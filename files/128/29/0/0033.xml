NationalService.(previous reference:CM. (55) 26thConclusions,Minute 10.)Whole-time service.1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Defence (CP. (55) 125) on the future of National Service,and a memorandum by the Minister of Labour (CP. (55) 130) onthe liability of agricultural workers to National Service.The Mini:,er of Defence said that his review of the future ofNational Service had been undertaken, not by reason of theimmediate economic difficulties which the Cabinet had recently had under discussion, but because of the excessive burden which existingdefence programmes would in the long term impose on the nation&apos;resources. Among other measures for relieving this burden he proposed that the total strength of the Forces should be reduced to700,000 by 31st March, 1958. In his memorandum he had reviewed the various methods by which this reduction could be achieved.Effectively, however, the choice lay between two methods: (i) main-taining the period of service at 24 months, but reducing the intakeby allowing the age of call-up to rise; or (ii) reducing the periodof service to 21 months and making a smaller reduction in the intakeby allowing the age of call-up to rise. On military grounds, the first of these two courses was to be preferred. If the period of service were reduced, the efficiency of the Forces would be impaired; and,if the Forces were to be smaller in size, it was the more important that their efficiency should not be reduced. If, however, it were thought that there were strong political advantages in following thesecond course, the military consequences, though substantial, wouldnot be disastrous.The Secretary of State for War said that any substantial reductionof the existing period of National Service would impair the efficiency of the Forces. A quicker turnover of the National Service element in front-line units would lower their standards of efficiency: asubstantial part of the useful service of National Service men wouldbe lost, and the effect of this would be felt especially with officers,N.COs. and skilled tradesmen: the incentive to volunteer for regular engagements of three years or more in lieu of National service would be reduced: the strain on the training cadres would beincreased, and the morale of the Regular Army would suffer. all this would make it more difficult to achieve the objective, which theServices had in view, of increasing the regular content of the Forces.These considerations became all the more important if the adjustmentwere viewed as the first step in a progressive movement towardsthe abolition of National Service. For it was important that theGovernment should not become committed to a policy ofdiscontinuing National Service by progressive reduction of the periodof service. This might have been feasible if the function of NationalService were still, as originally envisaged, to provide trained reservesfor a future war; but its primary function now was to provide men for active service in peace, and this could not be secured if the periodof service fell much below 24 months. A reduction of three months in the period of service would not satisfy critics in other Parties, wholooked for a much larger reduction, and it would be criticised bysome Government supporters as likely to impair the efficiency of theForces.The First Lord of the Admiralty and The Secretary of Statefor Air supported the views expressed by the Secretary of State forWar.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff agreed that the efficiency of the Forces would be impaired if the existing period of NationalService were reduced. The reduction in numbers proposed by theMinister of Defence should not in itself make it impossible for theForces to carry out the commitments which they were likely to becalled upon to discharge after 1958; but Forces of that size would
not be equal to those commitments unless their efficiency was maintained. He had himself had personal experience, as commander-in-Chief, Far East, of the effect on efficiency when theperiod of service was raised from 18 to 24 months in 1950, and hewas confident that the subsequent achievements of British troops in korea, Malaya and Kenya would not have been possible with a shorter period of service.The First Sea Lord said that he fully supported the view expressed by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet that the desired reduction in the strength of the forces should be secured, without any reduction in the period of service,by allowing the age of call-up to rise. Ministers accepted the contention that, unless there was some substantial change in our overseas commitments, the efficiency of the Forces would suffer ifthe period of National Service were reduced below twenty-four months. They were also influenced by the consideration that, if the size of the Forces was to be reduced, it was the more important thattheir efficiency should be maintained. They considered that thepolitical advantages of reducing the period of service to twenty-onemonths were not sufficient to outweigh the loss of efficiency whichthis reduction would involve. Indeed, if the period were reducedat this stage to twenty-one months, the political pressures to reduceit still further might be difficult to resist. It would be easier for theGovernment to take their stand on the efficiency argument if theperiod of service were maintained at twenty-four months.In the course of the discussion the following particular points were made:  (a) There would be advantages in allowing the age of call-up torise; for, if they were not called up until a later age, young men were more likely to settle down, before National Service, in employment to which they could return thereafter. Some firms already tookspecial steps to encourage young men to return to their employmentafter: completing their National Service, and further efforts mightwell be made to extend this practice more widely throughout industry.The Minister of Education said that he would like to discuss this aspect of the matter with the Minister of Labour; for theGovernment would have to meet the criticism that, by raising theage of call-up, they were increasing the gap, between school-leaving age and National Service, which was now regarded as a fertileground for juvenile delinquency.(h) If the age of call-up were raised, it was important thatcandidates for University education should be able to do their national Service immediately after leaving school. The Ministerof Labour confirmed that there would be no difficulty in arranging for this.(c) If a period of twenty-four months&apos; National Service was tobe justified on the ground that it was essential for the efficiency ofthe Forces, the Services must put themselves in a position to replyeffectively to complaints that National Servicemen were not alwayskept fully occupied on worthwhile tasks.(d) Was it clear that, with the reduced numbers now proposed,the Services would be able to meet their commitments in full?Further consideration would certainly be needed before the strengthof the Forces was reduced to a point at which we should be unableto carry out all the obligations which we had undertaken in agreementwith the United States and other Allies. Any modification of thoseobligations would need to be negotiated with our Allies.The Prime Minister said that he hoped there need be no suggestion at this stage of inability to carry out those obligations.The international skies, though they might seem fairer at the moment,might well darken again; and this was an additional reason for
adopting a flexible method of reducing Service strengths so that, if it became necessary, the process could be reversed without a majorupheaval.(e) This method of reducing the size of the Forces should be presented as the first step in a policy of progressively reducing theburden of National Service.In this connection it was to be remembered that the principle which had originally been accepted, by all political Parties, was thatyoung men should undergo military training in peace as a citizenduty. Over the years, however, National Service had come to fulfila wholly different function, viz., that of supplementing regular forces which were inadequate to discharge all the commitments which theywere required to meet in peace. Politically, this was quite a differentproposition; and Ministers would ultimately have to consider forhow long National Service could be justified for that purpose. this involved the further question how far, under conditions of full employment, the regular Forces could be maintained at the strengthrequired to meet present-day commitments.(/) In paragraph 21 of CP. (55) 125 it was stated that substantial improvements were already needed in the pay and conditions ofservice of the regular Forces.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that no proposals for thispurpose had yet been submitted to the Treasury; and while he agreedthat some improvements were due, he did not consider that these could be brought into force before the spring of 1956. He hopedthat Service Ministers would take all practicable steps to prevent any premature foreshadowing of increases in Service pay.The Minister of Defence said that, while he recognised that pay increases could not come into effect for some months to come, he still hoped that the announcement of changes in the system ofNational Service might include some promise of future improvements in the pay and conditions of the Regular Forces.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposal in CP. (55) 125 that the strengthof the Armed Forces should be reduced to 700,000 by31st March, 1958.(2) Agreed that, in order to secure this reduction in the size ofthe Forces, the intake of National Servicemen should bereduced by allowing the age of call-up to rise, the periodof National Service being maintained at twenty-four months.(3) Agreed that this decision should be announced beforeParliament reassembled; and invited the Minister ofDefence to prepare a draft announcement for the PrimeMinisters consideration.Part-time The Cabinet then discussed the proposals in paragraphs 17-20Service. of CP. (55) 125 for adjusting the existing arrangements for part-time service by National Servicemen.The Minister of Defence said that, as it was no longer the function of National Service to create a large pool of trained reservesfor use in war, it would be logical that the obligations of part-time service should now be substantially reduced. Account must,however, be taken of the future role of the reserve Army, the structure and morale of the Territorial Army and the existing obligation tocontribute two divisions from the reserve Army to the forces of theNorth Atlantic Alliance in the event of war in Europe.  With these
&quot;&quot;&quot;7 IAgriculture. The Cabinet then discussed the application of the NationalService Act to agricultural workers.The Minister of Labour explained that applications for defer -ment of call-up of agricultural workers were at present entertainedonly from stockmen or men employed on small farms, and the applications were only granted if the holding was making a significant contribution to food production and it was impracticable to makealternative arrangements and there was no prospect of obtaining areplacement within a reasonable period. The National Farmers&apos;Unions had strongly urged that special steps should be taken toprevent further loss of manpower from the industry, and the agriculture Ministers were convinced that some further concessionwas necessary. He therefore proposed that any full-time worker inagriculture should be eligible for consideration for deferment on thesame tests as at present applied to men employed on small farms.This would include those men who were due to be called up at theend of the current harvest and up to now had been ineligible forconsideration. The effect of this concession would be that only,500 agricultural workers, instead of 6,000 as at present, would becalled up each year out of each age: class of approximately 15,000.Many agricultural workers whose call-up had been deferred since1952 were uncertain about their position and thought they were likely to be called up because they were approaching the upper age-limit of liability. The Minister therefore proposed to announce that,if the conditions justifying their deferment still existed when they reached their twenty-sixth birthday, agricultural workers who hadbeen deferred would continue to be deferred even though this meant that they would pass out of liability.The Minister of Agriculture said that, although he would have preferred that all agricultural workers should be deferred, he appreciated the importance of maintaining as far as possible theprinciple of universality of National Service and; welcomed the concessions proposed by the Minister of Labour. There had been asubstantial continuing decline in the manpower engaged inagriculture, mainly because about half of the workers failed to returnto the industry after completing their National Service.considerations in mind he suggested that the obligation to part-time service should be reduced to the following: (i) for men in theTerritorial Army, about 24 drills within 12 months, of dischargeand one period of 15 days&apos; camp; (ii) for men in the ArmyEmergency Reserve, as much training as was administrativelypracticable within the limits proposed in (i); and (iii) for men inMobile Defence Battalions, two periods of 15; days&apos; camp. If theseproposals were adopted, the obligations of reservists in the royal navy and the Royal Air Force could be similarly reduced.In discussion it was pointed out that part-time service was now required mainly for the Mobile Defence Corps, which was essentialto the development of an efficient system of Civil Defence. In equity,however, other reservists would have to be required to give part-time service roughly comparable to that required of reservists in the mobile Defence Corps.The Cabinet (4) Agreed in principle that the obligations to part-time service under the National Service Act should be reduced to thefullest extent consistent with the efficiency of the MobileDefence Corps.(5) Invited the Defence Committee to work out the detailed application of the principle set out in Conclusion (4)above.
The Lord President said that, while he appreciated the difficultiesof agriculture and would not oppose the concessions now proposed,deferment of the call-up of some scientific workers was even moreimportant to the national economy. At present only a small numberof qualified scientists and technicians, such as graduates for theGovernment Scientific Service and technicians in certain defenceindustries, were eligible for deferment. This position might have tobe reconsidered.Discussion showed that the Cabinet agreed in principle with theproposals in paragraph 11 of CP. (55) 130. It was, however, thoughtthat these concessions should not be announced until after the state-ment of the Governmenfs general policy on National Service hadbeen made.The Cabinet (6) Approved the proposals put forward in paragraph 11 of CP.(55) 130.(7) Agreed that this extension of the system of deferment foragricultural workers should not be announced until afterthe statement of the Governmenfs general policy on national Service had been made.2. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the arguments forand against recalling Parliament in the following week in order that immediate effect could be given to the measures which it was desiredto take to remedy the current economic situation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the choice before theCabinet was clear. On the one hand, if Parliament were recalled, theGovernment would be able to retain the initiative. The situation wasmade even more difficult by the conjunction of the date of publicationof the September gold and dollar losses, the announcement of our inability to go to 90 per cent, liberalisation in Europe, the forth-coming Conservative Party Conference and the speech which he was committed to make at the Mansion House. The recall of parliament would be interpreted by foreign opinion as a logical sequel to thedeclaration which he had made at Istanbul and had the merits of leaving the position at risk for the shortest possible time, of drawingthe sting out of the September gold and dollar figures and ofproviding a realistic basis for the speeches which would have to bemade at the Mansion House and at the Party Conference.On the other hand, there was the risk that the recall ofParliament would precipitate an atmosphere of crisis that would notbe helpful. Moreover, it now appeared that the loss to the reservesfor September would be less than had been expected. But bydelaying recall the initiative would be lost and the Government mightbe forced into the position of appearing to act under force majeure.Moreover, the period of risk would be prolonged: at best thesituation might be expected to get worse in October: at worst there might be such a marked deterioration that the programme of measures he proposed might, when the time came, be found to be insufficient. If the Cabinet decided against the immediate recall ofParliament, he felt that, in order to prepare the way for the Party-Conference and his Mansion House speech, there should be a public statement to the effect that the measures which were in preparation for strengthening the internal economy would be announced inParliament and that, because of the pressure of other business,Parliament would be recalled for this purpose a week earlier than had hitherto been planned. This statement should be made before thepublication of the September figures.
3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. (55) 83)proposing that legislation should be introduced to amend in certain respects the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1949,and a memorandum by the Attorney-General (CP. (55) 119)commenting on these proposals.The Home Secretary said that no major amendment of theexisting legislation was required. Experience had, however, shownthat under the existing provisions of the Act general reviews of constituencies had to be held at too frequent intervals and the boundary Commissions were obliged to apply too rigidly the principleof achieving numerical equality between constituencies. It was proposed to amend the Act in these respects. He thought that the changes proposed would command general support, and he felt thatthe doubts expressed by the Attorney-General on certain points couldbe resolved in consultation between them. After the cabinet&apos;s previous discussion, the Secretary of State for Scotland and he had come to the conclusion that there would be advantage in legislatingnow upon these matters in an atmosphere undisturbed by the prospectof an early General Election. If the Cabinet approved the proposals in CP. (55) 83, he would inform the Speaker and would open discussions with Leaders of the Opposition Parties.House ofCommons.redistribution of Seats.(previous reference:C.C. (55) 19thConclusions,Minute 7.)The Prime Minister said that in considering these alternatives theCabinet should give full weight to the effect which the recall ofParliament was likely to have on public opinion at home and abroad.Nothing had happened to prepare the public at home for such a step.Foreign opinion might find in it grounds for inferring that we were on the point of collapse.In discussion it was argued that, in spite of these dangers, itmight be unwise to run the risk to our reserves of allowingspeculators the opportunity which would be provided by three weeks&apos;delay in recalling Parliament. Moreover, it would be sound policy to create a situation in which the discussion of economic issues at both Party Conferences could take place on a realistic basis.The balance of opinion in the Cabinet was, however, against theimmediate recall of Parliament. If it were found in the early part ofOctober that immediate action was needed to protect the reserves itwould still be possible to advance still further the date of meeting ofParliament. In spite of the current drain, the reserves were still someway from reaching dangerously low levels. There was no likelihood of immediate catastrophe, Indeed, the sudden recall of Parliament,if misinterpreted abroad, might be more likely to increase the risk ofa serious withdrawal of funds. It was true that early action wouldenable the Government to take advantage of the current favourablemovement of the exchanges. But the creation of an atmosphere ofcrisis by the precipitate recall of Parliament would shake public confidence in the Government to an extent which would hamper the mover the longer term in applying a programme of measures whichwould require time to take full effect.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that, in order to deal with the economic situation,Parliament should re-assemble on 17th or 18th October.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider the formand timing of the announcement of the earlier meeting ofParliament, and to submit his recommendations on thismatter to the Prime Minister.
The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, subject to further consultation between theHome Secretary and the Attorney-General, legislation should be introduced in the current session to amend theHouse of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1949,as proposed in CP. (55) 83.(2) Authorised the Home Secretary to inform the Speaker of theGovernment^ intentions and to consult the Leaders of theOpposition Parties on the substance of the proposals.Imports ofUnited StatesFruit.(previous reference:CM. (55) 32ndConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the extent to whichimports of American fruit should be authorised during the currentseason.After the Cabinefs discussion on the previous day Ministers ofthe Departments concerned had made a further examination of the issues set out in the report by officials (CP. (55) 129) but they had been unable to agree on arrangements which the Colonial Secretary could accept as providing a sufficient safeguard for the interests of west indian producers of grapefruit. They reported that, as regardscanned grapefruit, the choice lay between buying million worth of american imports out of Aid funds before 30th November, orcontinuing to exclude such imports completely until the autumn of1956. They also invited the Cabinet to decide whether $1 million of aid funds should be spent on fresh grapefruit.The Colonial Secretary said that he was ready to agree that weshould take $1 million worth of fresh grapefruit from the UnitedStates, if it could be arranged that this would be imported during alimited period in order to avoid competition with the West Indies. he also wished to have the opportunity of explaining this decision to west indian Ministers before it was put into effect. He would, however,prefer that we should take no canned grapefruit from the UnitedStates this season. Our aim should be to provide time for acceptablearrangements for future seasons to be worked out between the west indian and American industries. It was possible that West IndianMinisters, realising the importance of reaching a satisfactory agreement with the American industry, would be prepared to agreethat some small quantity of American canned grapefruit should be imported into the United Kingdom this season. But if they did not\ take this attitude he considered that we should exclude Americancanned grapefruit in order to avoid prejudicing our position in theforthcoming negotiations with the West Indies over price assistance for their citrus fruit industry.The President of the Board of Trade said that $i million worth of American canned grapefruit, which we would obtain as a gift, wasa small quantity compared with the total amount of 14,000 tons whichwe had imported annually before the war, mainly from the UnitedStates. To exclude this token quantity would be giving the west indies complete protection against American competition; and, while some degree of protection for Colonial industries was justified,complete protection was not. The quantity proposed and the limited period for shipment were the same as in the arrangements which west indian Ministers had themselves agreed with the Florida producers.In discussion the following points were raised:  (a) We were now under a stronger obligation to safeguard theinterests of West Indian citrus producers than before the war since we had persuaded these Colonies to grow citrus in order to diversifytheir economy.(b) The limitation on the period for shipment would be a valuable safeguard for West Indian producers, and it was likely that
the American product would have been disposed of before the west indian season began.(c) A complete ban on American canned grapefruit wouldalienate United States opinion; and it was important that the goodwill of the United States Secretary of Agriculture should bemaintained in order to secure the orderly disposal of the substantialAmerican surpluses of other commodities.Further discussion showed that it was the general view of theCabinet that the Colonial Secretary should be given an opportunity of explaining to West Indian Ministers, when they arrived in london for the negotiations on price assistance for their citrus industry, why it was desirable not to exclude American canned grapefruitcompletely from the United Kingdom market. They could be told that their views would be taken into account before a final decision was reached.The Cabinet Invited the Colonial Secretary to inform West IndianMinisters that it was proposed to spend $1 million of Aidfunds on American fresh grapefruit, and, subject to theirviews, million on American canned grapefruit, providedthat shipment of the latter could be completed by30th November.East/west trade.(previous reference:C.C. (55) 5thConclusions,Minute 9.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Defence (CP. (55) 122) suggesting that the securitycontrols on trade with the Soviet bloc should be revised in the lightof the new strategic concept.The Minister of Defence said that recent military developmentshad revolutionised the basis of our strategic planning, and it no longerseemed necessary to seek to deny to countries in the Soviet bloc themeans of expanding their industrial manufacturing capacity andaccumulating raw materials. In view of the political difficulties andthe hindrance to world trade which resulted from security controls,it would now be justifiable to exclude from the list of controlled itemsanything which had hitherto been included solely because it would assist the general industrial development of the countries in the soviet bloc. The list should now be confined to equipment and material which would assist those countries in a military sense in preparation for, and during the initial phase of, a major war. The types of equipment and material which should still be controlled wereindicated in paragraph 7 of CP. (55) 122.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Defence to arrange for the ministers concerned to work out a detailed revision of the security,controls on East/West trade, with a view to proposing tothe United States and French Governments a change ofpolicy on the lines indicated in CP. (55) 122.Supply of arms to the middle east.French Aircraft.(previous reference:CM. (55) 30thConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Foreign Secretary said that it had proved impossible toprevent the delivery of French Mystere aircraft to Israel by inducingthe United States and French Governments to join with us inimposing a complete ban on the delivery of arms to Israel and Egyptduring the present period of frontier tension. Ministers must therefore consider again whether we should accord staging facilities in Cyprus for the delivery of these aircraft. There was no way of preventing their delivery because in the last resort they could be shipped. He was therefore inclined to the view that we should accordthe facilities requested in Cyprus because of our paramount interest
as an air power in maintaining the principle that transit facilities for aircraft were given without prejudice. It might, however, be possibleto delay for a time making any reply to the French request.The Minister of Defence supported the view that transitfacilities should be accorded. It would follow that similar facilities,if requested, would then be accorded to Western countries for the delivery of arms to the Arab States. There was, however, apossibility that Egypt might secure arms from Russia and it might be embarrassing if similar transit facilities were requested by a memberof the Soviet bloc.The Cabinet Agreed in principle that transit facilities in Cyprus shouldbe accorded for the delivery of French Mystere aircraft to Israel, subject to further consultation between the foreign secretary and the Minister of Defence on the widerimplications of this action.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,22nd September, 1955.
