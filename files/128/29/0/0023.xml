Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.On 20th July there would be a debate on Coal. This debate,though held at the instance of the Opposition, would take place ona Government motion to take note of the annual report of theNational Coal Board for 1954. It was agreed that the Minister of fuel and Power should speak first on the Governments behalf, andthat the reply to the debate should be made either by theLord Privy Seal or by the Home Secretary.The Cabinet were informed that Parliament would reassembleafter the summer recess on 25th October.Technological 2.   The Minister of Education said that, in a debate in the HouseEducation.      of Commons on 21st July on the shortage of scientific and technical(Previous        man-power, the Government would be pressed to explain whatReference:      practical steps they were taking to provide further facilities force.C.

TheConclusions,    provision made for this in the Education Estimates for the currentMinute 7.)       year would not go far to meet the increasing demand for technicalcourses, both at technical colleges and at secondary schools; and theGovernment statement, if limited to the current year, was unlikely tosatisfy opinion in Parliament or in the country. He therefore hopedthat he might have authority to refer instead to a five-year programmeof expansion.In discussion the point was made that the Governmenfsstatement in this debate need not be limited to the projects for whichthe Minister of Education was departmentally responsible. account should also be taken of the Governmenfs plans for expandingfacilities for higher technological education, through grantsadministered by the University Grants Committee. In thisconnection the Cabinet were informed that the Fine Arts commission were raising objections to the proposal that the Imperial Institutebuilding in South Kensington should be demolished in order tofacilitate the expansion of Imperial College, London. It was important that there should be no undue delay in carrying throughthe plans for expanding the facilities for higher technological education at Imperial College.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to settle, inconsultation with the Lord President and the Minister ofEducation, the terms of the statement to be made on the government&apos;s behalf, in the forthcoming debate on21st July, on the Governmenfs programme for expandingfacilities for technological education.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider, inconsultation with the other Ministers concerned, what steps could be taken to expedite work on the approvedproject for enlarging Imperial College, London.Remuneration 3.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the cabinet of Ministers.     Committee appointed to review the remuneration of Ministers had(Previous        come to the conclusion that some informal soundings would have to reference:      be taken among Members of Parliament before they were in a positionCM. (55) 19th  to submit firm recommendations to the Cabinet. He therefore soughtConclusions,    the Cabinet&apos;s authority to make informal soundings on this subject,Minute 1.)       both with Leaders of the Opposition Parties and among government supporters, before Parliament adjourned for the summer recess.   Ifthis were not done, the Cabinet Committee would have to suspendtheir consideration of this problem until the autumn.48545-2 B 2
The Cabinet Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrangefor informal soundings to be taken among Members ofParliament on the question of increased remuneration for ministers.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Transport (CP. (55) 73) seeking approval for the terms in whichhe proposed to announce the decision already taken by the Cabinetto bring road haulage disposals to an end.The Minister of Transport said that the announcement, whichhe proposed to make in Parliament on 20th July, had been draftedon the assumption that the present status of British Road services would remain unchanged. This was a point on which there werediffering views among Government supporters, but in his opinion there would be no real advantage, and some disadvantage, inconverting British Road Services into a nationalised corporation orinto a company. From the point of view of the legislation whichwould be necessary, the simplest course would be to maintain theexisting status of British Road Services.As regards determining the number of vehicles which BritishRoad Services would need to retain in order to operate their trunkservices, the Minister proposed to seek the advice of the DisposalBoard.In discussion, it was suggested that it might be preferable if theBritish Transport Commission^ road haulage trunk services were tobe integrated with the railways, since this might make rationalisation of railway services easier. It was, however, pointed out that, if british Road Services continued in being, there would be nothing toprevent the Commission from placing the executive responsibility forthe operation of the road haulage trunk services on the regional boards.Further discussion showed that it was the general view of theCabinet that it should be made clear that a decision to leave thestatus of British Road Services unaltered would not preclude thedevelopment of different arrangements in the light of futureexperience.It was also suggested that it might be wise not to proceed withthe proposal to offer a Parcels Company for sale in the autumn,since there was a risk that the shares in this Company might not betaken up. The Minister of Transport said that there was a reasonably good chance of selling the Parcels Company successfully, particularly since a few months would elapse before the offer was made, duringwhich the Company would be in operation.The Cabinet then considered the draft statement attached to cp. (55) 73.  Various amendments were suggested and approved.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that there should not be any change in the presentstatus of British Road Services.(2) Agreed that the decision to bring road haulage disposals to anend should be announced by the Minister of transport in Parliament on 20th July, in the terms proposed in cp. (55) 73 as amended in their discussion.5. The Prime Minister said that he and the Foreign secretary had discussed with some of their senior colleagues the general line which they should take, on behalf of the United KingdomGovernment, at the forthcoming meeting of Heads of Governmentsat Geneva. They had also consulted the Chiefs of Staff on the military aspects of problems which would be under discussion at the meeting.Road HaulageDisposals,(previous reference:CM.

The Western Powers were in a stronger position than they hadbeen in the past and should be able to resist effectively any pressure from the Russians.  They must, however, take account of the strong desire of the German people to move towards the reunification ofGermany.   If German reunification was not secured on termsacceptable to the West, there was a real danger that the Russiansmight subsequently tempt the Germans by offering it on termsunpalatable to us. Thus, we had everything to gain by pressing now for an agreement on some move towards German reunification.  Inthis, time was not on our side.   It was not impossible that theRussians might be persuaded to move in this direction. At the BerlinConference they had seemed to be adamant in their opposition tothe conclusion of an Austrian Treaty. But within a few months theyhad themselves taken the initiative in seeking a settlement on Austria,because they thought this to their advantage.  We might be able toput forward proposals on Germany which they could not afford to reject.   For this purpose the so-called Eden Plan would not alonesuffice.  We should have to show, in addition, that safeguards couldbe devised to ensure that a united and independent Germany need not represent an increased military threat to Russia.   These safeguardsmight have to include some limitation on the strength and location of forces in Germany and in countries neighbouring Germany, andpossibly some arrangement for the demilitarisation of a part ofGermany, so as to separate the Forces of the East and the West.These provisions might be accompanied by some sort of security pactwhich would not involve guarantees of frontiers.   Though therewere as yet no signs of any new flexibility in the Russian attitude, itwas not impossible that they might be brought to discuss arrangements on those lines.The Foreign Secretary said that it might well prove impossibleto make much progress with these proposals in the initial discussions at the Meeting of Heads of Governments. It was, however, important that we should have put forward at that Meeting proposals whichwould be regarded by world opinion as fair and reasonable. If itwere known that reasonable proposals had been put forward and rejected by the Russians, the strength and influence of the western powers would be increased. After the Geneva Meeting the russians were likely to make some tempting offer to Dr. Adenauer during his visit to Moscow in the autumn. But, if Dr. Adenauer was firm in resisting those overtures, the Russians might be more willing toconsider our proposals at the next stage, viz., the meeting of foreign ministers which was likely to be convened to follow up the discussions at Geneva. We should be in a better position to press our proposals on that occasion if we had taken a firm stand on them at the GenevaMeeting.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of the line which the Prime Ministerand  the Foreign  Secretary proposed to  take  at theforthcoming Meeting of Heads of Governments at Geneva.Cyprus.(previous reference:CM. (55) 22ndConclusions,Minute 5.)6. The Cabinet discussed the arrangements for the forthcoming conference with representatives of the Greek and turkish governments on political and defence questions affecting the eastern mediterranean, including Cyprus.The Greek Government had been given to understand that this conference would be held in August and they would deprecate anypostponement, since they would wish to preserve the possibility of raising the question of Cyprus at the United Nations Assembly inSeptember. On the other hand, the Colonial Secretary was due to visit Colonial territories in the Far East and would not return from48545-2 b 3
this tour until 4th September. In these circumstances the cabinet agreed that the best course would be to suggest that the conference should open on 29th August.The Foreign Secretary could open the proceedings by putting forward the views of the United Kingdom Government on politicaland defence questions affecting the Eastern Mediterranean generally.In this statement, though he would deal with the strategic importanceof Cyprus, he would not discuss the future constitutional developmentof the Island. On that question the Greek and Turkish governments would be given an opportunity to present their views before any proposals were put forward on behalf of the United KingdomGovernment. It should therefore be possible so to arrange thebusiness of the conference that the stage of detailed discussion on constitutional plans was not reached until after the Colonial secretary had returned to London.The Cabinet had yet to decide what constitutional proposals should be put forward on behalf of the United Kingdom government at this conference. Two alternative plans had been outlined in thememorandum (CP. (55) 33) circulated to the Cabinet by the foreign secretary and the Colonial Secretary in June. It was important thatthese should be further discussed before the end of July.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to propose to the Greek and turkish Governments that the conference on political and defence questions affecting the Eastern Mediterraneanshould open in London on 29th August.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary and Colonial Secretary tosubmit, for consideration by the Cabinet in the week beginning 25th July, a revised statement of the proposals to be put forward at the conference on behalf of the UnitedKingdom Government regarding future constitutional development in Cyprus.(3) Invited the Minister of Defence to circulate to the Cabinetthe views of the Chiefs of Staff on the strategic considerations to be taken into account in relation to future constitutional development in Cyprus.housing subsidies.(previous reference:CM. (55) 21stConclusions,Minute 7.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Housing and Local Government (CP. (55) 67) on the future levelof housing subsidies.The Minister of Housing said that it would become clear in theautumn that there had been a substantial fall in the rate of housebuilding by local authorities. Local authorities&apos; building programmes for 1956 would have to be decided in October, and the government&apos;s policy would have to be disclosed to Parliament soon after the endof the summer recess. He hoped that it would be possible to concentrate the housing subsidies in future on particular objectives,such as slum clearance and the relief of housing congestion in urban areas. He was working out detailed proposals on these lines whichshould reduce the cost to the Exchequer by about 40 per cent. Thisconcentration of the subsidy on particular types of new houses shouldmake it possible to maintain a high rate of construction in districts where there was still an acute shortage of accommodation. The lossof subsidy, if spread over the whole area of a local authority, shouldmean only a small increase in council house rents. Even if a localauthority did not benefit from the continued subsidy on special types of new houses, the rents of existing houses would not be likely to go up by more than Is. per week in the first year, with a further similarincrease thereafter.In order to prepare the public for such a change of policy, andin order to pave the way for discussions with local authority
tariff policy.Japan andthe G.A.T.T.(previous reference:CM. (55) 19thConclusions,Minute 11.)8. The Cabinet again considered whether the United kingdom should record a vote in favour of admitting Japan to the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.).The Cabinet were informed that it was still not clear whetherJapan would secure admission if the United Kingdom did not vote in her favour. It was open to us to record our vote at any time up to11th August, and it might be that before then Japan would have obtained sufficient votes to secure her admission. If that happened,would it still be open to the United Kingdom to record a vote in favourof Japan? If so, Ministers would need to consider whether we should do so, in order to obtain a measure of goodwill in Japan, or whether we should abstain, in order to avoid exacerbating public opinion inthis country.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in favour of postponinga decision on this question for a further period.The Cabinet (1) Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at their next meeting.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to report whetherit would be open to the United Kingdom to record a vote in favour of Japan, at any time up to 11th August, eventhough she had already obtained sufficient votes to secureadmission.Palestine. 9.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Foreign(Previous Secretary (CP. (55) 75) reporting that the United States SecretaryReference: of State was anxious to make a public statement outlining the planCM. (55) 15th (CP. (55) 35) which had been worked out by the Governments of conclusions, the United Kingdom and the United States for the settlement of the minute 6.) dispute between the Arab States and Israel.associations, the Minister wished to announce, in reply to questions in Parliament, that the Government did not intend to increase thehousing subsidy; that the rates and purposes of the housing subsidieswere being examined, with a view to considering whether any changes were desirable; and that he intended to have discussions with localauthority associations with a view to making a further statement afterthe recess.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat for the time being it would be preferable to avoid arousingexpectations of a change of policy on housing subsidies. There wasno immediate urgency to begin the discussions with local authority associations, and the Cabinet should have an opportunity to considerthe proposed change of policy before those discussions were opened.The Minister could make it plain that there was no intention toincrease the housing subsidy in consequence of the increase in therate of interest on Public Works Loans; but he should avoid giving any indication at this stage that the Government were about to undertake a general review of the level of housing subsidies.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government, if itwere necessary to reply to Questions about the housing subsidies, to avoid giving any indication that theGovernment were considering a change of policy.(2) Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government tosubmit for their consideration early in September detailed proposals for reducing the housing subsidies.
The Foreign Secretary said that Mr. Dulles felt that he wouldhave to make this announcement (the essential passages of whichwere attached to CP. (55) 75) on about 18th August, in order toprevent the Palestine question becoming an issue in the forthcomingelection campaign in the United States. It did not seem likely thathe could be dissuaded from making some announcement of thiskind; and it was arguable that it would be better for the plan to be disclosed if there were a real danger that Mr. Dulles might otherwise be led, under pressure of the election campaign, to make proposalswhich would be more favourable to Israel and consequently evenmore objectionable to the Arab States. Nevertheless, there was a real danger that the announcement might provoke serious trouble in theMiddle East, including rioting by Arab refugees or incidents involvingBritish property and persons. It might also endanger the progressso far made over the Northern Tier defence and the Treaty with Iraq.If, therefore, Mr. Dulles were resolved to make an announcement on the lines proposed, we should do our utmost to secure, in return,American help on certain aspects of our Middle East policies,i.e., (i) an assurance of United States readiness to join the Turco-IraqiPact in the event of a settlement of the dispute between the arab states and Israel; (ii) an undertaking by the United States to supplyIraq with British Centurion tanks by off-shore purchase; and (iii) an assurance that the.United States would be ready to give us physicalsupport if we were involved in fighting as a result, direct or indirect,of the proposed announcement.In discussion the following points were raised:  (a) If Mr. Dulles made this announcement, it would be difficult for us to dissociate ourselves from the plan, which we had worked outjointly with the United States. On the other hand, we could resonably object to the proposal to make it public before the details,including such matters as the adjustment of frontiers, had been worked out in negotiation with the other parties concerned.(b) The plan had important financial implications, which shouldbe considered in detail before we were publicly committed tosupport it.(c) It was not impossible that we could reach agreement with theUnited States on some kind of a joint public statement about the plan.But if we were to share the responsibility for such a statement, more time was necessary to study it. &quot;Mr. Dulles could be informed that weneeded more time to consider a statement of this importance.(d) In seeking more time for consideration, the foreign secretary might indicate that it was his personal opinion that theUnited Kingdom would need assurances from the United States onthe points mentioned in paragraph 7 of CP. (55) 75.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform the United states secretary of State that the United Kingdom Governmentneeded more time to consider his proposal to make apublic disclosure of the plan for a settlement of thePalestine question; and to indicate, as his personal opinion, the modifications which might be necessary, andthe assurances which might be required, if the UnitedKingdom Government were to share responsibility for anysuch announcement.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform them of the resultsof his discussions with the United States Secretary ofState, and to arrange for the other Ministers concerned to give immediate consideration to the form of a possiblejoint statement on this plan on behalf of the Governmentof the United States and the United Kingdom.
v 9 CM. 23 (55)Japanese War 10.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCriminals.       Foreign Secretary (CP. (55) 74) proposing the exercise of clemencytowards Japanese war criminals still in British custody.The Foreign Secretary said that he recommended that the UnitedKingdom should fall in with the proposal made by the United StatesGovernment that the major Japanese war criminals, for whom theInternational Military Tribunal for the Far East was responsible,should be released after completing ten years&apos; imprisonment. Hewould prefer that these prisoners should be released outright but, ifthe other Powers insisted that they should be released on parole, hewould be ready to concur.The question of exercising similar clemency in favour of minorJapanese war criminals, over whom the United Kingdom Governmenthad jurisdiction, was in a sense more difficult. There were eighty-oneof these still in our custody, and the last of them would not be due for release until 1960. It would benefit Anglo-Japanese relations, andwould bring our policy into line with the more lenient attitude adoptedby other Powers, if we now reduced sentences of more than fifteen years to fifteen years. This would mean that, with one-third remissionfor good conduct, all these criminals would be released after servingten years.Discussion showed that opinion in the Cabinet was divided onthis question. It was suggested that, if a more lenient policy was tobe followed, it might be better to put it into effect gradually andunobtrusively. If the prisoners still in custody were all releasedat once, public feeling was more likely to be aroused. Many of thesemen had been personally responsible for barbarous treatment ofBritish prisoners of war.The Cabinet Agreed to resume consideration of this question at a later meeting.Uganda. 11.   The Colonial Secretary said that there were only two(Previous        outstanding points on which agreement had not yet been reached in reference:      the negotiations for a settlement of the constitutional problem inC.C. (55) 26th   Uganda.    These   were   the   method   of   election   of   BugandaConclusions,    representative members on the Protectorate Legislative Council, and minute 3.)       the date of the Kabaka&apos;s return to the Buganda Province. Originally,\    it had been stated that the Kabaka would not be allowed to returnuntil nine months after the new Constitution had come into operation.The Province had, however, remained tranquil; and the Bugandawere co-operating fully in the process of bringing the new Constitutioninto effect. He was therefore disposed to think that this period could now be reduced.  He proposed that the Kabaka should be allowedto return not later than two months, or even six weeks, after the newConstitution had come into operation and the Buganda representativemembers had been elected.  He hoped that it would be possible toreach agreement on the outstanding points, so that he could make anannouncement to Parliament towards the end of the following week.The Cabinet Took note with approval of this statement by the colonial secretary.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,14th July, 1955.
