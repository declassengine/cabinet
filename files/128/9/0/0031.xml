Goal.Imports fromthe UnitedStates.(previous reference:CM. (47) 27thConclusions,Minute 5.)The Cabinet considered a telegram from the Foreign Secretary(Moscow telegram No. 221 of 20th March) stating that any attemptto secure from the European Coal Organisation a special allocation of coal for the United Kingdom would embarrass him in his negotia-tions at Moscow.The Prime Minister said that at a meeting on 20th March(F.C. (47) 14th Meeting, Minute 1) the Fuel Committee had asked the Minister of Fuel and Power to take up urgently with the UnitedStates Ambassador, and thereafter with the European CoalOrganisation, the question of importing coal from the United Statesduring the summer; and had agreed that, in his speech on the adjournment in the House of Commons that evening, the minister should state that the Government were not opposed to the import of coal from the United States or South Africa if it was procurable.On receipt of the Foreign Seeretary&apos;s telegram, however, he had felt bound toask the Minister to avoid making any definite State-men t I- r,nfiwith regard to coal imports from the United States.The Foreign Secretary seemed to have misunderstood what was proposed, since there had been no intention to make an agreementwith the United States Government without the knowledge of theEuropean Governments . represented on the European CoalOrganisation. Again, the Foreign Secretary had not realised that, even after allowance was made for all possible savingsby the coal/oil conversion programme and by the curtail-ment of coal supplies, for passenger transport, bunkers and non-industrial consumption, the coal available for industry would be8-8 million tons short of requirements for the six summer monthsalOne. And, in his estimate that the deficiency could be made upby the production of an additional hundredweight of coal per day by each miner, the Foreign Secretary had overlooked the fact that only about one-third of the miners were face workers. It wassuggested.that we should weaken our position in the Moscow negotia-tions if we sought to obtain coal from the United States, but our influence in international affairs would be much more seriouslyweakened if, through failure to take every possible step to obtainadditional supplies of coal, we were faced with widespread interruption-tioh of industrial production.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that his officials had estimated that at most we might be able to obtain a million tonsof coal from the United States and that 600,000 tons was a more likely estimate of what we should get. Fie had a good deal of sympathy with the view of the Foreign Secretary that it would notbe worth alienating France and other European countries repre-sented on the European Coal Organisation for so small a contri-bution to our needs. He still believed that the right course was to concentrate on increasing output in this country. The spirit ofthe miners had greatly improved since the coalmining industry hadbeen nationalised, and both output and recruitment had alreadyexceeded estimates. If he could be enabled to devote more time to securing an increased output of coal by being relieved of some of hisother duties, and if he could be given a free hand to do all that was required to secure increased production, he believed that he could achieve much more by these means than by such expedients asimporting coal from the United States or restricting domestic consumption.The President of the Board of Trade said that the effect of the fuel shortage on industrial production was much graver than theunemployment figures would suggest. Thus, output in the cottonindustry had fallen by two-thirds, and in the Midlands manyfactories were working only three days a week. Unless the Govern-nient showed that they were doing everything possible to obtainincreased supplies of coal, the morale of-industry might collapse.In further discussion the following points were made :. (a) During the six months from 1st May to 31st Octoberindustry would require 26-4 million tons of coal and, even after
other demands had been cut to a minimum, there would be a deficit of 8-8 million tons. This could not be spread equally over all industries and, unless additional supplies could be obtained, some ofthe less essential industries would virtually have to close down.(5) The Minister of Fuel and Power was meeting the Ministerof Industries and Commerce of Eire later in the day and hopedthat it would be possible, in return for a slight increase in coal exports to Eire, to obtain his co-operation in the recruitment of moreIrish labour for the coalmining industry in the United Kingdom.(c) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs had arranged to see the South African Minister of Mines and Economic Develop-ment with a view to pressing him to make available as much coalas possible from South Africa for bunkers; the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies was exploring the possibility of obtaining suppliesof coal from Nigeria and Borneo.(d) Allocations of coal for the second quarter of 1947 hadalready been made by the European Coal Organisation and, evenif the United States Government were willing to export more coalthan was needed to cover these allocations, it was doubtful whetherthe United Kingdom could qualify for any allocation from theEuropean Coal Organisation, since, on the basis of calculation used by the Organisation, our current output was sufficient to meetThe Prime Minister said that it was clearly desirable that every effort should be made to secure increased output of coal. But,in view of the critical situation this summer, we could not afford to reject any contribution, however small, towards increasing ourcoal supplies. He therefore felt that the Minister of Fuel and power should, as agreed by the Fuel Committee, approach the United states ambassador forthwith and discuss with him how far the UnitedStates would be able to make additional supplies of coal available and, if they could do this, how the question of obtaining the wholeor a share of these additional supplies for the United kingdom might best be handled with the European Coal Organisation.The Cabinet-/I \   Tnirs f G.A   fV.fi  TVT-inief TTn/il   a r\ r\   Wrwurar  i-r\  a rvoniro  f r\  co^y - y        *  1 1 T J.
