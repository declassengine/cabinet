1. The Minister of Labour gave the Cabinet the latest information about the dockers&apos; strikes in Glasgow and London.The Glasgow strike had been called by a Scottish Union whichwas not affiliated to the Transport and General Workers Union;and the London stevedores and lightermen who had suspended workin support of the Glasgow dockers had been influenced by a desireto embarrass the latter Union. These strikes were symptomaticof a growing tendency to ignore the advice of responsible union leaders.The Cabinet were informed that, if the London strike continued for more than a week, it would be necessary to employ emergency measures to maintain the distribution of essential food-stuffs.In further discussion it was suggested that unofficial strikeswere being encouraged by delays in the operation of the constitu-tional machinery for negotiating wages claims and by the failureof Union leaders to keep their members informed of the progressof these negotiations. Would it not be possible for the Ministryof Labour to keep in touch with all such negotiations from the outset, so that they might take an initiative when undue delayseemed likely to provoke trouble in the industry ? What progress had been made, since the Cabinet last considered this question on16th January, in discussing with industry means of improving the negotiating machinery with a view to avoiding such delays?The Minister of Labour said that he had. discussed this questioninformally with the General Council of the Trades Union congress and had asked for their suggestions on means of avoiding delays.On receipt of their suggestions, and in the light of the cabinets discussion, he would take the matter further with the National joint advisory Council.The Lord President suggested that the Cabinet might considerthe expediency of an approach to the leaders of the Trades UnionCongress about the economic consequences, not only of unofficial strikes, but also of demands for increased pay or shorter hours inoccupations where such Changes could not be offset by increased output.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statements recorded above regarding the dockers&apos; strikes in Glasgow and London;(2) Invited the Minister of Labour to continue his discussions about the possibility of improving the negotiating machinery in industry with a view to checking thegrowth of unofficial strikes.2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofState (CP. (47) 140) on the question whether His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should commit themselves in advance to accept the recom-mendations of the United Nations Assembly concerning the future government of Palestine.The Minister of State said that there had already been adversecomment in the United States on our apparent reluctance: so to commit ourselves, and the point was likely to be pressed at theSpecial Assembly. In the circumstances described in his memoran-dum he had considered that our representative at the SpecialAssembly should be authorised to say, if strongly pressed, that therecommendations of the General Assembly, if carried by a two-thirds majority, would be adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Government, but thatthey must reserve their position with regard to themselves enforcingany such policy. The Foreign Secretary had now, however,expressed the view (Berlin telegram No. 679 of 28th April) thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government should^not commit themselves even tothis extent in advance of the Ueneral Assembly^ meeting inSeptember.-3] b 2
NationalServiceBill.(previous reference:V..1VX.     j o\jhtxConclusions,Minute 4.)3. At their meeting on 24th April the Cabinet had agreed to resume discussion of the points raised in CP. (47) 133 after theyhad been considered by the Defence Committee. -The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that the DefenceCommittee had agreed to recommend to the Cabinet that the periodof reserve training under the National Service Bill should not exceed60 days in all and 21 days in any one year. The Defence Committeehad also agreed that this should include time spent in travelling and that the periods of training should, so far as possible, be adjusted so as to avoid broken weeks. The Minister of Labour hadbeen asked to consider whether any amendment of the Bill wasnecessary in order to safeguard the right of national service mento take periods of training outside any holiday periods to whichthey were entitled. It was also recommended that a pledge shouldbe given that no man called up before 1st January, 1949, wouldbe retained with the colours after the first men. called up under theprovisions of the Bill had been released. Detailed release time-tables to give effect to this undertaking should be left to be worked out when a clearer view could be obtained of the commitments ofthe Forces in 1949 and 1950.in a preliminary discussion cuiiering views were expressed onthis question. In favour of an undertaking to accept the recom-mendations . of the General Assembly, it was argued that oursubmission of the Palestine question to the United Nationsnecessarily implied willingness to accept the Assembly&apos;s recom-mendations. This could be inferred from the Foreign Secretary^statement in the House of Commons on 18th February, 1947, andit had been implied in statements made at the time to representativesof the Arabs and the Jews. His Majesty&apos;s Government could hardlyhave referred the matter to. the United Nations on the basis of treating the Assembly&apos;s recommendations as advisory and reserving the final decision to themselves. This did not mean, however, thatwe were committed in advance to assuming responsibility forenforcing the Assembly&apos;s recommendations; and the question of acceptance was in any event of secondary importance comparedwith that of implementation. The Assembly should be made awarefrom the outset that we reserved our position on this issue; forthat knowledge might induce a greater sense of responsibility in reaching final conclusions.On the other hand, it was argued that it was unreasonable thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government alone should be asked to give this under-taking in advance of the General Assembly&apos;s discussion. TheAssembly&apos;s recommendations might prove to be wholly impracticable for political or other reasons, and His Majesty&apos;s Government wouldbe placed in a most difficult position if they had committed them-selves in advance to accept them. No analogy could properly bedrawn with procedure in a court of law: we were seeking a settle-ment between the conflicting claims of Jews and Arabs which wouldbe backed by greater moral authority than one Government couldcommandi: it was, however, a settlement which we were seekingand not a judgment. In any event, it need not be assumed that thedemand for a statement on this question would be pressed; forthe purpose of the Special Assembly was to appoint a preliminarycommittee to prepare material on which the General Assembly could reach conclusions, and the question whether His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would bind themselves to accept those conclusions was strictlyirrelevant to the purpose of the Special Assembly.After further discussion, it was agreed that the Prime minister should discuss the matter with the Foreign Secretary, who had now returned to this country.The Cabinet-Invited the Prime Minister to discuss the issues raised in CP. (47) 140 with the Foreign Secretary.
4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofLabour (CP. (47) 131) on certain issues outstanding between him and the President of the Board of Trade in connexion with theIndustrial Organisation Bill.The Minister of Labour said that his first request was for adeclaration in the Bill or in all Development Council Orders thatthe exercise by Development Councils of any functions assigned tothem should not prejudice the exercise of similar functions by ministers. Without some such^safeguard there was a danger thatthe exercise by Development Councils of certain functions (e.g.,those relating to training) would imply that a Government Depart-ment had no right to exercise similar functions.The President of the Board of Trade said that the inclusionof a specific saving in the terms suggested would set an undesirableprecedent since it would cast doubt on the exercise of functions by a Government Department in all cases in which there was nosuch statutory saving. He was, however, willing to insert in development Council Orders, in appropriate cases, a provisionrequiring the Development Council, in exercising their functions,to have regard to the work which was being done in the same fieldby other bodies, including Government Departments.The Cabinet-(1) Jxejected the proposal that the Industrial OrganisationBill should be amended on the lines suggested in para-graph 2 of CP. (47) 131 and invited the President ofthe Board of Trade and the Minister of Labour and national Service to discuss what safeguards should beinserted in particular Development Council Orders indue course.The Minister of Labour said that it was essential that Develop-ment Councils should not undertake recruitment campaigns whichwould frustrate the work of the Ministry of Labour in the recruit-ment and allocation of labour. He therefore urged that the bill itself or all Development Council Orders should provide that func-tions in the field of recruitment should be exercised by DevelopmentCouncils only with his consent.IndustrialOrganisationBill.jLiuts oiaumcu (1) Endorsed  the recommendations  made by  the  DefenceCommittee on the points raised in CP. (47) 133.The&apos; Cabinet were informed that at a meeting of the Legisla-tion Committee earlier in the day it had been agreed that a new clause should be added to the National Service Bill to give effectto the decision of the Lord Presidents Committee on 14th Marchthat the existing arrangements for making up the balance of civilpay to members of local authorities&apos; staffs called up under theNational Service scheme should be terminated from 1st July, 1947.In discussion doubt was expressed about the propriety of including in the National Service Bill a Clause primarily designedto deal with the position of men called up under the existing national Service Acts and it was suggested that this matter shouldbe dealt with in separate legislation. Against this, it was pointedout that Parliamentary Counsel was satisfied that the proposed new clause would be within the scope of the Bill. Further, it was not likely to prove controversial,   jailer discussion,The Cabinet-(2) Endorsed the proposal to add a new Clause to the NationalService Bill terminating from 1st July, 1947, thearrangements for making up the balance of civil pay to local authorities&apos; staffs called up under the NationalService Acts.
The President of the Board of Trade pointed out that there was nothing to prevent any firm or group of firms from undertaking a campaign for the recruitment of labour and that the proposals inthe Bill would, if anything, lessen the danger of undesirable recruit-ment campaigns, since Development Councils would be less likelyto exercise their functions in such a way as to embarrass the Govern-ment. If it were provided that recruitment functions should be exer-cised only with the consent of the Minister of Labour, it would benecessary also- to provide that the various other functions whichcould be conferred on Development Councils should be exercisedonly with the consent of the other Ministers concerned.The Cabinet-(2) Agreed that it would be inappropriate to include provisionseither in the Bill or in Development Council Ordersrequiring the functions of development Councils in thefield of recruitment to be exercised only with the consentof the Minister of Labour, but invited the President ofthe Board of Trade to consult tihe Minister of Labourbefore conferring on any particular development council the power to exercise such functions.The Minister of Labour said that he had been strongly pressed by the British Employers Federation to secure tihe inclusion in theBill of a requirement that before a Development Council Order wasmade there should be consultation with joint organisations ofemployers and workers established for the purpose of settlingremuneration and conditions of employment.The President of the Board of Trade said that the Bill already made provision for separate consultation with the representativesof employers and of workers and that tihe Federation of BritishIndustries and the Trades Union Congress were opposed to theinclusion of any requirement for consultation with joint industrial councils and similar bodies. Such a requirement would give riseto the erroneous impression that Development Councils were concerned with remuneration and conditions of work.The Cabinet-(3) Agreed that the Bill should not include any provisionrequiring consultation, before Development CouncilOrders were made, with joint organisations of employersand workers concerned with remuneration and conditionsof employment.The Minister of Labour said that he was anxious to avoidduplication in the demands made on employers for statistics. Forthis reason he suggested that Development Councils should berequired to obtain any statistics which they needed from the Govern-menfc Department concerned. Alternatively, he proposed that theBill should be amended so as to require each Development Councilto obtain the consent of all the Departments concerned with the types of statistics which that Council desired to collect.The President of the Board of Trade said that, on the Ministryof Labour&apos;s own admission, they did not collect all the statisticswith regard to employment which would be required by certainDevelopment Councils. No Development Council could call forstatistics without obtaining the consent of the department responsible for setting it up and it was to be presumed that that department would consult with other interested Departments before giving consent.The Cabinet (4) Agreed that the provision in the Bill authorising Develop-inent   Councils  to  collect   statistics  should   remain

The President of the Board of Trade said that the staffof his Department were proposing to hold their annual sportsmeeting on a week-day and had asked whether this would beregarded as inconsistent with the Governments policy of restrictingmid-week sporting events, lie had thought that no objection need be raised to this proposal if the meeting did not begin till 4 p.m.It was pointed out, in discussion, that the current restrictionson mid-week sport were aimed at professional events Which attractedlarge numbers of spectators. This would be in the nature of aprivate meeting, and there seemed to be no reason for interfering with it.The Cabinet Agreed that no objection need be raised to the proposal that the staff of the Board of Trade should hold their annual sports meeting on a week-day.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,29th April, 1947.Mid-WeekSport.(previous reference erence:CM.
