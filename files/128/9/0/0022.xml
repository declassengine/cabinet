A considerable number of coal ships had reached the Thames or were on their way, and the work ofunloading coal was going on well. The main problem at present was to secure the rapid turn-round of coal wagons.The Cabinet-(4) Took note of the statement made by the Minister of fuel and Power.The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof National Insurance (CP. (47) 60) proposing- that arrangements should be made to enable workers who were unemployed for twelvedays or more as a result of the fuel cuts to receive unemploymentbenefit for the first three days of their period of unemployment.The Minister of National Insurance said that representations on this point had been made to the Prime Minister by the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress. It was the case that underthe Unemployment Insurance Act, 1935, workers who were thrown out of employment received no benefit in respect of the first three days of their period of unemployment. But the National InsuranceAct, 1946, contained a provision, which had been passed after muchdiscussion in Parliament and in face of demands that the waitine1period should be abolished altogether, by which, if the period ofunemployment lasted for twelve days, payment was made for thefirst three days. In his view it would be desirable to bring this new provision into operation as from 10th February, and he thought[33350-2] B 2ploymentmce.1. The Prime Minister said that the Chairman and theDirector-General of the British Broadcasting Corporation had asked whether it would be helpful if the Corporation arranged fora series of broadcasts by leading representatives of the Opposition,the Churches and both sides of industry appealing for national unityin the present crisis. His own view was that this should not be encouraged.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the British Broadcasting Corporation shouldnot be encouraged to arrange a series of broadcastsappealing for national unity.The Prime Minister said that the Fuel Committee would be considering later in the day a recommendation by the Postmaster-General that no broadcast transmissions should be made during the periods in which the use of electricity for domestic purposes hadbeen forbidden.The Cabinet (2) Agreed that, for the present, broadcast transmissions shouldnot be made during the hours of 9 a.m. to 12 noon and1-30 p.m. to 3-30 p.m.
Palestine.Future Policy.(PreviousBet erence:CM. (47) 18thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary and the Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP. (47) 59)reporting the results of the further discussions with representativesof the Arabs and the Jews on^ the future of Palestine.Both the Arabs and the Jews had declined to accept as a basis for further negotiation the proposals approved by the Cabinet on 7th February. The Jews had rejected them as likely to lead to anunitary State in which the Jews would be a permanent,j. The Arabs had rejected them as leading inevitably toPartition andl also becausemmorit, . . \J &apos;  I Vt.Y..V .further Jewisnimmigration.In these circumstances, it was recommended that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should give immediate notice of their intention to refer the problem of Palestine to the judgment of the General Assemblyof the United Nations. In placing the question before the Assembly,His Majesty&apos;s Government should give an historical account of thedischarge of their trust in Palestine, and should explain the varioussolutions which had been proposed; and, without themselves making any recommendations, should invite the Assembly to find a solutionof the problem. The next Session of the Assembly would not be helduntil September, but it would probably be impracticable to arrangefor a special Session to be held before then.   Meanwhile, we mustr*r.yif&quot;.iTm^       fldmrn icfA?&apos; th0 oviofinir TV/Va-nrl a t-the Foreign Secretary recalled the various stages of the negotia-tions over the past eighteen months, and explained how the problemhad become progressively more intractable. American Jewry now had great influence in the counsels of the Jewish Agency. He had made every effort to secure the assistance of the United StatesGovernment, but in the event their interventions had only increasedour difficulties. When the first session of the London conference had ended last autumn, he had not been without hope of a solution,but since then opinion on each side had hardened and the negotia-tions which had just taken place left no room for hope of a settle-ment acceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government in which either side would acquiesce.In the final stage of the negotiations the Jewish representatives had been prepared to consider a scheme of Partition, but when askedto define what they meant by their claim to a &apos;: viable State in anadequate area of Palestine&apos;&apos; they had made it clear that theyclaimed a far larger area than any which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would be justified in proposing for the Jews under a Partitionscheme. A map indicating the extent of the Jewish claim was shown to the Cabinet.The Foreign Secretary said that he had the impression that therepresentatives of the Jews had not believed that we should in factrefer the matter to the United Nations. He thought that both jews and Arabs were anxious to avoid discussion of the problem in thatforum, and it might be that, if we now announced our firm intentionto. take the matter to the United Nations Assembly, this might bring them to a more reasonable frame of mind.   Even after such that if an announcement were made at once that the government intended! to do this, it would forestall demands for a complete abolition of the three days&apos; waiting period.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he supported theproposal, the cost of which would amount to  750,000 for eachmillion persons who were unemployed for long enough to qualify for payment for the first three days.The Cabinet-(5) Agreed that the provisions of the National Insurance Act,1946, with regard to payment of unemployment benefit for waiting days should be brought into force from monday, 10th February.
an announcement had been made, he would certainly continue his efforts to find a solution; and he had it in mind, in particular, tomake a direct approach to the rulers of the Arab States. Eventhough we gave notice of our intention to submit the matter to theUnited Nations, we could subsequently withdraw it from the agenda of the Assembly if between now and September a solution could befound which was acceptable to both parties.The Lord Chancellor said that, at the suggestion of the Secretaryof State for the Colonies, he had acceded to a request that he shouldgrant an interview to Mr. Simon Marks and Mr. Ben Gurion. Thelatter had made it clear that the Jewish Agency would prefer thatwe should not try to force a final solution of the Palestine question at the present time by submitting it to the judgment of the united nations. The Agency believed that it would be easier to reach afinal solution at some future date; and they desired that meanwhileHis Majesty&apos;s Government should continue to administer theMandate on the basis on which it had been administered before theWhite Paper of 1939. If the Government were willing to do this,the Jews would be satisfied with two concessions.  The first was that-i f\n Ann   Tnt ^,,1J r. Jv^U + ^J DnU^iMA  ^TTrt,i  4-hn *-txr^1UU,WU   UCVVO   OllUU-XII    UCT    aUlUlULCU    IU    X CIjXOOUXIIO   WCX     U1XC   11CAI    uvVuyears, and that further immigration thereafter should be determinedsolely in accordance with the principle of economic absorptive capacity. If it were clearly laid down in advance that immigra-tion was to be regulated solely in accordance with that uiiuuiple,they would, be content that the rate of immigration should be finally determined by the High Commissioner. The second concession wasthat Jews should have the right to settle and buy land in any partof Palestine. Mr. Ben Gurion had added that, if those two conces-sions were made, he would be able to secure the co-operation of theJewish community in Palestine in combating terrorist activities,and he believed that terrorism could then be brought to an end.He could not give any assurance that illegal immigration would cease, but he thought that it would shrink to small proportions iflegal immigration were allowed to the extent which he had suggested.The Foreign Secretary said that it was clear that the objectwhich Mr. Ben Gurion had in mind, in his conversation with theLord Chancellor, was the same as that which the representativesof the Jewish Agency had. advanced in their recent conversationsv/ith him and the Colonial Secretary, viz., that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should continue to administer the Mandate in such away as to enable the Jews to attain, by immigration, a numericalmajority in Palestine. Such a policy was bound to excite the activehostility of the Arabs in Palestine.The Minister of Food said that he could not find, in the pro-posals now submitted by the Foreign Secretary and the Secretaryof State for the Colonies, any hope of reaching finality in thePalestine problem. It was admitted that the present position inPalestine was unsatisfactory and was imposing a great strain onour troops and civil administration; and under these proposals he feared that this position would continue indefinitely. He would himself have preferred that we should support the Jewish claims.He believed them to be just; and he also considered that our strategic interests would be best served by securing in a friendly Jewish state the military facilities which we desired).As against this, it was pointed out that by adopting such apolicy we should probably provoke an Arab rising in Palestine andshould incur the hostility certainly of the Arab peoples and possiblyof the whole Muslim world. Our&quot;main object in desiring military facilities in Palestine was to enable us to maintain our positionand influence throughout the Middle East. It would be no advantage to us to secure a safe base in Palestine by means whichestranged the surrounding Arab countries. Further, in view ofthe recent activities of Jewish terrorists in Palestine, it was notto be assumed that a policy of full support for the Jewish claimwould be acceptable either to public opinion in this country or tothe British troops in Palestine.       , &apos;
The Chief of the Air&apos; Staff said that,.in the considered view ofthe Chiefs of Staff, it was vital to,the security of. the British Com-commonwealth and of the United Kingdom itself that we should retainbases adequate to maintain our military position in the Middle East-and in present circumstances we were relying on securing in Pales-tine some of our essential needs for such bases. If the future ofPalestine were left to the decision of the United Nations, we could notbe sure that we should be able to secure there the military facilities which we required. If in the event we were unable to secureadequate bases there or elsewhere in the Middle East, the founda-tions of Commonwealth defence would be undermined.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he still believed thatPartition would afford the best means of securing both peace inPalestine and our own strategic interests in the Middle East. he presumed that the proposals now before the Cabinet did not exclude the possibility of a decision by the United Nations in favour of partition. The Foreign Secretary confirmed that Partition was not excluded.Further discussion showed that it was the general view of theCabinet that the right course was now to submit the whole problem to the United Nations, on the basis proposed in CP. (47) 59. Thissubmission would not involve an immediate surrender of theMandate; but His Majesty&apos;s Government would not be under an obligation themselves to enforce whatever solution the united nations might approve. If the settlement suggested by the united nations were not acceptable to us, we should be at liberty then to surrender the Mandate and leave the United Nations to make other arrangements for the future administration of Palestine.The Cabinet next considered whether the matter could not bebrought to the United Nations before the next regular Session ofthe General Assembly in September. It was admitted that this further delay would be most unfortunate. On the other hand, itwas clear that a special Session of the General Assembly could notbe convened until end of the meeting of Foreign ministers in Moscow; and the Dominion Governments desired that, after that,a Conference of the principal belligerent States should be held todiscuss the peace settlement for Germany. There seemed, therefore,to be little prospect of arranging for the General Assembly to con-sider the Palestine problem before September. The Cabinet were also informed that the Trusteeship Council would not be competent to discuss this matter, as there was no trusteeship agreement inrespect, of Palestine. In these circumstances The Foreign secretary undertook to enquire whether there were any means by which theUnited Nations could set in train preliminary enquiries and otherpreparatory measures with a view to ensuring that the general assembly could proceed at once to a definitive discussion of theproblem at its next regular Session in September.Discussion then turned on the difficulties of holding the internalposition in Palestine in the interim period before a decision wastaken by the United Nations. The Secretary of State for the Coloniesstressed the difficulties which this further delay would involve forthe civil administration, and drew special attention to the state-ment in paragraph 8 of CP. (47) 59 that conditions might arise in which the control of the country would have to be handed over. to a military administration. The Chief of the Air Staff said thatthe British troops in Palestine were now under great strain, butthey had at least a definite objective, viz., the maintenance of theexisting Mandate. Once it was announced that the question ofPalestine&apos;s future was to be submitted to the United Nations with-out any recommendation from us, a new element of uncertaintywould be added; and it would become more difficult to maintain the discipline and morale of the troops. It was also pointed out thatthe policy now proposed would involve a further delay in providingpermanent accommodation for the troops in Palestine, who were now living under unsatisfactory conditions; and this would increasethe difficulties of the military authorities.
The suggestion was made that the position might be eased if some concession could be made in respect of Jewish immigrationin this interim period. The Prime Minister said that in his view the right course for His Majesty&apos;s Government would be to make every effort to maintain the status quo during this period, includingthe restriction of Jewish immigration to the present rate of 1,500a month. Any concession on that point would excite the opposition of the Arabs and would also lead to pressure from the Jews forfurther concessions.The point was also made that, once it was announced that thequestion was to be submitted to the United Nations, there was some reason to hope that both communities in Palestine would exerciserestraint so as to avoid prejudicing the case which they would haveto present to the General Assembly. It might be useful to suggestthat the President of the United Nations should make an appealto all parties to preserve the status quo in Palestine until the mattercame before the General Assembly.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that His Majesty&apos;s Government should now give notice of their intention to refer the problem of palestine to the General Assembly of the United Nations on thebasis proposed in paragraph 13 of CP. (47) 59.(2) Authorised the Secretary of State for Dominion affairs and the Foreign Secretary, respectively, to communicate this decision to Dominion Governments and to the UnitedStates Government.(3) Agreed that a statement of the Governments intentionshould be made in both Houses of Parliament early inthe following week.(4) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider whether, in orderto avoid further delay, preparatory measures could be initiated by the United Nations to ensure that theGeneral Assembly could proceed to a definitive discussionof this problem when it met in September.lith February, 1947.
