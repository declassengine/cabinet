1.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the.Minister of Defence (CP. (47) 36) embodying the draft of a pro-posed statement calling on men who had deserted from the armed forces to surrender themselves and regularise their position.The Minister of Defence said that there were now nearly20,000 deserters in the United Kingdom. These men were not onlyliable to arrest under military law, but were unable to lead a regularcivilian life as they were dependent for food and clothing on privatecharity or on breaches of the rationing regulations. Many of them were, therefore, under strong temptation to resort to a life of crime:and it was known that of the indictable crimes attributable to individuals convicted in the Metropolitan Police District in 19458 per cent, were committed by deserters. A determined effort should therefore be made, to clear up this position; and the draft statement which he had presented to the Cabinet had been drawn up afterconsultations which he had held with the Service Ministers and theChiefs of Staff. He was satisfied that there could be no questionof a general amnesty to these men : that would be ill-received by those who were loyally fulfilling their military obligations. Someinducement must, however, be held out to persuade these men togive themselves up : paragraphs (b) to (d) of the draft statement were designed to provide such an inducement, and he was satisfiedthat they went as far in this direction as it was safe to go.In discussion of the draft statement the following points weremade : (a) Desertion was still continuing; and from the-Army alonethe current rate of desertion was 700 a month. The Chief of theImperial General Staff thought that this was due largely to the factthat the Army intake now included large numbers of illiterate orsemi-illiterate men; and he expected that the problem of desertioncould be reduced to much smaller proportions in future years.(b) It was suggested that there might be grounds for modifying the existing provisions determining whether a man, by desertion,forfeited his accumulated rights to war gratuity. The Minister ofDefence undertook to look into this point.(c) The inducements offered in the draft statement might bemore effective if they were expressed as applying only to deserterswho gave themselves up by a specified date. It was agreed that these assurances should be expressed as applying to men who gave them-selves up by 31st March, 1947.(d) The expression &quot;restoration of full civil rights,&quot; whichwas used in paragraph (d) of the draft statement, had a technicalsignificance in some countries; and it would be preferable to usemore general language such as &quot; resumption of full status as amember of the civil community.&quot; It was the view of the Cabinetthat it would be preferable if the Ministry of Defence, in consulta-tion with the Home Office, could devise some still more simplelanguage which would express more precisely the point which thisparagraph was designed to convey.(e) A general invitation to employers to satisfy themselves thatthere were no deserters among their work-people would give riseto confusion and perhaps ill-feeling; and it was agreed that thefinal sentence of paragraph (e) of the draft statement should be deleted.The Cabinet Approved the draft statement embodied in CP. (47) 36,subject to amendment of the points noted in paragraphs(c) to (e) above; and took note that the Minister ofDefence would make this statement, as so amended, inreply to Questions which were to be addressed to him inthe House of Commons on the following day.33111]
defence estimates.(previous reference:CM. (46) 16thConclusions,Minute 6.)2, The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of IDefence (C .P. (47) 33) covering memoranda submitted to ; the defence Committee on the general Defence Estimates for 1947-^481and on the production, research and development programmes!included in these Estimates.The Minister of Defence said that he would have liked to belable to submit Estimates for 1947-48 against the background of proposals for a long-term defence policy.   But, although he had Istarted work on this with the Chiefs of Staff, no definite proposals!had yet been formulated.   The year 1947-48 could not, however,!be regarded as a normal year and his recommendations must belconsidered in the light of the exceptional commitments which hadto be met in the transition from war to peace.   He had closely!scrutinised the demands of the Services, in terms both of man-power 1and of money and, with the help of the Service Ministers and the!Chiefs of Staff, had made substantial cuts in the original proposals.The Cabinet had already approved on 17th January (CM. (47)19th Conclusions, Minute 2) a figure of 1,087,000 for the combine!strength of the Armed Forces and a figure of 450,000 for the man-power employed in the supply industries at 31st March, 1948.  Aslregards expenditure, he had been able to reduce the estimate for!net current expenditure from  913 million to  822 million andthe estimate for terminal charges from  149-9 million to  118-5 million.   The figure of  822 million for net current expenditure!compared with a figure of  1,091 million for 1946-47; and, iffallowance were made for  40 million of expenditure carried onjService and supply estimates in respect of civil research and!development, the Polish Resettlement Corps, locally stationed!colonial forces and administration of African ex-enemy territory,the true charge for defence in 1947-48 was of the order of il - 82million for net current expenditure plus  118-5 million for terminal!charges.The Cabinet first considered the Defence Estimates for 1947- 48in detail.   The following points arose in the discussion : (a) It would be convenient if in future years the vote heading^under which the estimates for each of the three Services were presented, as shown in Annex A to D.O. (47) 4, could be recast scjas to show the constituent items of each heading and to enable coin-]comparisons to be made between the expenditure incurred by each service on similar items.The Minister of Defence undertook to look into this suggestion,(b) It was suggested that the expenditure on supply would bfglarger in future years when the time came to discontinue i litexisting policy of relying on stocks with a view to reducing demandfor new production.   Further, tlie more up-to-date weapons were likely to be more expensive.As against this, it was pointed out that the Forces to blsupplied would be smaller in future years.(c) &quot;Was the  66 -1 million proposed for research and developgjment an adequate proportion of the total expenditure proposedjjWould it not be better to devote more money to the developmeni &apos;of up-to-date equipment and to reduce the scale of productionobsolescent equipment ?The Cabinet were informed that the Defence Research PoliCommittee would review the research and development programmeover the coming year, in connexion with the formulation of a lonjterm defence policy. Meanwhile, the amount which could profitabbe spent in 1947-48 was determined largely by the scientific maipower and equipment available. The policy of using t.1Universities for fundamental research was being continued.(d) The figure of  82 - 9 million for shipbuilding consisted velargely of expenditure on shipping repairs.   New constructionwarships had been continued only where the work was so f
advanced that it would be uneconomical to cancel the contract. Newshipbuilding projects to be put in hand in 1947-48 would not amount to more than  100,000.(e) Tank production had been limited to the minimum rate(240 a year) required to keep two factories in economic operation.(/) Production for the Royal Air Force was concentratedmainly on jet fighters and on an improved type of transport air-craft which would be more economical in operation than the Yorkand could be used in airborne operations. The introduction of jetfighters should enable the defence of the United Kingdom to bebased on a smaller number of squadrons and might also reduce theman-power needed for engine maintenance.(g) Expenditure of all three Services on works, buildings andlands nad been greatly reduced. Much of it would be incurred in providing accommodation overseas. So far as concerned expenditurein the United Kingdom, the amounts proposed for the improvementof living conditions and amenities had been reduced from  29million to  20 million. Much of the expenditure on works wouldbe devoted to the repair and improvement of existing barracks whichwere very much out of date and, particularly in dockyard towns,uau&apos; Suiiereu ntjavy  war uauiage.    xiie plans iOr piuviumg auui-tional married quarters would contribute towards meeting thegeneral housing shortage. No expenditure was proposed for theprovision of accommodation for troops in training areas, though this was contingent on the Service Departments being able to obtainthe use of training areas where accommodation was already avail-able. Some expenditure would have to be incurred by the RoyalAir Force on the construction of new hangars, workshops and con-trol buildings and for the provision of runways at certain per-manent stations which had not been used for modern aircraft during the war, but work of this kind would be restricted to theminimum.(h) The figure of  55 - 5 million for Army movements included a substantial expenditure arising from demobilisation and the resulting redeployment of units, and a smaller expenditure underthis head was to be expected in future years.The Cabinet then proceeded to consider whether the national economy could bear an expenditure of the order proposed in theEstimates presented by the Minister of Defence.The Chancellor&apos; of the Exchequer said that when it had beententatively suggested, in the time of the Coalition Government, thatpost-war expenditure on Defence might be of the order of  500million a year, some of the leading Conservative members of thatGovernment had expressed the view that such an expenditure on defence would impose too heavy a burden on the national economy.Allowing for the fact that we were still in a period of transition from war to peace, he had indicated to the Minister of Defence atan early stage in the preparation of the Estimates that it would bedifficult to justify a total expenditure on Defence of more than  750million for the year 1947-48. At the Defence Committee it hadbeen agreed that there should be a further scrutiny of the financial proposals made by the Minister of Defence, and he had hoped thatas a result of this the total might be reduced from  963 million to something in the region of  850 million. In fact, however, thereduction achieved had not amounted to more than  22-9 million.Unless the Estimates could be reduced by a further  80 million on current expenditure, he would have very grave difficulties in framing a satisfactory Budget and the whole national economy would be seriously jeopardised. When the Estimates for 1946-47had come before the Cabinet it had been agreed that they shouldbe cut by 10 per cent, on the understanding that, if any service department found it impossible to keep within the reduced figure,a Supplementary Estimate could be submitted. In the event,savings of  50 million by the Ministry of Supply and  20 million by the Air Ministry had offset excess expenditure of  25 million by the Admiralty and  45 million by the War Office; and for
Defence as a whole the 10 per cent, cut had been achieved. Hesuggested that a similar procedure should be adopted in 1947-48.It was not for him to suggest which particular items of expenditure should be cut further; but he believed that, notwithstanding the cuts already made by the Minister of Defence, it should be practicable for the Services to find, throughout the year, means of achieving an overall reduction of a further 10 per cent. If anyof the four Departments concerned found it impossible within the reduced total to meet their essential requirements, he would make no difficulties about Supplementary Estimates.The Minister of Defence said that, after his preliminar y con-versation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, he had approachedhis examination of the figures originally submitted by the service departments with the aim of bringing them down to a total approxi-mating as nearly as possible to  750 million, excluding terminalexpenditure. As a result, however, of long and detailed discus-sions with the Service Ministers and the Chiefs of Staff, he had come to the conclusion that the essential needs of the Services couldnot be met with a current expediture lower than  822 million. Hewas satisfied that the figures which he had now submitted to theCabinet represented the least for which he could ask if the armed forces w6tg to 1)0 maintained in a state which would give them theminimum resources to meet their operational commitments and to train new recruits so as to enable balanced and efficient peace-timeForces to be built up within a reasonable number of years. Thesuggestion that the Estimates which he now submitted as Ministerof Defence should be subjected to. a 10 per cent, cut, on the analogy of the cut made last year in Estimates submitted by the service ministers, failed to take account of the work which he had already done in scrutinising the Departmental demands before submittingthem to the Cabinet. As a result of this scrutiny substantial reductions had already been made in the figures originally submittedto him and there was, in his view, no room for further sweepingreductions. He was satisfied that the provision made in theEstimates before the Cabinet was the absolute minimum consistent with the tasks which the Services had to discharge; and, if a further reduction were made of the order now proposed, he would have toconsider whether he could assure Parliament that the Forces wouldbe maintained in a state of reasonable efficiency.In further discussion several Ministers supported the proposal of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that there should be a furthercut of  80 million in the Estimates. It was pointed out that theEstimates would be considered at a time when it would be the dutyof the Government to bring home to the public the gravity of theeconomic situation. A beginning had already been made by thepublication of the White Paper on the economic considerations affecting relations between employers and workers, and this wouldhave to be reinforced by further publicity. In such an atmosphereit would be difficult to justify Defence Estimates totalling nearly 1,000 million. All Departments were having to face the fact thattheir programmes could not be fully carried out because of shortages of man-power or materials.Summing up the discussion, The Prime Minister said that,while it was clear that the figures of expenditure proposed by theMinister of Defence would impose a very heavy burden, the cabinet must keep in mind the importance of preserving an armed strengthsufficient to support the foreign policy which the Government had undertaken to pursue. Before a final decision could be reached, theCabinet should know where the further cut now proposed would falland what its effect would be.The Cabinet-(1.) Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with theService Ministers and the Chiefs of Staff, to consider on what items of expenditure in the Defence Estimates for
71CM. 10 (OT)1947-48 reductions could be made with the least detri-ment to the efficiency of the Armed Forces if it were decided to reduce by a total of  80 million the netcurrent expenditure of  822 million proposed in CP.(47) 33, and what the effects of these reductions would be(2) Agreed to resume at an early meeting their discussion ofthe Defence Estimates for 1947-48Shipping.proposed inter-governmentalOrganisation.(previous reference:CM. (46) 101stConclusions,Minute 8.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of State (CP. (47) 14) covering a report made by the steering Committee on International Organisations on various points Vhich had been raised in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on28th November, 1946, about the proposed establishment of an Inter-governmental Maritime Consultative Organisation.This report concluded that the balance of argument lay on the side of conducting international consultations on shipping through a Specialised Agency rather than a body subordinate to theEconomic and Social Council; and made it clear that this Agencyneed have only a small Secretariat. It also concluded that the new organisation, far from hampering the recovery of our own mercan-tile marine, should be able to check the adoption oi uiscriinmatorypractices in shipping which might impede that recovery. Itsuggested that, in order to prevent overlapping with the work ofthe International Labour Organisation, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould propose that a clause be inserted in the constitution of thenew Organisation providing that it should not concern itself with matters within the competence of other Specialised Agencies except by agreement with them. Finally, it stated that the majority of theGovernments represented on the United Maritime consultative council were likely to share the Cabinet&apos;s view that the head-quarters of the Shipping Organisation should not be in the UnitedStates.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the report annexed to CP.fAI-!\   t A * * *International 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theLabour Minister of Labour  (CP.  (46)  449)  recommending that HisOrganisation. Majesty&apos;s Government should ratify the International Labour Con-Convention on vention (No. 63) on Statistics of Wages and Hours of Work, whichStatistics of was adopted by the International Labour Conference in 1938. HisWages and Majesty&apos;s Government had supported the Convention in 1938, butHours of Work, further action with a view to its ratification had been suspended onthe outbreak of war.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that His Majesty&apos;s Government should ratify theInternational Labour Convention (No. 63) on statistics of Wages and Hours of Work.(2) Authorised the Minister of Labour to announce thisdecision by presenting to Parliament a White Paper inthe terms of the draft annexed to CP.
