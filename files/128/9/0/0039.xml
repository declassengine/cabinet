275CM. 39 (17)litHome Foodti ..a! n rt f i rtnin 1957.(previous reference erence:C.M.(47)34thConclusions,Minute 9.)1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum (CP. (47) 128)circulated by the Minister of Agriculture in response to theCabinet&apos;s request, at their meeting on 1st April, for proposalsdesigned to secure the maximum output of home-produced food in1947.The Minister of A griculture said that the total losses of cropand livestock production in 1947-48, due to blizzards, floods anddecreased yields from late sowing, might amount to over 36 millions. These losses represented a serious disaster to thenational economy and to the smaller farmers who could notwithstand unaided the financial strain involved. The measures already taken to provide compensation and to stimulate productionwere described in paragraph 6 of his memorandum; but these alone would not provide a sufficient stimulus to production either in thecurrent season or in the next two or three years. He therefore recommended that, for the purpose of stimulating production of crops and milk in 1947, an additional sum of  7 millions shouldbe provided from the Exchequer to offset the extra costs incurred by farmers in additional efforts to secure increased production.This amount could be made available to farmers either by price increases or by acreage payments; and he suggested that, if theCabinet agreed that this global sum should be provided, the methodof distributing it among the farmers should be left to be settled after consultation with the farmers&apos; unions. To promote thedevelopment of food production in future years he recommended(i) an early declaration that the minimum rate of subsidy for ibj.ilsheep in 1948 and 1949 would be 10s. per head; (ii) the importation-.-.^-.-.-1    -C-oi more animal ieeamg-stuns, and an early announcement that farmers would be allowed to retain up to 20 per cent, of theirmillable wheat and barley from the 1948 crop; and (iii) further efforts to provide houses for farm workers.The Cabinet were informed that the Secretary of State forScotland was in general agreement with these recommendations.The Cabinet first discussed the proposal to provide anadditional  7 millions to stimulate home food production in 1947.While there was general agreement that further expenditure ofthis order would be justified, it was pointed out that neither of themethods suggested would ensure that the money was spent to thebest advantage. Price increases, while giving needed help to the marginal farmer, would inflate the profits of the low-cost producer;and acreage payments would not relate the additional rewards to increased output. It was unfortunate that it had not yet beenpossible to find more discriminating means of promoting efficiency in agriculture. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while he sympathised with these criticisms, the overriding present need was to avoid increased imports of food from dollar countries; and,to secure increased home production of food, he was prepared toagree to the expenditure of a further  7 millions even though somey-v-P -i f- Tin i rpl-i-f -fi-n r\ ti-C -mo tr fin 4-S\ -fll-i  1 rvrtnlraf o r\-P -Po nm anft -rrrl-i^v A t i-3 nrtfvi   j. v   a 11 i ^ i ii/  iiuu   j. wo    tV wVy    .l j-j. vuv   puviwuo icii i r t \,&apos;&apos; o    vv j-i^r n\juneed it.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that an additional sum of  7 millions should bemade available for stimulating the home production of crops and milk in 1947; and invited, the agriculture ministers to determine, after consulting the farmers&apos;..^4^^ n-nJ *V.^ TV/Hi. iS-i-A&apos;.; w-P T?/vaJ   i-V.^ -.4? ^Tl^^^i.:^^.LuxiVJAio aiixj. t/iic laiuioLoi circulated a: wu, luio iai^jclho Oj. cuiwuttuixigthis global sum which were best calculated to secureincreased output.As regards the long-term measures proposed, discussion turneamainly on the question of providing houses for farm workers. TheSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs suggested that in allocatinghouses in rural areas priority should for the next two years begiven to farm workers. He also suggested that the pressure for new houses could be relieved if more assistance were given to ownerswilling to recondition rural cottages. The Minister of Health said[33567-1] &quot; b 2
UXXCbl/     J.OJJhe allocation of new houses it was impracticable to give Ioverriding priority to any particular class of worker. Localauthorities must be allowed to retain a discretion to consider appli-cations on their merits. Arrangements were, however, being madeto promote closer collaboration between the local authorities in rural areas and the County Agricultural Committees, and he hoped thatthis collaboration would yield useful results. As regards &quot;recondi-tioning, owners should have no difficulty in obtaining licences and materials for reconditioning cottages let to farm workers.The Prime Minister suggested that the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs should pursue his suggestions on both thesematters in consultations with the Agriculture Ministers and theMinister of Health.With reference to paragraph (d) in the Appendix to CP. (47)128, The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs suggested that more might be done to improve grassland by direct re-seeding andother methods.The Cabinet (2) Agreed that the minimum rate of hill sheep subsidy in 1948and 1949 should be 10s. per head, and that an earlydeclaration should be made to this effect;(3) Invited the Minister of Food to maintain his efforts toincrease the import of animal feeding-stuffs; and autho-rised the Agriculture Ministers to announce that farmers in this country would be allowed to retain up to 20 percent, of their millable wheat and barley from the 1948crop;(4) Invited the Minister of Health and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland to consider what further steps could betaken to provide more housing accommodation for farmworkers.Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Report Stage of the Transport Bill would be taken on 28th,29th and 30th April.On 1st May, in Committee of Supply, there would be a debate on the Fuel Situation.On 2nd May the House would be invited to approve the con-tinuance of emergency government in Burma; and further progress would be made with outstanding legislation.The Minister of Health informed the Cabinet that the nextHousing Return would include a warning that, on account of the fuel crisis and the severe winter weather, the amount of house-building in 1947 would fall short of earlier expectations,might provoke a demand for a debate on Housing.ThisAnglo-egyptian treaty.(previous reference:CM.

The Cabinet were informed that no report was yet available the results of the approach which His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador iniro had been instructed to make to the Egyptian Prime minister on the questions discussed by the Cabinet at their meeting on22nd April.In these circumstances, the Cabinet Agreed to postpone further discussion of these questionsuntil their next meeting.
NationalSeraice BUI.(previous reference:CM. (47) 35thConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The Cabinet had before them a. memorandum by theMinister of Defence (CP. (47) 133) on certain implications of thedecision to reduce the period of full-time service under the NationalService Bill from 18 to 12 months.The Prime Minister said that it would be convenient for theCabinet to have a- -preliminary discussion of these points; but theyshould be discussed by the Defence Committee before final decisionsw*6x6 reached.cmrriTootirvn at.; t.Via ncfcrrpcpji t,a&quot;&quot;-&amp;&amp;^&quot;&quot;-&apos;&quot;-&quot; -- -00--0---period of 60 days&apos; part-time service in the reserve should beincreased.In favour of this proposal it was urged that in a period of only 12 months&apos; full-time service national service men would spendonly a short time in operational units and as a result would form aless effective reserve. If the period of part-time service were increased to 90 days, the Army and the Royal Air Force wouldbe able to call men up for 15 days&apos; annual training in each year of reserve service and the Navy could call men up for three periods of 28 days&apos; sea-going training.On the other hand, it was pointed out that, if the government proposed an amendment to increase the period of part-time service,the difficulties of securing the passage of the Bill would be greatlyaggravated. In particular, any such proposal to increase the periodof part-time service would be represented as an admission that aperiod of 12 months&apos; full-time service was insufficient. It was alsourged that an increase in the period to 90, or even to 75, da)^s would impose an excessive burden on the national economy. So far as concerned the Navy, it should be possible to arrange that 6 of the12 months&apos; full-time service were spent at sea; and at least someof the difficulties likely to be experienced by the Royal Air force could be overcome by careful selection of recruits so as to makethe maximum possible use of any technical training which theymight have had in civilian life. As regards the Army, the mostserious difficulty was not that of carrying out the necessary trainingwithin a period of 12 months&apos; full-time service, but the danger that by 1950 we should still have overseas commitments which called for larger numbers of troops than could be provided by voluntary--v v\ 1 -n      .4- &quot;V&quot;V\      try 4-then considered the suggestion that the maximumany one year of reserve liability shouldbe increased from 21 to 28 days.It was explained that this suggestion was primarily designedto enable sea,-going training to be given to naval reservists and that,from the point of view of the Navy, it would be desirable to adoptit even though the aggregate period of part-time service were toremain at 60 days.Against the suggestion it was urged that to withdraw men from industry for so long a continuous period as 28 days would giverise to serious dislocation and that, while there would be no objectionto voluntary arrangements made for this purpose with the consentof both employers and workers, it would be preferable not to amend the Bill so as to impose a liability for more than 21 days&apos; service in any one year.Other points in discussion were : (a) The Minister of Defence said that before the committee stage of the Bill it should be decided whether a pledge was to begiven that no man called up before 1st January, 1949, would berequired to serve after January 1950, when the first men called up under the Bill would be released. It was arguable that, as men called up before 1949 had no liability for reserve service, they could resonably be called upon to give a longer period of full-time service;and if all such men had to be released by January 1950, the Forces,and particularly the Army, might have great difficulty in maintain-ing adequate strengths. On the other hand, it would be hard tojustify retaining men called up before 1949 after the date on whichduration of training
those called up under the Bill began to be released, and both heand the Secretary of State for War felt that the right course wasto give such a pledge in general terms, leaving for later decision the detailed arrangements for tapering off the period of serviceof men called up before 1949.(b) The Minister of Labour said that it should be made clear whether travelling time and Sundays were to be included in reckon-ing the number of days of reserve training.(c) The Secretary of State for War said that with only12 months&apos; full-time service the obligation placed on the services to provide further education for national service men would haveto be interpreted more narrrowly than had been contemplated.It was the view of the Cabinet that no difficulties should arise on this score, since the obligation on the Services was to provide further education only so far as might be practicable.(d) The Prime Minister said that an early decision should bereached on the future of Dartmouth College.The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that he hoped to be ableto make a recommendation to the Prime Minister on this matter in the following week.The Cabinet Agreed to resume discussion of the points raised in cp. (47) 133 after they had been considered by the DefenceCommittee.Food.Rations of sugar, Teaand Meat.(PreviousReferenceCM. (47) 33rdConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Ministerof Pood (CP. (47) 130) proposing an increase in the sugar rationto offset forthcoming reductions in the rations of tea and meat.The Minister of Food recalled that on 27th March the cabinet had agreed that his proposal to increase the sugar ration shouldbe reconsidered when it became&apos; necessary to reduce the ration ofsome other food. He was now satisfied that he must announce atonce a reduction in the tea ration; and, although this need notbe announced for some weeks, the meat ration would also have to bereduced from the end of June. He thought it essential, on bothnutritional and psychological grounds, to make some concession to offset these reductions. The proposed increase in the sugar rationwould not involve additional dollar expenditure, since the purchaseof the full amount of sugar needed to maintain the increased rationduring 1947 and 1948 had already been made or authorised.Preliminary points in the discussion were: (a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he hoped shortly to be able to put before the Cabinet the report of the Working party on the Balance of Payments, on the basis of which difficult decisions would have to be taken on means of reducing our overseas deficit.These might involve a substantial reduction in food imports in 1948.He thought, therefore, that it would be preferable to defer a decisiona general discussion on the future import programme.(b) The Minister of Food said that an incidental advantageof his proposal was that it would enable the export of certainluxury food-stuffs, such as confectionery and biscuits, to be resumed.The Cabinet thought, however, that it would be inadvisable topermit the export of such foods under prasent conditions.Discussion then turned on the necessity for the proposed reduction of the tea ration.jl it/iv j.&apos;m. nfKof^/   \jj  x- uyii oaiu oilhIi Our tea xcCJUixcxncntS wv-^i  l*uunext twelve months, on the basis of the present ration, were425 million pounds. 260 million pounds had been secured by bulk purchase through the Governments of Ceylon and India; but both those Governments had refused to allow further bulk purchases and
Iron and StesiIndustryNationalisationBill.(previous reference:CM. (47) 37thConclusions,Minute 8.)6.   The Cabinet resumed consideration of the memorandum byfor bringing certain sections of the iron and steel industry under public ownership.The Minister of Supply explained that this scheme had beenapproved in principle by the Committee on the Socialisation ofIndustries. It would bring under public ownership the central coreof the iron and steel industry by compulsory purchase of all the shares of the companies concerned. He was satisfied that this method was preferable to the acquisition of selected physical assets,which would involve difficult problems of severance as well asdisturbance and delay. He was also convinced that it would notbe sufficient merely to acquire a controlling interest in the companies.The existing company structure would be retained, at any rate inthe initial stages, though it would be possible for the Central Board,which would replace both the existing Iron and Steel Board andthe Federation, to make wide changes in organisation later on. Theresponsibility of the Board would be to control the industry in sucha way as to ensure (i) the efficient production of adequate suppliesof iron and steel and the sale of these supplies at prices best calcu-lated to serve the national interest, and (ii) the continuous develop-ment of the industry towards greater efficiency. As regards theterms of purchase of the shares, the only practical course seemed tobe to pay holders of shares quoted on the Stock Exchange on thebasis of their market value at a selected date or dates. The purchase price of unquoted shares should, he suggested, be fixed by a tribunal which would be required to place on them a value corresponding toa Stock Exchange quotation and not to base the purchase price onthe balance of pur requirements would have, to be bought at publicauctions in Colombo and Calcutta. At present, as a result of demands from the United States and the Middle East, the prices: in those markets were unduly high; and, although it was hoped that prices would fall when those demands had been met, our best tacticswere to hold off the market for the present, Our present stocksamounted to 89 million pounds or about three months&apos; supply onthe present ration. He was advised that, unless the now of supplieswas soon resumed, there was serious risk of interruption of distribu-tiori in the late summer; and to reduce that risk he recommendedan early reduction of the ration.The Cabinet were not, however, fully satisfied that a case hadbeen made out for such a reduction. Half of the requirements forthe next year had already been secured, and there was some prospect that prices might fah to a level at which more could be bought.Some supplies from the Dutch East Indies might also become available later in the year.   Meanwhile, the existing stocks in this.      - -        ...1.-1-       n      * * ft . t*     i. il , * 1        *country provided a ran- margin oi sarecy ror wie time being.The Cabinet were also informed that in a forthcoming debate in the House of Lords on the food situation Lord Woolton was expected to argue that world supplies of tea were sufficient to justifythe abolition of the ration, the abandonment of Governmentpurchasing and the restoration of the free market. This mightassist in breaking down the present artificial level of tea prices. Itwas in any event inexpedient that the Government should announce a reduction in the ration shortly before this debate. It would alsobe helpful if, in replying to the debate, the Government spokesmanlaid special emphasis on the measures which were being taken todevelop alternative sources of supply within the Colonial Empire.The Cabinet-Agreed that for the present there should be no increasein the sugar ration or reduction in the tea ration; and invited the Minister of Food to bring these proposals beforethe Cabinet again when the import programme for 1947-48was under examination.
the value of the physical assets which they represented. He had had informal consultations with Government supporters in Parlia-ment, with a committee of the Trades Union Congress and withthe trade unions concerned and was satisfied that they were ingeneral agreement with his scheme.In discussion, the following points were raised: (a) With the support and acquiescence of former governments the iron and steel industry had built up a powerful cartel whichhad maintained prices at a level sufficient to enable obsolescent andobsolete plant to be profitably employed; and one of the first tasks which would have to be carried out when the industry had beennationalised would be to develop modern large-scale steel plants totake the place of many of the existing plants. This being so, wouldnot the Government by acquiring all the shares of the companiesat market value be paying for a substantial amount of worthlessassets %The Minister of Supply said that ail the evidence which hehad been able to obtain suggested that in recent years iron and steel companies had pursued a conservative dividend policy and that theeffect of the projected development of modern large-scale plantshad already been discounted. In these circumstances, he doubted whether the shares quoted on the Stock Exchange were over-valued;and the instructions which he intended to give to the proposedtribunal would ensure that an unduly high price was not paid forunquoted shares. Any alternative scheme would involve eithervaluing the physical assets or remitting the whole matter to a tribunal; and either of these alternatives would mean serious delay-in reaching a settlement and the likelihood that the Governmentwould have to pay a higher sum in compensation than would be involved in the purchase of the shares.(&amp;) The Lord Chancellor and The Lord Privy Seal suggestedthat it would be sufficient if the Government were to acquire acontrolling interest in the companies concerned by the purchaseof 51 per cent, of the shares. This would minimise the extentto which the Government might be paying for obsolescent or obsolete(c) The Minister of Fuel and Power stressed the political disadvantages of tihe proposal to retain the existing companystructure. In his view, unless there was a radical change in the structure of the industry it would be difficult to maintain that itwas being effectively socialised.(d) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that itwas important that in presenting the scheme the Government shouldbe able to adduce convincing arguments for the proposal to bringthe companies under public ownership and to show that the scheme would provide an effective incentive to these companies to develop their undertakings on enterprising lines.(e) It was suggested that the requirement proposed in para-o-rnrjh ft of AnBendix I to CP (47 j 123 that anv person carrying ona specified process should register with the Ministry of Supplywithin two months of the passing of the Act was not wholly consist-tent with the proposals in paragraph 12 of Appendix I.(/) The suggestion was made that it would be preferable to substitute 1st July, 1945, for 1st January, 1946, as the date after which any agreements made by a company which were consideredby the Board to have been unnecessary or imprudent might bedisclaimed.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their discussion of CP. (47) 123 at ameeting on 28th April.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,21th April, 1947.
