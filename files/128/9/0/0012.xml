Burma. 1.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary (CP.Constitutional   (47) 41) covering the text of a statement which it was proposed to position.(previous reference:CM. (47)9thConclusions,issue on the conclusion of the discussions with the Delegation ofthe Burma Executive Council.The Prime Minister said that the discussions with the BurmaDelegation had appeared to be leading to a conclusion acceptable to both sides; but at the final meeting on the previous day, when thedraft of an agreed statement was under consideration, two membersof the Delegation (Thakin Ba Sein and U Saw) had expressed dis-sent and indicated that they would not be parties to a declaration on these lines. It was. clear that these two, who were not membersof the Anti-Fascist People&apos;s Freedom League, were influenced by considerations of domestic politics in not pre-pared to shoulder the responsibility of defending in their own country the proposals which had been worked out in the course ofthe discussions.   The other members&apos; of the Delegation were, how-ever, ready to assume that responsibility; and it was clear that.!the right course for His Majesty&apos;s Government was to conclude Ithe agreement with Aung 1 San and those who were prepared to gfollow his leadership.The Prime Minister explained to the Cabinet the main features of the policy outlined in the statement annexed to CP. (47) 41. the broad intention was t.o apply to Burma the same procedure as hadbeen adopted in India for framing a new constitution and forcarrying on under an Interim Government in the transition period.Special provision was proposed to enable the peoples of the FrontierAreas to decide upon the form of their association with the Govern-ment of Burma during the transition period and upon the methodof their collaboration in the working out of the new constitution.It was proposed that a Minister should proceed to Burma on aspecial mission to promote agreement with the peoples of theFrontier Areas on both these matters; and the Prime Minister saidthat he would ask the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State forDominion Affairs to undertake this task.The Prime Minister said that, subject to the cabinet&apos;s approval, he intended to sign the agreed statement on behalf of HisMajesty&apos;s Government that afternoon. Aung San would sign onbehalf of the Burma Delegation.In discussion, The Secretary of State for Burma drew special attention to the proposal that during the interim period theGovernor should on occasion not preside over meetings of his executive Council. As the rest of the procedure was modelled onthat which had been followed in India, this proposal might havereactions in India, where it was the current practice for the viceroy to preside at all meetings of his Executive Council. It had, how-ever, been the convention in Burma before 1942 that the governor should not always preside at meetings of the Council of Ministers;and it had not, therefore, been thought practicable to refuse therequest of the Burma Delegation that the same convention should apply to the new Executive Council.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was satisfied withthe agreement on finance, which was set out in Annex B of the draft statement appended to CP. (47) 41. Contrary to expectations, the burma Delegation had been reasonable in their financial demands;and he hoped that Burma would not prove a heavy burden on theBritish taxpayer. Care must, however, be taken in selecting theBritish officials to be sent out to Burma to supervise the working out of this financial agreement.The Prime Minister said that, if the agreement was signed that!day, he proposed that he should make a short oral statement in the!House of Commons on the following day and that the full text of!the agreement should be published immediately thereafter as ajWhite Paper. The Secretary of State for Burma would make a Isimultaneous announcement in the House of Lords. The Opposition!Leaders would be informed in advance.   There would no doubt be!
a demand for a Parliamentary debate; but he hoped that this mightbe postponed until after the Delegation had returned to Burma andif was possible to gauge what reception the agreement would have in Burma.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the policy for constitutional development in burma which was outlined in the draft statement annexed to CP. (47) 41; and authorised the PrimeMinister to sign a statement in those terms on behalf ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government;(2) Took note that the conclusion of this agreement would be announced in both Houses of Parliament on 28thJanuary; and invited the Prime Minister to arrange forthe full text of the agreed statement to be publishedimmediately thereafter in the form of a White Paper.Anglo-Egyptian 2. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that theTreaty Egyptian Government had decided to break off the negotiationsNegotiations.    for the revision of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and to refer the(Previous        matter to the United Nations.   On the Treaty itself, there were reference:      no outstanding points of difference : the negotiations had failedCM. (46) 104th solely on account of the Sudan Protocol.   On this every possibleConclusions,     effort had been made to reach a satisfactory understanding with minute l.)       the Egyptian Government, consistently with our obligations to the sudanese.   We had gone to the very limit of concession : to go further would have meant committing ourselves to opposing the sudanese if, when the time came for them to achieve self-govern-ment, they wished to sever their connexion with Egypt.The Foreign Secretary said that he would make a short state?ment in the House of Commons later that day announcing the break-down of the negotiations.The Cabinet expressed their appreciation of the patience whichthe Foreign Secretary had shown in his protracted efforts to bring these negotiations to a successful conclusion. If there had to bea breakdown, it was satisfactory that it should come on this issueof the right of the Sudanese to determine their own future:Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Palestine. 3.   The Cabinet were informed that on the previous eveningPublic Order, a British subject named H. I. Collins had been kidnapped in-Jerusalem. It was possible that those responsible for this kid-napping intended to threaten to kill Mr. Collins unless the british authorities reprieved the Jewish terrorist, Dov Groner, who was now under sentence of death. It had previously been announcedthat there would be no interference with this sentence, which was due to be carried out on the following day.It was the view of the Cabinet that, even if such threats weremade, Groner&apos;s execution should not be postponed on that account.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,27th January, 1947.
