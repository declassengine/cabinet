265CM. 38 (17)Anglo-egyptian treaty.(previous reference erence:CM. (47)20thConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The Minister of Defence drew attention to the foreign secretary&apos;s telegram from Moscow (No: 825 of 18th April) recom-mending that a firm stand should now be taken against the attemptsof the Egyptian Prime Minister to undermine our position underthe Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936. The two specific questions nowat issue were (i) the right of British Service vehicles to exemption from civil registration in Egypt; and (ii) the right of British troops to travel in uniform through Egypt to and from- the Sudan. these rights were of great importance to the Services, but the cabinet would also wish to weigh the risk that, if we sought to enforcethem, we might precipitate widespread disturbances involvingattacks on British lives and property.The Prime Minister said that, while a firm stand must be madesooner or later, it was important that we should choose the groundwith care. On the first point, our legal position was strong, butit was scarcely important enough to warrant drastic action. Thesecond point was more important, but on this our Treaty rights werenot equally clear.The Cabinet were informed that the Chiefs of Staff had con-sidered the Foreign Secretary&apos;s telegram. In their view freedomof movement for Service vehicles between the Canal Zone and theDelta was an essential defence requirement. The movement ofBritish troops in uniform between the Sudan and the Canal Zonewas not essential; but the use of alternative routes would be incon-venient and. expensive and might, in an emergency, delay the reinforcement of Cyrenaica or the Sudan. It was for the Cabinetto decide, on political grounds, when a stand should be made against these encroachments on our Treaty rights; but the Chiefs of staff would like to have advance notice so that the necessary forces couldbe made available to handle the resulting situation. The troops now available in the Middle East could enforce the two specificrights in question; but, if serious disturbances fallowed, they wouldnot be sufficient to protect British lives and property and also toretain the initiative in Palestine. The First Armoured division would, however, be transferred shortly from Italy to Palestine toreplace the Third Armoured Division; and, while both these divisions were in the Middle East, we should be in an exceptionallystrong position.The Minister of State said that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in cairo had been instructed on 17th April to inform the EgyptianPrime Minister of the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government regarding their legal position on both the questions at issue under the Treatyof 1936. He suggested that the Cabinet might defer further discus-sion of this question until the results of this approach were known.The Cabinet Agreed to resume discussion of this question at their next meeting.2. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that the UnitedStates Government might make difficulties over our trade in arma-ments with South American countries. It was to our interest tosecure or retain an equitable share in this trade, so as to earn hard currency and to establish enduring markets for the output of ourarmament and aircraft factories. Our efforts might, however, be resented by the United States Government, who seemed to be out to secure a monopoly of this trade and might, for political reasons,take particular objection to our selling arms to the argentine government. We, on the other hand, had special grounds fordeclining to put an embargo on the supply of arms to the Argentine :we were dependent on her good will for essential food supplies,and her requirements for some years, especially for her naval construction programme, would be very extensive. It was therefore[33524-2] b 2
Anglo-soviet treaty.(previous reference:CM. (47) 37thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (CP. (47) 129) covering the draft of the Anglo-soviet treaty which had been communicated to the Soviet Government.The Foreign Secretary had decided, on reflection, that it would be inadvisable to extend the military Clauses on the lines discussed by the Cabinet on 17th April; and the draft communicated to theSoviet Government was within the limits of the authority given bythe Cabinet on 18th March.The Cabinet Took note of the position as set out in CP. (47) 129.Cyrenaica.(previous reference:CM, (46) 83rdConclusions,Minute 4.)memorandumby the Secretary(CP. (47) 126) on the future administration of4.   Theof State for WarCyrenaica.The Secretary of State for War said that the Departmentsconcerned had reached agreement on the recommendations of theworking party sent out to Cyrenaica last winter to draw up a plan for associating local Arabs with the Administration and forfurthering the economic reconstruction of the territory. Since his paper had been circulated, it had been agreed that an AdvisoryCouncil should be established without delay, subject to furtherconsideration of its constitution; and the Commander-in-Chief,Middle East Land Forces, had been informed accordingly.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said, with referenceto paragraph 4 of CP. f47) 126, that he wou Id give all the help hecould in providing staff from the Colonial Service. Some of theofficers seconded from the Colonial Service to Cyrenaica were,however, disturbed at losing opportunities of promotion in their service, and he hoped that paragraph 4 (a) would not be interpretedtoo rigidly. The point was also made that the possibility shouldbe fully explored of securing for employment in Cyrenaica officersof the Indian and Burma Services whose appointments might be terminated on the transfer of power.In further discussion the question was raised whether a public statement should now be made of the future intentions of HisMajesty&apos;s Government towards Cyrenaica, The Cabinet consideredthat it would be inexpedient that such a statement should be madeat the present time, though the Departments might with advantageconsider what form such a statement might take when the time came to make it.proposed to instruct His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington toexplain our attitude frankly to the United States Government andto suggest that the two Governments should examine together the arms requirements of South America. He would make it clear that,meanwhile, British firms would continue to be free to tender forthe supply of armaments to the Argentine.The Foreign Secretary thought it possible that, if we took this line, the United States Government might complain of it in negotia-tions which other Ministers had to conduct, e.g., on matters of foodor finance; and he therefore sought the concurrence of his colleagues in the line which he proposed to take.Agreed that, notwithstanding the risk of objection by theUnited States Government, British firms should be free to tender for the supply of armaments to the Argentine;and approved the instructions which the Foreign secretary proposed to send to this Majesty&apos;s Ambassador atWashington on this question.
4^9JL 8 6The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the recommendations made in OP. (47) 126 onthe future administration of Cyrenaica;(2) Invited the Secretary of State for War to arrange for his department, in consultation with the Foreign Office andthe Colonial Office, to decide by what means publicity should be given locally to the measures proposed forassociating local Arabs with the present administrationof Cyrenaica and for furthering the economic recon-struction of the territory;T-i-k-rr-i i-s\iA    -t-T-Vi-w   TV/T-i -r\t of ah   r\     G 4- n -t- s\   4-1-\    rt -rt-nn v\ rfn    -P^\-n   4-lTi CJ*T!J.J-l V ItCU    UllXs   JLTJLXXXXOL/CJ-    VAX    KJ VCh UC    U\J    GDX X OtXXgl^    JLXJA.

(47) 37thConclusions,Minute 6.).16 IP so, JUJ\   A&apos; OUUs    OOtXKJ.lJXi.ail,Cabinet&apos;s decision of 17th April, he had discussed with represen-tatives of the millers what measures might be taken to safeguard the distribution of flour during the next six weeks, While they agreed that some action must be taken to avert the risk of localbread shortages, they were strongly opposed to the proposal thatthey should restrict deliveries of flour to bakers to a percentage ofrecent orders. They maintained that, if this were done, bakerswhose stocks were low would be unable to honour the ration and difficulties would arise in holiday towns, where there would be a seasonal increase in demand during the next few weeks. they believed that the best way of meeting the situation would be toraise the extraction rate to 90 per cent, for about six weeks; andthey had suggested that, in order to mitigate the deterioration inthe quality of bread, an additional 5 per cent, of imported flourof 72 per cent, extraction should be mixed in the grist. Thisproposal would save 10,000 tons of wheat a week and would inducebakers who had ample stocks of 85 per cent, extraction flour todraw on those stocks. The Minister repeated his assurance thatthis change in the extraction rate could be made without endangering the supplies of animal feeding-stuffs.ion it was again pen)printed out that, even thoughsufficient supplies of feeding-stuffs were in fact available, a decisionto increase the extraction rate would undoubtedly shake theconfidence of farmers in the ability of the Government to maintainthe animal feeding-stuffs ration. It would also be difficult toexplain why the situation was not being met by an adjustment ofthe bread ration, which had been justified as an instrument to enableconsumption to be reduced during critical periods. It was alsourged that the objections raised by the millers to the proposal fora percentage reduction in deliveries of flour to bakers were notlUOU^JOictuio   OrlJJVj.:    vlrcbu    uiio    -LrjLi-nioiJA yT?---J      --,U    ,,,,,,,---[3352particular bakers to receive additional supplies of flour if they hadno reserve stocks or needed extra supplies to meet a higher demand,s.g., in holiday areas. If such a scheme were devised, and if effectivesteps were taken to explain both to the public and to the bakers theneed for economy in the consumption of flour during the next six weeks, it should be possible to overcome the difficulties of this period.The Minister of Food said that the situation would not, in his view, justify reducing the bread ration and he still felt that itwould be preferable to raise the extraction rate. It would bedifficult to impose on the millers the responsibility of discriminatingbetween one baker and another; and, if a scheme on the lines suggested in discussion were adopted, it would probably be necessaryfor the Ministry of Food to certify those cases in which a bakershould receive more than 95 per cent, of his orders during recent-weeks. He would, of course, do his best to ensure that such a2] b 3
scheme worked successfully, but be felt bound to warn his colleagues that there was a serious risk that some bakers would not have enough flour to enable them to supply the rations to Which their customers were entitled.The Cabinet-(1) Reaffirmed their decision that no increase should be madein the extraction rate of flour;(2) Invited the Minister of Food to arrange for a percentagereduction in the deliveries of flour to bakers sufficientto restrict the total weekly off take of flour to the amount required to meet the ration, provided, that any individualbaker who for good reasons was unable on the basis ofthe reduced delivery to meet the demands made on himshould be entitled to an additional supply of flour;(3) Agreed that the Minister of Food should announce the steps which were being taken to meet the situation, making itclear that the total quantity of flour which was being issued was enough to honour the ration, and inviting thepublic and the bakers, and particularly those who hadaccumulated stocks of flour, to co-operate in reducingthe off take of flour to a minimum during the next six weeks.Man-Power.Civil ServiceStaffs.(previous reference-.CM. (47) 26thConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Cabinet had before them a report (CP. (47) 121) fromthe Committee on Civil Service Man-Power.The Home Secretary said that he and his colleagues on theCommittee were disappointed at the results which they had so farachieved. They had not been able to secure any gross reduction inCivil Service staffs: indeed, the total numbers in the Civil service were likely to rise from 722,000 on 1st January, 1947, to 740,000in April 1948, after which numbers would decline to some 650,000unless new duties were imposed. The Committee had, however, been satisfied that the present strength of the Civil Service was barelyadequate to discharge efficiently the duties arising from government policy; and that no. drastic reductions could be expected unless theGovernment were prepared to abandon some existing services, e.g.,in the field of rationing&quot; and controls, or to postpone the introductionof new policies. Man-power savings secured by either of thesemeans would be very dearly bought and were not recommended bythe Committee. Ministers should be prepared to defend themaintenance of Government staffs sufficient to carry out government policy; and the Civil Service was entitled to look to Ministers todefend them against the criticism that they were parasites on thecommunity. The Committee appreciated the statement on this point which had recently been made by the Prime Minister in replying to a Parliamentary Question; and they recommended that thisshould now bo followed up by a fuller &apos;statenlent making it clearthat Civil Service staffs were not inflated in relation to the tasks which they had to discharge and presenting a picture of theessential activities in which the Service was engaged.The Home; Secretary added that the present trend of Govern-ment policy involved accretions to Civil Service strengths which didnot represent any transfer from productive to non-productive work,e.g., the transfer to Government service of staffs previously employedby approved societies and County War Agricultural ExecutiveCommittees.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in general agreementwith the view that no substantial reduction in Civil Service staffscould be expected while rationing and other war-time controls hadto be continued and new administrative tasks had to be undertaken in pursuance of Government policy. It was also agreed that ministers should be prepared in these circumstances to explain the nature of the tasks which the Civil Service was undertaking and
to defend it against unwarranted criticism. The Prime minister unertook to make a public statement on the lines recommended inparagraph 16 of CP. (47) 121.In discussion of the Report the following points were made : (a) Could further staff economies be secured by the introductionof more efficient methods of work?The Cabinet were informed that the Committee had considered this possibility, and had heard the Director of the Organisation andMetliods Division of the Treasury. They were satisfied that good progress was being made, through the experts in Organisation and methods in the Departments and in the Treasury, in introducingimproved methods of working. This policy had already yieldeduseful results in staff economies and would continue to do so.(b) Could numbers be reduced if there were greater readiness to devolve responsibility for taking decisions?The Cabinet were informed that there was room for moredevolution of responsibility, and this would come as temporary staff were gradually replaced by the better qualified permanent officers who were now being recruited. But the immediate effect would beto speed up output rather than reduce the numbers employed.(c) ,The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that the Com-mittee had been invited (CP. (46) 431; paragraph 3) to considerthe &quot;Foreign Service as well as the Home Civil Service. Their report-made no reference to the Foreign Service.The Cabinet were informed that the present report was basedon a survey of 22 of the larger Departments comprising 90 per cent,of the total staff. The number of home-based Foreign Service officers was relatively small. The Treasury and Foreign Office were examining the expenditure and the numbers employed in the foreign service abroad.(d) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was not satisfied with the staff reductions achieved by the Service Depart-ments. He drew particular attention to the fact that the civilstaffs in the War Office were expected to show an actual increase overthe period April to October 1947.The Minister of Defence said that this increase was due tothe substitution of civilians for uniformed staff in the service departments, which Was a measure of economy; and the threeoervioe jjepaixmeiits inaa in lact secure a a neu Sb&amp;tt reduction oi42,000 from their war-time peak by 1st January, 1947.(e) Was sufficient care being taken to secure due economy inthe departmental staffs in the regions ? There was danger ofduplication between the regional staff and the headquarters staff ofa particular Department, and also of overlapping between the regional staffs of different Departments.The Cabinet were informed that a special enquiry was beingmade into this question. It was suggested that this enquiry shouldalso cover the distribution of functions between the regional repre-sentatives of the various Departments; for it was unlikely that thefull possibilities of staff economy would be secured unless someregional staffs were empowered to act on behalf of more than one department.(/) The Chancellor of the Excheguer asked whether the Com-mittee had fully explored the possibility that the Ministry ofNational Insurance might carry out its local work in certain areasthrough the existing offices of the Ministry of Labour.The Cabinet were informed that this possibility had been carefully considered; but throughout the country there were only18 Labour Exchanges which had sufficient accommodation to enablethem to transact this additional business. Elsewhere, it wouldhave been necessary for the Ministry of Labour to take over supple-mentary premises or to enlarge their existing buildings. The first of these alternatives would have precluded any substantial saving in man-power : the second would have involved building operations which could not be undertaken at the present time.
(g) The Committee had recommended (paragraph 10 (a) 0fCP. (47) 121) that the local and regional organisations of the Assis-tance Board should be merged under the Ministry of national insurance network. The Minister of National Insurance said that,if effect was to be given to this recommendation, it was important that it should be done in such a way as to preserve the independence of the Assistance Board. An issue of policy was involved hereon which he proposed to seek the advice of the Social services committee.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the report (CP. (47) 121) of the Civil ServiceMan-jfower Committee;(2) Invited the Prime Minister to make a public statement about the work of the Civil Service on the lines suggestedin paragraph 16 of CP. (47) 121;(3) Took note that the Minister of National Insurance would refer to the Social Services Committee the question ofoolicy arising from the recommendation, in para-graph 10 (a) of CP. (47) 121, that the local and regional organisations of the Assistance Board should be mergedunder the Ministry of National Insurance network;(4) Invited the Committee on Socialisation of Industries toconsider the suggestion, in paragraph 12 of CP. (47) 121,that an investigation should be made into the growth of clerical and administrative staffs of public Boards;(5) Invited the Civil Service Man-Power Committee tocontinue their review of the position and to consider thepoints raised in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion, particularly those noted in paragraphs (c) and (e) above; and invited the Committee to submit a further report to the cabinet at a reasonably early date.Civil.Aviation.CivilAircraftBsc, uir exnents.(previous reference:CM. (47) 37thConclusions,Minute 2.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs (CP. (47) 134) reporting the views of the Civil Aviation Committee on a proposal that additional Constellation aircraft should be purchased from theUnited States for the use of B.O.A.C. on the main Empire routes toAustralia and South Africa and on the North Atlantic route.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that, theproposal was that nine Constellation II aircraft should be purchasedand re-engined with British Centaurus engines. This was putforward on the ground that the Tudor aircraft had failed to come up to expectations : the Tudor II could not be used on the australian and South African routes, and the range of the Tudor I was insufficient for the North Atlantic route. The Committee&apos;s view was that, in the interests of the British aircraft industry, it wouldbe inadvisable to adopt the proposal and that the right course wasto rely on interim British types until the Brabazon I and other new types came into operation. Meanwhile, everything possible shouldbe done to improve these interim types and to produce the newhi, ZtJLr!ff!\0f Cw*t VTion said ^ main reason forgfSS to enable B.O.A.C. to play a proper part in theKHft Empire air routes to Australia and South Africa.TudbfS ^MM^ Constellation aircraft in preference to thereW lln A n Afncans Tere usinS American Skymasters.miSnl L  W,,\t0 rely OD Tudor ^aircraft, it would beAfrTcanroi t0 coUabFate with the Australian and SouthmeZrTJF 0 ki 0Peratl^ these routes.

Cabinet Office. S.W. 1,22nd April, 1947to purchase Constellation aircraft they would have to rely on existing British types, which could only be run at a heavy loss, untilthe advanced new British types now under development became available. It would be unwise to assume that these new types wouldbe in operation before the end of 1952 and, unless we were preparedto face drastic cuts in the services provided by B.O.A.C. on theEmpire routes, it would be necessary to ask Parliament to authorisean increase in the statutory limit on the subsidies payable to thecivil aviation Corporations. This would discredit the government&apos;s policy in bringing civil aviation under public ownership and mightwell lead to a- demand, which it would be difficult to resist, for apublic enquiry into the efficiency of the Corporations. The issue which the&quot;Cabinet had to decide was whether they should accept a loss of prestige by the British aircraft industry through the extended use of American aircraft by British airways corporations;or whether British civil aviation should suffer a loss of prestigethrough inability to maintain an efficient competitive service onthe Empire routes and the North iitlantic. In weighing these alter-natives, he asked the Cabinet to bear in mind the ultimate damage which the British aircraft industry would suffer if, throughcontinuing to operate with obsolete or obsolescent types of british aircraft. British civil aviation lost its competitive position beforethe new British types&apos; of aircraft became available.The Minister of Supply said that there had been no undue delay in the production of Tudor aircraft. Nor had they failed to come up to specification : it was the additional fittings demanded by the operating Corporations which had resulted in the reduction intheir range and payload. The real difficulty on the Empire routeswas the failure to provide a suitable ground organisation; and hewas convinced that it would be better to operate these routes withLancastrian and York aircraft and with flying boats until thenecessary ground organisation had been provided to enable Tudoraircraft, to be used or until the new British types now under develop-ment became available. Any further purchase of United states aircraft would have a most adverse effect on the development of theBritish aircraft industry and on our export trade in aircraft.The Secretary of State for Air endorsed the views expressed bythe Minister of Supply. He believed that there was considerablescope for the development of flying boat services on the Empireroutes.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while the adoptionof either of the alternative proposals considered by the Civil aviation-tion Committee would impose a heavy charge on the Exchequer, he felt that the balance of argument was against the proposal topurchase additional United States aircraft as this would involve an immediate heavy expenditure of dollars without any certainty of recoupment.The Cabinet-(1) Rejected the proposal that additional Constellation aircraft should be purchased for use by B.O.A.C. on the mainEmpire and the North Atlantic routes;(2) Invited the Minister of Civil Aviation to take all possible steps to secure the most efficient operation of the mainEmpire services with existing British aircraft and topromote the development of the necessary groundorganisation to enable Tudor aircraft to be used onthese routes.
