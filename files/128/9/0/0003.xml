Goal and electricity.(previous reference erence:CM. (46) 100thConclusions,Minute 4.)The Cabinet had before them the following memorandadealing with coal and electricity supplies : :CP (47) 6 by the Minister of Fuel and Power;CP. (47) 15 by the Minister of Transport;CP. (47) 18 by the President of the Board of Trade; and cp. (47) 17 by the Lord President of the Council.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that, although coal production had risen steadily since the beginning of October, theestimates of consumption had been so far exceeded that a critical situation had arisen. Thus, the average consumption of coal for electricity during the summer of 1946 had been 446,000 tons a week,as against an estimate of 415,000 tons; and the average consumptionduring the winter period had been 607,000 tons a week as against an estimate of 557,000 tons and an actual consumption of514,000 tons in the winter of 1945. On present trends of eonsump-tion, it would be necessary to increase deliveries of coal to power stations by 50,000 tons a week for the next six weeks in order tokeep them in production. It would not be safe to rely on a total output of more than 3,600,000 tons of deep-mined coal and120,000 tons of opencast coal a week during this period, and heestimated that 8,270,000 tons of this would be required to meet theneeds of public utilities, essential industries such as iron and steel,railways, bunkers and domestic consumption, leaving for generalindustrial consumption only 450,000 tons a week against a totalrequirement of about 760,000 tons. It was therefore essential thatthe coal allocations for industry should be revised. He was ingeneral agreement with the proposals for this purpose which wereoutlined in CP. (47) 18.The situation would be eased if more drastic steps could betaken to give a higher priority for the transport of coal, both byroad and by rail. The Coal Committee had discussed this aspect of the problem on the previous day, and their recommendations would be reported to the Cabinet by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.Even though ample supplies of coal were available it would beimpossible to meet the increased demands for electricity for lackof generating plant. It was estimated that in the present winterthere would be a deficiency of 1-2 million kilowatts, which would rise to 1-7 million kilowatts in the winter of 1947-48 and to1-8 million kilowatts in the winter of 1948^49. It would not bepossible to meet demand in full before 1950. He therefore consideredthat restrictions should be imposed on the supply and installation of machinery and appliances using electricity for power, heatingor cooking, and that there should be some check on the consumptionof existing machinery and appliances, both industrial and domestic.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Coal Committeehad considered Cr. (47) 6 and CP. (47) 15 on the previous day.theview that it would be necessary to increasedeliveries of coal to power stations at the expense of industry. they felt, however, that the alternative, mentioned in paragraph 8 (2) of cp. (47) 6, of enabling power stations to cut off the supply ofelectricity to specified works for specified times, should also be pursued.With regard to the suggestion of an overriding priority for themovement of coal, corresponding to the priority given to militarytraffic before D-Day, the Committee had felt that such an unquali-fied priority might do more harm than good by interfering with the deliveries of other essential supplies. They had, however, agreedto submit the following recommendations : (i) The movement of commodities, such as iron ore, whichcompeted with coal should be delayed wherever therewere adequate stocks in the hands of the consignees,(ii) Save in exceptional cases, the movement of surplus Govern-ment stores should be stopped for a period of a month,(iii) All road haulage vehicles which could be used for coaltransport should be made available for this purpose.
(irv) Where road vehicles were used, they should not be requiredto travel long distances; opencast.coal should be delivered to nearby consumers,(v) As much coal as possible should be carried by sea, and theMinistry of Fuel and Power should discuss with theTreasury means of overcoming any difficulties arisingfrom the additional cost.(vi) The Minister of Supply should take immediate steps tobring to the channel ports 28 austerity locomotives nowin Europe, in order that the Minister of Transport mighthave them conveyed to this country.(vii) The possibility of diverting capacity now used for themanufacture of locomotives1 and wagons for export tothe repair of locomotives and wagons for British nail-ways should be further examined,(viii) Until further notice no special trains should be madeavailable for sporting events,(ix) There should be an urgent examination of the problem of reducing the amount of coal in transit; and the Ministerof Labour and the Minister of Transport should, inparticular, consider what steps might be taken to reduceabsenteeism by railway workers and to induce them towork overtime to clear traffic congestion.The Coal Committee had also considered the suggestions of theMinister of Fuel and Power for limiting the consumption ofelectricity, and they made the following recommendations :  (x) The production of machinery and appliances usingelectricity for domestic purposes should be diverted fromthe home to the export market.(xi) The possibility should be examined of dealing with the salein the home market of electrical machinery and appliances for industrial purposes.(xii) The question of introducing a scheme for  rationingdomestic electricity consumption should be examined asa matter of urgency.The President of the Board of Trade said that his proposals in cp. (47) 18 were designed to meet the inequality in the availability of coal in the different regions. In the North-West region thesituation was very serious, and in the Midlands deliveries had fallen to about 50 per cent, of requirements; but in the North-East therehad been little difficulty, and elsewhere deliveries had been running at about 75 per cent, of requirements. He therefore recommendedan over-all cut of about 40 per cent, in all industries, apart fromiron and steel and coke ovens, for which the cut might be from17t?-2Q per cent. This would provide a reserve which could be allocated among the several regions and distributed within eachby the Regional Fuel Allocation Committee according to the special needs of the individual firms in the region. Cuts could not be madeindustry by industry, and in order to provide the necessaryflexibility the Committees roust be given power to distribute theavailable coal according to the circumstances of individual firms.The Committees must be given some guidance on priorities, and hesuggested that the Lord Presidents Committee should be empoweredto approve a revised list of priorities, which would have regard both to the importance of the products and to the importance of avoidingwholesale unemployment in industries using a small quantity of fuel. If such a scheme were adopted, industrialists would be ableto plan ahead with a reasonable degree of certainty.^ As regards the industrial consumption of electricity, it wouldbe impossible for power stations to make selective cuts as between one firm and another, and he therefore deprecated the solutionproposed in paragraph 8 (2) of CP. (47) 6. He suggested as analternative that firms should be directed to ensure that theirmonthly consumption of gas and electricity was reduced by a largerpercentage of their November consumption. He also deprecated theproposal that the supply and installation of machinery and32993-3 b 2
appliances using electricity for industrial purposes should belimited, since this would be a retrograde step and it would often beimpossible for firms to obtain alternative equipment using otherfuel.The Lord President said that for the short term he favouredadhering to the scheme for the distribution of fuel supplies whichhad been agreed with the National Production Advisory council for Industry. This scheme, however, did not effectively restrain theconsumption of electricity, and he suggested that it might be advisable to impose a penal fiat rate surcharge on consumption inexcess of the amount consumed in a suitable base period. Lookingahead, it was essential that all possible effort should be made toavoid a recurrence of the present crisis. Steps must be taken tosecure an output of coal adequate both for home consumption andfor some restoration of the export trade. The possibility of devisinga new wage structure which would give miners an incentive to higher production should also be explored, and immediate steps should be taken to employ foreign labour in the mines. Jtie under-stood that the National Union of Mine Workers were about to confer with the Trades Union Congress on this subject, and he thought itdesirable that the Trades Union Congress should be authoritativelyinformed of the Governments views. The Coal Committee shouldbe asked to review urgently the estimated supply requirements ofcoal for the next few years and to examine various measures toincrease production. On the question of electricity generation, he did not see how the Cabinet could accept an estimated deficiency of 1-8 million kilowatts as late as 1949, and he suggested that theMinisters of Fuel and Power and Supply should, as a matter of urgency, consider what measures could be taken to increase the effective capacity of the electricity system.In discussion of the proposal made in CP. (47) 18 by thePresident of the Board of Trade, the following points arise : *(a) The Minister of Supply supported these proposals.(b) The Minister of Health suggested that any action to reducedeliveries on the scale proposed would lead to widespread unemploy-ment and solution of the problem should rather be sought by taking every possible step to increase the output of coal and to distribute it more efficiently.(c) The Foreign Secretary said that, while he agreed that itwould be necessary to reallocate the available supplies amongindustries, he felt that in announcing this decision it was important that emphasis should be laid on the need for revised allocationsrather than percentage cuts on existing allocations. There was general support for this view.(d) The Minister of Works said that, while he did not dissent from the proposal, he hoped that the principle would be preservedof giving special treatment to firms engaged in the production of essential building materials, such as bricks and glass.In discussion of the proposals in CP. (47) 6, CP. (47) 17 and cp. (47) 18 for limiting the consumption of electricity, thefollowing points arose :- -(e) There was general agreement that it would be undesirable for the present to impose any further restrictions on the consump-tion of electricity for industrial purposes; or to limit the supplyand installation of electrical machinery or appliances for industrialuse.(/) It was pointed out that an absolute prohibition on the saleof electrical appliances for domestic purposes would mean that itwould be impossible to provide cooking and heating facilities insome new houses. It was also urged that to a large extent the useof electrical appliances enabled economies to be made in theconsumption of domestic coal.
(a) The Minister of Health urged that all possible steps shouldhe taken by way of propaganda, including in particular broadcastappeals at frequent intervals, to encourage domestic consumers ofelectricity to avoid consumption during peak hours.Other points in discussion were:-(h) The Minister of Labour said that he had been considering whether, as a means of reducing the industrial consumption of fuelwithout creating unemployment, encouragement should be givento firms to adopt a five-day working week. It was pointed out thatthis would involve an increase in the industrial consumption ofelectricity at peak periods, and might also lead to a drop in produc-tion generally. For these reasons, it was the view of the Cabinetthat this suggestion should not be pursued.(i) The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the lord president had suggested &quot;in CP. (47) 17 the possibility of importingcoal into the United Kingdom as a temporary expedient. Any such proposal would be strongly opposed by the European Coal Organisa-tion. The United States were already behindhand in theirdeliveries to Europe. Imports from South Africa would be extremely expensive.(j) The Minister of Labour informed the Cabinet that con-siderable progress had been made in securing agreement to the useof Polish labour in industries other than coalmining, and he had had an encouraging meeting with the National Coal Board and theNational Union of Mineworkers on the use of Polish labour in coal-mining. The National Union of Mineworkers were to meet theTrades Union Congress on 16th January to discuss this matter andhe would arrange to put the Government&apos;s views to the TradesUnion Congress before this meeting.(k) The Secretary of State for Scotland pointed out that theNorth of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board had hoped to have beenin a position to supply 150,000 kilowatts to the Scottish industrial area in the winter of 1948. Unless, however, it were possible tomake available machinery from the United States and to give ahigher priority for the constructional needs of the Scottish hydro-electric schemes, it would be impossible to adhere to this programme.(/) The Minister of Defence undertook to take up with theFirst Lord of the Admiralty the question whether it might bepossible in particular areas to supplement the supply of electricityby the use of the generating capacity of submarines.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the arrangements for the supply of solid fuelto industrial firms should forthwith be revised on thelines proposed by the President of the Board of Tradein paragraph 4t of CP. (47) 18, with a view to thecreation of a reserve of coal which could be allocatedamong the several Regions and distributed by the regional Fuel Allocation Committees in each Regionamong individual firms. The new arrangements shouldbe presented as a new system of allocations, rather thana percentage cut on existing allocations.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to prepare and submit for the approval of the Lord President&apos;s Com-mittee draft instructions for the guidance of RegionalFuel Allocation Committees in discharging their taskunder (1) above.(8) Agreed that for the present deliveries of coal to power stations should be so increased, at the expense of deliveries to industry, as to ensure their continuedoperation.(4) Agreed that for the present no steps should be taken toimpose any further restrictions on the consumption of
gas and electricity for industrial purposes or to limit the installation of electrical machinery or appliances in industrial premises.(5) Invited the Coal Committee to arrange for officials of theDepartments concerned to consider, in the light of theCabinet&apos;s discussion, the possibility of securing econo-mies in the domestic consumption of electricity.(6) Approved in principle the suggestions (summarised in para-graphs (i) to (ix) above) made by the Coal Committee for improvements in the arrangements for the transport ofcoal and invited the Committee to arrange for the detailsof these proposals to be worked out by officials of theDepartments concerned.(7) Invited the Coal Committee to report what measures mightbe taken to secure an adequate output of coal over thenext three years.(8) Asked the Minister of Fuel and Power, in consultation withthe President of the Board of Trade and the Ministerof Supply, to examine and report to the Lord President&apos;sCommittee what steps could be taken to ensure a suffi-cient supply of electricity-generating plant over the next three years.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,7th January, 1947.
