43CM. 7 (m)Koad HaulageStrike.(previous reference:C.M.(47)6thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Minister of Labour informed the Cabinet of the latest developments in the strike of road haulage workers; and The HomeSecretary reported the measures approved by the IndustrialEmergencies Committee at their meeting on the previous day.In London the position had altered little, but at Tilbury docks and in certain provincial districts additional men had gone on strike and further extensions of the strike were thought to be imminent.For the moment^ the emergency transport arrangements wereproving sufficient. The Services could provide up to 4,480 lorrieswith drivers and a further 500 drivers&quot; without vehicles. Unlessfurther accommodation could be provided for the drivers, it wouldnot be possible to deploy more than about 2,000 of these lorries inLondon; but the Services had been instructed to mobilise theirvehicles at once and to await orders as to their use. If, however,the strike continued for much longer, or extended further, it wouldbecome necessary to appeal for volunteer drivers. Hitherto, it hadbeen possible to maintain reasonable supplies of food on the basisof deliveries at the rate of about 20,000 tons a week; but from17th January it would be necessary to move supplies at the rate ofabout 65,000 tons a week, owing to the need to resume deliveries of flour and potatoes. The movement of supplies at this higher rate would involve the use in London alone of all the 5,000 lorries whichcould be made available by the Services or manned by Service drivers.Moreover, it would become necessary to move by rail certain food supplies normally carried by road, and to clear stocks of food whichhad accumulated at the railheads and in the dbcks. Thus, from17th January onwards the need for enlisting the help of volunteerlabour would be increasingly felt.The Industrial Emergencies Committee had considered whatmachinery could be used for recruiting volunteer labour, if such acourse became necessary. They saw serious objection to the use ofEmployment Exchanges for this purpose, in view of the concilia-tion functions of the Ministry of Labour; and they had been unableto devise any satisfactory alternative method of obtaining volunteers.In the Cabinefs discussion, the suggestion was made that this might be done through the agency of local authorities. The cabinet recognised, however, that an official appeal for civilian volunteers to maintain essential services might well provoke a widespreadextension of the strike. This made it even more important that means should be found of securing the early termination of thestrike.The Minister of Labour said that the special delegate con-ference, which on the previous day had voted in favour of remainingon strike, was meeting at 2 p.m. in order that a further attemptmight be made to end the dispute. At this further meeting theGeneral Secretary of the Transport and General Workers union would inform the delegates that the Joint Industrial Council would meet at 5 p.m. on 16th January to consider the situation and totake advantage of any developments; that, when the Council startednegotiations, the Minister of Labour would use all his influence tosecure an early decision; and that if they failed to reach a settle-ment the Minister would take action under the Industrial CourtsActs.In view of the grave consequences which would ensue if thestrike continued, the Minister invited the Cabinet to consider :__(i) whether he should press the Joint Industrial Council to start negotiations even though the strikers had notresumed work; and(ii) whether he should move the Joint Industrial Council toask for the immediate appointment of a Court of Enquiry a fact-finding body which would report on such matters as whether there had been unreasonable delay in operating the negotiating machinery, what were theproposals made by the employers and what were thepresent conditions of employment in the industry.
The Cabinet considered that no useful result was likely to besecured by arranging at this stage to appoint a Court of enquiry to establish the facts. If, however, it were possible to inform the delegate conference that the Joint Industrial Council would startnegotiations at once, this might tip the scales in favour of a decisionto return to work. On the other hand, at a discussion which theMinister of Labour had held on the previous evening with repre-sentatives of the General Council of the Trades Union Congress, ithad been made clear that the Council would be opposed to any suchdeparture from the normal rule that negotiations should! not beginunti^ strikers had returned to work.in further discussion it was urged that, as the Transport andGeneral Workers Union had been given a full opportunity to persuade their members to return to work but had been unable todo so, and as the claims of the strikers were substantially sound, theGovernment would no longer be justified in refraining from asking the Joint Industrial Council to proceed to negotiate, even thoughthe strikers had not returned to work. This course would not be welcome to the Transport and General Workers Union or the TradesUnion Congress, and might tend to weaken the authority of theUnions; but the alternative of calling on civilian volunteers wouldbe even more damaging to the Unions.On the other hand, it was argued that to ask the Joint IndustrialCouncil to embark on negotiations even though the strikers had notreturned to work represented a complete reversal of policy and would1have very serious consequences. Moreover, there was no evidencethat the employers side of the Joint Industrial Council would be willing to negotiate before the men had resumed work. It wastherefore suggested that the right course was to allow the delegate conference to meet without sending them any further communication from the Government through the General Secretary of the Trans-port and General Workers Union; but to be prepared, if the con-f erence did not decide on an immediate resumption of work, to issue a proclamation under the Emergency Powers Act, 1920, declaring that a state of emergency existed. Once this proclamation had beenmade, the Government would have wide powers to make regulations and could, if they thought fit, take over the road haulage industry.This would lift the dispute on to a different plane, and would alsoenable the Government to offer reasonable conditions to the men, orto set up machinery for reaching a settlement of their claims, withoutfurther delay.The Minister of Transport said that the implications of makinga proclamation of emergency under the Act of 1920 should befurther examined. In particular, he foresaw serious difficulty inany attempt to take over the running of the road haulage industry.The Cabinet agreed that the Industrial Emergencies Committeeshould consider more fully the implications of making a proclama-tion under the Act of 1920; and that, if it were decided to take this step, the General Council of the Trades Union Congress should beinformed in advance. It might also be desirable that the PrimeMinister should broadcast an appeal to the strikers to resume workafter the proclamation had been made.The Cabinet&apos;s conclusions were (1) The delegate conference which was to be held later in theday should be allowed to proceed on the basis agreed on the previous day between the Minister of Labour andthe General Secretary of the Transport and general works Union.(2) The Industrial Emergencies Committee should meet at p.m. that day to consider (i) the implications of pro-claiming a state of emergency under the emergency powers Act, 1920, and (ii) what steps would be necessaryto provide adequate transport if the strike continued.The Lord Chancellor and the Service Ministers should attend this meeting.
45 CM. 7 (47)(3) If the results of the delegate conference were unfavourable,the Minister of Labour should inform the general council of the Trades Union Congress that the Govern-ment had it in mind to proclaim an emergency underthe Act of 1920.(4) The Minister of Transport and the Minister of Food should arrange for the immediate issue of a statement thattraders would be charged at normal civilian rates for transport undertaken by the Services on their behalf.2.   The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda : CP. (47) ?9: Note by the Lord President covering theEconomic Survey for 1947;CP. (47) 20 : Note by the Lord President covering a Reporton this Survey prepared by the Official Steering Committee onEconomic Development;CP. (47) 25 : Report made by the Ministerial Committeeon Economic Planning after considering the Economic survey and the Report of the Steering Committee;CP. (47) 29 : Memorandum by the Minister of Educationstating her objections to the proposal that the raising of theschool-leaving age should be postponed from April to September1947.In the Lord Presidents absence The President of the Board ofTrade presented to the Cabinet the findings of the Ministerial Coni-mittee on Economic Planning. He said that the papers before theCabinet disclosed a great and increasing gap between our require-ments and our productive resources. It was clear that we were trying to do too many things at once, and the general shortage oflabour was getting worse. It was therefore essential that theGovernment should consider what requirements could be curtailedor postponed. Apart from the inflationary risks of a general excessof demand over supply, we were faced with special difficulties overour balance of payments. There would be great difficulty in achieving the target, already approved by the Cabinet, that in thesecond half of 1947 we should export a volume of goods 50 per cent,greater than that which we had exported before the war. It might become necessary to divert to the export market consumer goods and capital goods which were urgently required at home.The President proceeded to summarise the main recommenda-tions made in the Report of the Ministerial Committee for remedy-ing the situation disclosed by the Economic Survey, and he outlined the principal arguments in favour of the various measures recommended.The President stressed the point that these measures represented a concerted plan for closing the gap between requirements and productive resources; that they were to some extent interdependent;and that the gap would not be fully closed unless all the measures recommended were adopted. If, however, the Cabinet endorsed allthe Committee&apos;s proposals, there was a reasonable prospect thatserious economic dislocation in 1947 might be avoided.In conclusion, the President called attention to the recommenda-tion made in paragraphs 54 and 55 of CP. (47) 25 that a white paper based on the Report should be presented to Parliament witha view to a debate on economic affairs in the second half of February.If this time-table was to be kept and it was important that this general debate should be held in advance of the introduction of theBudget it was necessary that the Cabinet should reach early decisions on the issues raised by the Report, so that the drafting ofthe White Paper could proceed.The Cabinet Agreed to meet again later in the. day to discuss the issues raised by the Economic Survey for 1947.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,l$th January, 1947.
