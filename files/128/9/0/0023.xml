1. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of the latest developments in the constitutional position in India.The Cabinet&apos;s discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of Cabinet Conclusions.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Air (CP. (47) 57) recommending that legis-lation should be introduced to validate retrospectively marriagessolemnised by Naval and Air Force Chaplains outside the UnitedKingdom, and to make certain minor amendments of the ForeignMarriage Act, 1892.It was explained that when this recommendation had beenmade to the Legislation Committee the Lord Chancellor had pointedout that the retrospective validation of such marriages might, ifthe parties had subsequently married, have the result that these latermarriages would become bigamous. The Lord Chancellor now, how-ever, agreed that the proposed amendment of the law should bemade: and the other Ministers concerned had approved the pro-visions which were to be included in the Bill, details of which weregiven in the Annex to CP. (47) 57.The following points were raised in discussion :. -(a) It was proposed that power should be taken to define byOrder in Council to what extent civilian employees in the services or other persons in His Majesty&apos;s service were to be covered by theprovisions relating to the validation of marriages solemnised by naval and Air Force Chaplains. This would enable the provisions to be applied to marriages contracted by members of the staff ofthe Control Commission in Germany and Austria.(b) There was no assurance that Parliamentary time could befound for the proposed Bill in the 1946-47 Session, but it might bepossible to secure its passage if it could be introduced in the Houseof Lords before the end of March.The Cabinet-Approved the preparation of a Bill to amend the ForeignMarriage Act, 1892, on the lines indicated in the annex to CP. (47) 57, and invited the Secretary of State for air to submit the draft Bill to the Legislation Committee intime to enable it to be introduced in the House of lords in March.3. The Foreign Secretary said that he had now received fromGeneral Marshall, the United States Secretary of State, a messageabout the Governments decision to refer the Palestine problem tothe United Nations. General Marshall was concerned about thefurther delay involved in waiting to submit this issue to the Genera]Assembly in September, and had asked whether in might not beconsidered earlier by the Trusteeship Council. The foreign secretary had been advised that the Trusteeship Council would notbe competent to discuss the matter, as Palestine was not the subjectof a Trusteeship Agreement. He had, however, decided, in viewof General Marshall&apos;s representations, that in the announcement tobe made in Parliament that afternoon he would avoid specific reference to the General Assembly and say merely that the matter was to be submitted to the United Nations. He could then continueto consider possible means of getting the matter discussed by theUnited Nations before September.General Marshall had also asked whether the rate of jewish immigration into Palestine could not be increased in the interim period before the judgment of the United Nations was given.   On
Foreign Secretary thought it inexpedient to hold outltms poiiib wrc      ^poent t&apos;me.   If the United States Government I^E^cancession^hould be made to the Jews,the? S3 consider what pressure they could bring to bear tosecure the acquiescence of the Arao btates.The Minister&apos; of Health said that as there was now to he asubstantial further delay before a final settlement was reached hethoS it right that the rate of Jewish immigration should%\incSed in the interim period. If some such concession were made,Se Jewisn Agency would find it easier to give effective co-operation jin cheSng both terrorism and illegal immigration.JL fVty   hJWI KjVVUt If-one of several questions which he would have to ask the Cabinet toconsider regarding the administration of Palestine in the interim period before the judgment of the United Nations was given. Heuntil he had been able to submit considered recommendations formu-lated in the light of the representations which would be made afterthe announcement of the Governments decision to submit the issue to the United Nations.The Cabinet Took note that the Secretary of State for the Color.!!would submit a memorandum on the rate of Jewish jimmigration and other issues affecting the administrationof Palestine during the interim period before any final]settlement of long-term policy in respect of Palestine was jreached by the United Nations.Coa1, 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theInducements; Minister of Food (CP. (47) 61) proposing that miners should receivefor Coal additional rations of sugar and fat and extra food points, and thatMiners. consideration should be given to other measures, including the pay-(Previous       ment of higher wages, to increase the attractiveness of the coal-Reference:      mining industry.C.M.(46)85th The Minister of Food said that the concessions proposed would conclusions, mean an increase of only about \ per cent, in the annual consumptionMinute 6.) 0f sugar and fat and thatthere would be no difficulty in supplying the extra points foods. Fie recognised that there might be some com-plaints if these concessions wrere confined to the mining industry,but he believed that in present circumstances there would be general support for his proposals.The Minister of Fuel and power  said that he did not believethat these concessions would have the effect either of attractingadditional recruits to the mining industry or of increasing the out-put of the existing labour force. As regards wages, the NationalUnion of Mineworkers had not so far made any claim, for higher wages, and any such claim should in the first instance be consideredby the National Coal Board. He was preparing a memorandumon the general question of coal production and he suggested that theproposals in CP. (47) 61 should be considered in conjunction witlthat memorandum.The Cabinet-Agreed that the proposals in CP. (47) 61 should be con-sidered in conjunction with the memorandum on theproblems of coal production which the Minister of fuel and Power was preparing.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,IBtfy February., 1947.
