Cyprus.(previous reference:O.M.(47)29thConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The Minister of State said that the documents which theUnited States State Department had made available to the ForeignAffairs Committee of the House of Representatives for the discus-sion of President Truman&apos;s proposals for financial- aid to greece and Turkey had included one containing a statement that- in certaincircumstances the United States Government would favour the cession of Cyprus to Greece. The State Department had now with-drawn this part of the document and had made it clear that it wasnot tJhe policy of the United States Government that Cyprus shouldbe ceded to Greece. The Cabinet might think it expedient thatsome authoritative statement about this should be issued in thiscountry: this would provide an opportunity for making it clearthat His Majesty&apos;s Government had no intention of ceding cyprus to Greece.It was the view of the Cabinet that it would be preferable thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government should not volunteer any statement onthis matter.Mid-WeekSport.DogRacecourseBetting(temporary provisions)Bill.(previous reference:C.M.(47)28thConclusions,Minute 6.)2. The Home Secretary said that he had found great difficultyin persuading the House of Commons to accept the Dog racecourse betting (Temporary Provisions) Bill, particularly as the Ministry of fuel and Power and other production Departments had been unableto provide him with definite evidence that the holding of dog-racingmeetings during the week involved the loss of industrial production.He had, therefore, felt obliged to promise that further consideration would be given to the possibility of amending the Bill in such away as to allow meetings to be held during the week in holidayresorts and other areas where it was clear that mid-week racingwould not interfere with industrial production. He had now con-sidered this point and was satisfied that some further flexibility wasin fact required.The Secretary of State for Scotland supported this view.The Cabinet-Agreed that, in the Committee Stage in the House of-Lords, a new Clause should be added to the Dog Race-course Betting (Temporary Provisions) Bill empowering the Secretary of State by order to exempt a particular area from all the provisions of the Bill, or so to vary thehours as to enable race meetings to be held earlier inthe day, if he were satisfied that such a relaxation wouldnot involve any substantial interference with industrial-production.tne Mouse ofCommons.3. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.On 31st March the Minister of Labour would move the Secondxteaamg oi tne ivactoruu oertnce nut. xne minister ox ueieacewould reply to the debate, which would be continued on 1st Apriluntil 7 p.m. Thereafter the Committee and remaining stages ofthe Trafalgar Estates Bill would be taken.On 2nd April the House would take the Report Stage and third Reading of the Cotton Industry Bill.On 3rd April, Questions would be taken at 11 a.m., and theHouse would adjourn for the Easter Recess until 15th April.The Cabinefs attention was drawn to the fact that a largenumber of Government supporters had put their names to a Motionurging the rejection of the Northern Ireland Bill on the ground thatthe Northern Ireland Parliament were failing to provide democraticliberty and equality for the people of Northern Ireland. It waspossible that the Speaker would rule that this amendment was out[33415-2] b 2
of order, on the ground that the Bill conferred no fresh powers onthe Government of Northern Ireland. This would not, however,prevent these Members from voting against the Second Reading ofthe Bill. 0Gold Coast. : 4.   The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the repeatedDeath delays in executing the sentences of death imposed on five men whoSentences.       had been convicted of murder in. the Gold Coast in December 1944.These executions had already been deferred on several occasions, byreason of appeals on legal grounds; and, on the previous day, after three of the men had been executed, notice had been given of inten-tion to petition the Privy Council for leave to appeal against theconvictions and the executions of the other two men had again been postponed.The Lord Chancellor said that the administration of criminla justice would be brought into disrepute if these inordinate delays in executing the sentences of the courts were allowed to continue.He was proposing, in consultation with the Secretary of State forthe Colonies, to submit a memorandum on this matter for theCabinet&apos;s consideration.Reference was also made to the Speaker&apos;s ruling that this wasnot a matter which could be discussed in the House of Commons.Was it right that Parliament should be precluded from discussingquestions affecting the liberty of the subject in British territoryoverseas? The Home Secretary said that it was a long-establishedrule that the advice tendered to His Majesty regarding the exerciseof the prerogative of mercy could not be called in question by Parlia-ment. The Cabinet asked that this point should also be covered inthe memorandum which was to be submitted to them.Divorce.(previous reference:CM. (46) 95thConclusions,Minute 3.)ReconciliationMachinery.5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordVviiauceilOr (o.jt. [Qi) xuxj Oil uie leCOmuieiiuanuuS auutlo rcuOiiCilla-tion machinery in the Final Report of the Denning Committee on procedure in Matrimonial Causes (Cmd. 7024).The Lord Chancellor said that in a debate in the House of lords on 27th March the Government would be asked whether they pro-posed to give effect to these recommendations. The Committee had assumed that most of their proposals could be implemented without legislation, but it was doubtful whether that assumption was justified. The Lord Chancellor therefore proposed to take a some-what cautious line, in replying to the debate, about the extent towhich effect would be given to all these recommendations. He pro-posed, however, to indicate sympathy with the objects of the Cont-mittee&apos;s recommendations and general agreement with their lineof approach to the problem. He would say that the Governmentwould be ready to make a start on these lines but must be free tojUUge, in me ngnt ox cxp^rienco, uvw x-ctpiu.xy vxks cxpci 011*01^be extended.The Cabinet-Approved the Lord Chancellor&apos;s proposals, as set out in cp. (47) 101 and summarised above, regarding the line to be taken in the forthcoming debate in the House of Lordsregarding the recommendations made in the Final Reportof the Denning Committee on the establishment ofmachinery for reconciliation in matrimonial causes.
CM. 32 (47)Coal.Domestic FuelRationing.(previous reference:CM. (47) 17thConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of fuel and Power (CP. (47) 103) outlining a scheme for rationingthe domestic consumption of gas and electricity.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that it was proposed thatthe Governments intention to introduce a rationing scheme shouldbe announced in general terms on the lines of Annex I to CP.(47) 103. Discussions would then be opened with gas and electricityundertakers and local fuel overseers about the machinery needed tobring the scheme into operation. The essence of the scheme wasthat during the summer householders would be required to reduce their consumption of gas and electricity to the scale set out in annex II to C.P. (4.7) 103, or to 50 per cent, of their consumptionfor the corresponding period of 1946, whichever was the greater.Since the scheme had been approved by the Fuel Committee, ithad been pointed out that there would be difficulty in proving forhold in a corresponding period of 1946, but he believed that means could be found of overcoming this difficulty. The proposed scheme should save from 1-f to 2 million tons of coal during the summer months.In discussion it was pointed out that the scale of consumptionproposed would impose severe hardships on most householders. Onthe other hand, any substantial increase in the scale would so reducethe saving in coal as to make it hardly worth while to introduce a rationing scheme at all. There would undoubtedly be very strongresentment of such drastic cuts and this, coupled with the fact that many householders owing to the intricacies of the scheme would be unable to keep a proper check on their consumption, would inevitably lead to a very large number of infringements. Even if 90 per cent,of householders achieved the prescribed reduction, this would mean that as many as 1 million would be liable to prosecution for breaking the law. It would obviously be impossible to prosecute so large a number, and proceedings would have to be confined to flagrantcases, viz., grossly excessive consumption or persistent failure to conform to the standard. Once, however, it was known that pro-ceedings would be taken only for such extreme departures from thestanclcild be bound to come out when the schemewas discussed in Parliament there would be a general disinclina-tion to comply strictly with the provisions of the scheme. The fact was that criminal sanctions could not successfully be applied toenforce a law which lacked the support of public opinion; and legal prohibitions which were widely disregarded were open to graveobjection as tending to breed disrespect for the law as a whole. Itwas suggested in paragraph 3 of CP. (47) 103 that 2,000 additional staff would be required for the administration of the proposed scheme, but it seemed likely that much larger numbers would be needed if the scheme was to be properly enforced. In these circum-stances, would it not be preferable to continue throughout the summer the existing restrictions on the consumption of electricitybetween certain hours and to impose similar restrictions on theconsumption of gas ? It was recognised that, owing to the difficultiesof enforcing these restrictions, reliance would have to be placed upon voluntary co-operation by householders, but it should bepossible to encourage this by a vigorous publicity campaigndesigned to bring home to householders the need for saving coal.It would also be possible, in cases of flagrant disregard of therestrictions, to take proceedings under the existing Order for theprevention of waste of fuel.The Prime Minister said that it seemed clear that the general view of the Cabinet was against proceeding with the scheme pro-posed in CP. (47) 103. He therefore suggested that the Ministerof Fuel and Power should submit to the Cabinet, for their con-sideration on 27th March, a statement explaining that the Govern-ment had reached the conclusion that any scheme of rationingaccording to a fixed scale of consumption would be extremely difficultto enforce and would make very heavy calls on man-power, and
that, for this reason, they proposed to continue throughout the summer months the existing restrictions on the consumption of -electricity between certain hours of the day and to extend these restrictions to the consumption of gas. The statement should alsostress the importance of securing the maximum savings in the domestic consumption of fuel in order to make fuel available for industry, and should call upon the public for their co-operation.The President of the Board of Trade drew attention to the gravity of the industrial situation. Unless enough coal could beobtained to rebuild stocks and to give industry something like100 per cent, of its requirements during the summer, there was a risk of a complete economic collapse. He did not believe that anything short of a scheme on the lines suggested in CP. (47) 103would achieve the savings in domestic consumption which were necessary to avert an industrial crisis.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power to circulate, forconsideration at their meeting on 27th March, a draft statement on the lines suggested by the Prime Minister.Coal.Imports fromthe UnitedStates.(previous reference:CM. (47) 31stConclusions.)Imports from south Africa.7. The Minister of Fuel and Power said that, in pursuanceof the Cabinet&apos;s decision of 21st March, he had discussed with theUnited States Ambassador in London the possibility of importingcoal into this country from the United States during the comingsummer. The Ambassador had shown every desire to be helpful, andhad undertaken to urge his Government to take all practicable stepsto increase their total exports of coal. He had also promised toconsider whether such additional supplies could be provided direct to this country or whether it would be necessary that the questionof an allocation to this country should be taken up with theEuropean Coal Organisation. The Ambassador had subsequentlyindicated that he had satisfied himself that it would be necessaryfor an application to be made to that Organisation.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that he had seen the South African Minister for Mines and Economic Develop-ment about the possibility that South Africa might increase her exports of coal for the benefit of the United Kingdom. He had sent a report of that interview to the Minister of Fuel and Power. Itwould apparently be possible for South Africa to increase her pro-duction of coal: the limiting factor was the shortage of wagonsfor transporting the coal from the pits to the ports.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.Coal.Five-day week.(previous reference:CM. (47)29thConclusions,Minute 9.)8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Fuel and Power (CP. (47) 104) covering a copy of aletter from the Chairman of the National Coal Board regardingthe introduction of the five-day week in the coalmining industry.With his letter the Chairman enclosed a note of the agreement reached between the Board and the National Union of Mineworkersregarding the conditions to be attached to the introduction of thefive-day week; and he asked for the Government&apos;s directions on thequestion whether the five-day week should be brought into effect on those conditions on 4th May, 1947.The Prime Minister reminded the Cabinet of his discussions with the Executive Committee of the National Union of Mine-workers on 18th March, which he had reported to the Cabinet later that day. He thought that the Government had no alternative butto agree to the introduction of the five-day week.
The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the conditions whichhad been negotiated with the Union were strict and should havethe effect of increasing substantially the output per man-shift atthe coal face. There were already indications of increased produc-tion: total output for the past week, of both deep-mined and open-cast coal, was 3-9 million tons.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that, if experience showed that the new system was not in fact resulting in increased output, the question of suspending its operation could at a latrstage be taken up with the Union.The Cabinet Agreed that the Minister of Fuel and Power should informthe Mational Coal Board that they were authorised tointroduce in the coalmining industry, from 4th May, 1947,a system of working a five-day week on the conditions setout in the note enclosed with their letter of iSth Marchannexed to CP. (47) 104.Losses due So 9. The Cabinet reviewed the situation resulting from theFloods and      recent floods and the severe winter.wintfi? rP&quot;hp; C!p,HiT!f^f, iTi,iPovrnftH  list. sro.srErsn.cv mAasnto ^s?!Weathe?. with the effects of the floods were being co-ordinated by a committeeRelief and under the chairmanship of a senior official of the Home Office. ACompensation, scheme for sending supplies of food, fuel, blankets and dockets forhousehold supplies was in operation; pumps were being madeavailable by the National Fire Service; the Ministry of Transportwere co-ordinating demands for civilian and Service transport; theMinistry of Labour had arranged to supply the necessary labour,and special arrangements had been made to give guidance to theServices as to where Service equipment and help was needed. Itwas suggested, in discussion, that the responsible officers of theMinistry of Agriculture and Fisheries should be empowered to requisition any plant required for draining flooded land.The Minister of Agriculture said that he had appointed an advisory committee representing landowners, farmers and agricul-tural workers, which would in the first instance direct its attentionto emergency measures for the rapid restoration of flooded farmlands. He asked that the Prime Minister should instruct Depart-ments to see that all demands for materials, machinery or transportneeded for this purpose were promptly met. The Committee wouldalso consider measures to mitigate the loss of food production onaccount of the floods and the severe winter. Both the Secretaryof State for Scotland and he were obtaining through the county agricultural executive committees information about the losses sus-tained by farmers, and they would circulate to the Cabinet amemorandum suggesting what comnensation might be given inrespect of these losses. Any such compensation would have to take account of the extent to which the losses had been covered by insurance.The Prime Minister said that on the previous day he had madea general statement in the House of Commons about the relief of distress caused to householders by the floods. It seemed clear, how-ever, that the Government should make some contribution towardsreplacing the losses sustained by householders and it was important that an announcement about this should be made at the earliestpossible moment. The Lord Mayor had indicated that he wouldbe prepared to open a Fund for this purpose.The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Health, pointed outthat many local authorities had already spent considerable sums inthe relief of distress caused by the floods and it might be difficult for the Government to refuse to reimburse them for this expen-diture.
In further discussion there was general agreement that farmers should be compensated for losses sustained, after taking into accountany receipts from insurance, and that the question of reimbursinglocal authorities who had already incurred expense on the relief of distress caused by the floods should also be considered. The relief of individual cases of distress could probably be carried out most effectively through the machinery at the disposal of the Lord Mayorand he should be encouraged to open a Fund for this purpose. TheGovernment should make a substantial contribution to this Fund.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would instruct Depart-ments to see that all demands for materials, machinery and transport required for the restoration of floodedfarm lands were promptly met.(2) Asked the Minister of Agriculture to arrange to confer onthe appropriate officers power to requisition any planturgently required for the draining of flooded land.(3) Asked the Minister of Agriculture and the Secretary ofState for Scotland to circulate, for the Cabinet&apos;s con-sideration on 1st April, a memorandum on the questionof compensating farmers for losses caused by the severewinter and the recent floods.(4) Agreed that the Lord Mayor should be encouraged to opena Fund for the relief of distress caused to householdersby the floods, and that the Government should offer a contribution of  1 million towards this Fund.(5) Took note that it might be necessary to reimburse localauthorities for expenditure incurred by them in relievingdistress caused by the floods.(6) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to make a state-ment in the House of Commons later that day indicating that the Government were considering how they could best help to relieve losses by farmers and others and emergency expenditure by local authorities, andannouncing that the Government had agreed to contri-bute  1 million to the Lord Mayor&apos;s Fund for the relief of distress.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,25th March, 1947.
