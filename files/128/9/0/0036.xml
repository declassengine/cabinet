The Budget(previous reference erertce:C.M.(46)31stC\/-\t-t rtl 11 QiAn a minute 1.)1. The Chancellor of the Exchequer communicated to theCabinet particulars of the proposals in the forthcoming budget in accordance with precedent, details are not recorded in theCabinet Conclusions.India and burma,Compensationfor IVEembersof indian and BurmaServices.(previous reference:CM. (46) 98thConclusions,Minute 6.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (CP. (47) 127) regarding the compensation for loss ofcareer and prospects to be paid to members of the civilian services in India- and Burma, when their appointments under the Secretaryof State were terminated as a result of constitutional changes inIndia and Burma, and to officers of the Indian and Burma armed forces,The Prime Minister said that, since this matter had last beenconsidered by the Cabinet on 19th November, 1946, it had been thesubject of discussions with the Government of India and of prolonged consideration by the India and Burma Committee. Theposition now reached was that the Government of India would raiseno objection to the payment of compensation on the scales proposedto European members of the Services, though they still contendedn .i 11-.:- -        -  *      - -    -rhQt   t ha   oaoi-&apos; &quot;       KJKJX AJ.C7    KJJuuvciJimciiL;they were strongly opposed to the payment of any compensation to indian officers, whether by themselves or by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, save in a limited number of cases where it could be shownthat an individual would actually be damnified as a result of theconstitutional changes. The Viceroy strongly recommended thatthe views of the Government of India on this point should beaccepted; and his recommendation was endorsed by the India and burma Committee. The Secretary of State for India dissented,however, from this recommendation; and favoured the adoption ofa scheme whereby Indian members of the Services would receive compensation on a lower scale than that proposed for the european members.The Secretary of State, for India, and for Burma- said that inhis view the proposals recommended by the India and BurmaCommittee could not be reconciled with the pledge given by his predecessor on 1st June, 1945, in connection with the announcementof a scheme for recruiting war-service candidates to the indian and Burma Services at, the end of the war in Europe. Under thisscheme war-service recruits to the Services were to have been entitled to compensation for loss of career and prospects as a resultof constitutional changes; and, in a communique issued at thetime of the announcement of this scheme, it was stated that existing members of the Services would be given terms which would be notless favourable, considered as a whole, than those applicable tothe new entrants. This scheme of recruitment was open to Indiansas well as Europeans; and some Indians were in fact in processof being recruited under it when it was abandoned. In his view,therefore, the Government were pledged to give existing membersof the Services, wiietiier Indian or European, compensation on metermination of their appointments under the Secretary of state which was not less favourable than that promised to war-servicerecruits under the scheme announced in June, 1945.In discussion, it was pointed out that the basis of the proposedcompensation was the loss of career and prospects due to thetermination of service under His Majesty&apos;s Government. The bulkof the Indian members of the Services would not in fact suffer suchloss.. Indeed, it was likely that their prospects would be improved by the withdrawal of the -European members of the Services.Special provision was proposed for the minority who were notretained in the service of the Government of India after the transierof power or could prove that their actions taken in the course or their duty before the transfer of power had created a prejudice
Glasgow 3.   The Home Secretary said that, in view of the continuanceDock Strike, of the dockers&apos; strike at Glasgow, he must ask the Cabinet toauthorise the employment of additional troops to unload the foodships now lying there. Some of the perishable food in those shipswas already being unloaded by a small contingent of Soya!Engineers; but he was advised that, if the supply of rationed foodswas to be maintained in that neighbourhood, further military labour would have to be employed to unload less perishable rationed foods,such as meat, cheese and fats.   The Service Departments wereagainst them and damaged their prospects. It was reasonable toassume that, apart from these, the Indian members of the services would be willing to continue in service under an Indian Govern-ment: indeed, it was known that many of them were ardentnationalists who would welcome the opportunity of serving an indian Government.iVpart from the merits, there were strong arguments of expediency on the side of accepting the view of the Governmentof India. They had good grounds for objecting to a proposal thatIndians should receive financial compensation for becoming the-servants of an Indian, instead of a British, Government: theywould certainly decline to pay such compensation from Indianfunds; and, in view of their attitude, it would be inexpedient thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government should insist, against their wishes, inpaying this compensation from the British Exchequer. The Govern-ment of India had gone a long way to meet our views on thisquestion of compensation generally; and it would be unwise for usto insist pn this particular proposal, which would have to be justified on the basis of the statement of 1st June, 1945, rather than the merits. It was a relevant consideration that; while tha,t statement had promised to existing members of the Services treatment not less favourable than that to be accorded to officers recruited under thewar-service scheme, that scheme had in fact been abandoned.The point was also made that the alternative proposed bythe Secretary of State for India, while it would have the disadvan-tage of discriminating between Indian and European members ofthe Services, would not in any way meet the views of the Govern-ment of India.The Chancellor of the Exchequer stressed the fact that acceptance of the scheme recommended in CP. (47) 127 did notnecessarily imply that the cost of the proposed compensation wouldbe borne by His Majesty&apos;s Government : the source from which themoney was to be found still remained a matter for negotiation withthe Government of India.The Cabinet (1) Approved the scales of compensation recommended by the india and Burma Committee, as set out in CP. (47) 127,to. be paid to members of the civilian Services in Indiawhen their appointments under the Secretary of Statewere terminated clS BL result of constitutional changes,and to officers of the Indian Armed Forces;(2) Invited the Secretary of State for India to communicate to the Viceroy the draft statements contained in annexes II and III to CP. (47) 127; and took note that, subject to any comments by the Viceroy, theGovernments decision would be announced in bothHouses of Parliament in the terms of the draft containedin Annex III;(3) Agreed that compensation on the same scales should bepaid to members of the Burma Services and to officersof the Burma Armed Forces; and invited the Secretaryof State for Burma to authorise the Governor of burma to submit these proposals to his Council.
anxious that, before additional troops were employed, there shouldbe a public announcement of the reasons for their employment.The Minister of Labour said that he raised no objection tothe employment of further military labour for this purpose. Hewould, however, deprecate any public announcement as this mightbe interpreted as a strike-breaking move on the part of the Govern-ment and might have the effect of extending the strike to other ports.The Cabinet agreed that no public explanation of this furtheruse of military labour need be volunteered : if questions were asked,however, it could be said that stocks of rationed foods were now so low that the Government could not tolerate this interruption of current supplies and had to use military labour for the unloadingof ships in order that the ration might continue to be honoured. -The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Defence to arrange for furthermilitary labour to be provided for the unloading of foodships at Glasgow;(2) Agreed that no public announcement of this decision shouldbe made, but that, if questions were asked, this extendeduse of military labour might be explained on the lines indicated above.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,14th April, 1947.
