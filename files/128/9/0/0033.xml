Parliament.FutureBusiness.1. The Cabinet were informed that it would be announced inthe House of Commons that day, in the statement on Business, thatthe Chancellor of the Exchequer would open his Budget onI5th April.144Town andCounttyPlanningBill.position ofCommonCouncil of city of London.(JfreviousEeferenee:CM. (47) 28thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Cabinet were informed that the Minister of Town and country Planning was being strongly pressed, to amend the Townand Country Planning Bill so as to accord to the Common Councilof the City of London the title of local planning authority. Underthe Bill as introduced, the London County Council were to be thelocal planning authority for the whole of London and the CommonCouncil were to cease to be an independent planning authority. Ithad, however, been agreed in negotiations with the London CountyCouncil and the Common Council that the Bill should provide forthe Common Council&apos;s continuing to exercise certain planningpowers, and the Common Council now claimed that this should be formally recognised by giving them the title of local planning authority. The Opposition would support this claim and it was likely to be pressed when the Bill was before the House of lords on the other hand, the London CouLabour Party were strongly opposed to itThe Cabinet Agreed that the Common Council of the City of london should not be given the title of local planning authority.nty Council and the LondonGermany. 3 xhe Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ChancellorJJse of Liberty of the Duchy of Lancaster (OP. (47) 106) on a proposal by ships for Mr. Hoover that 75 American Liberty ships should be made avail-Import able for transporting supplies to the British and United StatesProgramme. Zones of Germany.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that acceptanceof this proposal, which was to be put before the United StatesCongress, would reduce substantially our dollar expenditure on germany. If we opposed the proposal, the United States Govern-ment would consider that we were denying relief to the Americantaxpayer, and our opposition would be thought to be narrowly basedon our own commercial interests. Moreover, if the three-year pro-gramme for achieving a balance of payments in the Combined Zonefailed to materialise, the additional expenditure to be borne out of subsequent appropriations would be laid at our door and the Ameri-cans might refuse to continue to bear as much as 50 per cent; ofthe combined costs. On the other hand, the security aspects of theproposal could not be ignored. The use of the Liberty ships, ifapproved, might have to be continued for some years; and, as itwas intended that they should be manned by Germans, there was a risk that this plan might foster the growth of a German mercantilemarine. Moreover, it might involve retaining in Germany largerrepair facilities than was at present envisaged, and might ultimatelystrengthen the arguments for relaxing the restrictions on Germany&apos;sshipbuilding industry. He had, however, ascertained, since para-graph 6 of his memorandum was written, that acceptance of theproposal would not involve any immediate loss to the Britishmercantile marine, since alternative freights could be found for theBritish ships now carrying German imports.The Minister of Transport said that this proposal, if acceptedby Congress, would constitute a reversal of American shippingpolicy, for the United States had hitherto refused to agree to thesale or transfer of American ships. He viewed with some anxietya proposal which might give an opening for the rebuilding of aGerman mercantile marine. If we were to support the proposal, weshould insist on stringent conditions to safeguard our interests.[33415-3] b 2
The Cabinet were informed that the Admiralty were opposedto this proposal, which was inconsistent with the accepted policyof limiting German tonnage and destroying German shippingpotential. It would provide an opportunity for maintaining a bodyof skilled German merchant seamen; it would involve retaining inGermany repair facilities substantially in excess of what would otherwise be necessary; and it would open the door to reconsider a-tion of the policy of eliminating German capacity for buildingocean-going ships.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there were strongfinancial arguments in favour of the plan. It should save about80 million dollars a year, of which about half would accrue to HisMajesty&apos;s Government. The greater part of this saving would be in dollars and he thought that, in the light of the situation disclosed in his memorandum CP. (47) 100 on the exhaustion of our dollarcredit, this consideration should be regarded as a decisive argument in favour of acceptance. Adequate safeguards could be devised tomeet the security &quot;considerations to which reference had been made.In further discussion, the following points were made : (a) These ships would not be under German control; they wouldbe operated under the direction of the competent Anglo-Americanauthority for the Combined Zones.(b) The policy of eliminating Germany&apos;&quot;s shipbuilding capacityneed not be prejudiced : even repairs might, to a substantial extent,be done outside Germany.(c) This use of Liberty ships would ease the shortage ofshipping required for food imports into the United Kingdom.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed in principle to support the proposal for the use of american Liberty ships for the carriage of Germanimports, if adequate safeguards were provided to meetthe security considerations involved.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, in con-sultation with the Minister of Defence, the Minister ofState- and the Minister of Transport, to submit, forconsideration by the Cabinet at their next meeting,recommendations on the nature of the security safe-guards to be proposed to the United States Government.Olympic 4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the SecretaryGames, 1948. of State for Air and the Secretary for Overseas. Trade (CP. (47)Aceommoda- 102) on the provision of accommodation for competitors at the for Olympic Games Meeting which was to be held in this country inCompetitors. 1948.The Secretary of State for Air said that, if the Games were tobe held in this country, the Government should do all they could tomake them a success; and nothing would contribute more to theirsuccess than the provision of satisfactory accommodation for thecompetitors. After much discussion with interested Departments,and consultation with the British Olympic Association, he com-mended to the Cabinet the plan outlined in CP. (47) 102, by whichaccommodation would be provided for 4,300 competitors in threecentres within reasonable distance of the Wembley Stadium byadapting the RAP. Depot at Uxbridge, the R.A.F. Station at WestDrayton and the Convalescent Depot in Richmond Park. these works would cost about  720,000 and would require 600 tons of steel.The major part of the work, and of the steel requirements, arose&apos;. from the&apos; proposal to build additional barracks and messes atUxbridge; but this expansion was part of the building programme which the Air Ministry would be undertaking in any event over thenext few years and the new buildings would be of permanent value
227CM. 33 (17)to the R.A.F.- If they were to be ready in time for the Games, itwas necessary that work should start at once; and the Secretary ofState asked that the highest priority should be given, for bothlabour and materials, to ensure that the work was completed in time.In discussion the following points were raised : (a) Was it wise that the Olympic Games should be held in thiscountry at a time when we should not have recovered from our economic difficulties ? Was it reasonable that we should be preparing for an Olympic Meeting at a time when we had thought it necessaryto restrict our own mid-week sport in order to avoid loss ofindustrial production ? Gould we justify the use of scarce materials for this purpose when we had refused facilities for, e.g., the High&apos;land and Agricultural Society&apos;s Show?It was pointed out in reply that the invitation to hold theOlympic Games in this country in 1948 had been given, and accepted, many months ago; and it would be most inexpedient towithdraw now from the commitment into which we had entered.Moreover, the holding of the Games in this country would help usto overcome some of our economic difficulties; for it would attract tothis country many thousands of tourists, who might contribute asmuch as  1 million towards restoring our balance of payments.(6) The Secretary of State for Air said that the cost of theworks involved at Uxbridge and West Drayton could probably bemet within the total of the Air Ministry Estimates, by offsettingagainst the Sub-Head for Buildings savings made under other Sub-Heads. The steel required could not, however, be found within theAir Ministry allocation; for the whole of that was required for theconstruction of married quarters, for most of which the contractshad already been let. If this steel could not be found from otherdepartmental allocations, would it be permissible to use for thispurpose any additional supplies of steel which might be obtainedfrom abroad? Finland or Sweden might be willing to make steelavailable for the special purpose of facilitating the holding of theOlympic Games.It was the view of the Cabinet that, if any additional steelcould be obtained from abroad, it should be put into the general poolfor allocation among the more important departmental programmes.Further discussion showed that the general sense of the cabinet was against providing for this purpose, in present circumstances,the labour and materials required for the building of new barracks and messes at the R.A.F. Depot at Uxbridge. This part of the planoutlined in CP. (47) 102 would absorb by far the greatest part ofthe total amount of labour and materials required, and would pro-vide accommodation for only about 800 of the 4,300 competitors. Itshould be possible for the Service Departments to find some otherexisting accommodation, in the neighbourhood of Wembley Stadium,which could be adapted at much lower cost to provide accommoda-tion for these numbers.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed1 that accommodation for the competitors at theOlympic Games should be provided at the R.A.F. depot at Uxbridge, the R.A.F. Station at West Drayton andthe Convalescent Depot in Richmond Park, on the under-standing that no new buildings would be erected forthis purpose at the depot at &quot;Oxbridge.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Air to arrange, in con-sultation with the First Lord of the Admiralty and theSecretary of State for War, for some other existingaccommodation held by one or other of the service departments in the vicinity of the Wembley Stadiumto be made available to house the balance of the competi-; tors who could not be accommodated under the modifiedplan authorised by Conclusion (1) above.5-3]
(3) Invited the Minister of Works and other Ministers concerned to see that labour and materials were provided to enable the adaptation of the existing buildingsselected for the accommodation of Olympic competitorsto be completed by 1st June, 1948.Food(previous reference:G.M.(47)S0OtConclusions,5. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister of Food(CP. (47) 99) and the Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Health(CP. (47) 105), about a proposal that from 27th April the weeklysugar ration should be increased from 8 to 10 ozs. The cabinet also had before them- a memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP. (47) 100) drawing attention to the rapid rate atwhich the United States loan was being exhausted and a memo-randum by the Minister of Fuel and Power (CP. (47) 109) on thegeneral question of our balance of payments.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it would be some weeks before he could put before the Cabinet the import programme for the second half of 1947 and the first half of 1948. In view,however, of the proposal to increase the sugar ration he felt boundto warn his colleagues of the alarming rate at which the UnitedStates dollar credit was being exhausted. Of the S3,750 milliongranted in July 1946, $600 million had been used by the end of 1946and in the first quarter of 1947 the Treasury would have to draw a further S700 million. At this rate the remaining credit wouldbe exhausted at latest by June 1948, whereas we had hoped thatit would last until September, 1949. The chief reasons for the rapidrun-down of the credit were the steep rise in the United Statesprices and the increasing cost of providing food for Germany, where we were at present financing the purchase of food supplies forthe United States Zone as well as our own, pending the voting ofthe necessary appropriations by Congress. He hoped that at alater stage the Cabinet would have an opportunity to discuss the suggestions made by the Minister of Fuel and Power in CP. (47) 109for dealing with the problem of the balance of payments, whichwas by far the most difficult of those which, as Chancellor of theExchequer, he had to face. For the present, however, he merelywished to urge that the proposal to increase the sugar ration shouldbe postponed.The Minister of Food said that it was almost certain that therewould have to be a cut in the tea ration in the next few weeks andthat a cut in the meat ration during the summer was probable inview of the heavy losses of livestock due to the severe winter. Thus,unless some compensating increase in other rationed foods was given,the standard of nutrition would deteriorate and this was boundto affect industrial production, including the production for exporton which we relied to redress the adverse balance of payments. TheChancellor of the Exchequer had already authorised the purchaseof enough sugar from dollar sources to enable a weekly ration of 10 ozs., with the usual additional supplies for jam-making inthe summer, to be maintained throughout 1947 and 1948, even afterallowance had been made for the fall in supplies of home-producedsugar which was likely to result from the recent floods; and, apartfrom unforeseen circumstances, we should by 1949 be able to drawall the sugar that we needed from non-doliar sources. He hopedthat if cuts had to be made in food imports in order to save dollarsthey would be at the expense of other, less essential, items. Forexample, rather than lose the chance of an increase in the sugar ration, he would if necessary be prepared to forgo the purchaseof turkeys which he had agreed on during his recent visit to theUnited States, though the United States Secretary of Agriculturehad pressed him strongly on this point and the additional meatwould be of real assistance in supplementing our meat supplies.
C.M. 33 (47)

The Cabinet-

Agreed that there should for the present be no increase in the sugar ration; and invited the Minister of Food to bring this proposal before the Cabinet again when it became necessary to reduce the ration of some other food.

Coal.

Domestic Fuel Rationing (Previous Reference: C.M. (47)32nd Conclusion, Minute 6.) The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Power (C.P. (47) 108) on the restrictions to be applied to the domestic consumption of gas and electricity during the coming summer.

The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he had reviewed the position further, since the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on 25th March, and he was satisfied that it would be inexpedient to continue the existing restrictions in their present form. He now recommended that there should be a total prohibition on the use of gas or electricity heating rooms in residential premises during the summer months, subject to exceptions for illness and for periods of extremely cold weather. He also proposed a prohibition on the use of gas and electricity for cooking and water-heating between the hours of 9 to 11.30 a.m. and 2 to 4 p.m. These prohibitions should be supported by a vigorous campaign for fuel economy. In shops, offices and other non-industrial establishments voluntary schemes should be introduced with a view to limiting the consumption of gas and electricity to a proportion of previous consumption. If these recommendations were approved, an announcement might be made in Parliament on the lines of the draft annexed to C.P. (47) 108.

The President of the Board of Trade said that, while he did not dissent from the specific recommendations now made by the Minister of Fuel and Power, he considered that the announcement should be in much stronger terms than those proposed. In his view, it should begin by stressing the extent to which the national economy was being crippled by shortage of coal and should state that domestic consumers must achieve a total saving of 2 1/2 million tons of coal during the summer as their contribution towards bridging the gap between supply and demand. The only certain way of securing this saving would be by rationing, and the Government had examined a number of alternative schemes for rationing domestic consumption. These were, however, complicated and difficult to enforce and would necessitate the employment of large administrative staffs. The Government had therefore decided to rely, on the first instance, on the alternative measures recommended by the Minister of Fuel and Power and on the co-operation of the public in seeking to reduce their consumption, by these and other means, to the standard to which they would have had to conform under a rationing scheme. The Government would, however, keep the position under review and, if the economies required were realised, they would feel compelled to introduce a compulsory rationing scheme

There was general agreement with the views expressed by the President of the Board of Trade, subject only to doubts whether the Government should at this stage commit themselves to introducing a rationing scheme if it became clear that domestic consumption was not being reduced to the required level. The Cabinet&apos;s previous discussion had shown that there would be grave political and administrative difficulties in introducing a scheme of compulsory rationing; and the Cabinet considered that, until it was known whether means could be found of overcoming these difficulties, it would be unwise for the Government to commit themselves to introducing such a scheme.


\fter further discussion it was agreed that the announcement should follow the broad lines indicated by the President of theBoard of Trade but should end by stating that, if the present proposals proved to be insufficient, the Government would then be compelled to introduce other measures, however drastic, to ensurethat the target was achieved.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the restrictions to be imposed on the domestic consumption of gas and electricity during the comingsummer should be on the lines indicated in paragraphs 3,4 and 6 of CP. (47) 108; and invited the Minister of fuel and Power to open discussions with the gas and electricity &quot;supply industries with a view to completinga detailed scheme on those lines.(o\ T^ok note that the Prime Minister would make an&quot;&quot;announcement in the House of Commons that day, on thei:___ aA nnop in fhp Cabinet&apos;s discussion, about theunco asioou &quot;f&quot;&quot; ^ . &apos;    , .nature of the restrictions to be imposed on uhe domestic consumption of gas and electricity during the comingsummer.Palestine.Public Order.(previous reference:CM. (47) 30thConclusions,Minute 1.)7. The Prime Minister invited the High Commissioner forPalestine and the General Officer Commanding the British Army inPalestine to give the Cabinet an appreciation of the presentsituation in Palestine.The High Commissioner for Palestine said that the Jewishterrorists, whose strength was about 6,000 to 7,000 or 1 per cent, ofthe Jewish population, were continuing their activities andpersistent pressure on them must be maintained. Every effort hadbeen made to enlist the help of the Jewish population in this cam-paign; that, in his view, was essential to success. Hitherto, theJewish representative bodies had condemned terrorism, but had done nothing to help the Administration in suppressing it. Therewas now some reason to hope that they might be ready to go further;and the Jewish residents certainly seemed disposed to afford sub-stantially more help than ever before. There were, however, newelements of special difficulty in the situation, since civil war betweenarmed bodies of Jews was now possible. The use of the term&apos;&apos; statutory martial law &apos;&apos; for the March operation had been a mistake : in practice the only difference from the normal procedure for cordoning and search had been the simultaneous withdrawalof the administration from the areas concerned. This had been donein order to bring it home to the Jewish population that they couldnot continue to receive the benefits of the civil administration with-out affording it the necessary co-operation in maintaining law andorder. It had been realised from the outset that these measures could not be maintained for more than a limited period. After two weeks it was clear that they had reached the limit of their useful-ness; substantial relaxation would otherwise have been necessary,and increasing unemployment might have provided recruits for the terrorists. There was also a serious risk that the sympathy of theHistadruth, who were disposed to co-operate with the Government,would be alienated. In general, he had no doubt that the results achieved had been most beneficial.The Arabs were quiescent; the fellahin were enjoyingunprecedented prosperity, and it was doubtful whether the Mufti&apos;efforts to organise guerilla bands would, in present circumstances,meet with much success. The position of the British community,which had been segregated in defended areas, was an unhappy one,but it seemed unlikely that there could be any improvement in theirsituation until a political settlement had been reached.The General Officer Commanding expressed agreement with theHigh Commissioner^ survey.   There was complete accord between
the civil and military authorities in Palestine. The morale of thetroops was high.In reply to questions, The High Commissioner said that themain results of imposing &quot; statutory martial law &quot; had been that78 terrorists had been arrested; that the Jewish population had, forthe first time, been stimulated into giving help to the Police in theirsearch for terrorists; and that the Jews were seriously afraid lestsimilar action should be taken again in the future. Strong reactionsfrom the terrorists could be expected if Dov Groner was executed :special precautions had, however, been taken to meet this situation.It might be necessary to reimpose &quot;statutory martial law &quot; inspecified areas. During the past year, the terrorist groups badundoubtedly increased. For the most part they were composed of very young men. There was reason to suppose that recruits forthese groups were coming to Palestine in some of the illegal immi-grant ships, particularly those recently organised by the revise-sionists. As regards the terrorists arrested during the recentoperation, those against whom evidence was available would be tried by the special military courts j others would be detained under theprovision of the Palestine Defence Regulations, similar to Regula-tion 18B of the United Kingdom Defence Regulations. The casesof persons thus detained were kept under continuous review by an impartial Advisory Committee. The Jewish Agency appeared tobe losing influence; attempts by the Government to secure itsco-operation in opposing terrorists had indicated that the con-tinuance of its influence over the Jewish community dependedlargely upon the maintenance of an attitude of persistent oppositionto the Government. Since the Basle Conference there had been serious divergences within the Agency between the AmericanZionists led by Rabbi Silver and the Mapai under Mr. Ben Gurion.There was some hope that Dr. Weizmann might regain his formerinfluence.The Prime Minister thanked the High Commissioner and theGeneral Officer Commanding, who then withdrew.The Cabinet then considered a Report by the Chiefs of Staff(OP. (47) 107) on the measures necessary for maintaining law andorder in Palestine during the next six months.The Chief of the Air Staff said that the Chiefs of Staff had prepared their Report after consultation with the Commanders-in-Chief, Middle East, and after discussions with the High Commis-sioner and the General Officer Commanding. They had reached theconclusion that there would be no justification for imposing martial law over the whole country; such a measure was not necessary fordealing with a relatively small number of terrorists operating fromthe main areas of Jewish population, it would have serious politicalresults and would impose an excessive strain on the availablemilitary forces. The Chiefs of Staff considered that the best coursewould be to retain the existing civil Government; to intensify the continuous military pressure against terrorists throughout thecountry; and to reimpose &apos;&apos; statutory martial law &apos;&apos; in appropriateareas for limited periods, when and where necessary. They attachedparticular importance to their recommendation for the establish-ment of summary military courts to deal with, specified offences.The Cabinet were in general agreement with the recommenda-tions made by the Chiefs of Staff. They thought, however, thatcareful consideration should be given to the constitution and powersof the proposed military courts, and that detailed proposals on these points should be submitted for further consideration.Points made in further discussion were : (a) The use of the title &apos;&apos; statutory martial law&apos;&apos; should infuture be avoided.(6) It was important that the new military courts proposed in cp. (47) 107 should have the services of competent legal advisers.
(c) The measures to be taken in the event of the outbreak ofcivil war within the Jewish community in Palestine were discussed.The Chief of the Air Staff said that the difficulties of such a situation were fully appreciated; but there was some hope that insuch circumstances members of the Hagana might be enlisted asspecial constables.The Cabinet (1) Approved the recommendations of the Chiefs of Staff con-tained in CP. (47) 107, subject to further considerationof the constitution, jurisdiction and powers of the sum-mary military courts proposed in paragraph 18 (d) ofthat memorandum.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in consulta-tion with&apos; the Lord Chancellor, to submit proposals regarding the constitution, jurisdiction and powers offi-.^ qi-iTYi-mgyv military courts nroijosed in mm.graph 18 (d) of CR &quot;(47) 107.&quot;(3) Asked the Secretary of State for the Colonies to inform theCabinet at once if the authorities in Palestine shouldtake further action in accordance with paragraph 18 (c)of CP. (47) 107.Uoibinet oil-ce, S.W. 1.27thMarch, 1947.
