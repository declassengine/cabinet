(46)79thConclusions,Minute 3.)1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (CP. (47) 1) on the constitutional position in India.The Cabinet&apos;s discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of Cabinet Conclusions.2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for India (CP. (46) 466) on the future control of our relationswith the Arab States of the Persian Gulf.The Secretary of State for India recalled that the Cabinet had agreed on 4th September, 1946, that the conduct of our relationswith these States should be taken over from the Government ofIndia, but had not decided which Department of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should assume this responsibility. This question had since been discussed by officials of the interested Departments. Itwas generally agreed that the Foreign Office should eventuallyassume the responsibility, but they were not in a position to do soimmediately. The Colonial Office were in a, position to acceptimmediate control, but their assumption of responsibility forrelations with quasi-independent Rulers would be open tomisrepresentation. It was therefore recommended that the india Office should take over the responsibility from the Govern-ment of India and hold it, as an interim arrangement, until theForeign Office were in a position to assume full control.The Foreign Secretary and The Secretary of State for theColonies supported this recommendation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer also agreed, while reserving the Treasury&apos;s right to examine the detailed estimates of theadministrative costs and capital expenditure (for the constructionof a new Residency) which would in future fall on United Kingdom,instead of Indian, funds.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that from 1st April, 1947, the India Office shouldtake over from the Government of India, as an interim arrangement, direct responsibility for the political posts in the Persian Gulf; and that the cost should be borne on the India Office Vote;(2) Agreed that this responsibility should be transferred fromthe India Office to the Foreign Office as soon as the latterDepartment were properly equipped to take it over; andthat the aim should be to make this transfer by 1st April,1948;(3) Invited the Secretary of State for India to negotiate withthe Government of India for the transfer to the direct control of His Majesty&apos;s Government, on terms to beagreed with the Treasury, of the staff, buildings and facilities required for this service.Food. 3.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the SecretaryWheat of State for India (CP. (47) 13) and the Minister of Food (CP.Supplies (47) 21) on the distribution, as between the United Kingdom andfrom Turkey.    India, of supplies of wheat bought by the Ministry of Food inTurkey.The Secretary, of State for I(ndia said that, under standingarrangements by which the Ministry of Food procured on behalfof the Government of India some of India&apos;&quot;s requirements of imported grain, the Ministry of Food had bought some Turkishwheat and barley for India in the summer of 1946. Subsequently,[33047-2] B 2
when the Government of India received through trade channelsoffers of further Turkish wheat, they were persuaded to refrain from pursuing these by an assurance, given to them after consulta-tion with the Ministry of Food, that they would receive a sub-stantial quantity of any further wheat or barley which the Ministryof Food were able to obtain from Turkey. In November theMinistry bought from Turkey 125,000 tons of wheat and 24,000tons of rye for shipment from January onwards. The Ministrynow proposed, however, to bring the whole of this wheat to theUnited Kingdom and to allot to India only the rye. The Secretaryof State said that this would be regarded by the Government ofIndia as a breach of faith. India was in greater need of wheatthan of coarse grains; and he must ask that the Ministry of hoodshould supply to India a substantial share of this Turkish wheat.He suggested that half of it should be allotted to India and thatthe whole of India&apos;s share should be shipped in the months january to March so as to relieve the immediate difficulties of the wheatsituation in India.The Minister of Food said that he had not regarded himself as publicly pledged to give this wheat to India. Even if the wholeof it were taken by the United Kingdom, India would have had1over half of the total quantity of cereals which he had bought from turkey since the summer of 1948. He had looked at the matter in the light of the relative needs of India and the United King-dom. The recent rice crop in India had been good, and her cerealsposition this year should be very much stronger than last. In thefirst half of 1947 her total supplies should be sufficient to meet hertotal requirements, if surpluses in some Provinces were used tomake good deficits in others. In the United Kingdom, on the otherhand, our position was precarious. Our stocks of wheat and flourwere lower, by 150,000 tons, than they had been at the time when we decided to ration bread. In these circumstances he had feltjustified in proposing to allot the whole of the Turkish wheat tothe United Kingdom. In the last few days, however, our prospectshad been improved by the purchase of a substantial quantity ofwheat in the Argentine; and he was now able to agree that thisTurkish wheat should be divided equally between the United King-dom and India. As, however, the Argentine wheat would not arrive in this country for some time, he thought it important that theearly shipments from Turkey should come to the United Kingdom.It was the view of the Cabinet that the assurances given to theGovernment of India, on the basis of the letter of 9th Novemberfrom the Ministry of Food to the India Office, committed HisMajesty&apos;s Government to sending to India a substantial part ofthe wheat purchased from Turkey in November. The Cabinet there-fore approved the proposal that this 125,000 tons of wheat shouldbe divided equally between the United Kingdom and India. Thequestion whether priority in shipment should be given to the UnitedKingdom or to India must depend upon the relative urgency of thetwo countries&apos; needs; but the Cabinet were not prepared to agreethat the whole of the United Kingdom share should be shippedbefore any shipments went to India. It was suggested that theMinister of Food should explore the possibility of reaching an agree-ment with the Government of India by which, to save shipping time,more of the early shipments of the Turkish wheat would be sent toIndia and a corresponding amount of United States wheat wouldbe diverted from India to the United Kingdom. Alternatively, this opportunity might be taken of seeking to divert some australian wheat from India to the United Kingdom in exchange for Turkishwheat. Either of these courses would be financially advantageous to us,.in view of the high cost of the Turkish wheat; and the second would be in line with the long-term objective of re-establishing theUnited Kingdom as a market for Australian wheat. If, however,no such arrangements for diversions could be made, the Ministerof Food should arrange that the first shipments of wheat from turkey should include at least one shipload for India.
The Cabinet -(1) Agreed that the 125,000 tons of wheat which the Ministryof Food had bought from Turkey should be dividedequally between the United Kingdom and India.(2) Asked the Minister of Food to explore the possibility of concluding an agreement by which India would take asubstantial proportion of the early shipments of thisTurkish wheat and a corresponding quantity of UnitedStates wheat would be diverted to the United Kingdom.(3) Asked the Minister of Food to consider whether more ofthis Turkish wheat could be allotted to India in returnfor the release to this country of Australian wheat nowdestined for India; and to examine other means ofattaining the long-term objective of drawing from australia part of the wheat imports of the UnitedKingdom.(4) Agreed that, in default of any arrangements for diversionon the lines indicated in Conclusions (2) and (3) above,the first shipments of wheat from Turkey should include&apos; at least one shipload for India.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,8th January, 1947.
