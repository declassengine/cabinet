Lord Altrincham had agreed to postpone until later in the week the debate on Palestine which he had proposed to initiate in the House of Lords on 17th February.As regards future business, the Cabinet were informed that theOpposition Leaders were being asked to agree that the debate on theStatement relating to Defence should be confined to a single dajr.It was proposed that the general debate on Foreign Affairs shouldbe held on 26th and 27th February.lown 3.

India.constitutional position.(previous reference:CM. (47) 4thConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of developments in the constitutional position in India.The Cabinet&apos;s discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of Cabinet Conclusions.economic survey for1947.(previous reference:CM. (47) 14thConclusions,Minute 5.)draft white Paper.5. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Prime Minister(CP. (47) 53 (Revise)) covering a draft White Paper on theEconomic Survey for 1947.The Prime Minister said that the main theme of the white paper was that strenuous efforts must be made to increase produc-tion. Forecasts were given of what could be done to raise the levelof exports, restore our capital equipment and increase home con-sumption; and the estimates of output on which these were basedmade certain assumptions about the availability of fuel supplies.The recent fuel crisis had affected these assumptions and the white paper could not be published exactly in the form of the draft beforethe Cabinet. The alternatives seemed to be either to revise theWhite Paper completely in the light of the new situation, whichwould involve considerable delay, or to publish it with the minimumalterations but to add an introduction relating it to the existing situation.The Cabinet&apos;s preference was for the second of these courses.It was recognised, however, that substantial modifications wouldhave to be made in those passages of the draft which dealt withcoal and electricity (paragraphs 84-96); and the Cabinefs discus-sion turned mainly on these paragraphs.The main points made in discussion were: (a) It was suggested that it was no longer realistic to propose(paragraph 86) a target of 200 million tons of coal, and that thefigure of 180 million tons should be substituted. On the other hand,it was pointed out that, even with the greatest practicable economy in consumption, a total production of under 200 million tons wouldbarely suffice to meet current needs and enable coal stocks to be built up to a level sufficient to avert another fuel crisis in the winter of 1947^-48. Moreover, if we were to achieve a production of some-thing like 230 million tons in the next two or three years- which seemed to be the minimum required to put our economy on a satis-factory basis we could hardly suggest for 1947 a target of less than200 million tons.The general view of the Cabinet was that the target of200 million tons should be retained in paragraph 86, and that an indication should be given that in subsequent years a higher output would be necessary.(b). In, paragraph 88 of the draft it was suggested that the aim should be to increase the labour force of the coal-mining industryto 700,000 by the end of 1947.The Minister of Fuel and Power pointed out that, although there were mow 695,000 workers on the colliery books, the effectivelabour force was not greater than 640,000, and not all of these were working the full number of shifts per week. If he could get an effective labour force of about 650,000, working five shifts a week,his production problem would be very largely solved. Tire greatest need was for more underground workers, and he was discussing with the National Coal Board how this need could be met. he agreed, however, that in present conditions production would beincreased if the labour force could be raised to 730,000, since thelarger numbers available :would offset loss of production throughabsenteeism. In his view the ultimate aim should be to increase production by the more effective use of a limited labour force.
There was general agreement that the target for the labour force on the colliery books should be raised from 700,000 to 730,000,and that the Minister of Fuel and Power and the Minister of labour should take vigorous steps to achieve this increase both by recruitingadditional British labour and by bringing more foreign workers intothe industry.(c) It was suggested that paragraph 92 of the draft should state more strongly the Governments determination to take all practicable measures to secure economies in the consumption ofcoal, gas and electricity.(d) More could be done by way of conversion to oil burning if thenecessary tankage were provided for power stations and factories.Urgent steps should be taken to provide the necessary supplies ofsheet steel to manufacture the tanks if necessary by the use ofGovernment-owned factories.Firms producing oil-burning plant could enlarge their capacity,if it were made clear to them that conversion to oil-burning was likely to be a long-term policy.(e) It was desirable that the production Departments, in con-sultation with the Ministry of Fuel and Power, should begin to workout a revised scheme for the allocation of coal to industry, whichcould be put into force when the present crisis was over.(/) Enquiries were being made into the possibility of intro-ducing a scheme for rationing the use of all forms of fuel for domestic consumption, and the results of these enquiries would besubmitted to the Fuel Committee.(g) It was agreed that paragraph 96 of the draft should statemore strongly that every effort was being made to make availableadditional electric generating plant, and should indicate that theGovernment intended to restrict the consumption of electricity for domestic purposes during the rest of 1947.(h) The Minister- of Fuel and power  asked whether it would notbe possible to divert to home use generating plant produced forexport.It was explained that generating plant constituted a most valuable element in the export trade, and much of the production for export was in fulfilment of foreign contracts which we had made great efforts to obtain, in view of the difficult balance ofpayments situation which we should face towards the end of 1948.Moreover, in many cases the export of generating plant assuredour imports of essential raw materials.The Minister of Supply undertook, however, to consider whether any diversion of generating plant could be made from export to home needs.(i) Greater use might be made of mobile generating stations in the possession of the Services and of Government Departments.The Minister of Supply undertook to consider, in consultationwith the Minister of Fuel and Power, what further steps could betaken to bring such plant into use to supplement existing suppliesof electricity.(j) It was agreed that in paragraph 95 some reference shouldbe made to the contribution which the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board schemes would make towards the increased produc-tion of electricity. These schemes had been held up by delays inobtaining the necessary constructional plant, much of which hadto be procured in the United States. No difficulties had been raisedabout the provision of dollars for. this, but the arrangements forthe procurement of the plant had only recently been put on a satis-factory basis. These arrangements also covered the procurement ofmachinery for open-cast coal working. The Minister of Fuel and power and the Secretary of State for Scotland should submit to theMinister of Works as soon as possible full particulars of their requirements for machinery.(k) In view of the loss of production caused by the fuel shortage,the export targets for the second half of 1947 should be reduced from 150 to 140 per&apos; cent, of the 1938 volume; the figure of
borrowings from abroad should be raised from  250 million to 350 million; and: the target of 13 million tons of steel should be written down.In discussion of the remainder of the draft White Paper thefollowing points were made : (I) The title of the White Paper should be &quot; Economic survey for 1947.&quot;(in) in place of tne last two sentences of paragraph 27 thereshould be inserted a passage referring to the White Paper (Cmd.7018) on the economic considerations affecting relations between employers and v/Grkpeople. This passage should state that theGovernment regard it as desirable that increased earnings should,wherever possible, be linked with incentives to increase production!The Cabinet then discussed the terms of the note which it was proposed that the Prime Minister should preface to the white paper.A draft which had been prepared was read to the Cabinet.There was general agreement that this should be recast on thefollowing lines : When the Government took office in 1945 they hadto face many difficulties, due partly to the war and partly to the policies of Governments before the war. They had done their best to maintain the standard of living of the people in spite of thedifficulties which had been inherited from earlier administrationsor had arisen through international shortages, e.g., of food. But theyhad inevitably to operate on a very narrow margin, and the recentadverse weather had shown through its effect on the fuel situationhow precariously the national economy had been balanced. TheGovernment had always published the truth about the situation,however unpalatable it might be, and would continue to do so. they believed that if the problems facing this country were tackled inthe spirit of a war operation, they could be overcome. Successwould depend mainly on the efforts made by the people themselves,and the Government believed that the necessary effort could andwould be forthcoming. A great deal depended on the workers in heavy industries, and the value of the work done by them shouldreceive full recognition.The Cabinet were informed that the Central Office of Informa-tion, under the direction of the Lord President, had prepared apamphlet entitled &quot; The Battle of Production, 1946.&quot; It seemedinappropriate that this should be published at a time when attention was being directed to production in 1947. It was therefore suggestedthat publication of this pamphlet should be suspended. On theother hand, it would be desirable that a popular version of the white paper on the Economic Survey for 1947 should be published about ten days after the White Paper itself.The Cabinet. (1) Subject to the amendments agreed on in discussion and toany other minor or drafting amendments which might befound necessary, approved the draft White Paperannexed to CP. (47) 53 (Revise) and agreed that itshould be published with a foreword by the PrimeMinister on the lines indicated above.(2) Approved the preparation of a popular version of the white paper, which might be published at the time when the debate on the White Paper took place.(3) Took note that any publicity arrangements connected withthe publication of the White Paper would be made from10 Downing Street, under the general supervision ofthe President of the Board of Trade.(4) invited the Minister of Fuel and Power and the Ministerof Labour to consider and report to the Fuel Committeewhat steps might be taken, by the use of foreign labour orotherwise, to increase the coal mining labour force tothe target figure of 730,000.
(5) Invited the Minister of Supply, after consultation with theMinister of Fuel and Power, to submit to the Fuel Com-mittee schemes for (i) the supply of tankage in order toencourage conversion from coal to oil burning and(ii) the use of mobile generating plants to supplement the existing electricity generating resources.(6) Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power and the Secretaryof State for Scotland to submit to the Minister of Worksa full statement of their requirements of contractor^plant for open-cast coal working and for the North ofScotland Hydro-Electric schemes.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (CP. (47) 54) reporting that appli-cation had been made for an allocation of paper for the purpose ofresuming the publication of A ction, the periodical issued up to June1940 by the British Union of Fascists.The President of the Board of Trade said that the Cabinet had hitherto accepted the view that a censorship of publications could notbe exercised through the machinery of paper allocation. He there-fnre thnuffht it, inevitable thai, the firm should he allower! the mwta,......------ o    -   &quot; &apos; ....... .. ...   .....-    &apos;A &apos; . &quot;of paper to which they were entitled under the existing practice;but, in view of the political criticism which would be aroused ifthe publication of Action were resumed, he had thought it right tosubmit the issue for decision by the Cabinet.In discussion the view was expressed that there would be gravepolitical difficulty if the publication of A ction were resumed. would it not be possible to justify the withholding of facilities which weredesired in order to resume publication of a periodical which hadbeen suppressed during the war ?The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary and the Lord Chancellor, toconsider, and report to the Cabinet, what steps could properly be taken to prevent the publication of A ction from being resumed.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,13th February, 1947.iPaper for aFascist^Periodical.(Previous^Reference:C.M.(46)69thConclusions,Ifinute 5.)
