The Cabinet were informed that on 31st January thereBusiness in     would be a short debate in the House of Commons, on a Motion forthe House of   the Adjournment, on the present situation in Palestine.Commons. Thg chief y/^ informed the Cabinet of the business whichit was proposed to take in the House of Commons during thefollowing week.On 3rd and 4th February, the Second Reading of the ElectricityBill would be taken. The Government spokesmen on the first day would be the Minister of Fuel and Power and the Secretary ofState for Scotland : the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministryof Fuel and Power would reply to the debate.On 5th February there would be ct debate on Germany, on the motion for the Adjournment, The Government spokesmen wouldbe the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the Minister ofState. It was pointed out that the Government might be embarrassed by statements made in such a debate at a time whenthe Foreign Ministers&apos; Deputies were meeting in London in preparation for the Moscow meeting on Germany. The cabinet were, however, informed that it would be difficult to persuade theOpposition Leaders to forgo this debate, especially since they had agreed that the expected debate on Foreign Affairs might be deferred. It was finally agreed that this debate should be held,but that it should be restricted to the discussion of conditions inGermany.On 6th February it was proposed that there should be a debate on the Territorial Army. The Minister of Defence deprecated the holding of such a debate at this stage, since it would anticipateforthcoming Parliamentary discussions on the Defence white paper, the Army Estimates and the National Service Bill. after discussion, it was agreed that the subject for debate on 6th Februaryshould be the proceedings at the recent conference of the Food and agriculture Organisation. The Government spokesmen would bethe Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Works and theMinister of Food.On 7th February the Government would move the SecondReading of the Appellate Jurisdiction Bill, the Births and DeathsRegistration Bill and the County Councils Association Expenses(A mendment) Bill.Gisic5SastauFam&amp;sBin.(previous reference erence:CM.(46)96thConclusions,Minute 6.^2. The Minister of Food recalled that at their meeting on14th November, 1946, the Cabinet had agreed that a provision should be included in the Civic Restaurants Bill empowering localauthorities to apply for licences to serve intoxicating liquor in civicrestaurants operated by them. When the Bill had been in StandingCommittee this provision had been deleted; and the Governmenthad now to decide whether they should seek to restore it on theReport Stage. From informal discussions which had taken place it appeared that the majority view among Government supporterswas in favour of such a provision for England and Wales. InScotland there were special difficulties, which had already been explained to the Cabinet; and the general feeling among Scottishsupporters of the Government was that no such provision should apply in Scotland.After a short discussion, the Cabinet Agreed that on the Report Stage of the Civic RestaurantsBill an amendment should be moved on behalf of theGovernment to empower local authorities in England andWales to apply for licences to serve intoxicating liquor inrestaurants operated by them under the Bill.
InternationalTradeOrganisation.(previous reference:CM. (46) 44thConclusions,Minute 8.)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the President!of the Board of Trade (CP. (47) 44) suggesting that a statement!should be made in Parliament about the plans for the next stage!in the International Trade Organisation discussions. \ IThe President of the Board of Trade said that if a statements were made it would probably be necessary to agree to a debate!Such a debate would, in his view, be helpful to the Government jand he suggested that it might be held on a Supply day after the;debate on the White Paper on the economic situation.   If theten days&apos; time.The Cabinet Agreed to defer a decision on the proposal in CP.

The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (47) 34) on the policy to be pursued in regard to greece and Turkey.The Foreign Secretary said that, in accordance with the advice of the Chiefs of Staff, he proposed that the British forces in Greeceshould be reduced by 1st April, 1947, to one brigade of fourbattalions, which would remain in Greece until the date of thewithdrawal of Russian forces from Bulgaria^&apos;.e., ninety days afterthe ratification of the Bulgarian Treaty. Fie also proposed that assistance should be given to the Greek Government in order toenable them to undertake effective operations against bandits inthe coming spring if such operations proved necessary after theUnited Nations Commission of Enquiry had performed its task.For this purpose the Chiefs of Staff had recommended that the combined strength of the Greek Army and gendarmerie should beincreased from 130,000 to 150,000 men and that the Army shouldbe reorganised and to some extent re-equipped. Some additionalequipment would also be required for the Greek Navy and for ther^^^^U   A U  T7^,^0^      Tt  ,,T^m        ______3  il.,t  a. ___1   _____-____vjrxcciv iiu JjOi.Cc.    n vvcio jjjujjuaeu mat tuc ciuun,iuiiai equipment required by the Greek Armed Forces should be made available from united Kingdom sources, provided that the Greek Governmentwould meet the additional cost, which for the period up to31st March, 1947, would amount to about  2 million. As regardsthe long-term problem of the future of the Greek Armed forces and the general question of establishing a stable economy in Greece,the Foreign Secretary recommended that there should be discussions with the United States Government with a view to ascertainingwhat part of the burden they would be willing to bear.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in his view, wtshould avoid any financial commitment to Greece after the end ofthe current financial year and should advise the Greek Governmenlto seek assistance from the International Bank for reconstruction and Development. In any event Greece could not afford to maintain an Army and gendarmerie of 150,000 men as a permanentforce.The Foreign Secretary said that he had it in mind that tingpermanent strength of the Army and gendarmerie might be aboutg70,000. The effectiveness of a force of this size would be great!&apos;increased if communications were improved and better communi!cations would help in the general rehabilitation of the country. HIagreed that the Greek Government should be encouraged to apply!to the International Bank.In further discussion it was suggested that there should be alcloser investigation by officials of the Departments concerned of til
economic survey foe1947.Employmentof Women.(previous reference erence:CM.(47)8thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Labour (CP. (47) 38) giving the further information about the scheme for the direction of women proposed in para-graphs 16-19 of CP. (47) 25, which had been asked for at their meeting on 16th January.The Minister of Labour said that, on the assumption thatmarried women would be exempted and that the only occupationsfrom which women would be withdrawn would be the metal,engineering and chemical industries, the distributive trades,catering, professional and personal services, entertainment andsport, the additional women made available for undermannedfinancial implications of the proposals for re-equipping the GreekArmed Forces to enable them to undertake operations against thebandits and of the problem of arranging for assistance for the rehabilitation of the Greek economy.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the British Forces in Greece should be reducedby 1st April, 1947, to one brigade of four battalions.These troops would remain in Greece until the with-drawal of Russian forces from Bulgaria, which was due to take place within ninety days after the ratifica-tion of the Treaty of Peace with Bulgaria.(2) Agreed in principle that the Greek Armed Forces shouldbe placed in a position to undertake operations againstthe bandits in the spring.(3) Agreed that the Greek Government should be encouraged to apply to the International Bank for reconstruction and Development for assistance towards the rehabilitation-tion of Greece.(4) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for a committeeof officials representing the Foreign Office, the treasury and the Ministry of Defence to consider (i) the financial implications of providing assistance to the GreekGovernment to enable their Armed Forces to undertakeoperations against the bandits, and (ii) what proposals should be put to the United States Government withregard to long-term financial, economic and military help for Greece.Turkey. The Foreign Secretary said that it was desirable that theTurkish Government should be persuaded to reorganise and re-equiptheir Army. The United States Government should be asked toundertake as large a share as possible of the expenditure whichthis would involve; and we should co-operate with the United StatesGovernment in advising the Turkish Government on the training and organisation of their Armed Forces. For this purpose british service representation in Turkey should be strengthened and, mean-while, the present limited supply of equipment should be continued.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he accepted theseproposals, on the understanding that the Turkish Government would pay either in gold or in goods for any equipment supplied beyond what had already been approved.In discussion it was suggested that the additional expenditure which would be incurred in strengthening British service repre-sentation in Turkey might also be met by the Turkish Government.The Cabinet- (5) Approved the proposals with regard to Turkey set out inparagraph 8 of CP. (47) 34, on the understanding thatthe Turkish Government would pay for any additional supplies of equipment and that the question of securingpayment for the cost of strengthening the British Servicerepresentation in Tnrkev would be considered.
occupations by the end of 1947 might amount to 45,000 if thescheme applied to women of 20 years of age and 58,000 if thescheme applied to women of 18. Some transfers of women fromtheir home areas would be necessary in any event and, if it were decided that women were to be directed mainly into the textile industries, much larger numbers would have to leave home.Problems of accommodation and of personal hardship would arise and there would be strong opposition from parents. In thesecircumstances, he felt that it would be unwise to proceed with thescheme.The President of the Board of Trade said that, in his view,the Minister of Labour had underestimated the number of women who would be made available by the scheme. If the period of service were fixed at two years, and if some at least of the 56,000 women notinsured under the Unemployment Insurance Act could be directedinto undermanned industries, the scheme should make available from100,000 to 150,000 women. Further, it should be possible to switchmost of the women from non-productive employment into occupa-tions of national importance without requiring them to leave their home areas. The alternative of trying to attract women into under-manned industries by raising wrages or reducing hours of work would merely lead employers in other industries to offer similar concessions with the result that the inflationary pressure would be---:a^AThe Foreign Secretary said that even during the war, when there had been general agreem Gilt  licit  ill women should undertakesome form of national service, it had been difficult to administer the scheme for the direction of women into industry, especiallywhere this involved transfer from their home areas. In particular,extremely awkward questions had arisen over the application of sanctions to women who refused to comply with directions. Thedifficulties would be accentuated in peace-time, and he was convincedthat any scheme on the lines proposed would break down.In further discussion, it was urged that, without paying higher wages, much could be done to attract women into undermannedindustries by arranging the hours of work so as to fit in with theirdomestic responsibilities, improving transport to and from workand providing better amenities in the factories. By these means, achange in the status of the undermanned industries could be made and, if it could be established that an industry such as cottonspinning was able to offer steady employment in reasonably goodconditions, this would be a much more effective way of securinglabour for it than the use of powers of direction, which would onlytend to make the industry unpopular.Other points in discussion were : (a) Both sides of the cotton industry had shown great reluctance to agree to changes designed to raise the status of the industry.(b) There had been too great a tendency in the past for teachersto inculcate into children the idea that manual occupations were tobe avoided. The Education Ministers should do what they could to reverse this tendency.(c) More might be done by the skilful use of publicity to attractwomen into undermanned industries.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had supported theproposed scheme for the direction of women as part of a bold pro-gramme designed to remedy the situation disclosed in the economic survey for 1947, The Cabinet had not, however, been willing to approve the other main elements in this programme, and he felt thatit would be impossible to proceed with the scheme for the direction ofwomen alone, &quot;rle must repeat his warning that the failure to takethe drastic action recommended by the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Planning might well lead the country into an extremelycritical situation.
95CM. 15 (4?)iforejgnLabour.the Entry ofLabour intoNon-ProductiveEmployments.Limitationof Week-daySportingEvents.White paper on theGeneralj^CouoHlicPosition.(previous reference:CM. (47) 11thConclusions,Minute 3.)The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that a scheme for the direction of women on thelines of the proposals in paragraphs 16-19 of CP. (47) 25would not be practicable.The Cabinet then considered whether the man-power shortagemight be relieved by a larger importation of foreign labour.The Minister of Labour said that it had been agreed that inthe first instance he should concentrate on obtaining female labour for domestic service in hospitals and similar institutions. Already1,000 displaced persons had been transferred to the United King-dom for this purpose and 1,000 were on their way, while the workof selecting a further 3,000 had started. In addition, about 7,000women had been admitted to the United Kingdom in order to take up dbmestic work in private households. A serious difficulty in theway of importing large numbers of displaced persons was theshortage of suitable accommodation for them.The general view of the Cabinet was that there should be amuch larger recruitment of suitable displaced persons in order tomeet the needs of undermanned industries, and that the present arrangement under which recruitment was virtually limited tofemale labour for domestic service in hospitals and similar institu-tions should be abandoned. Recruitment should not be limited to women, and skilled men who could undertake useful work in thiscountry should also be admitted.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Foreign Labour Committee to work out as amatter of urgency a scheme for recruiting suitable labour for undermanned industries and services from amongdisplaced persons in Europe, and agreed that the existinglimitation whereby recruitment was in practice limitedto women for domestic service in hospitals and similarinstitutions should be abandoned.The Minister of Food suggested that the possibility of restricting the entry of additional labour into non-productiveoccupations such as sport, entertainment and distribution should beconsidered. It might well be that no one method of achieving thisobject would be applicable to all employments, and it was desirablethat there should be an investigation to determine what could bedone by such means as higher taxation, reduction of profit marginsand other expedients.There was general agreement that an enquiry of this kind wouldbe useful.The Minister of Fuel and Power drew attention to the heavyloss of production caused by weekday football matches The ScottishFootball Association had agreed to abandon mid-week footballmatches in Scotland, but it had not so far been possible to obtain agreement on similar action in England and Wales.In discussion it was pointed out that now that so manyindustries were working a five-day week there was very little justi-fication for mid-week sporting events.The Cabinet (3) Invited the Ministerial Committee on Economic planning to consider what measures might be taken to restrict the entry of additional labour into non-productive occupa-tions and to limit the interference with productioncaused by mid-week sporting events.The Prime Minister explained that a first draft of the proposed white Paper on the general economic position would shortly beavailable. It seemed desirable that at this stage a small group ofivj-imsters should examine the draft, and he proposed that he himself together with the Lord Privy Seal, the Chancellor of theExchequer, the President of the Board of Trade, the Minister ofLabour and the Minister of Fuel and Power should examine thedraft at a meeting early in the following week.
Women&apos;sILand tomy.(previous reference erence:C.M.(47)9thConclusions,Minute 2.)6. At their meeting on 17th January the Cabinet had invited the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Secretary ofState for Scotland to review the organisation andJ conditions ofservice in the Women&apos;s Land Army.The Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries (CP. (47) 39) recommending that the Women&apos;s Land Army should not be continued beyondOctober, 1948; that meanwhile every effort should be made to keep up the numbers through recruiting publicity, and that there shouldbe no material change in the organisation or the conditions ofservice.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that theWomen&apos;s Land Army had been established to meet a special war-4&quot; inri i YY^orl o n rl o i&quot;1 &apos;V*AJoTl vomui i f or. in ninlir 4^tiaiv\ ivavh r*-r\ -i-r-rl-,-rir^rvn -.-..-!!,-.

Only 5,000of those eligible for release at the end of the war with germany had signed on for further service and about one-half of the presentmembership of roughly 30,000 were women with one year&apos;s service or less. He was convinced that it would be neither practicable nordesirable to try to maintain the Women&apos;s Land Army in beingindefinitely, but in view of the prospective labour difficulties forthe next year or two, he would try to continue it until the autumn of 1948; and in order to obtain new recruits and to retain existing members, he proposed to offer members of the Women&apos;s Land Armya week&apos;s paid holiday. It should be kept in mind that any additional concessions to the Women&apos;s Land Army would lead toresentment among the 59,000 other women agricultural workers who were not enrolled in the Women&apos;s Land Army because theywere employed in their home districts. The farmers preferred to employ male labour and, even when they had work suitable forwomen, would rather employ local women with an agriculturalbackground.  The Trade Unions did not look with much favour onThe Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that his experience as Chairman of an Agricultural Executive Committeehad led him to the conclusion that the Women&apos;s Land Army could&apos;have been made more popular if those responsible for organisms&apos;it had shown more enterprise and understanding. The agriculture ministers were proposing to embark on a policy of increased live-stock production which would make large demands on labour ata time when the available supply was dwindling through there patriation of German prisoners of war. Women were speciallysuitable for employment in such branches of the livestock industry as poultry-keeping, and he urged strongly that further efforts shouldbe made to retain the Women&apos;s Land Army in being and to increaseiV ft fJ-ioTwnrrli-fToiTio&apos; mpssiirp rvf r fin PCS ni SJltlQUIn further discussion it was suggested that the objection to giving members of the Women&apos;s Land Army preferential treatmentover other women agricultural workers might be overcome by arranging that all women agricultural workers should be eligiblefor enrolment but that only women who were willing to undertake work away from their home area should receive special privileges.The Cabinet Invited the Agriculture Ministers, in consultation withthe Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and theMinister of Labour and National Service, to consider inthe light of the discussion what arrangements should bemade to enable women to be employed most effectively inagriculture.&apos;&quot;i-&quot;r&quot; &quot;Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,30th January, 1947.The Cabinet (4) Took note of the arrangements proposed by the PrimeMinister for the examination by Ministers of the draft white Paper on the economic situation.
