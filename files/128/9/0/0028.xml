Town and country planning.CompensationonCompulsoryAcquisitionof Land.1. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP. (47) 82) and the Minister of Town and country planning (CP. (47) 83) proposing that when land is acquired com-pulsorily by public authorities compensation should be assessed by reference to current market value instead of 1939 value.The Cabinet were informed that the Chancellor of theExchequer was proposing, on the recommendation of the war damage Commission, to invite Parliament to approve an Orderproviding for a percentage increase in value payments under theWar Damage Act. Once this had been done, it would be impossibleto justify paying only 1939 value for land compulsorily acquired by public authorities; and, as the method of a percentage increase was not applicable to these cases and it was desirable to find abasis which would not have to be changed again within a year ortwo, it was proposed that compensation for compulsory acquisitionshould in future be assessed by reference to current market value,with the qualification that, where that value included the right to immediate or early possession and the owner was not himself occupy-ing the premises, the value of the right to possession would be excluded. The Chancellor of the Exchequer had proposed that where the owner of the property was in occupation, he should beentitled to full market value; but, after discussion with the Ministerof Town and Country Planning, he had agreed that the compensa-tion payable to owner-occupiers should include only one-half of thedifference between full market value and market value excluding the value of the right to possession. This would be a rough and ready way of excluding any element attributable to the presentscarcity of vacant property.In discussion there was general agreement that it would benecessary to amend the existing law with regard to compensationfor the compulsory acquisition of land by public authorities, andthere was considerable support for the method agreed on by theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Toavu and country planning.On the other hand, The President of the Board of Trade urgedthat many anomalies would arise if compensation were assessed by reference to the right of immediate or early possession. This pro-posal took no account of the distinction between the rise in propertyvalues due to the fall in the value of money and that due to thescarcity of vacant property, and its adoption in the present disturbedstate of the property market would be particularly unfortunate.There was the further objection that the treatment proposed for owner-occupiers seemed to involve accepting the principle, whichhad hitherto been resisted, that compensation should provide forreinstatement.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should pro-ceed to seek Parliamentary approval for an Order pro-viding for a percentage increase in value payments underthe War Damage Act;(2) Agreed that some corresponding increase should be madein the compensation payable on the compulsory acquisi-tion of land by public authorities; and invited the Com-pensation and Betterment Sub-Committee of the lord presidents Committee to consider the points raised inthe Cabinet&apos;s discussion and to settle the method bywhich this increase should be given.[33397-2]
Prisoners ofWar.&quot;Repatriation.(previous reference:C.M.(46)81stConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Cabinet considered two telegrams from the foreign secretary (Moscow telegrams Nos. 37 and 39 of 12th March) urginggreater expedition in the repatriation of German prisoners of warand in the dispersal of para-military formations in the British zone of Germany.In the first of these telegrams the Foreign Secretary stated thatat the meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers on 12th Marchhe had offered to furnish a return of the numbers of german prisoners still in British custody and the dates of their proposedrepatriation, provided that the Soviet Government would tablecorresponding information about the German prisoners held by them.It was of great importance that we should secure the early returnto Germany of the substantial numbers of German prisoners stillin Russian hands, and the Foreign Secretary wished to make themost of the opportunity afforded by the Russians&apos; acceptance ofhis proposal for this exchange of information. He therefore askedfor immediate authority to disclose the numbers G^rmpn prisoT?f?*ain our hands and the rate at which they were to be repatriated. he also urged that the Cabinet should expedite the existing programmes of repatriation and suggested, in particular, that all german prisoners now in the Middle East should be repatriated bv June1947.In supporting the Foreign Secretary&apos;s request, The Ministerof State said that from the Foreign Office point of view there v?n:dr!be great advantage in expediting the repatriation of german prisoners. United States opinion was sensitive about our continuinguse of prisoner labour. We were anxious to bring pressure to bearon the Soviet Government to reduce the numbers of german prisoners still held in the Soviet Un&quot;ion. And we were ourselvesfinding increasing difficulty in maintaining the substantial numbersof displaced persons who were still a charge on us in Austria,Germany and Italy. Why should we not meet our man-powerdifficulties by putting these displaced persons to profitable employ-ment in place of German prisoners, who could much more readily be absorbed in their own country?The Minister of Agriculture stressed the extent to which foodproduction in this country depended on the continued employmentof German prisoners, and said that he would deprecate any hastydecision to accelerate the planned rate of repatriation of these prisoners. There was no assurance that their place in agriculturecould be taken by Poles or displaced persons, and in any event mostof these would have to be trained before they could effectively replaceexisting prisoner labour. The Secretary of State for Scotland andThe Minister of Labour endorsed these views.It was suggested that the Foreign Secretary&apos;s difficulties wouldbe eased if German prisoners who were willing to volunteer for employment in this country were allowed to remain here as civilians.It was the view of the Cabinet that, subject to any securityobjections to particular individuals, this should now be allowed.As regards the Middle East, the Cabinet were informed thatthere were now about 87,000 German prisoners in this area, all ofwhom were employed in labouring work furthering the withdrawalof the British Forces from Egypt to the Canal Zone. The foreign secretary was mistaken in thinking that they swelled the total ofour overseas military expenditure : on the contrary, if their services were not available, the work which they were doing would have tobe done, at higher cost, by local labour or by additional Britishtroops. There was a phased programme for their repatriation as our military installations in the Canal Zone were completed; andall the prisoners in this area would have been repatriated by July1948. The military authorities in the Middle East^would be askedto consider accepting the 12,000 Chetniks now in Italy in replace-ment of a corresponding number of these German prisoners; but itwas unlikely that there would be further scope for the exchangeof displaced persons for German prisoners in this area..
Para-inilitaryFormations inBritish zone of Germany.(previous reference:CM; (46) 104thConclusions,Minute 7.)The Cabinet- (1) Agreed that the Foreign Secretary should disclose to theCouncil of Foreign Ministers detailed information ofthe numbers of German prisoners of war still in Britishhands and the rate at which these were to be repatriated;and should be authorised to say that the possibility ofincreasing this rate of repatriation would be consideredby His Majesty&apos;s Government in the light of the informa-tion provided by the Soviet and French Governmentsabout the rate at which they intended to repatriate theGerman prisoners still in their hands;(2) Invited the Minister of State to communicate to the foreign secretary the latest figures of German^ prisoners inBritish custody, and to inform him of Uonclusion (I)above;(3) Invited the Minister of Labour and the Home Secretarvto make immediate arrangements for enabling german prisoners of war who were willing to volunteer for civil employment in essential industries in this country toremain here for that purpose on a civilian basis on thesame terms as other ex-enemy aliens, subject to anysecurity objections to particular individuals.In telegram No. 39 the Foreign Secretary referred to the embarrassment caused in the discussions at Moscow by our continued,retention of para-military organisations of Germans and other foreign nationals for mine clearance and labouring work of various kinds in the British Zone of Germany. Over 80,000 german prisoners of war were retained for these purposes in formationsunder the command of German officers; and in addition there wasa Watchmen&apos;s corps of 14,000 ex-soldiers of various nationalities.The other Foreign Ministers could not be persuaded that these werenot military formations. The Foreign Secretary said that he wouldbe greatly assisted, in his discussions at Moscow, if the cabinet could decide that these formations should be finally dissolved by theend of 1947 and that meanwhile their work should be progressivelytaken over by displaced persons and others on a civilian basis.Thethey werebe converted to a civilian basis by of the military formation of Royalist Yugoslavs Avould also be com-pleted by that date.The Vice-Chief of Naval Staff said that the Royal Navy were responsible for a German mine-sweeping force now totalling 12,644.In view of the nature of its duties it was essential that this shouldbe a uniformed and disciplined force. It would be disbanded assoon as all the mines had been swept. It had been hoped that this work would be completed by the summer of 1947, but operationshad been delayed by the severe winter weather. This force includedthose engaged in sweeping mines in the territorial waters of denmark and Holland. In addition the Royal Navy controlledMarine Dienstgruppen, employing 3,000 men, engaged mainly inthe maintenance of the German mine-sweepers, it was proposedto disperse this force in the course of the next few months.The Cabinet-(4) Took note that the Dienstgruppen and other para-militaryformations in the British Zone of Germany would be either dissolved or converted to a civilian basis by theend of 1947;(5) Invited the Minister of State to communicate to the foreign secretary in Moscow the information given to theCabinet about these formations, as summarised above;and to inform him that he was authorised to assure theCouncil of Foreign Ministers that these formationswould have been dispersed or converted to a civilianbasis by the end of 1947.Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that, so far as: under the control of the Army, these Dienstgruppen couldThp ^uii3[;ci oai.[33397-2]
Transport 3.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of bill. Transport (CP. (47) 84) seeking guidance on the question whetherLimitation the provisions of the Transport Bill restricting the operation ofcf.&quot; q &quot;&apos; &quot; C,&quot; licence vehicles should be modified or abandoned in viewLicences. of the strong opposition which they had aroused.(Previous j&apos;he Minister of Transport said that these provisions were reference: supported by the transport workers&apos; unions and by his officialC.M.(46)64th advisers, who were impressed by the danger that without suchConclusions, restrictions &quot; C &quot; licence holders would be able to throw upon the minute 4.) public haulage system the less remunerative traffic. On the otherhand, both in Parliament and in the country there was very strong opposition to the proposed restrictions; and, although the majorityof the Government supporters on the Standing Committee favouredtheir retention, he believed that among all Uovernment supporters in the House there would be a majority against the restrictions.He himself was inclined to modify Clause 57 (3) of the Bill on thelines suggested in the Annex to CP. (47) 84, which would go someway to meet the opposition. Unless, however, the Cabinet were determined to adhere to the proposals as so modified even in the face of strong opposition which was to be expected in the Houseof Lords, it woulcf be better to drop them altogether. In that event,he would propose to inform the transport workers&apos; unions before he gave notice of the necessary amendments.In discussion there was general agreement that the wiser course was to abandon the proposals altogether. This would not preclude the Government from introducing further legislation at a later date to control the operation of &quot; C &quot; licence vehicles if events showed that their exemption from restrictions was being abused to the detriment of the public haulage system.The Cabinet-Agreed that the provisions of the Transport Bill ^restricting the operation of &quot; C &quot; licence vehicles should be abandoned.Parliament. 4.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in     the House of Commons in the following week.the House of On 17th March the Air Estimates would be taken.Commons. On 18th March the Navy Estimates would be taken.On 19th March there would be a debate on the. distribution ofMan-power, on the Report Stage of the Civil Vote on Account.Questions were likely to be raised about the labour force in agricul-ture, and the Agriculture Ministers should be in attendance.On 20th March, after the Report Stage of the Navy, Army andAir Estimates, which would be taken formally, there would be a debate on a Government Motion inviting the House to approve theStatement Relating to Defence (Cmd. 7042). The Opposition hadnot, as previously contemplated (CM. (47) 24th Conclusions,Minute 1), taken the opportunity of discussing in the debate on theEconomic Survey for 1947 (Cmd. 7046) the proportion of our totalresources to be allotted to Defence; and they now desired a separateopportunity of discussing the Defence White Paper.   Theoiabinetrecognised that, unless this was carefully handled, it might produce an awkward Parliamentary situation which would increase theForeign Secretary&apos;s difficulties in the discussions on the Council ofForeign Ministers at Moscow. The Minister of Defence was invitedto ensure that these dangers were appreciated by government supporters and by the Opposition leaders.On 21st March the House/ would take the Committee and remaining stages of the Isle of Man Harbours Bill, the Naval Forces(Enforcement of Maintenance Liabilities) Bill, a Motion to approve the War Damage (Increase of Value Payments) Order, 1947, andthe Second Reading of the Public Offices (Site) Bill.
Parliament.Select -Committee onParliamentaryProcedure.(previous reference:C.M.(46)23rdConclusions,Minute 7.)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord privy seal (CP. (47) 78) on the recommendations made in the third report of the Select Committee on Procedure.The Lord Privy Seal said that these recommendations had first been examined by the Machinery of Government (parliamentary procedure) Sub-Committee, whose report was annexed to his memo-randum. That report had in turn been considered by a ministerial committee appointed by the Prime Minister. The Ministerial Com-mittee endorsed the Sub-Committee&apos;s views, subject to certain modifications set out in paragraph 3 of CP. (47) 78; and they proposed that the Government&apos;s conclusions should be announced in a Parliamentary statement in the terms set out in Annex I tothat memorandum.In discussion the following points were raised : (a) It was proposed that the Government should indicate thatwhen Private Members&apos; time could be restored they would favour the introduction of a scheme on the lines proposed by the SelectIt was the view of the Cabinet that serious consideration wouldhave to be given to the possibility of restoring Private Members&apos;time in the 1947-48 Session, The Lord Privy Seal said that onthis point he intended to put proposals before the Cabinet whenthey considered in the following week the principal features of theLegislative Programme for that Session.(b) It was proposed that the Government should put beforethe House, unless Mr. Speaker held strong objection to it, a proposalto abolish the present restrictions on the power of the Chairmanof Ways and Means and the Deputy Chairman to accept the closure.The Chief Whip explained that Mr. Speaker had been con-suited and was not in favour of this change. He believed the point to be one of great constitutional importance; and he thought thatthe proposed change would be highly controversial and of littlepractical value. In the Speaker&apos;s hands this power was an impor-tant safeguard for minorities in the House, and to share this power with others would undermine the status and authority of the speaker. The argument from procedure in Committee was notvalid, as discussion in Committee was not limited. Finally, theChairman of Ways and Means and the Deputy Chairman were members of a political Party and open to the charge of grantingthe closure on Party grounds. For these reasons, Mr. Speaker would prefer that there should be no change in the existing procedure onthis point; but he was ready to give an assurance that, if theGovernment thought it important that the closure should be movedat any time when he was temporarily absent from the House, hewould do his utmost to return to the House in order to deal withthe matter. On occasions when he was unavoidably absent, andthis had been announced, his deputies already had power to acceptthe closure.iii was tile view o-i &amp;ne OctOHi^u tucit li Dnis pioposax were pressed, especially at the present time, it would arouse acutecontroversy in Parliament, In these circumstances, and in view ofMr. Speaker&apos;s attitude, it would be preferable not to put thisproposal forward. The Chief Whip should so inform Mr. speaker and make it clear that the Government intended to rely on hisassurance that he would do his utmost to return to the House if on any occasion when he was temporarily absent the government thought it important that the closure should be moved.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Government should not put forward the&quot;proposal to abolish the present restrictions on the powerof the Chairman of Ways and Means and the deputy chairman to accept the closure;
(2) Subiect to Conclusion (1) above, approved the recommen-dations made in CP. (47) 78 and invited the Lord privy seal to arrange for the Government^ conclusions to be announced in Parliament in the terms of the draft setout in Annex I to CP. (47) 78, subject- to the omission of any reference to the second of the government proposals which had been rejected by the SelectCommittee.opOrc.(previous reference:CM. (47) 14thConclusions,Minute 5.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Hometary (CP. (47) 86) reporting the results of meetings which,at the request of the Fuel Committee, he, the Secretary of Statefor Scotland and the Minister of Fuel and Power had held withrepresentatives of various forms of sport with a view to limiting the number of mid-week sporting events which interfered with industrial production.The Home Secretary said that the representatives consultedhad shown a due appreciation of the seriousness of the situation.So far as concerned football, it had been agreed that from17th March all mid-week matches would be cancelled, except possibly a few matches between boys which would not attract largecrowds.   This would involve extending the football season until theend ot iviav.ultafions were to*e held, about toe. and New Zealand1947-48 season, for which tours bv South AfricaiRugby teams were planned.As regards greyhound racing, the Betting and Lotteries Act,1934, provided that racing might take place only on four Bankholidays and on two days in each week fixed by the licensing authorities, which in some areas did not include Saturdays. Thegreyhound-racing representatives had been tola that the Govern-ment would introduce legislation as soon as possible to authoriseracing at all tracks on Saturdays only; and the Home Secretaryfurther recommended that this legislation should permit the holding of two meetings on each Saturday. The Minister of Fuel and power was prepared to relax the ban on the use of electricity at greyhound-racing tracks on Saturdays.The main difficulty about speedway rasing was that many ofthe meetings were held at greyhound-racing tracks and if twogreyhound-racing meetings were to be held on Saturdays it wouldbe impossible for speedway racing to be held on Saturdays at thesetracks. The Auto-Cycle Union had, however, been told that theGovernment could not allow meetings to be held on other days, andthe Union were to try to reach an agreement with the greyhound racing Association for some Saturday use of the tracks.Attendances at ice hockey matches were normally small andhe had agreed with his colleagues that no restrictions need be placedon mid-week ice hockey. For the same reason he thought it unnecessary to interfere with lawn tennis. These views wereendorsed by the Cabinet.As regards horse racing, the National Hunt Committee had agreed that the date of the Grand National should be altered fromFriday, 28th, to Saturday, 29th March, and the representatives ofthe Jockey Club had offered to draw up a revised programme underwhich meetings which attracted very large crowds would be heldon Saturdays.The Fuel Committee had not considered the possibility oxlimiting mid-week cricket and no consultation had taken place withthe M.C.C. This point had, however, been raised by the represen-tatives of the other sports. Any general prohibition of mid-weekcricket would involve suspending County cricket altogether andcancelling the Test Matches with South Africa which had beenarranged for next season. The M.G.C. might, however, be asked what measures could be taken to reduce the risk of loss of industrial production through the holding of Test Matches in the comingseason.   The Cabinet endorsed this view.
Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,IBth March. 1947.In discussion the following points were raised: (a) The Minister of Defence said that- he was concerned aboutthe consequences of cancelling all mid-week football matches. Thiswould deprive many workers, particularly in the distributive trades,of their normal recreation. Moreover, football clubs might suffera considerable loss of revenue and this would affect the current negotiations about the wages of professional footballers.(b) It was suggested that the holding of two greyhound-racingmeetings on a Saturday was undesirable on the ground that thiswould encourage those who attended to risk more money than theycould afford.As against this it was pointed out- that at present the lawallowed racing on 104 days in the year, plus four Bank holidays;and that, as the main object was to avoid interference with produc-tion, the proposal that two meetings should be held on each&quot; Saturdayshould be accented.(c) It would be inadvisable for the Government to suggest thatcricket matches might be played on Sundays, and the suggestion of the greyhound racing interests that greyhound racing meetingsshould be permitted on Sundays should be rejected.The Cabinet-(1) Took note with approval of the arrangements for the limita-tion of mid-week snorting&apos; event-? &quot;which the HomeSecretary and his colleagues had made with the football,speedway racing and horse-racing interests;(2) Agreed that legislation should be introduced at once toenable two greyhound-racing meetings to take place atall tracks on Saturdays and to limit meetings to that day: and that, meanwhile, electricity might be used atgreyhound-racing tracks on Saturdays;(3) Invited the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forScotland and the Minister of Fuel and Power to discuss with the M.C.C. whether it would be possible to re-arrange the time-tables for the Test Matches with SouthAfrica with a view to reducing the risk of loss of indus-trial production;(4) Invited^the Home Secretary to announce these decisions inthe House of Commons later in the day; and took note that the Minister of Labour would simultaneously informhis Joint Consultative Council.
