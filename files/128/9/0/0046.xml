Germany.Fusion ofBritish and united StatesZones.(previous reference erence:CM. (47) 42ndConclusions,Minute 8.)29CM. m (47)1. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that theMilitary Governor of the British Zone of Germany was arriving in London that day, with his Chief of Staff and Political Adviser,to confer with him and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasteron the difficulties which had arisen in implementing the agreement for the economic fusion of the British and United States Zones.The immediate problem was to find means)f increasing foodTon Axxvi (*^Lr\-\Tf\-r&apos;Ti m aii 4-c- ------iwui v/ r v/x j-iiixvnt-vm o   r\t-i r\   ^4-   i- Y\ r........ . .supplies in the Zones; for without this no increase in industrial production could be expected.In the course of a preliminary discussion, it was suggested thatthe devolution of administrative responsibility to the germans might have involved some loss of efficiency in the collection of food from the country districts. It might be that in the United StatesZone devolution had been pressed too fast and too much powers iA an&apos;o raA   f r\  f heto be examined.As regards imported food, the Cabinet were informed thatGermany had been given high priority in the allocation of wheatshipments from the United States in recent months; but her supply position would continue to be precarious during the months of june and July. The Minister of Food said that he must continue to keep a careful watch on these diversions, while United Kingdom stocksr\-P wKoot  onri Ann t* romorriDri  q ir tiharv Tv^Diccnl 1r*-*xr 1 mm! *  o -n A      n ttTnn 1 A\J J.     tr -LJ-v^X^tj-   itiiti   -lj-w u. j,    j- waj1i*^jj.aj.v--v^.  t*       ujiWJ. j.    jj *. vuvjlIV   WVr    X^y v LCXIU   &apos;XX^    vv U U-XtU.keep in touch with the Foreign Secretary on this- aspect of theXlCt U LU1 .The Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Ukraine.Establishmentof diplomatic relations.(previous reference:W.M.(44)72ndConclusions,Minute 7.)2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (47) 153) seeking authority to propose that diplo-matic relations should now be established.between the Ukraine andthe United Kingdom.The Foreign Secretary said that the War Cabinet had decided in 1944 that the question of according diplomatic recognition to theconstituent Republics of the Soviet Union should be postponed untilthe peace settlement. The Governments of the Dominions and ofthe United States had concurred in that view at the time; and weshould be obliged to consult them before we adopted a differentpolic3&apos;&apos;. He was, however, satisfied that from our point of view the balance of advantage now lay on the side of establishing diplo-matic relations, with the Ukraine. Neither the United Kingdomnor the Dominions had any representatives in the Soviet Unionoutside Moscow; but the Soviet Government had diplomatic orconsular representatives in seven centres throughout the Common-wealth. Thus, taking the Commonwealth as a whole, the balancewas heavily in favour of the Soviet Union. The establishment of diplomatic relations with the Ukraine would provide us with a source of information about an area of the Soviet Union which was of great economic and military importance; it would give us anothercentre in the Soviet Union for diplomatic contacts and the spread ofcultural influence; and it would enable us to see how the Sovietmachinery of government worked outside Moscow. If a proposalfor the exchange of diplomatic representatives was made andrefused, this would help to expose the unreality of the Ukraine&apos;spretensions to independence and would strengthen our arguments for opposing the separate representation of other constituentRepublics of the Soviet Union on international bodies.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) We should try to check any attempt to use the diplomaticrecognition of the Ukraine as a pretext for excessive additions tothe staff of the Soviet Embassy in London.[33688-1] b 2
(5) If a British diplomatic post were established in the Ukraine,it should include an &quot;efficient agricultural attache.(c) Was it reasonable that the Russians should maintain their.refusal to allow&apos; British - consular representatives in the&apos; soviet union? When British trade with Russia was resumed, we should press for the appointment of British consular representatives atLeningrad, and possibly other Russian ports, to look after theinterests of British seamen.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposal that diplomatic rela-tions should now be established between the Ukraine andthe-United Kingdom.(2) Invited &apos;the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs toinform Dominion Governments, and the Foreign Secre-tarir to inform the&apos; United States Government of our intention to make this proposal and give them an oppor-tunitv for comment before the approach was made tothe Government of the Ukraine.(3) Authorised the Foreign Secretary, in the light of the consultations mentioned in Conclusion (2) above, to put the proposal to the Ukrainian Government through theMinistry for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union.international labour conference.Social Policyin dependent territories.3. The Cabinet had before them. a memorandum by theMinister of Labour (CP. (47) 149) on the action to be taken by HisMajesty&apos;s Government on the Recommendation (No. 74) on social policy in dependent territories adopted at the 27th Session of theInternational Labour Conference.The Minister ofLabour said that the text of the Recommenda-tion had already been presented to Parliament in Cmd. 6828.Though the Recommendation was generally acceptable, there were certain details (including nr particular&apos; the references to &quot; equal remuneration for men and women for work of equal value &quot;) whichit Would not be easy Tor-His Majesty&apos;s Government to apply atthe present time. Moreover, the International Labour conference would be considering at their Geneva meeting&apos;in-June-July 1947a number of the subjects covered in this&apos; Recohimendation with aview to adopting International Labour Conventions which wouldsupersede it in certain respects; He therefore proposed that a white Paper should be presented to Parliament,; in terms of thedraft ^annexedtoCP. (47) 149, intimating general agreement withthe Recommendation, but stating that His Ma j esty&apos; s government proposed to defer a final decision on it until the results of the next session of the International Labour Conference were known. Thiscourse would avoid committing His Ma j esty&apos;s Government^ toapplying the Recommendation if it were not adopted by otherGovernments.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he was inagreement with the course proposed.The Cabinet- - . fAuthorised the Minister of Labour to present to parliamentary White Paper in the terms of the draft annexed to cp. (47) 149.
Radioactive 4.   The Cabinet were informed that the Second Heading ofSubstances the Radioactive Substances Bill in the House of Lords had beenBill. postponed because there appeared to be considerable opposition tothose of its provisions which made the possession of radioactivesubstances subject to licence and conferred wide powers to make regulations for preventing injury to the health of industrial workers who be affected by radioactive substances.   In view of the congestion of business in the House of Lords, it bad been thought desirable to postpone the Second Reading in order to ascertain whether the objections raised could be met. The Minister of Healthhad since arranged to meet Lord Gherweli, who was leading theopposition to the Bill, and it was his intention to propose theaddition of a new Clause providing for the appointment of ascientific advisory committee, the members of which would be nominated after consultation with representative scientific bodies.This Committee would advise Ministers on the exercise of their powers under the Bill. It was hoped that a concession on these lines would enable the Bill to proceed as a non-contentious measure bothin the House of Lords and in the House of Commons.Cabinet Office, S.TV. 1,13th May, 1947.
