Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenBusiness in in the ttouse of Commons in the week following the Whitsun Recess,the House of On 3rd June the Report Stage and Third Reading of the commons.      Industrial Organisation Bill would be taken.On 4th and 5th June the Report Stage of the Agriculture bill would be taken. In these debates the Minister of Agriculture wouldbe assisted by the Solicitor-General and the Paymaster-General.On 6th June the Second Reading of the Companies Bill wouldbe taken. The President of the Board of Trade would have theassistance of a Law Officer in this debate.During the week opportunity would be taken to obtain theCommittee Stage of an Income Tax Resolution relating to the armed forces, and the Second Reading of the Education (Exemptions)(Scotland) Bill.2, The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (47) 160) reporting the results of the consultations which he had held with other Ministers concerned, in pursuance ofthe Cabinet&apos;s decision of 15th. May, about the proposed erection ofa power station at Bankside, Southwark.The Lord President said that, after reviewing all the relevant considerations, he and his colleagues had decided to advise theCabinet to reaffirm the decision to proceed with the erection of an oil-fired power station on this site. They wished, however, to drawspecial attention to two considerations which had not previously been brought to the Cabinets notice. First, oil-firing would addsubstantially to the generating costs : at present prices of oil and coal, the additional cost was estimated at  450,000 a year. Althoughon this occasion the amenity advantages of oil-firing would warrant the additional cost, this was a point which Ministers should notoverlook when considering whether other power stations shouldbe fired by oil or by coal. Secondly, as oil contained more sulphurthan coah&apos; the problem of eliminating the sulphur from the fumeswas greater at an oil-fired station. The technical experts were,however, satisfied that it would be possible to solve this problem at the Bankside station.In discussion the following points were made: (a) As regards the increased operating costs, it was suggestedthat price increases were likely to be greater for coal than for oil;and that on this account tihe margin between operating on oil and operating on coal, was likely to become less. In any event, therewere advantages in having at least one oil-fired power station onthe Thames.&apos; (b) It seemed likely that the Fine Arts Commission wouldpronounce against this project. Their proper concern was, however,with questions of design; and the Government would be entitled to disregard objections taken by them on planning grounds.(c) The Minister of Health said that his other public dutieshad prevented him from taking part in the Lord Presidents con-saltations on this matter. He still regretted the original decisionto proceed with this project; but he agreed- that it would! be inexpedient for the Government to reverse that decision at this; stage. . &apos;.

Germany.Level ofIndustry.(previous reference:C.M.(47)43rdConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (47) 163) on the level of German industry.The Minister -of State said that in the current discussions inBerlin the Americans had proposed that the level of german industry in the British and American Zones should be raised to85 or 90 per cent, of the 1936 level and that the ceiling for steel production should be fixed at million tons for internal consump-tion and 1 million tons for export. This proposal had been examined by a working party of officials, whose report was annexed to cp. (47) 163. They considered that a ceiling of 13t million tons ayear for German steel production would constitute a potential danger to world security. It would also have two subsidiary conse-quences disadvantageous to the United Kingdom : first, it wouldenable German exports to compete in due course with UnitedKingdom exports; and secondly, it might reduce to negligible pro-portions the steel plants which could be made available to us byway of reparations. The working party therefore recommendedthat we should continue to urge that German steel production shouldbe limited to 10 million tons a year and that we should in no circumstances agree to a level of more than 11 million tons. TheForeign Secretary endorsed these recommendations as a basis forfurther negotiations in Berlin.The Minister of State added that, if it were agreed that the permitted level of German steel production should be raised to10 or 11 million tons, it would become necessary, in order to preservea proper industrial balance in Germany, to revise the agreed level for certain other industries. He asked for authority to settle theseconsequential changes in consultation with the Departmentsconcerned.The Minister of Health argued that the higher figure proposedby the United States should be accepted. He saw no justification for limiting Germany&apos;s steel production on security grounds:inspection at the finishing end of the industry would be a more effective means of preventing the misuse of Germany&apos;s steel capacity.Restriction in the interests of British exports was even harder tojustify at a time when the demands for steel, both in this countryand throughout Europe, far exceeded the supply. The policy proposed would retard reconstruction and alienate the Germanpeople.As against this, it was pointed out that it was the settled policyof the Allied Powers to reduce Germany&apos;s war potential by restriet-ing the capacity of her key industries. It was doubtful whether any system of inspection would provide sufficiently effective safe-guards. The German steel industry had formed the basis of Naziaggression and we could not disregard the natural fear of theinvaded countries that history might repeat itself. In any eventGermany&apos;s actual output of steel would not in practice reach the ceiling proposed for many years to come. The raising of this ceilingwould not enable her to contribute any more towards the currentshortage of steel. Steel plant transferred from Germany by wayof reparations could be brought into production in this countryfar earlier than it could in Germany.The Cabinet Approved the recommendations in the Annex to cp. (47) 163 as a basis for further negotiations in Berlinfor the revision of the permitted level of German steel production in the British and American Zones; and authorised the Minister of State to settle in consultationwith the Departments concerned any consequential changesin the permitted level of production of other Germanindustries.
5.   The Cabinet had before them (i) a memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(CP. (47) 150) on the numbers and cost of the CivilService; and(ii) a memorandum by the Minister without Portfolio(CP. (47) 164) reporting the conclusions of the social services Committee on the proposed merger of the local and regional staffs of the Ministry of National insurance and the Assistance Board.The Cabinet first considered the proposal in CP. (47) 150 that by the end of 1947 the present numbers of non-industrial civilservants should be reduced by 36,000.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, after making allallowances for the new work which the Civil Service had had to[33688 4] b 3Oisil Service.Man-Powerand pay claims.(previous preference:CM. (47) 38thConclusions,Minute 6.)Japan. 4.   The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs reported that peace :dere had recently been indications that the United States Govern-Settlement. m&amp;at intended to initiate discussions regarding the peace settlement with Japan. As it was essential that we should know the viewsof the Dominion Governments on both the procedure and thesubstance of the settlement before we entered into international discussions, he had thought it desirable to try to arrange a Common-wealth meeting for this purpose. At the same time the australian government had proposed that such a Conference should be heldis Canberra. In view of the difficulties which this would present for United Kingdom Ministers, he had considered whether informal discussions might be arranged in New York at tihe time of theGeneral Assembly of the United Nations in September. HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington had now, however, reportedthat the United States Government might decide to make an earlymove, and it was important that they should not commit themselvespublicly on major issues of procedure or substance both he andthe Foreign Secretary, for instance, felt that the Council of foreign ministers was not a suitable body for handling this question andthat the preliminary conference should include the eleven Powersrepresented on the Far Eastern Commission, together with South-V T f  Tin.

U10V.UOOV/U       UliO      lULl.Ot; V uu        *n lull       ^LL^ZDominion High Commissioners on the previous day, and it was theirunanimous view that a Commonwealth Conference should besunimoned at the earliest practicable date and that, in the meantime,&quot;lie United States Government should be asked to defer making anvpronouncement on the matter. The general view of that meeting had been that it was desirable, for Commonwealth reasons, thatthe Conference should be held in Canberra. He had made it clear to idem that, in that event, the Prime Minister and the foreign secretary would be unable to take part. He considered, however,that the wishes of the Dominion Governments in this matter shouldbe met: and in the circumstances he suggested that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should be represented at this Conference by theMinister of State and himself. The object of the Conference, whichwould take place at the end of August, would be to exchange views;there would be no attempt to develop an agreed policy. Therehad not so far been an opportunity to consult the Foreign secretary on this proposal.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, subjectto the concurrence of the Foreign Secretary, to informthe Australian Government that their proposal for a commonwealth Conference in Canberra for discussionof the Japanese peace settlement was acceptable to his majesty&apos;s  j esty&apos;s Government;(2) Agreed that His Majesty&apos;s Government should be repre-sented at the proposed Conference by the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs and the Minister of State.
undertake, fie felt that the present numbers could not be justified.For example, as shown in the Appendix to CP. (47) 150, the civilstaffs of the three Service Departments now exceeded by 58,000the numbers employed in 1930, even though the Ministry of supply had since taken over many functions which in 1939 had been carriedout by the War Office and the Air Ministry. He did not believethat these figures bore any relation to the realities of our defence policy or our economic situation and he was convinced that they ought to be substantially reduced.   At the Cabinet&apos;s meeting ontZ^dJJU -CLUill lin iLiaii) uiciu.c 10 ucax   uu.au mo  yyo,o SOu Satisfied. Wltilthe results achieved by the Civil Service ManJPower Committee;and, in view of the claims for higher pay for civil servants withwhich he was faced, he had been impelled to bring before theCabinet his proposal for a drastic cut in the present strength ofthe Civil Service.The Prime Minister recalled that on 22nd April the Cabinetuau auucpLcu oiic view lcauiicu uiic \_yiVii service iYian-irowerCommittee after a detailed investigation that no substantial reduc-tion in staffs could be expected while the Civil Service had tocarry out its present tasks. The memorandum now circulated bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer did not show in which Departmentsstaff economies might be made, nor did it bring forward any relevant facts which had hot been before the Cabinet on 22nd April, andit was therefore difficult to see any justification for the proposalfor a global cut of 5 per cent. It was impossible Lo carry out suchGovernment policies as socialisation, bulk purchase and economic controls without employing large numbers of civil servants. While,therefore, all practicable economies should be sought, ministers should be prepared to defend a substantial increase in the size ofthe Civil Service.The Home Secretary said that he would be glad to discuss withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer whether any further staff economiescould be made, but be could not accept the proposal for a globaluui   i^x   *J   j^^-f-   ooi-lu.,    ?vxj.jlL/jj.   yyO.ii.xu   uo  cULti. Vwxtjliu   \j\J:   Qj %jx   ctJJUUL13 per cent, on those Departments in which any staff reductionswere possible.In further discussion there was general support for the viewthat the question of further staff economies must be pursued by theCivil Service Man-Power Committee on the basis of the needs ofparticular Departments and that a global percentage cut on thelines suggested, by the Chancellor of the Exchequer was impracticable.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to discuss withthe Home Secretary what further steps could be takento secure staff economies, having regard to the tasks which Departments were discharging in pursuance ofGovernment policv.XT 1/The Cabinet then considered the proposals in CP. (47) 150 fordealing with the pay claims made by civil servants.The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that the staff associations had for some time been&apos; pressing a claim for increases in the pay of 270,000 workers in the clerical and allied grades.To meet the claim in full would cost  6 million a year, but he hadbeen advised that a settlement costing about  3 million a year mightbe negotiated and that, if the matter went to arbitration, there wasa reasonable chance that an award would be made which wouldnot involve much more than this amount. The staff associationswere also claiming compensation for waiving their right to a restora-tion of the prerwar hours of work and he understood that a settle-ment, costing about  2-1- million a year, migbt be reached on thebasis of paying an extra dufy allowance to the middle grades whowere not paid overtime. Lastly, the Government were being pressed to concede equal pay in the Civil Service. This fell to be considered as part of the general question of equal pay, which was dealt with
53CM. m (47)in the memorandum by the Minister without Portfolio (see cp. (47) 165 and Minute 6 below); but he was satisfied that,whatever conclusion. might be reached on the principle of equal pay, any proposal to grant it in the Civil Service at the presenttime should be rejected. There was general agreement with thisview. &apos; -The Cabinet (2) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to deal withthe claims for increased pay for clerical and alliedgrades and for compensation for the continuance of thepresent hours of work in the Civil Service on the lines proposed in paragraph 2 (a) and (c) of CP. (47) 150.The Minister without Portfolio recalled that on 22nd april the Cabinet had asked the Social Services Committee to examine thequestion of policy arising from the recommendation in para-graph 10 (a) of CP. (47) 121 that the local and regional staffs ofthe Ministry of National Insurance and the Assistance Board shouldbe merged. The Committee had been informed by the Minister ofNational Insurance that he had already undertaken to do everything possible to secure stall economies by housing staffs in the samepremises and by sharing common staffs wherever this was practica-ble. The Minister felt, however, that those officers of the assistance board who exercised discretionary functions in deciding applioa-tions for assistance must remain directly responsible to the board in order to avoid prejudicing the existing practice under which their decisions were not- regarded as open to challenge in Parliament.The Committee had accepted this view, on the understanding thatthe Minister would arx^ange for the maximum possible sharing of staff and that the search for suitable common premises to facilitatethis would be intensified.The Cabinet-(3) Endorsed the conclusions reached by the Social services committee with regard to the merger of local and regional staffs of the Ministry of National Insurance andthe Assistance Board.6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the minister without Portfolio (CP. (47) 165) reporting the conclusions reached by the Ministerial Committee which the Prime Minister had appointed to examine the issues raised by the Report of the RoyalCommission on Equal Pay (Cmd. 6937).The Minister without Portfolio said that the Committee had had the assistance of a working party of officials, who had framedan estimate of the cost of introducing equal pay in the public services (i.e., the non-industrial Civil Service, Local government service and the teaching profession). They estimated that the eventual cost might be as much as  30 million, and to this wouldhave to be added the cost of the scheme of family allowances whichwould have to accompany the introduction of equal pay. the ministerial Committee were satisfied that the introduction of equal pay in the public service would inevitably lead to its introduction in industry, where it would lead to increased production costs anda serious disturbance of the present stability of industrial relations.The introduction of equal pay would be wholly inflationary in its economic effects; and the Committee had concluded that it would be inexpedient for the Government to introduce equal pay in the public services at the present time. The Committee recommended that,in announcing this decision, the Government should be careful to refrain from reaffirming the principle of equal pay. The economic difficulties which made it inexpedient to introduce eaual pay atthe present time were not likely to be overcome quickly, and itwould be embarrassing for the Government to undertake now anyfurther commitment in favour of equal pay which they might be
expected to carry out before the General Election. It was therefore recommended that the Government should rest their case mainly on the vast expansion which they were making in the social services,the total cost of which was to be raised to  380 million in 1948;and should argue.that, until these great changes had been completed,they could not promise to introduce the further scheme of family allowances which must accompany the application of the principleof equal pay to the public services. A. draft statement on theselines was annexed to CP. (47) 165. It was recommended that thisshould be made in Parliament at a convenient opportunity afterthe Whitsirn Recess: and that, meanwhile, when the matter was raised at the Labour Party Conference at Margate the reply shouldbe that the Government intended to make an early announcement on this subject in Parliament. The Governments decision shouldbe explained in confidence to representatives of the Trades UnionCongress before any public announcement was made.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in full agreementwith the conclusions reached by the Ministerial Committee. various suggestions were made, however, regarding the wording of the draft announcement annexed to CP. (4f) 165; and it was agreed thatthis would require some revision. It was specially important thatthe Governments decision should be announced in terms whichwould discourage the Burnbam Committee from reopening the issueof equal pay for teachers. The Prime Minister also undertook toconsider whether he or the Chancellor of the Exchequer should makethe announcement in Parliament.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the recommendation of the Ministerial Coni-mittee that at the present time it would be inexpedientfor the Government to introduce equal pay in the public services;(2) Agreed that this decision should be announced in Parlia-ment, at the first convenient opportunity after the whitsun Recess, in terms which avoided reaffirming theGovernments endorsement of the principle of equal pay;(3) Invited the Minister without Portfolio, in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, to revise in the lightof the Cabinets discussion the draft statement annexed to CP. (47) 165; and to submit a revised draft to thePrime Minister, who would consider whether thism ^.-1^      ft.. 4-      r.T-. rtnl J      l^rt     w\ ft si r\     1-itt     &apos;Vi -t w\ nrtl       r\ V.ir      lliziICfcll J-i^UilUCJLlJlCll L     OllUUiU     UC    A1KXU.U    uy     XllxilclCl-X     \JX.      vj     U1L\5Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Floods of 7.

The Prime Minister said that war-time experience had demon-demonstrated the dangers of overriding priorities; and he thought it would-    be Unwise for the Cabinet to give binding directions on the lines
