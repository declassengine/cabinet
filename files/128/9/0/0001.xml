peace treaties..(previous reference:CM. (46) 87thConclusions,Minute 2.)Italy.1. The Foreign Secretary reported on the proceedings of theCouncil of Foreign Ministers in New York on completion of their work on the Peace Treaties with Italy, Bulgaria, Hungary,Roumania and Finland.The Foreign Secretary first recalled some of the difficultieswhich had prolonged the discussion of these Treaties. The decision&apos;,taken at the Potsdam Conference, that the peace settlements withthe ex-enemy satellite States in South-East Europe should bediscussed first, had meant that the Council was faced from the outset with the determination of the Soviet Union to establish an exclusive influence over those States. Our bargaining position hadbeen greatly weakened by the fact that most of the territorial claims of the Soviet Union had been conceded, before the discussion of thepeace settlements began, by undertakings given at Three-PowerConferences during the war. In the light of subsequent events itwas unfortunate that we had ourselves renounced in advance any claim to territorial advantage as a result of the war; for, if wecould have asserted our right to retain Cyrenaica, we could havespared ourselves our present difficulties in retaining a footholdelsewhere in the Mediterranean. Throughout the discussion of the treaties much embarrassment had.been caused by the early rulingthat decisions were to be taken only by those members of the council who had been parties to the Armistice with the particular state concerned; and this and other questions of procedure had proved afertile cause of delays, both in the Council of Foreign ministers and at the Peace Conference in Paris. In view of all these difncul-ties it was satisfactory that the discussions had at last beencompleted; and it was gratifying that the memorandum submittedby the United Kingdom Delegation on the Italian Treaty had inthe end been adopted as a basis for all these Treaties.In the discussions on the Italian Treaty it had been ourre-establish a democratic Italy in Western Europe withxrontiers adjusted in accordance with strategic, ethnic andei-al considerations, While ensuring that Italy was made to pay forher action during the war and was prevented from repeating it.The adjustment of the Franco-Italian frontier had been accom-panied by an agreement for joint control over the water and hydro-electric resources in this part of the Alps which should remove a cause of friction and facilitate economic development on both sides of this frontier. The Treaty incorporated the agreement reached between the Austrian and Italian Governments about the SouthCl-lCrX   (XJLOXJ    LliOXO    VVCSjO   OUUlO \J 1Tyrol; and in thisrespect of water resources which would materially assist theeconomic development of the whole region. The cession of the dodecanese to Greece had in the end been approved. The Treatyprovided for tihe protection of the property of Italians in cededterritories.Agreement had been reached on the disposal of the italian fleet. The Foreign Secretary said that he would himself have preferred an arrangement by which those warships which were notto be returned to Italy would have been sunk. We were, however,bound by an undertaking given at the Tehran Conference that someItalian warships should go to the Soviet Union; and in the endwe had been compelled to accept a plan for sharing the italian fleet between the main belligerents. He now understood that theAdmiralty were proposing to use for target practice the battleshipwhich was to be allotted to us under this plan. He hoped thatthey would not proceed with this proposal. The Prime minister unertook to enquire into this.It had proved impossible to reach agreement about the disposalof the Italian colonies. The Treaty provided that Italy shouldrenounce her claim to these territories; and that, if after a year the Four Powers had failed to reach agreement about their disposal,a final decision should be taken by the General Assembly of theUnited Nations. Meanwhile the territories would remain under our administration.   &quot;[32993-1]
Trieste.(previous reference:CM. (46) 63rdConclusions,Minute 2.)&quot;Balkan Statesand Finland.Forces ofOccupation.The discussions bad clearly shown that Trieste and VeneziaGiulia could not be given either to Italy or to Yugoslavia withoutcreating an irredentist movement. The Council had thereforeadopted the line proposed by the French Delegation for the ItakvYugoslav frontier; and had proceeded to discuss means of establish-ing an international regime for the port and city of Trieste. Theagreement eventually reached was admittedly a compromise, whichwould work satisfactorily only if tJhere were goodwill on the partof the Governments of Italy and Yugoslavia. There was, however,some hope of a better understanding between them on this issue.It was natural that critics should draw unfavourable comparisons with Danzig; but it was to be remembered that, while Danzig had served only Poland, Trieste was a commercial outlet for many countries other than Italy and was particularly well placed to fulfil the function of an international port. There were great possibili-ties of economic development throughout the countries of the danube Basin, for which Trieste would provide an outlet to theMediterranean. There would also be advantage in developing asouthward flow of trade, through Trieste, from Austria and southern Germany. Ever since the unification of Germany underBismarck there had been an excessive tendency to draw her commer-cial strength northwards towards the Baltic; and it would be useful to redress this balance by developing a southward outlet throughTrieste to the Mediterranean.In the discussion of- the draft Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary,Roumania and Finland our main objects h to safeguardBritish interests, to open up trade in South-East Europe and tosee that these ex-enemy satellite States received no better treatmentthan Italy. The Governments of Bulgaria, Hungary and roumania had realised that their countries could not survive if they becamesolely dependent on the economy of the Soviet Union; and, if we took full advantage of the Treaties and handled the situationcarefully, we now had a good prospect of re-establishing ourtrading connections with these countries.The Treaties included a provision on the freedom of navigationon the Danube, and agreement had been reached for a Four-power declaration for a Danubian Conference. This should assist in promoting economic development throughout this area. TheForeign Secretary said, however, that it would in his view benecessary to concede a right of cabotage to riparian States.We had tried to keep the reparation provisions within reason-able bounds and had succeeded in getting them spread over a termof years. The Soviet Government had already been collectingreparations from these countries under the armistice terms whichthey had imposed; but there were some indications that they were beginning to realise that the exaction of heavy reparations wasincompatible with the re-establishment of a healthy economy.The Treaties included provisions- for the protection of Jewishrights and interests in Roumania and Hungary which should havethe effect of reducing the flow of illegal Jewish immigrants fromthose countries to Palestine.The Treaties imposed limits on the armed forces to be main-tained by these States. These limits were satisfactory in relationto the armed strength of Greece. They might, however, be frus-trated by the creation of an organised militia; and there were signs that such a para-military force was being created in Bulgaria.We had been unable to secure all the provisions which we had sought with a view to restoring the pre-war position of the british oil companies in Roumania.The Treaties provided that all Allied occupation troops shouldbe withdrawn from Italy and the Balkan States within 90 days after the signature of the Treaties. It was hoped, therefore, thatthe Soviet Government would no longer maintain troops in thesecountries of South-East Europe on the ground that they wereguarding the lines of communication of their forces in Austria.For our part we had arranged that our communications to our
dGermany.(previous reference:CM. (46) 105thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Foreign Secretary said that the Council of foreign ministers had agreed to meet in Moscow on 10th March to discussGermany. They had further agreed to appoint special Deputieswho would at once begin, in London, preparatory work for thismeeting. The Deputies were, in particular, to ascertain and reportto the Council by 25th February the views of Allied States whohad common frontiers with Germany or fought in the commonstruggle against Germany. There would be great advantage in thusascertaining at an early stage the views of Governments not repre-sented on the Council of Foreign Ministers. It should mean thatall the claims and views of interested States would be known beforework began on the preparation of a draft Treaty; and, when thetime came to hold a full Peace Conference, a draft could be laidbefore it which took account of those views and claims. This should avoid some of the difficulties which had arisen at the PeaceConference in Paris. -It had also been agreed that the Control Council for germany should submit a report, for consideration at the Moscow meeting,on its work on demilitarisation, de-nazification, democratization,economic principles and reparations. The Foreign Secretary had asked that, under the last two heads, the Control Council should report on the total value of goods taken out of Germany, either inreparations or in commercial exports, since the beginning of theoccupation. There were indications that the Russian Zone ofGermany was rapidly becoming a deficiency area. Yet the SovietGovernment were pressing their demand for reparations to the valueof $10 billion from current production in Germany. They couldnot obtain so large an amount unless much of it came from theWestern Zones. It was possible that the United States government might be tempted to go some way towards meeting this Russiandemand, as the price for an effective agreement for treating thewhole of Germany as an economic unit. This was a development which would have to be carefully watched; for it was vitally impor-tant that we should not be involved in any further expenditure(particularly in dollars) in addition to that to which we were already committed by the agreement for the economic fusion of the Britishand United States Zones. In the discussion at Moscow the SovietGovernment might be prepared to make some concessions on theeconomic side in order to obtain reparations from current produc-tion and to retain their foothold in the combined Anglo-AmericanZone. We should, however, be well advised to refuse any concessions which failed to meet our full requirements about the treatment ofGermany as an economic unit, including a full accounting by theRussians for all that they had already taken out of Germany inreparations or commercial exports. The agreement for the economicfusion of the British and United States Zones would give us anopportunity to restore the economic life of our Zone and a fairchance of recovering our expenditure on it; and it would improve our bargaining position vis-a-vis the Soviet Government.The Control Council had also been asked to report to the moscow meeting on the establishment of central administrationsin Germany, and the political future of Germany would be discussed at this meeting.  On this there was at present a wide divergence oftroops in Austria should in future be maintained through theUnited States Zone of Germany and not through Italy. If soviet troops were thus withdrawn from Bulgaria, it would becomepolitically impossible for us to keep British troops in Greece. our forces in Venezia Giulia would also be substantially reduced. Wehad agreed with the United States authorities that for the inter-national garrison of Trieste we should each provide a force of5,000; and this would be the limit of our military commitment inthis area. If the conclusion of these Treaties resulted in a generalwithdrawal of occupation forces from&apos; Italy and South-East Europe,it would make a substantial contribution towards the easing of ourman-power situation.
view. The French were concerned to prevent the creation of astrong centralised Germany. The Soviet Government, on the otherhand, seemed likely to favour a strong central Government whichthey would hope to convert to communism, We ourselves favoured a federal system under which large powers would rest with tfceprovincial Governments. The attitude of the United States Govern-ment was uncertain.It should be among our aims at the Moscow meeting to secure a reduction in the forces of occupation in Germany. If means could be found of securing really effective co-operation between thefour occupying Powers, it should be possible to evolve a system ofadministration which would enable the national armies now main-tained in Germany to be reduced and drawn further back from theZonal boundaries. There were dangers in maintaining the present arrangement by which four national armies confronted one anotherat close quarters in Germany; and it was important that no oppor-tunity should be lost of relieving the anxieties to which this situation gave rise, particularly in countries adjacent to Germany.The Foreign Secretary said that on the whole the progress madein the preliminary discussions of Germany at the New York meeting had been satisfactory, and the prospects for the Moscow meeting were encouraging.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that he wouldbe glad if some machinery could be devised to keep DominionGovernments in touch with the progress of the work of the specialDeputies in preparation for the Moscow meeting, so as to give theman opportunity of making their views known at an early stage inthe formulation of policy. The Foreign Secretary agreed that thiswas a point which should be considered by his Department andthe Dominions Office.Austria^ 3.   The Foreign Secretary said that the Council of ForeignPreparation Ministers had also agreed that special Deputies should be appointedof Peace to proceed with the preparation of  a Trea,ty recognising theTreaty. independence of Austria and to hear the views of States interestedin the Austrian problem. Their report would be considered at theCeunciFs meeting in Moscow on 10th March. There was some reason to hope that the Soviet Government were now&apos; prepared to conclude a Treaty with Austria in the fairly near future.united nations.Meeting ofGeneralAssembly.4. The Foreign Secretary gave the Cabinet an account of theproceedings at the General Assembly of the United Nations. he paid tribute to the work of the United Kingdom Delegation, whichhad been strong and effective and sufficiently numerous to ensurethe proper presentation of our case at all the various meetings.Some of the other Delegations, notably the Russian, had beenhampered by the lack of sufficient representatives for this purpose.The Assembly had achieved a great deal of positive work.Public attention had been directed mainly to the General Disarma-ment Resolution which had resulted from a Soviet motion calling for returns of the numbers of Allied troops in other United Nationscountries. The Foreign Secretary had argued that the number oftroops which each country would feel bound to maintain would depend very largely on the extent to which they had. confidence inthe system of security evolved by the United Nations. this argument had had some effect. He had already set in hand a study of constructive proposals for a scheme of disarmament. It was important that this should be completed soon, and he invited hiscolleagues to arrange for their Departments&apos; to give any co-operation which was necessary for the completion of this study.The Attorney-General said that the Soviet Government had tried to obtain international prestige by taking the initiative inthis matter. We had recovered the initiative in the Assembly andwe should strive to retain it in the Security Council.   It was
important, therefore, that we should, be ready with constructive proposals, which we should prepare in consultation with DominionGovernments, some of whom had taken an active and useful partin the proceedings at the Assembly.Much would turn on the question of sanctions for the breach of any disarmament agreement and on the use of the veto in thatconnection. The Baruch plan for the control of atomic energyprovided that the veto should not be used and, if the United StatesGovernment insisted on retaining this provision in the plan, itwould involve a departure from the enforcement procedure of theUnited Nations Charter. Some protocol to the Charter would,therefore, be required; and it would be advisable for us to considerwhether we should not seek to have included in such a protocol an obligation on all States to come to the assistance of any State whichwas the victim of aggression. There was no such provision atpresent in the Charter.The Foreign Secretary said that there had been a discussion atthe Assembly on the use of the veto. He did not himself favour,the abolition of the right of veto, if only it could be secured thatit was not improperly used. To this end he had tried to persuade the representatives of the Five Great Powers to come to ah under-standing as to the; circumstances in which it should be used. this attempt had failed; but M. Molotov had given him some grounds for hoping that we might in the future have less cause to complainof the Russian use of the veto.On the question of the regime in Spa-in, there had been strong pressure for some positive action against the Franco Government.In the result, while diplomatic relations  would not be broken,Ambassadors and Ministers Plenipotentiary would be withdrawn.The Foreign Secretary said that.he had been anxious to avoid theimposition of sanctions against Spain. This would have been ofconsiderable disadvantage to our trade; and. (we,should also havebeen expected to take a considerable share in the policing of thearrangements.In discussion it was suggested that it would be useful.if.theCabinet could have before them a statement showing the economic implications of imposing sanctions on Spain and an estimate of the share which we should be expected to take in policing the arrange -ments and of the measures which this would involve.The Foreign Secretary undertook to arrange for such a state-ment to be prepared.The Foreign Secretary said that the Assembly had set up the trusteeship Council, and trusteeship agreements had been approved in a satisfactory form. Under the Charter, Powers administeringnon-self-governing territories (other than trusteeship areas) were under ah obligation to forward1 information about those territories to the United Nations Secretariat. There had been a move at therecent Assembly to establish machinery for the regular discussionof this information. We must be careful that this did not placeus in an unfair and invidious position. He was discussing thisquestion with the Colonial Secretary.The Assembly had considered two questions affecting SouthAfrica. As regards the treatment of Indians in South, Africa, theIndian Delegation had won a moral victory by securing the rejection of the proposal to refer the point at issue to the International Court,and the passage of a motion inviting the two countries to discussa solution which could be presented to the next Assembly. Theproposal by the Union of South Africa to incorporate South-WestA frica had only been supported by the United Kingdom Delegation,and a motion was eventually passed by a very large majorityinviting South Africa to turn South-West Africa into a trusteeshiparea and to present a draft agreement to the next Assembly.The Foreign Secretary said that the discussions on these twosubjects had, he thought, brought home to the South african government the strength of feeling in the world about their native policy.   The discussions might have served a useful purpose.
Agreement had been reached on a resolution setting up anEconomic Commission for Europe and on the constitution of theInternational Refugee Organisation. A resolution had also been passed on relief after the- termination of U.N.R.R.A. This lastresolution was on lines acceptable to the United Kingdom. We hadbeen criticised because we had found it necessary to set a limit tothe financial assistance which we could offer. This was essential,however, if we were to conserve our slender resources of foreign exchange; for in this respect we were in no better plight than someof the countries seeking assistance.Agreement had been reached on the scale of contributions to thebudget of the United Nations. The scale fixed seemed reasonable.The United States contribution bad been fixed at 39-89 per cent,of the total for the next two years. The controversy as1 to the site of the United Nations had been settled through the offer by Mr. J. D.Rockefeller of an area on East River in the city of New York.Food. 5    Tke Foreign Secretary recalled that the Cabinet had askedSupplies from him to make representations to the United States Government whilethe United he was in America about the supplies of foodstuffs required for theStates. United Kingdom, the British Zone in Germany and India (CM.(Previous (46) 91st Conclusions, Minute 1).

He believed that it would often be possibleto bring more influence to bear on the United States government through this channel than through special representations in washington.6. The Prime Minister thanked the Foreign Secretary for thelong and interesting review which he had given (as summarised in Minutes 1-4 above) of the proceedings at the Council of foreign ministers and the General Assembly of the United Nations. TheCabinet would wish to have an opportunity for further discussionof some of the issues raised in this review. There were also other aspects of foreign policy on which, he knew, the Foreign Secretarydesired an early opportunity of full discussion with his colleagues.There was, in particular, the whole question of our position in theMediterranean and the Middle East and the specific problems ofEgypt and Palestine, which the Foreign Secretary had reserved for separate discussion. He therefore proposed that the cabinet should hold further meetings1 on foreign policy during the following week. A meeting would be held on Monday, 6th January, at whichthe Cabinet could discuss points arising from the report whichthe Foreign Secretary had made at the present meeting. other aspects of foreign policy would be discussed at later meetings.FutureMeetings.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,2nd January, 1947.
