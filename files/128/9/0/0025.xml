The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary (CP.(47) 69) covering a minute addressed to the Prime Minister by the attorney-General on the decisions of the High Court on theStevenage New Town (Designation) Order and the City of Plymouth(City Centre) Declaratory Order.The Minister of Town and Country Planning explained thatthe Stevenage Order had been quashed on the ground that he hadnot decided with an open mind whether or not to confirm it, but had meant to confirm it whatever the force of the objections. Thisview had been based partly on what was said about the water supplyand sewage disposal problems in the letter announcing the decisionto confirm the Order, and partly on a statement in a speech whichhe had made in May 1946 to the effect that the Stevenage scheme would go forward. He was satisfied that he ought to appeal againstthe High Courts decision. He and the Attorney-General had con-sidered whether concurrently he should initiate fresh proceedings in regard to Stevenage under the New Towns Act, but they had reached the conclusion that it would be inexpedient to do this atleast until the decision of the Court of Appeal was known. the opponents of new towns obviously meant to make regular use ofthe procedure laid down in the First Schedule to the New TownsAct as a means of holding up progress.   This was contrary to the1 it was for consideration whether uibAct should not be amended.The A attorney-General said that he could give no assurance thatthe High Courts decision would be reversed on appeal, particularly as the Court of Appeal might, unlike the High Court, take the viewthat on a true construction of paragraph 3 of the First Scheduleto the New Towns Act the public enquiry ought to have covered notmerely the objections to the Order but also the arguments in itsfavour. He would try to expedite the hearing of the appeal. Hesuggested that the Cabinet should also consider whether legislation should not be introduced to make it clear that the decisions ofMinisters on orders under the New Towns Act, 1946, the Townand Country Planning Act, 1944, and possibly the Housing Actswere not subject to review by the Courts.In discussion there was general agreement that the Ministerof Town and Country Planning should appeal against the HighCourts decisions on the Stevenage and Plymouth Orders, and thatconcurrently legislation should be prepared substituting some formof approval by Parliament for the procedure now applicable toorders made under the New Towns Act and the Town and country planning Act and possibly other similar orders. The scope of this legislation would require careful consideration. The Bill should beready for introduction immediatey after the determination of theappeals. Meanwhile no indication should be given of the Govern-ments intention to introduce such legislation.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Minister of Town and Country planning should forthwith lodge appeals against the High Courtsdecisions on the Stevenage New Toavq (Designation)Order and the City of Plymouth (City Centre)Declaratory Order, and that the Attorney-General shouldtake all possible steps to expedite the hearing of theseappeals.(2) Invited the Minister of Town and Country Planning andthe Attorney-General, in consultation with the Ministerof Health and such other Ministers as might be con-cerned, to prepare and submit to the Lord President&apos;sCommittee proposals for legislation designed to preclude the Courts&apos;from reviewing Ministerial decisions onorders under the New Towns Act, 1946, and the Town[33350-5] B 2
and Country Planning Act, 1944, and such other ordersas they might consider it desirable to bring within th* 1scope of the legislation.Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.a vo2. . The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.On 3rd March, unless it were found possible meanwhile to reachluntary agreement with the Opposition Leaders, the Lord Privy. would introduce a Motion for a compulsory time-table for theTransport Bill and the Town and Country Planning Bill. TheMinister of Health would be prepared to intervene in this debateif required. Further progress would also be made with outstandingSupplementary Estimates.()n 4th March it was hoped to pass the Summer Time bill through all its stages in the House of Commons. The HomeSecretary would be in charge of the Bill. The Minister of Agri-culture and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of labour should be in attendance during the debate. The Report and third reading of the. Polish Resettlement Bill would also be taken onthat day.On 5th and 6th March there would be a debate on India on aGovernment Motion inviting the House to approve the policy setout in the Prime Minister&apos;s statement of 20th February. ThePresident of the Board of Trade would introduce the Motion, theMinister of Defence would speak on the second day, and the PrimeMinister would reply to the debate.On 7th March the House would discuss Supplementary estimates for the Ministry of Food and Board of Trade and other outstandingVotes.Germany.Meeting ofForeignMinistersin Moscow.(previous reference:C.M.(47)2ndConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (47) 68) summarising the general line which he proposed to take at the Moscow Conference on questions affectingthe future of Germany.The Foreign Secretary said that papers setting out his proposals in greater detail had been considered by the Overseas Reconstruc-tion Committee. The main objects of his policy fell under twoheads. First, he wished to prevent the resurgence of a strongcentralised Germany. For our future security and for the develop-ment of a healthy democracy in Germany it would be preferable to lend our support to the growth of a federal system under whichsubstantial powers would be devolved on the Land Governments.The Russians favoured the establishment of a centralised regime,in the expectation that this would be a Communist regime. he believed, however, that a totalitarian Germany of any type wouldbe a serious menace to world peace and, indeed, to the security ofRussia itself. Secondly, he sought an upward revision of the agreedlevel of German industry. This question raised a delicate balanceof considerations; the need for preventing the revival of germany as a menace to world peace must be balanced against the need for restoring her economy to a point at which she would be self-sup-porting. The proposals outlined in his memorandum, which were based on a steel-producing capacity of 10 million tons a year, gavescope for the rebuilding of a peaceful economy while denying toGermany the industrial means of future aggression. A fundamentalconsideration must be that no scheme should be acepted which wouldinvolve an additional charge on the British Exchequer.The Chancellor of the Exchequer and The President of theBoard of Trade supported the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposals as out-lined in CP. (47) 68. They agreed that no proposals should beaccepted at Moscow which would increase the drain on Britisnresources, particularly in dollars, in supporting the german economy.
The Minister of Health expressed the view that the generalpolicy outlined in CP. (47) 68 would prove impracticable. On theeconomic side, it would be found impossible to concede self-govern-ment and at the same time maintain an artificial limit on industrial expansion. On the political side, he did not believe that germany could be prevented from attaining the type of constitution which she desired. This attempt to prevent the creation of a centralGovernment in Germany would break down within a few years andwould have provided meanwhile an effective stimulus to the growth of a neo-Fascist movement.Against this, it was pointed out that the level of industry pro-posed in CP. (47) 68 represented a substantial improvement on theexisting limits, which were the highest we had hitherto been ableto persuade the other occupying Powers to accept. It was not contemplated that a detailed control over German industry couldbe maintained indefinitely. It was, however, essential that we shouldconcert with our Allies a policy designed both to maintain security and to ensure that the removal of industrial plant and equipmentby way of reparations did not proceed to an extent which would preclude the reconstruction of Germany as a viable economic unit.On the political side, the history of Germany&apos;s political develop-ment showed that there was likely to be substantial German support for a federal system. There was still a strong public opinion inGermany against the centralisation of political power^ which had inthe past given a preponderant influence to Prussia. It was not our policy to impose a constitution contrary to German wishes, but toestablish federal institutions, during the period of Allied occupa-tion, which would afford the best prospect for the development ofan effective democracy. The views of France and other western european countries had also to be taken into account; their support would certainly not be forthcoming for proposals involving theestablishment of a strong central Government in Germany.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that he had always been doubtful about the wisdom of imposing artificial restric-tions on Germany&apos;s industrial production. Such restrictions couldnot be maintained indefinitely. For this reason he doubted whethersufficient emphasis had been laid in CP. (47) 68 on the political aspects of the German settlement. The constitutional proposals contained in this paper vere very similar to proposals which hadbeen put forward by a German Committee set up under the WeimarConstitution; and this in itself indicated that they were likely to command the support of important sections of German political opinion. Further encouragement for this policy could be found inthe developments so far achieved in the British Zone. Both theLand Governments and the Trade Unions had already sufficientpower to be able, if they wished, to frustrate British policy; butthey had in fact co-operated with us and had shown themselvessuspicious of centralisation. An excessively harsh economic policy might prejudice our relations with them and drive them to look to Russia for support. In general, however, he thought that theproposals outlined in the paper represented a substantial advance on the present position. He hoped that they would be put forward at Moscow as our minimum demands and that, if this minimum werenot accepted, we should feel free to adopt a unilateral policy inthe British and United States Zones.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster drew attention to a specific point on paragraph 8 (b) of Appendix A to CP. (47) 68.It was there contemplated that the power of the provisional centralGovernment in Germany to enact legislation should be subject toveto by the Controlling Powers. In Austria a similar procedurehad resulted in deadlock, since it enabled one Power to hold ut)any measure. He hoped that the Foreign Secretary would considerwhether, as an alternative, it could be proposed that the power of veto should be exercisable only by a majority of the controllingPowers.
The Foreign Secretary undertook to consider this suggestion.He feared, however, that if he were to secure agreement at Moscowhe might have to accept, for the earlier stages, the disadvantages of a provision for veto by a single Power.Procedure The  Foreign Secretary  said that  the Foreign Ministers&apos;at Moscow Deputies had been unable to reach agreement on the extent to whichConference. belligerent States other than the Four Great Powers should parti-participate in the early stages of formulating the peace settlement for germany. The Deputies would therefore be unable to present agreedrecommendations regarding the procedure to be followed at the moscow meeting: and each of the Four Powers would be free tosubmit its own recommendations. In these circumstances he had asked his Deputy to prepare, in consultation with Dominion high commissioners in London, a report embodying, so far as practicable,the suggestions made by Dominion Governments in this matter-and lie would thus be in a position to present at Moscow the viewsof the British Commonwealth as a whole on this procedural problem.He also proposed that Dominion Governments should be kept informed, through their representatives in Moscow and throughthe High Commissioners in London, of the progress of the discus-sions at the Moscow Conference.The Secretary of State for Dominion A ffairs said that he was grateful to the Foreign Secretary for the steps which he had takenalready, and was proposing to take in Moscow, to keep DominionGovernments in touch with the progress of these discussions. Itwould also be helpful if he could now communicate to DominionGovernments a digest of the memorandum now before the Cabinet,and of the more detailed memoranda which had been submittedto the Overseas Reconstruction Committee, so that they might be fully aware of the objectives with which the United KingdomGovernment were embarking on the discussion of this peace settle-ment. The material to be communicated to Dominion governments would be prepared in consultation with the Foreign Office and theTreasury.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the general statement of policy in respect of the&quot;future treatment of Germany outlined in CP. (47) 68,basis for the Foreign Secretary&apos;s approach to theforthcoming discussions at Moscow on the formulation of the peace settlement for Germany; and authorised the Foreign Secretary to put forward at the moscow conference a new statement of political and economicprinciples governing the treatment of Germany duringthe second control period in the terms of the draftembodied in Appendix A of CP. (47) 68.(2) Authorised the Secretary of State for Dominion affairs to communicate to Dominion Governments a digest ofthe material contained in CP. (47) 68 and in the papersrecently considered by the Overseas Reconstruction Com-mittee (O.R.C. (47) 7-16), so that they might be fully aware of the objectives which the United! KingdomGovernment were seeking to attain in the forthcoming discussions on the peace settlement for Germany.(3) Noted with approval the arrangements which the foreign secretary proposed to make to keep Dominion Goyern-ments informed of the progress of the discussions atthe Moscow Conference.Anglo-FrenchTreaty of alliance.(previous reference:CM. (47) 2ndConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (47) 64) covering the draft of a Treaty of alliance and Mutual Assistance between the United Kingdom and the french republic.The Foreign Secretary recalled that the proposals for the con-clusion of such a Treaty had arisen from the visit which M. Blum,then Prime Minister of France, had paid to this country in January.
165 CM. 25 (47)       1JL1He drew special attention to Articles I and III of the draft treaty. The French had been anxious that we should be committed!to come to their aid if Germany should infringe any of the obliga-tions, political or economic, imposed on her by the peace settlement.While he desired to reassure France that we should not again stand aside, as we had when Germany re-occupied the Rhineland, hehad been anxious to avoid any automatic commitment; and the draft treaty committed His Majesty&apos;s Government only to consult withthe French and to take such &quot; agreed action &quot; as might be requiredto deal with such a situation. Article I also safeguarded the pro-posed Four-Power Treaty for the disarmament of Germany.In discussion it was pointed out that Article II of the draftrequired us to come to the aid of France if she should be the victimof an armed attack by Germany. Would this Article involve usin war if France had herself provoked the aggression by pursuingan unreasonable policy towards Germanv? It was pointed out, inreply, that Article II applied only in the event of &apos;&apos; armed attack &apos; &apos;-within the meaning of Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.Moreover, if France should adopt a provocative policy towards germany, the situation created thereby could be brought beforethe Security Council before it developed to the point of an armed attack by Germany in retaliation.The Cabinet were informed that the Chiefs of Staff raised noobjection to the conclusion of a Treaty in the terms of the draft annexed to CP. (47) 64.The Foreign Secretary said that he was anxious to sign theTreaty before he left for Moscow. Before the Treaty was signed,however, he proposed that the text should be communicated to dominion Governments and that his intention to conclude the treaty should be notified to the United States and Soviet Governments.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to conclude a Treaty of alliance and Mutual Assistance with the french republic, in the terms of the draft annexed to CP.(47) 64, subject to any minor drafting amendments which might be desired by the Foreign Secretary orsuggested by the French Government.(2) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would notify theGovernments of the United States and the Soviet Unionof our intention to conclude this Treatv,(3) Authorised the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs tocommunicate the text of the draft Treaty forthwith to dominion Governments, so that they might have anopportunity of commenting before&apos; the Treaty was concluded.k^aumet ujjivv, b.V\1,27th February, 1947.
