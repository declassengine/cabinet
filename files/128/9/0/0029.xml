i fj rJjcgio-Sosletfteaty.(previous reference erence:CM. (47) 16thConclusions,minute 4.)1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (CP. (47) 93) recommending that, in negotiating in&apos;Moscow the revision of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty, the Foreign Secre-tary should be given discretion to agree upon a Treaty going as faras, but no further than, the recent Anglo-French Treaty, and should&apos;have full latitude to make such variations from that model as he:might think necessary.In discussion the following points were raised : (a) Reference was made to the suggestion (put forward in moscow telegram No. 690a of 13th March) that it would be inappropriate to include in this Treaty an article similar to article IV of the Anglo-French Treaty providing for constant eon-sultation on economic matters; and that it would be sufficient toinclude a more restricted provision to the effect that the High Con-tracting Parties would do their utmost to promote and develop com-mercial and trade relations between their two countries.It was the view of the Cabinet that there would be great advan-tage to this country in securing the inclusion in the Anglo-soviet treaty of a provision for constant consultation on economic matters,as this might have the effect of promoting the development of trade between the two countries. Moreover, any attempt to depart fromthe provisions of the Anglo-French Treaty in this respect would arouse suspicions both in Russia and in this country.(b) Was there a risk that the inclusion of an Article on thelines of Article II of the Anglo-French Treaty might involve us inwar if Russia had herself provoked a conflict by pursuing a provoca-tive policy towards Germany ?The Cabinet were reminded that this point had been discussed in connection with the Anglo-French Treaty (CM. (47) 25th Con-clusions, Minute 4). The safeguards on which the Cabinet thenrelied would apply equally to this Anglo-Soviet Treaty. Moreover,this Article would not involve this country in commitments going beyond those already assumed under the Anglo-Soviet Treatv of1942.(c) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that someDominion Governments had complained of the short notice givento them of the proposal to conclude a Treaty with France. In view;of their great concern about relations with the Soviet Government,,he would like to inform them at this stage of the lines onjvvhioh itwas proposed to negotiate a revision of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Prime Minister to authorise the Foreign Secre-.tary to negotiate an Anglo-Soviet Treaty going as faras, but no further than, the Anglo-French Treaty, withlatitude to make such variations as he might think necessary and discretion as regards the procedure andtactics to be adopted in the negotiations.(2) Asked the Prime Minister to inform the Foreign Secretaryoi me v^aumeL s Views aoouu me i mjjuruajj.ee Oj. ineiUuingin the Treaty provision for constant consultation oneconomic matters and, in general, adhering as closely as!possible to the terms of the Anglo-French Treaty.(3) Authorised the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs toinform Dominion Governments of the proposals whichwere being made for the revision of the Anglo-soviet treaty, and of the extent to which the United StatesGovernment were being kept informed of theseproposals.[ 33397-3]
Cyprus.(previous reference:C.M.(47)20thConclusions,Minute 6.)2 The Prime Minister recalled that at their meeting, on11th February the Cabinet had authorised the Foreign Secretaryto exolore the possibility of reaching an understanding with theGreek Government that they would not raise for some years to comethe question of the status of Cyprus. In subsequent discussion withthe Foreign Secretary he had reached the conclusion that it wouldpreferable not to raise this matter with the Greek Government.The present Greek Government were not likely to raise this issue,but thev could not bind future Greek Governments or speak onbehalf&apos;of the Greek Communists. If discussions were opened withthem they were bound to raise tihe question of the Cypriots&apos; rightto determine their future status and, as we were not rea^y to givethat point, they would nave no incentivetoCreach an7untoTa^commanding with us. &apos; There was also a risk that any*uch discussions with the Greek Government would become known and would provoke further agitation, bothiu Greesee and in Cyprus.The Cabinet-Took note that the Foreign Secretary would not raise withthe Greek Government the question of the future status of cyprus.faiesinia.(previous reference erence:C;M.(47)23rdConclusions,Minute 3.)3. Reference was made to the action taken by the High Com-missioner for Palestine, with the concurrence of the local rnilitaryauthorities, in revoking the order applying martial law to certain areas in Palestine.The Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the cabinet of the circumstances in which this order had been revoked, and undertook to circulate a telegram on this subject, which he hadreceived from the High Commissioner.The Cabinet Agreed that the situation in Palestine should be discussed at their next meeting.Parliament.Debate on defence white paper.(previous reference:C.M.(47)28thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Cabinet were informed that certain Government sup-porters had given notice of their intention to move an amendment to the Government Motion inviting approval of the statement relating to Defence (Cmd. 7042). This&quot;Amendment urged &quot;thata further review should be undertaken of our military commitmentsso as to reduce the burden on our man-power and financial resources.&quot;The Lord Privy Seal said that an Amendment in these termsmight be supported by the Opposition, and he proposed to see thesponsors of the Amendment before the debate with a view topersuading them not to move it.Expansion 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Primeof Fuel Minister (CP. (47) 92) proposing that allocating authorities forand Power      labour, materials and other essential supplies should go as far asResources.       practicable to meet all necessary requirements for the manufacture and installation of specified classes of equipment required for theexpansion of the country&apos;s resources of fuel and power.The following were the main points raised in discussion : (a) Progressing organisation. The Prime Minister asked what arrangements had been made for progressing the manufactureof the equipment listed in his memorandum.The Cabinet were informed that the Minister of Supply hadreconstituted under his Chairmanship the Heavy Electrical PlantCommittee, and was strengthening his organisation for progressingorders for electricity generating plant and for coalmining machinery
, and equipment. The main responsibility tor progressing orders forthe coal/oil conversion programme would continue to be undertaken by the Petroleum Board, who were in close touch with the manu-facturers; but the Ministry of Supply would give such assistance as was required and would, in particular, progress the orders placed for the conversion of railway locomotives to oil burning. For gas-undertakings, the main requirements were for replacement ofexisting plant; and the Ministry of Fuel and Power were arrangingto&apos; give any assistance which the undertakings required in securingearly completion of the orders which had been placed.(b) Electricity generating plant. The Prime Minister saidthat the short-term problem was to expedite delivery of ordersalready placed and to lose no practicable opportunity of convertingpower-stations from coal to oil burning. He had been disturbed tofind that on this second point the advice hitherto given by theCentral Electricity Board was disputed by the plant manufacturers^who foresaw no great difficulty in converting to oil-burning someof the larger power-stations. The Minister of Fuel and Power saidthat he also was concerned at this conflict of expert evidence; andhe was considering whether he should appoint a Technical Com-mittee under the Chairmanship of a scientist of high standing toadvise him in such matters. He would submit an early report onthis to the Prime Minister.The long-term problem was mainly one of avoiding delay in: placing firm orders for new power-stations and introducing thegreatest measure of standardisation in design. The Minister of fuel and Power said that hitherto it had not been possible to make as much progress with standardisation as he would have liked, since&apos;the orders were placed by particular undertakings over whomneither he nor the Central Electricity Board nor the ElectricityCommissioners had direct powers of control. As, however, theindustry was shortly to be brought under public ownership, it should now be possible to exercise a greater influence over the type of equip-ment ordered by particular undertakings; and he was considering whether it would not be advisable to appoint an organising Com-mittee to take preparatory action in anticipation of the powers tobe conferred on the British Electricity Authority by the terms ofthe Electricity Bill. A similar course had been adopted when theCoal Bill was passing through Parliament. It was suggested that,meanwhile, the manufacturers might be asked, through the HeavyElectrical Plant Committee, to assist by declining to undertakeorders which deviated unduly from their standard designs.(c) Gas undertakings.--^^ Cabinet were informed that pro-gress was being retarded by a shortage of silica bricks. It was sug-gested that supplies of silica might be obtainable from Greece..The Minister of Works undertook to enquire into this.(d) Railways. It was proposed in CP. (47) 92 that precedence&apos;should be given only to the manufacture and repair of locomotives and wagons intended for the transport of fuel. The Minister ofTransport asked that this should be extended to cover ail locomotives and wagons and also rails. The Prime Minister said that such anextension would involve an excessive curtailment of other importantprogrammes. It was his intention that this special precedenceshould be confined to a proportion of the total requirements of therailways corresponding to the proportion which fuel traffic bore tothe total traffic carried. He would, however, ask the Chairman ofthe Materials Committee to consider whether the same precedencecould be accorded to some proportion of the railways&apos; requirements for rails.(e) Building: The Minister of Works said that, so far as con-cerned building, the proposals in CP. (47) 92 would necessarilyentail some reduction in other parts of the national building pro-gramme. He was, however, appointing a Committee, comprisingrepresentatives of the Departments affected, to take the necessary measures to expedite the supply of labour,, civil engineering-resources and housing required in connection with the provision of generating capacity.[33397-3] b 3
(f) Atomic energy.- The Prime MinistertsaM that the pro-posals made in CP. (47) 92 should not be regarded as overridingthe request which he had recently made to a number of ministers to facilitate the progress of the atomic energy programme.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in CP. (47) 92 regarding the pre-eedence to be given to projects designed- to increase thecountry^ resources of fuel and power.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would consider, in con-sultation with the Chairman of the Materials Committee,whether the same precedence could be given to some partof the requirements of the railways for rails.6. The Cabinet had before them memoranda bv the lord privy Seal (CP. (47) 80), the Minister of Health (CP. (47) 85) andthe Minister of Education (CP. (47) 88) on the recommendationsof the Curtis and Clvde reports on the Care of Children (Cmd. 6922and Cmd. 6911).The Lord Privy Seal recalled that the Prime Minister had appointed a Ministerial Committee under the Chairmanship of theLord President to consider the recommendations made in these reports. This Committee had heard the arguments in favour ofassigning to the Home Office, the Ministry of Education and theMinistry of Health, respectively, the central responsibility for the care of children deprived of a normal home life: and the membersof the Committee who were not departmentally interested had allreached the conclusion that, for the reasons set out in his lnenio-randum, the balance of advantage lay on the side of conferringthis central responsibility on the Home Office. Local responsibility should rest with the county or county borough councils, who should submit to the Home Secretary schemes for the discharge of these functions. These schemes should normally provide for the appoint-ment of ad hoc children1 s committees. In Scotland the Secretaryof State was already responsible for all functions relating to the- - .... - * j___    -- .. ..... ...(jcirt? ui. v-uiiiuicll. uut it Has auresponsibility through the Scottish Home Department, localresponsibility being assigned to the councils of counties and large burghs. If the Cabinet endorsed these recommendations it was proposed that an announcement of the Governments intentionsshould be made by the Prime Minister in the terms set out in annex II to CP. (47) 80.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Health saidthat the assignment of responsibility to the Ministry of Healthwould ensure that deprived children were not segregated and dealtwith separately from other members of the community. Secondly,it would have the advantage of separating from delinquent childrenthose children who were merely the victims of misfortune. Thirdly,as the Ministry of Health were already responsible for about 75,000of the 125,000 deprived children, and as the health authoritiesalready had an organisation for home visiting, concentration ofresponsibility on the Ministry of Health would be the simplestsolution from the point of view of administration. Transfer of this responsibility to the Home Office would be criticised in parliament and in the country as handing over the care of deprived children to a Department mainly concerned with offenders.The Minister of Education said that in view of the heavy- tasksnow confronting his Department he would have been glad to avoidundertaking additional responsibilities. He was, however, con-vinced that the right course was to assign the central responsibilityfor deprived children to the Ministry of &quot;Education, who would work through the local education authorities. The present tendency7 wasto widen the scope of education so as to include the whole of the life of the child, and the additional responsibility of looking after
all deprived children would be a ssirural addition to the work of educational administration The Oasnty Councils of Middlesex andSurrey had already arranged to discharge their functions relating todeprived children through their eteafea committees, and he was satisfied that administrative aiTamgernents of this kind would bemore likely to secure the welfare of the children than the appoint-ment of ad hoc children&apos;s eonsniSees and the appointment of separate children5s officers. He reeagHmsed that the logical conclu-sion of his argument was that ire Ministry of Education shouldtake over responsibility for Jissaimle Courts, but he saw noinsuperable difficulty in this.The Home Secretary said ijfcajj zhe health and educationauthorities were concerned prfrriariLy with their own specialistfunctions, and if this task were assigned to them there was a danger that they would lose sight of the priiasary need of the deprived childfor  a  Subc*&quot;l-Ute home  and &quot;^-^&quot;^-d ibtoi rnn Tir.r.]A  Qt-.far it.inn   t.n  f.riAindividual circumstances of each child. The Home Office had alwayshad a general responsibility for xuithering the welfare of children in all respects not the specialist eoneern of other Departments, andit was a mistaken view that the Rcnc^cntration of this responsibility on the Home Office would mean that- all deprived children would bebranded as delinquents. The Cmrtis Committee had been leastcritical of the treatment of these (deprived children who were atpresent the responsibility of the u.:zzr Office; and, as the Cabinetknew, the three Ministers on tie Ministerial Committee who hadno departmental interest in the matter were in favour of assigningresponsibility to the Home Office.Other points in discussion weirs: (a) The Secretary of State far Scotland said that he had originally contemplated that respoasnbility in Scotland should beexercised through the educational ^organisation Since, however,the Cabinet seemed to favour the c-caeentration of responsibility onthe Home Office in England and TTaies, he was ready to assignresponsibility in Scotland to the Seofefeisla Home Department and toaccept the recommendation of the Clyde Committee that localresponsibility should rest with the conac-ils of counties and largehnrp-hso     * - &apos;(5) The Cabinet were informed chat the Admiralty, War Officeand Ministry of Pensions had certain, powers and duties in respectof the care of orphans of Service men. It was intended that these responsibilities should remain nsdlsterbed, and it seemed desirablethat this should be made clear in fine proposed public statement.(e) It might be worth con?: iering whether there would not be advantages in allowing the Ministry of Health and the publicassistance authorities to continue to discharge their functions inrelation to deprived children ur.&quot;?? cMe Poor Law and the ChildLife Protection Acts until 1st Apiil, 184S, when it was contemplated that the final break up of the Poor Law would be carried out. Ifsuch an arrangement were adopted, fx might be unnecessary to makeany order under the Ministers of tire Crown (Transfer of Powers)Act and the proposed public statement could be amendedaccordingly.(d) Attention was drawn to tike importance of announcing theCabinet&apos;s decision in such a way as to give no ground to the sugges-tion that deprived children were feing handed over to the police.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that central respossflblEty for the care of deprived children should be concentrated in the Home Office andthe Scottish Home Department; and that local responsi-bility should lie with tribe councils of counties, county boroughs and large bnrgssT who should be required tosubmit schemes to the Hesne Secretary and the Secretaryof State for Scotland fox the discharge of their functionsthrough ad hoc eMldiesfs committees and for theappointment of children3^ officers of suitable standing.
Imprisonment(German and austrian)SentencesBUI.7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster (CP. (47) 89) seeking approval for theintroduction of a Bill to authorise the imprisonment in GreatBritain of British subjects sentenced to imprisonment or penal servitude by Control Commission Courts in Germany and Austria.The Lord Chancellor explained that, in response to criticisms of the detention of British subjects in a German prison, the Chan-cellor of the Duchy of Lancaster had indicated that legislation forthis purpose would be introduced, though he had not indicated when this would be done. There was much to be said for the proposed legislation. The Cabinet should be aware, however, that it was likely to provoke discussion in Parliament on various complex legalquestions connected with the occupation of Germany, includingthe status of the courts by which these sentences were imposed. Ifthe authority of these courts were impugned, it would have to be defended on the ground that it derived ultimately from the control council, and this line of argument might lead to the Governmentsbeing challenged on the difficult question whether they could properly be said to be at war with a Germany in which there was no government other than the Control Council.The A attorney-General said that he shared the fears of the LordChancellor that the introduction of the Bill would provoke discus-sion of the question whether His Majesty&apos;s Government could properly be said to be at war with Germany. Though no guaranteecould be given that this question would not be raised in any event,the Cabinet might think it unwise to precipitate it by introducingii     ____,..nr,nj -n:nl/Iie piUpUOCU  Jjiii.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancastershould not proceed with his proposal for legislation authorising the imprisonment in this country of Britishsubjects sentenced to imprisonment by Control Commis-sion Courts in Germany and Austria.  ,Abolition of 8.   The Cabinet had before them a joint memorandum by theSnecial Juries.  Lord Chancellor and the Home Secretary (CP. (47) 90) proposing the abolition of all special juries save the City of London SpecialJury in Commercial Causes.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to discuss with the Ministerof Health the arrangements for discharging thefunctions relating to deprived children under the PoorLaw and Child Life Protection Acts during the period up to 1st April, 1948.(3) Invited the Home Secretary and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland to prepare legislation to implement those recommendations of the Curtis and Clyde committees which require changes in the law and to carry out suchpreliminary reorganisation of the administrative arrangements as could be undertaken before the passageof this legislation.(4) Agreed that the existing special responsibilities of theAdmiralty, War Office and Ministry of Pensions forcertain orphans of Service men should remain undis-disturbed, and that this should be made clear in the ,pi-0^)UScd  ctiiiiv/U-iiCCiii^iiiJ ijxx\j  \Ju i uiUiiivno o  xxxv\jXxljx*JxxS.(5) Agreed that, subject to such amendments as might benecessary to cover the points referred to in conclusions (2)and (4) above, a public announcement should be made inthe terms of the draft contained in Annex II to CP(47)  5.&apos; *
The Lord Chancellor said that, after consulting the Judges, hewas satisfied that there was no ground for retaining special juries(except the City of London Special Jury in Commercial Causes)for the trial of either civil or criminal matters. He recognisedthat it would not be practicable to introduce at once the necessary legislation; but in view of the Parliamentary interest in this matterhe asked that the Cabinet should take a decision in principle andauthorise a statement that it was the Governments intention to abolish special juries, though they could not promise early legislation.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed in principle that, with the exception of the City ofLondon Special Jury in Commercial Causes, specialjuries should be abolished.y J  j^LULlloriatJU.   Llic   xxtbOiiicj-Ociicxia-i   I/O   cfc-iiiiOUixCo   timi    LdioGovernment had so decided, as a matter of principle,though they could not promise early legislation to giveeffect to that decision.9. The Prime Minister said that he had that morning receivedthe Executive Committee of the National Union of Mineworkers and discussed with them the prospects of reaching the target outputof coal proposed in the Economic Survey for 1947 (Cmd. 7046).They had assured him that there was now a much better spirit inthe mining industry and that a substantial increase in output couldbe expected. They believed that, given the conditions which had nowbeen agreed with the National Coal Board, the introduction of thefive-day week need not involve loss of output.The Prime Minister said that the representatives of the union had promised to consider the appeal which he had made to themfor increased output; but he thought it unlikely that they wouldvolunteer to suspend the introduction of the five-day week. If nooffer of postponement were forthcoming from the Union, he thoughtthat the Government would have no alternative but to authorise theNational Coal Board to introduce the five-day week on 5th May.In discussion it was suggested that, if it were found that thefive-day week was in fact operating to reduce output, the questionof suspending its operation might at a later stage be taken up withthe Union.The Cabinet-Took note of the Prime Ministers statement.
