FinancialRelationsbetween theExchequerand LocalAuthorities.(previous reference:CM. (46) 22ndConclusions,Minute 7.)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chan-chancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister of Health and the Secretaryof State for Scotland (CP. (47); 142) submitting proposals forrecasting the financial relations between the Exchequer and the localauthorities so as to take account of the relief to local rates arisingfrom the inauguration of the National Health Service, the break-upof the Poor Law, and changes in the system of road grants.The Minister of Health said that the Government had already declared their aim of giving more assistance to the poorer areas and less to the richer. The inauguration of the National health service and the break-up of the Poor Law would relieve the ratesof expenditure which, in total, exceeded the amount of the existingblock grant. This relief would, however, be spread unevenly between different areas. It was proposed that the new grant should goentirely to the poorer areas and that the method Of distributionshould be to ascertain the average rateable value per head of popu-lation over the whole country, to credit to any county or countyborough or large burgh where the actual rateable value was lessthan the average the additional rateable value necessary to bring it up to the average, and to contribute from the Exchequer a sumequal to the rates on this credited rateable value. It was also proposed to redistribute education grants on a new basis in orderto transfer part of the gains of the richer authorities to the poorerauthorities. No change would be made in the method of appor-tioning grant among districts within a county. The general effectof the new system would be to reduce the level of rates in almost all areas and there would be very striking reductions in the develop-ment areas. In one or two areas, however, there would be slightincreases and he hoped that he might have authority to agree to spread these increases over a period of five years should he feel itnecessary to make this concession in his negotiations with the localauthorities.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, although less block grant would be payable under the new system, the net burden onthe Exchequer would be considerably greater. He was, however,satisfied that this could be justified in view of the advantages secured in simplicity and fairness of distribution. While he was ready toconsider minor adjustments which might be suggested in the forth-coming negotiations Avith the local authorities, he hoped there wouldbe no question of any major changes in the scheme which would add substantially to the burden on the Exchequer.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that he was in full agreement with these proposals, which would be of great benefitto the development areas and the crofting counties in Scotland.The Minister of Education said that he had now agreed withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer a revised formula for the distribu-tion of education grants. This would enable him to undertakenegotiations with the local education authorities concurrently withthe negotiations which were to take place with the local authorities.In further discussion it was suggested that an estimate shouldbe made of the extent to which the new system would enable savings to be made in central and local government staffs. It was explainedthat, so far as concerned central government staffs, the point mightbe covered in a memorandum which the Chancellor of the exchequer proposed to submit to the Cabinet shortly; and that it was unlikelythat any large saving of local government staffs would be secureduntil the new system of valuation had been introduced.The Cabinet (1) Gave general approval to the proposals in CP. (47) 142 forrecasting the financial relations between the Exchequerand the local authorities, and authorised the Minister ofHealth and Secretary of State for Scotland to open negotiations with the associations of local authorities onthe basis of these proposals;
(2) Took note that the Minister of Education would, at thesame time, open negotiations with the: local educationauthorities on the proposals for the redistribution of- &apos;: education grants.  ,Pai-Iiament.2.   The Cabinet-.were informed of the business to be taken in business in     the House of Commons in the following week.the Souse ofCommons.Business inthe House ofLords.   &apos;The-;Report&apos;1 Stage of the Town&apos;anmntv,1r* /vi fin n /vt rtJL    UUL/IVlt/VIVXjIIwould be taken on 12th, 13th and 14th May.       &quot;On 15th and 16th May there would be a debate on   oreigntv,&apos;^ Cabinet wpre informed that, in view of delays m passing the National Service Bill through the House of Commons it would no longer be possible for the House of Lords to take the SecondReading of this Bill before the Whitsuntide Recess. This would increase the difficulties of getting the major Government Bills passed through the House of Lords in time to enaoie tne present session to be brought to an end early in August.(cabinet Office, S.W. 1,Sth May, 1947.
