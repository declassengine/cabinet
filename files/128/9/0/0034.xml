1. The Cabinet considered various points which were likelyto be raised in the forthcoming debate in the House of commons on the Fuel Situation.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the United states ambassador had now informed him&apos; that difficulties of internaltransport would prevent the United States from increasing theircoal exports; but they would be prepared to divert to this countrycoal already allocated to other European countries who were unableto find the foreign exchange with which to pay for it.The Prime Minister said that he was not satisfied that theUnited States authorities had exhausted the possibilities of over-coming their internal transport difficulties : our request should be pressed at a higher level.Meanwhile, the South African Government had stated thatthey could export a further 50-75.000 tons nf coal a month, foruse in bunker depots abroad, if additional coal wagons were supplied to them. The number of wagons was small in relation to the coal which could thus be provided; and the wagons were of a gaugewhich could not be used in this country. Every effort should bemade to expedite the delivery of these wagons, which had alreadybeen ordered, both from this country and from Canada,The Cabinet-(1) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange that our request for increased coal exports from the UnitedStates should be taken up, at a high level, with theUnited States Administration in Washington.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would consult with theMinister of Supply and the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs on the possibility of expediting the delivery of coal wagons to South Africa from thiscountry and from Canada.(3) Agreed that in the forthcoming debate the Minister of fuel and Power should state that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere already in touch with the Governments of theUnited States and South Africa regarding the possi-bility of our securing coal exports from those countries.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he had nowconsulted the gas and electricity supply industries on the proposalsfor restricting the domestic consumption of gas and electricityduring the coming summer. The representatives of those industries,while agreeing that economies would be secured by the proposedprohibition onspace-heating, were doubtful whether anything wouldbe gained by the proposed restriction of the hours during whichgas and electricity might be used for cooking. In view of the irrepresentations, the Minister proposed that the restrictions oncooking and water-heating should not apply on Sundays, but recom-mended no other alteration in the scheme approved by the Cabineton 27th March. The representatives of the undertakings had askedfor further time to examine the details of the standard scale of consumption.In discussion, the suggestion was made that householders shouldbe prohibited from using coal, as well as gas and electricity, forheating rooms during the summer. It was pointed out that suchan absolute prohibition would cause unwarrantable hardship, e.g.,in cottages where no other means were available of drying wetclothes. It was, however, the view of the Cabinet that some means should be found of discouraging unnecessary use of coal for thepurpose of heating rooms during the summer.The Cabinet-(4) Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power to consider howdomestic consumers could best be discouraged from using coal for the purpose of heating rooms during the summer.6-1] b 2
(5) Agreed that the proposed restrictions on the domestic useof gas and electricity for cooking and water-heatingshould not apply on Sundays.(6) Agreed that in the forthcoming debate the Minister of fuel and Power should state that the Government had decidedto publish a standard scale for the domestic use of gasand electricity as a target to which householders should aim at conforming; that this scale was being discussed with the gas and electricity supply industries; and thatdetails would be published in the near future.Coal Alloca- The Cabinet were informed that questions might be raised intions for the debate about the allocation of coal to industrial undertakings,industry.        If the scope of the debate were thus extended, it might be advisable that the President of the Board of Trade should speak in the debate,as well as the Minister of Fuel and Power.The Cabinet were informed that a paper by the President ofthe Board of Trade on fuel allocations for industry was to be con-sidered by the Fuel Committee at their meeting on the following morning.TV- _.LJUC ^auiii^u-(7) Invited the Fuel Committee to consider whether anythingshould be said in the debate about the allocation of coal to industrial undertakings, and to decide which ministers should speak on the Government&apos;s behalf inthe debate.Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in the House of Commons during the first week after the Easter Recess,the House of On 15th April the Chancellor of the Exchequer would openCommons.       his Budget.On 16th and 17th April there would be a general debate on theBudget Resolutions.On 18th April the House would take the Report Stage and third Reading of the Cotton [Centralised Buying) Bill.Man-Power.Strengths of armed Forces.(previous reference:CM. (47) 9thConclusions,Minute 2.)3.   The Minister of Defence drew attention t proposal,made by Mr. Churchill in the debate on the Second Reading ofthe National Service Bill, that the Government should appoint a standing Parliamentary Committee, including representatives of all political parties, to enquire into the use of man-power in the armed forces. The Minister said that, in replying to the debate that evening, he proposed to take the line that the Government hadalready taken their own measures to prevent waste of rnan-power by the Services; that Mr. Churchill, when he was in office, had consistently resisted proposals for conferring such powers of inquisi-tion on Parliament; and that the Government, as at present advised,saw no reason to differ from the view which Mr. Churchill had himself taken of such proposals in the past.. The Cabinet endorsed the line which the Minister of Defenceproposed to take in the debate.IndIa- 4.   The Prime Minister said that the India Committee hadViscount proposed that a letter should be sent to Field-Marshal ViscountWavell. Wavell conveying the Cabinefs appreciation of his services asViceroy of India.   He commended this proposal to his colleagues.The Cabinet Invited the Prime Minister to convey to Viscount Wavelltheir appreciation of his services as Viceroy of India,
Town and country planning.Erection of power station at Bankside,Southwark.5. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP. (47) 110) and the Secretary of State forAir (CP. (47) 119) about a proposal to erect a 210,000 k.w. eiec-tricity generating station at Bankside, Southwark, in place of an existing 85,000 k.w. station.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, when the lord presidents Committee (L.P. (47) 9th Meeting, Minute 4) had con-sidered this proposal, the Minister of Town and Country Planninghad urged that the new station should be built at Rotherhithe. Ithad been the general view of the Committee that, if this wouldinvolve more than six months&apos; delay, the proposal to rebuild at?mrl  ciiKcDrmpnf anmnvipc ancyo^cfi^rithat, so far as concerned the first 105,000 k.w. of additional capacitytransfer of the project to Rotherhithe might involve a delay oftwo winters. He asked that the Cabinet should now take a finaldecision, so that the work of providing more generating capacitycould go forward.The Minister of Town and Country Planning said that replace-ment of the existing power station at Bankside by a new stationa^a    4-^i a   oa       r\   m f a   wfMn 1 a!    v\ -ma-..-. aI. o. a   ^-1&quot;.Council to redevelop for commercial, residential and public purposes the South Bank of the Thames between Blaekfriars and SouthwarkBridge. The construction of a large power station oppositeSt. paul&apos;s would also be criticised. Two winters&apos; delay in theprovision of 105,000 k.w. of generating capacity out of a total programme for London of nearly 1^ million few was a small price to pay for preserving the plan for redeveloping the South Bank ofthe Thames.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the choice of theRotherhithe site might well mean more than 18 months&apos; delay andan additional capital cost of  907,000. The new station atBankside would not be unsightly and need not spoil the redevelop-ment of the rest of the area. His efforts to expedite the provisionof new generating capacity would be frustrated if he were constantly faced with objections to the erection of new power stations on grounds of amenity.The Secretary of State for Air said that on strategic groundsthere were strong objections to both the Rotherhithe and theBankside sites and urged that, before any final decision was taken,further consideration should be given to the possibility of erectingthe station at Stone Ness, Purfleet, Tilbury or Rainham Caves. Itwas pointed out, however, that these alternative sites had alreadybeen considered and rejected in connection with a previous proposalto erect a power station at Poplar.The Minister of Labour stressed the importance of not pre-judicing the plan for redeveloping the South Bank. He pointedout, however, that the main features of that plan could be preservedif the new station was constructed for oil-burning and was setback from the river front so as to avoid interfering with the project for a riverside promenade. The new building should also be erectedto the west of the existing station; and the local planning authority should see to it that other industrial building was excluded fromtJhe area.The Cabinet Agreed that a new 210,000 k.w. power station should be erected at Bankside, Southwark, on the understanding thatthe electricity would be generated by oil and that thebuilding would be set back from the river, so as to avoid prejudicing the plans for redeveloping this area for commercial, residential and public purposes.[33486-1]
PublicBoards.political activities ofMembers and staff.6. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Prime Minister(CP. (47) 96) summarising the conclusions reached by the Socialisa-tion of Industries Committee about the extent to which members and staffs of the Boards of socialised industries should participate in national and local politics.The Prime Minister said that he had circulated this paperbecause he thought that the Cabinet should formally endorse these general principles as affording a reasonable basis on which a code of practice might be established. lie suggested that they shouldbe communicated to the Chairmen of the Boards of socialised indus-tries for their guidance, but he did not propose that they should atthis stage be made the subject of any public announcement.In discussion, it was pointed out that the application of these principles to the staffs of public Boards was likely to give riseto pressure for a revision of the rules applicable to Civil Servants.The Prime Minister recalled that a Cabinet Committee had beenf).rmninted to consider the revision of those rules.&quot;A AT(1) Took note with approval of the statement in CP. (47) 96 ofthe principles which should govern participation in national and local politics by members and staffs of the boards of socialised industries.(2) Invited the Prime Minister to arrange for a statement ofthose principles to be communicated to the chairmen of the Boards of socialised industries, for their guidance,by the Ministers responsible for those Boards.japanese reparations.(previous reference:CM. (47)5thConclusions,Minute 4.)7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofState (CP. (47) 117) on Japanese reparations.The Minister of State said that the United States Governmenthad abandoned their proposal to issue interim directives to enablereparations deliveries to begin and were now advocating a plan bywhich limited allocations would be made on account to certain countries which had been occupied and devastated by the Japanese.The implications of this plan had been examined by the Far Eastern(Official) Committee, whose recommendations were summarised inparagraph 15 of the Appendix to CP. (47) 117. It had since beenlearnt, however, from the British representative on the Far eastern commission that the recommendation in paragraph 15 (d) relatingto China would receive no support, and that there would also be strong opposition to any proposal for the extension of the plan tocover Australian territories formerly occupied by the Japanese. Ifwe insisted on these points, an agreed solution would not be foundand the United States Government would probably proceed to makeallocations by interim directive; but we should then have lost their support and could not be sure that they would take our representa-tions into account. In these circumstances, the Minister suggestedthat the recommendations contained in the Appendix to C.Jf. (47)117 should be put forward by the British representative as points for discussion by the Far Eastern Commission but that, if they werenot accepted, he should support the United States plan in itsoriginal form.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs deprecated thissuggestion. The Australian territories which had been occupied bythe Japanese had a claim to consideration as valid as that of anyof the territories covered by the United States plan, and the british representative on the Far Eastern Commission should not acquiesce in their exclusion.There was general agreement with this view. It was akw feltthat too small an allocation was proposed for the other british territories in the Far East which had been occupied by the Japanese,
Italy.Disposal of refugees.^xrcviOUoEeference:CM. (46) 53rdConclusions,Minute 4.)8. The Prime Minister said that he had given further con-sideration to the difficulties confronting the Foreign Secretary inhis discussions in Moscow as a result of our retention of displaced persons in Italy. When the Cabinet had last discussed this matter on 13th March, it had been suggested that the Yugoslavs nowin Italy should be transferred for employment with the british forces in Egypt so that a corresponding number of german prisoners of war might be released. Further enquiries had shown,however, that the transfer of these Yugoslavs to Egypt would be politically impracticable. He had therefore discussed the matter with the Secretary of State for War, the Minister of State andthe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster; and it had been agreed(i) that the 11-12,000 Yugoslavs now detained under our authority in Italy should be transferred to the British Zone of Germany;and (ii) that the 9,000 Ukrainians now detained in Italy shouldbe given the status of prisoners of war and transferred to theUnited Kingdom for employment, in agriculture and otherwise.The Cabinet Took notestatement.with   annroval   of   the  Prime  Minister&apos;sAgriculturalLosses due toFloods andWinterWeather.(previous reference:CM. (47) 32ndConclusions,Minute 9.)9. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister ofAgriculture (CP. (47) 116) and the Secretary of State for Scotland(CP. (47) 112) on the question of compensating farmers for lossescaused by the severe winter and the recent floods and proposingmeasures to stimulate food production in 1947. The Cabinet also had before them a note by the Prime Minister (CP. (47) 115)directing allocating authorities to do, all that they could to meetnecessary demands for labour and equipment required for therestoration of flooded farmlands.The Minister of Agriculture said that he proposed that theNational Farmers&apos; Union should be asked to raise an AgriculturalDistress Fund by means of voluntary levies on sales of milk, fatstock and eggs and voluntary contributions from fruit farmers,market gardeners and arable farmers who had not suffered losses from the snow and floods, and that the Government should offer tocontribute to this Fund on a  1 for  1 basis. The Union hadalready made an appeal for contributions and he was satisfied thatthey would support a scheme on these lines.As regards measures to stimulate food production, his Emer-gency Advisory Committee had recommended a scheme of acreagepayments to encourage farmers whose arable land had been floodedto till the land this year, even though it was not possible to sow orplant early enough to ensure a sufficiently large crop to be profitableat present prices.   The cost of this scheme was not likely to exceedand that the British representative should press for a higher alloea-tion for these territories, in addition to insisting on the extensionof the plan to cover Hong Kong, Borneo and the Australian territory-ries. If the plan should be adopted, it was likely that the propor-tions agreed on this occasion would be regarded as a precedent for future interim allocations.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of State to instruct the British repre-sentative on the Far Eastern Commission in accordancewith the recommendations made in paragraph 15 of theA j: a         pi Tj       IAI-!\ 4-^     l-nf^-nm     T^-rv^     flintMinisters attached special importance to (i) the extensionof the United States plan to cover the Australian terri-tories occupied by the Japanese: and (ii) a higher per-centage allocation for British territories in the Far East.
 2 millions. The Committee had also recommended that, to com-compensate hill sheep farmers for decreased income owing to the lossof sheep and lambs, the hill sheep subsidy should for the next three years be based on the number of ewes carried in December1946. Unless a scheme of this kind were adopted, many hill sheenfarmers would find it impossible to carry on and the necessarystock for lowland sheep farms would not be forthcoming.It was important that the Government should be seen to betaking all possible steps to promote home food production this yearand he hoped the Cabinet would approve the measures proposed inparagraph 17 of CP. (47) 116 for expediting the transport ofagricultural requirements, giving higher rations to agricultural workers and additional incentives&quot; to prisoners of war, and making available more agricultural machinery.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that he was in generalagreement with the measures proposed by the Minister of Agricul-ture. The English and Scottish National Farmers&apos; Union weremeeting on the following day and were likely to agree to set up asingle Agricultural Distress Fund for the United Kingdom.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he accepted theproposals for an Agricultural Distress Fund, on the understandingthat in its administration account would be taken of the extent towhich insurance was payable in respect of losses sustained by farmers. He would also prefer the Minister of Agriculture to avoid any definite commitment to give assistance to the Fund in its early stages by way of interest-free loans. He also accepted the proposalsfor acreage payments for the cultivation of flooded land and forthe adjustment of the hill sheep subsidy.In discussion the following points were made : (a) Might there not be difficulty in collecting levies from individual farmers on the strength of an agreement between theGovernment and the National Farmers&apos; Unions?The Minister of A griculture said that it should be possible to devise arrangements under which the Milk Marketing Board orthe Ministry of Food would secure the consent of each farmer beforethe levy was collected. He would arrange for this point to bediscussed between the Agriculture Departments and the Ministry01 rooo.(&amp;) It was suggested that the Government would be setting a dangerous precedent in agreeing to a  1 for  1 contribution tothe Agricultural Distress Fund. The Minister of Health had inthe past resisted the demands of local authorities for compensation in respect of losses due to floods, but he would find it difficult tomaintain this position; and, if farmers were to receive compensation from a grant-aided fund, it was not easy to see why building con-tractors whose sites had been flooded and buildings damaged hadnot a claim to Government assistance. Again, the hill sheep subsidyproposal involved accepting a liability for loss of income as distinct from loss of capital, which had not been accepted even under thewar damage schemes.In reply it was pointed out that the proposals for compensatingfarmers were to be justified, not by reference to the losses sustained by individual farmers, but by reason of the overriding need tomaintain agricultural production in the present exceptionalconditions of food shortage. This should be emphasised in any statement of the Governments intentions and the point might be reinforced by arranging for the Governments contribution to theAgricultural Distress Fund to be made, not on a  1 for  1 basis,but in the form of a lump sum, the amount of which could be adjusted so as to be broadly equivalent to 50 per cent, of the total.(c) The Minister of Food said that he was opposed to theproposal in paragraph 17 (6) of CP. (47) 116 to give a higher meat ration to aaxicultural workers.   He had already agreed to give
special seasonal allowances from 24th March to 30th April, whenmost of the spring sowing would be done and he would, if necessary,continue these allowances into May. Very little publicity had beengiven to the grant of these allowances and the Minister of Agricul-ture might take the opportunity to mention this matter in the broadcast which he was giving on the following day.id) There was general approval of the suggestion in para-graph 17 (c) that additional incentives should be given to prisonersof war employed in agriculture and it was agreed that a detailed scheme should be worked out by the Foreign Labour Committee.(e) With regard to paragraph 17 (d) of CP. (47) 116, therewas general approval for the proposal to divert agricultural machinery from export. The Cabinet felt, however, that it wouldnot be possible to accept the further suggestion that a special priority should be given for demands for materials and labour forthe production of such machinery.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals in paragraphs 7 to 11 of CP. (47)118 for the establishment of an Agricultural DistressFund, on the understanding that the Government con-tribution to the Fund would be given, not on a  1 for  1basis, but in the form of a lump sum, and that thearrangements for the collection of the proposed levieswould be discussed between the Agriculture departments and the Ministry of Food.(2) Agreed that acreage payments should be made to encourage the cultivation of flooded land and that for the next three years payments under the hill sheep subsidy scheme should be on the basis of the number of ewes carried.:.   - in December 1946.(3) Invited the Agriculture Ministers and the Minister ofFood to consider whether the seasonal food allowancesgranted to agricultural workers for the spring sowingshould continue after 30th April.(4) Approved in principle the proposal to give additionalincentives to prisoners of war employed in agricultureand invited the Foreign Labour Committee to work out(5) Took note with approval of the Prime Minister&apos;s directive(CP. (47) 115) regarding the allocation of labour and materials for the restoration of flooded farmlands.(6) Agreed that the Minister of Agriculture should make astatement in the House of Commons on 3rd April out-lining the Governments proposals for assisting farmers to make good their losses and maintain the maximumagricultural output. The terms of this statement shouldbe agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and steps should be taken to ensure that the B.B.C. reportedit in full.(7) Took note that the Agriculture Ministers would circulate a further memorandum to the Cabinet at an early dateoutlining the measures which they were taking to securethe maximum output of home-produced food in 1947.10. The Cabinet had before them telegrams (Nos. MG/45 andMG/47 of 31st March) from the Commander-in-Chief, Germany,on the recent demonstrations against food shortages in the british zone of Germany.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that food distribution in the British Zone had for some time been operated on very narrow margins, and it was remarkable that these protestshad not been heard earlier. The German population was now,however, becoming increasingly restive over the restricted rations;the acute housing shortage and the other discomforts of life; and
t!he German political parties and trade unions were finding itnecessary to show some sympathy with these feelings in order toretain their influence over the people. The situation had been further complicated in recent months by the severe weather and theadministrative reorganisation arising from the fusion of the Britishand United States Zones. This had resulted in an unfortunatedispersal of the food control organisation, the Headquarters ofwhich had, against our wishes, been established at Stuttgart. Therewere also serious difficulties in collecting food from the farms inthe United States Zone. Responsibility for the collection anddistribution of food in the British and United States Zones hadbeen transferred to German hands from 1st January last; and this had caused some temporary loss of efficiency. As a temporary measure to meet the immediate situation Allied officers had resumedcontrol of distribution of imported food-stuffs. The consent of theUnited States authorities was also being sought for importing food-stuffs through Rotterdam, and for an increase in the import of bread grains in April.The Cabinet Took note of the position.Administrationof criminla justice inthe Colonies.(previous reference:,G.M.(47)32ndConclusions,Minute 4.)11, The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for the Colonies (CP. (47) 118) on the administrationof criminal justice in the Colonies, with special reference to theGold Coast murder case. The memorandum covered a note by theLord Chancellor on the legal position relating to appeals to the privy Council, and the draft of a statement to be made in the Houseof Commons.The Lord Chancellor emphasised that, as a matter of law, therewas no reason Why the sentence of a Colonial Court should not beca,rried out notwithstanding that an application for leave of appealto the Privy Council had been lodged : the Executive was not under any legal obligation to postpone the execution of sentence pendingthe determination of the application for leave to appeal. He didnot dissent from the recommendations in paragraph 6 of CP. (47)118, but he thought that the draft statement could be strengthened.The Cabinet -(1) Endorsed the recommendations made in paragraph 6 of cp. (47) 118.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to reconsider,in consultation with the Lord Chancellor, the terms ofthe statement to be made in the House of Commons.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,1st April, 1947.
