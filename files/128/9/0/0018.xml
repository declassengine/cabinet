Coal.I (Previous* Reference:[CM. (47) 17thConclusions,Minute 3.)power stations.1.   The Minister of fuel and Powerthat since the cabinets meeting on the previous day he had given further con-sideration to the problem of keeping the power stations in opera-tion notwithstanding the interruption of coal supplies on accountof the severe weather. He was&apos; now satisfied that, despite theemergency measures which were being taken to increase the amountof coal available in the South, the weather was interfering with both the production and the transport of coal to such an extent that drastic cuts in electricity supplies were inevitable. He had considered whether it would be enough to confine the cuts to two days a week or to domestic consumption alone; but he was satisfiedthat the economies to be secured by these means would not be suffi-cient. Cuts in industrial supplies were inevitable; but he had ascertained that selective cuts would to some extent be practicable as a result of their experience in shedding the load, power stations would be able to reduce industrial supplies without interfering withthe more essential services.The Minister therefore proposed that a public statement should at once be made to the effect that in the London and South-Easternarea, in North-West England and in the Midlands, a number of power stations must cease generating electricity owing to shortageof coal and draw their supplies from the Grid, and that drasticreductions must be made in the consumption of electricity in these areas. It would therefore be necessary that in these areas all supplies of electricity should be cut off from industrial consumers,though arrangements would be made to maintain supplies for certain essential services and, for factories operating continuous processes,to continue sufficient supplies to prevent damage to plant. supplies to domestic consumers would be cut off, in the same areas, from a.m. to 12 noon and from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m., and similar cuts would be applied to theatres and cinemas.The Minister proposed that these restrictions should come intoeffect on the morning of Sunday, 9th February They might lastfrom three to seven days.In discussion the following points were made : (a) &quot;Would electric light, as well as power, be cut off from industry? Some factories using coal for power would be able tocarry on if supplies of electricit)&apos; for lighting were not withdrawn.The Minister of Fuel and Power undertook to consider whether in such cases electricity supplies for lighting could be maintained.(b) Was it necessary that these restrictions should be introduced on Sunday morning? This would cause grave inconvenience to domestic consumers and, as the industrial load was light on Sundays,it was doubtful whether any substantial saving would be secured.The Cabinet agreed that the restrictions should begin on the morning of Monday, 10th February.(c) In order that firms might know where they stood, it wouldbe preferable to announce at the outset that the restrictions wouldlast for at least a week.ihe Cabinet (1) Agreed that cuts must be made in electricity supplies onthe basis proposed by the Minister of Fuel and Power,subject to the points noted in paragraphs (a)-(c) above;and -took note that the Minister of Fuel and power would make an announcement to this effect in the debatewhich was taking place in the House of Commons that day.The Minister of Transport recalled that at the Cabinetsmeeting on the previous day he had undertaken to con-si der whether it would be possible to divert bunker coal to home consumption. Consultations had taken place between officials of his Department and the Ministry of Fuel and Power[33260-4] B 2
Exports.and a large measure of agreement had been reached. On the previous evening, however, the Minister of Fuel and Jfower, without further consultation with him, had given instructions that all loading ofcoal into British and foreign ships proceeding overseas should cease.As a result, between 30 and 40 ships were immobilised for the sake of about 40,000 tons of coal; and grave anxiety had been caused in shipping circles. This embargo, if it were maintained for morethan a few days, must gravely prejudice our prospects of main-taining supplies of food-stuffs and other essential imports.The Minister asked that the embargo on the bunkering ofBritish ships proceeding overseas should at once be withdrawn. he asked that no general ruling should be given on the question whetherbunker coal should be provided for foreign ships wishing to leaveUnited Kingdom ports or for the supply of coaling stations abroad.These were matters for detailed discussion between his department and the Ministry of Fuel and Power.After a short discussion, the Cabinet (2) Asked the Minister of Fuel and Power to withdraw the embargo on the bunkering of British ships leavingUnited Kingdom ports.(3) Invited the Minister of Transport and the Minister of fuel and Power to arrange for officials of their departments to determine in what circumstances bunker coal shouldbe provided, in the present emergency, for foreign shipsdesiring to leave United Kingdom ports and for coalingstations abroad; and agreed that the Ministry of food should be represented at these discussions.The Cabinet were informed that steps had already been takento suspend the export of coal to foreign countries.The Cabinet (4) Confirmed the decision that coal exports should be suspended during the present emergency.Palestine.future policy:Progress ofLondonDiscussions.(previous reference:CM. (47) 11thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Cabinet considered a joint memorandum by the foreign secretary and the Secretary of State for the Colonies (OP. (47) 49)reporting the progress of the discussions with Arab and jewish representatives about the future of Palestine, and seeking authorityto put before them as a basis for further negotiation the fresh pro-posals outlined in the Appendix to the memorandum.The Foreign Secretary said that it was clear from the discus-sions that the Arabs were implacably opposed to Partition. Apartfrom their opposition, there would be grave practical difficulties in giving effect to Partition; and it was also doubtful whether any scheme of Partition Avhich would be acceptable to the Jews wouldbe regarded by His Majesty&apos;s Government as defensible. The Arabsalso demanded that there should be no further Jewish immigration into Palestine; but on this appointed there should be some room forcompromise n means could be found of allaying the Arab fearsthat, by immigration, the Jews would achieve a numerical majority in Palestine.The Jews claimed that the Balfour Declaration and theMandate implied a promise that a Jewish State would be established in the whole of Palestine. They were willing to consider as a compromise the creation of &quot; a viable Jewish State in an adequatearea of Palestine.&quot; The essential point of principle for the Jewswas the creation of a sovereign Jewish State.In these circumstances the Colonial Secretary and he had tried to find a solution which, even though it were not accepted by eithercommunity, was one which His Majesty&apos;s Government could con-scientiously support and in which the two communities might finallyacquiesce.   They now sought authority to put before the Arabs and
the Jews the plan outlined in the Appendix to CP. (47) 49. Inis nacias its primary obiect the establishment of self-government m Pales-tine leading to independence after a transition period of five years under Trusteeship. It provided for a substantial measure of localautonomy in Arab and Jewish areas, and enabled Arabs and jews to collaborate together at the centre. It contained special safe-guards for the &quot; human rights &apos;&apos; of the two communities. It pro-vided for the admission of 100,000 Jewish immigrants over thenext two years and for continued immigration thereafter by agree-ment between the two communities or, failing that, by arbitrationunder the United Nations. The plan incorporated features of manyearlier schemes. It was consistent with the Mandate and, if itcommanded a reasonable measure of acquiescence from either of thetWO   COmmUllItlcb,   11.   COliiCt   Uc   Stfl  ylx   iwu   a,v  Uai^cJ   cUrix   loguicllibdusubsequently by a Trusteeship Agreement.If it were found that a plan on these lines was likely to com-mand such a measure of acquiescence, the Cabinet would be askedto decide whether His Majesty&apos;s Government should go ahead with it. If on the other hand there was no prospect of acquiescence, itwould then be necessary to submit the whole problem to the united nations, explaining the various efforts which had been made to finda solution but making no recommendations.The Foreign Secretary said that he thought it most desirablethat the negotiations should not be allowed to come to an end at* ----- -   J- ii- J-T. &quot;win      v mvln   ^rt /I . &apos; t- j-\    A 1 omi OO    intlilb   ^lOiiiL/.       iliUHuliiU,   aav. i i.

In the last two days, however, there had been some signs of a more accommodating spirit; and there was every advan-tage in continuing by patient endeavours over the next few days to seek a basis for detailed discussion of a practical plan.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he had pre-viously thought that Partition afforded the only way out of thepresent deadlock in Palestine; and he had been confirmed in that opinion by the views expressed to him by the High commissioner and by his advisers in the Colonial Office. He confessed, however,that, the longer he had examined the detailed implications of Parti-tion, the more he was impressed by its practical difficulties. Itwould be very difficult to establish a viable Jewish State without prejudicing the vital interests of the Palestine Arabs; andwherever the frontiers were drawn, large numbers of Arabs must inevitably be left under Jewish rule. He was also impressed bythe difficulties of securing the assent of the United Nations to ascheme of Partition. But perhaps the greatest difficulty of all wasthat the enforcement of Partition was, he was now convinced, boundto involve conditions of rebellion and disorder in Palestine whichmight last for a considerable time and would involve a substantialmilitary commitment for us.He was therefore in full agreement with the proposals in CP.(47) 49, which had been explained to the Cabinet by the foreign secretary. He believed that these proposals would go some way tomeet the Jewish point of view on immigration and on land transfer.There were signs of some division of opinion among the leaders*-Tn^   T^uli    A ^--n-    nr,A   r.r. ,k   ,,1 il.,    T____J ,1. 4 i ,TOx.   i/iiv UCVVAuii xigCiiuy,  aim OUAilO CIClllOlALD  All  L11C OBWISU UUffiZUUIlItyboth here and in the United States considered that the Agency&apos;demands were too extreme. He therefore hoped that the Jews might regard this plan as one which they were prepared to discuss.On the strategic implications of this plan, The Minister ofDefence suggested that it would be mistaken to set a limit of fiveyears for the period of Trusteeship. Even if both communitiesacquiesced in the scheme, it was doubtful whether in five years wecould^ produce in Palestine a stable State ready for independence.The Chiefs of Staff were much concerned at this time-limit, for there could be no certainty that we should be able to maintain a militarybase in Palestine thereafter, and-this was essential for the defenceof our interests in the Middle East as a whole. It was therefore suggested that the period proposed should be increased to ten years
Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,7th February, 1947.or, alternatively, that we should not do more than promise that thejcontinuance of the Trusteeship should be reviewed after five years.The general view of the Cabinet:was, however, that unless we now proposed a definite and relatively short period of Trusteeshipwe should be unable to convince the two communities that we weresincere in our intention to enable Palestine to achieve independenceMoreover, the knowledge that the period of Trusteeship was to be relatively short would provide both communities with the necessaryincentive to collaborate with one another. As to our strategic needs,we must in any event rely on a military Alliance with an independent state when the period of Trusteeship ended; and there was no reasonto suppose that this need be more difficult to obtain in Palestine thanit had been in Iraq and Transjordan.It was pointed out that the proposals now put forward were based on the hope that Jews and Arabs would collaborate in a unitary State. This had been the foundation of our policy for manyyears,&quot;but no signs had been forthcoming of any readiness to collaborate. Would this fresh attempt to secure collaboration meet with any more success&apos;?The general view of Ministers was thai, nevertheless, there was every advantage in putting forward these proposals to both partiesas a basis for negotiation. The results of the further discussions should be reported to the Cabinet. It was also agreed that thenegotiations must be brought to a point within the next week or so. If there was no measure of acquiescence in the proposals, then it seemed, that reference to the United Nations would be necessary.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of state for the Colonies to put before the representativesof the Arabs and the Jews the proposals outlined inthe Appendix to CP. (47) 49 on the understanding that,if ah agreement were reached on this basis, HisMajesty&apos;s Government would proceed to give effect to it.(2) Took note that, if in these further discussions no agreement were reached, the Foreign Secretary and the colonial secretary would report to the Cabinet whether in their judgment these proposals were likely to meet with anysubstantial measure of acquiescence from either of thetwo communities in Palestine, and would then invite theCabinet to decide whether His Majesty,&apos;s Governmentwould be justified in bringing the scheme into operation on their own authority pending the negotiation of trusteeship Agreement.
