Road HaulageStrike.(previous reference ereioce:CM. (47) 7thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Minister of Labour informed the Cabinet that earlier in the day the delegate conference of the workers involved in thestrike had agreed that work should be resumed on 18th January.Thereafter the Joint Industrial Council had been formally con-stituted and had adjourned until 19th January to enable theemployers to carry out certain consultations before negotiationsbegan. No difficulties would be made if the Services continued tomove essential supplies until the strikers returned to work on18th January.The Minister added that he had been intending to see representatives-sentatives of the General Council of the Trades Union Congress inconnexion with the strike. He thought that, even though the strike had now been settled, it was desirable to proceed with discussions with the Trades Union Uongress on the question of negotiating machinery.The Home Secretary said that the Industrial Emergencies Com-mittee had considered that on 17th January the Services should con-tinue to handle any food supplies which were already in transitHe hoped the Cabinet would agree that their appreciation should be conveyed to the members of the Services, who had done such excellentwork. The Service Ministers might also consider whether some com-pensation might be made to them.In discussion it was agreed that this compensation should takethe form, not of a money payment, but of additional leave. no publicity need be given to this.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that, until the strikers returned to work, the services should continue to handle essential supplies already in transit;(2) Agreed that the Governments appreciation of the work done by the troops should be conveyed to those membersof the Services who had been engaged in this duty;(3) Invited the Service Ministers to consider what arrange-ments could be made to grant additional leave to thesemembers of the Services;(4) Agreed that the Minister of Labour should pursue with theGeneral Council of the Trades Union Congress thequestion of improving the negotiating machinery inindustrv.Economic 2.   The Cabinet discussed the issues raised in the papers on the survey Economic Survey for 1947 (CP.

Thefollowing were the main points made in this part of the cabinets discussion : GeneralEconomicSituation.(a) The Survey stressed the difficulties of our balance of pay-ments; and one of the main questions raised was whether we could afford to go on importing so much from hard-currency countries.It was surprising therefore that there was so little reference in the survey to agriculture. All the emphasis was laid on the need forincreased exports of manufactured goods. Was it not at least as important to consider means of increasing the home production offood, with a view to reducing the volume of our imports, particularly from hard-currency countries ? It might be true that nothing couldbe done now to increase the amount of food produced in this countryin 1947; but the long-term position must also be faced for, unlessdrastic measures were taken to redress our balance of payments,[33073-1] b 2
we might be forced to seek further financial assistance from theUnited States when the present Loan was exhausted. To restoreour livestock, for example, plans must be laid far ahead. Themain problem would be to maintain the labour force in agriciilture;yet the Survey contained no proposals for replacing the largenumbers of prisoners of war who would be lost to agriculture bv1948. &apos;  *The suggestion was made that more women could be absorbed into agriculture if the organisation of the Women&apos;s Land army were overhauled and its conditions of service made more attractive.rntv  n   1 - &apos; --   J------J   4.1--4.  i 1--A .....      , 14-.^--     IV---. -       .  i.-I.___1\      i1116 KjADWMh a/grccu Lixetu UJ.G rtgiiuun,iuc -i^ojjai uiiiCUi/Q ouuuiu J.UUKinto this point,(b) Was it not already,too late to plan the distribution of ourman-power in 1947? Most of the Departmental programmes forthis period had already been made and approved and in many casescontracts had been let. Major adjustments could not now be made without great difficulty. General economic planning should precedethe preparation of Departmental programmes; and the cabinet should now be considering a plan for 1948.(c) There was no doubt that the available man-power was notdistributed in accordance with existing national needs. attention was drawn in the Survey to the swollen labour force in theengineering industries and the need for diverting some of thailabour to industries manufacturing consumer goods. The distribu-tive trades were also employing more people than we could sparein present circumstances; and large numbers were engaged in whollyunproductive activities such as football pools, sports andentertainments.Without powers of direction over labour, however, it wouldbe difficult to redistribute the available man-power in accordancewith an economic plan. Though the Ministerial Committee had recommended a limited scheme for applying industrial direction to young women, they had not contemplated the restoration of the war-time system of labour control. And, so long as we were withouteffective powers of control over the labour force as a whole, we couldnot expect to secure all the advantages which might be derived froma fully-planned economy.(d) The statistical estimates on which the Survey was basednecessarily contained a large margin of error. Some of the figures(e.g.. those relating to the Armed Forces and their supply) were already out of date, as a result of decisions taken while the survey was under consideration by the Ministerial Committee. the statistical gap shown in the Eeport might therefore give a some-what exaggerated picture of the economic consequences which would follow if all the measures recommended by the Committee were not adopted.(e) The figures of man-power requirements were presumablybased, in the last resort, on estimates by individual firms of thelabour which they required. Experience during the war had shownthat such estimates were too often inflated. It would be dangerousfor the Government to take drastic measures to increase the totalman-power available for industry so long as employers madeinefficient use of the labour so supplied. Better results might beobtained by maintaining the pressure on industry to make more efficient use of the labour available.As against this, it was pointed out that the estimates had beenprepared by the responsible Departments, who had long experience in discounting the demands of industry. Moreover, these were notestimates of the labour required for optimum programmes, butrealistic estimates related to the programmes, which could beachieved under current economic conditions. No better estimatescould be framed than those provided by the responsible Depart-ments; and, if these were to be rejected, all forward planningbecame impossible.
51 cm. 8 (47)(/) The gap of 630,000 disclosed in the Survey represented only  - 3 per cent, of the employed population. Was it not reasonable to expect that a large part of this gap might be closed by increased productivity 1 With greater efficiency in the use of labour, increaseduse of machinery and improved incentives, much could be done tosecure a higher rate of output per man; and greater efforts shouldbe made to secure a solution along these lines. Even a small per-centage increase in productivity would go a long way towards closingthe gap.As against this, it was pointed out that the estimates providedby the Departments included all the allowance which they had felti us tiffed in making for increased productivity. Attention was alsodrawn to the inter-relation of labour shortages. In many industriesincreased efficiency depended on the installation of new machinery;and this was delayed by the inability of the industries manufac-turing that machinery to meet all the demands which were beingmade on them. Shortages in one sector of industry prevented the attainment of efficiency in other sectors. This was strikinglyillustrated by the widespread effects, throughout industry, of theshortage of man-power in coalmining.(g\ Whatever decisions were reached on the specific recom-mendations made in CP. (47) 25, special efforts would have to bemade to present to the public the broad facts of our economic positionso that all might appreciate; the need for increased efficiency and effort in industry.The Cabinet were informed that the Ministry of Labour would shortly be producing a pamphlet based on addresses made to theNational Joint Advisory Council by the Lord President, theChancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Board ofTrade; and that arrangements had been made to secure that thisreceived a wide distribution among employers and workpeople in industry.The general conclusion reached by the Cabinet in this part oftheir discussion was that, while there might be some margin of error in the statistical estimates included in the Economic Survey,there was no escape from the broad conclusion that the nation&apos;economy was overburdened and that some adjustments were necessary, particularly in the distribution of our man-power, if wewere to achieve our primary objectives of attaining the export targetand maintaining essential production for the home market. Atthe same time, it was important to avoid extreme courses of retrench-ment such as had been adopted after the war of 1914-18. TheGovernment should take a balanced view of the situation. Inparticular, it seemed reasonable to assume that some part of the gap assumed in the Economic Survey could be closed by more vigorous action to secure increased productivity in industry.In the light of this general conclusion, the Cabinet turned toconsider the specific measures recommended by the Committee onEconomic Planning,   They first discussed the proposal, in para-School-leaving graphs 20-25 of CP. (47) 25, that the raising of the school-leavingA8e- age should be postponed from 1st April to 1st September, 1947.The Minister of Education said that there were no educationalgrounds on which such postponement could be justified. It would deprive 150,000 children of a whole year&apos;s education, and thechildren to suffer would be precisely those whose education had been most seriously interrupted by the war. They would all be children of working-class parents; and parents in better circumstances would remain free to keep their children at school. Postponement couldnot be justified on the ground that preparations for the change wereincomplete. The additional teachers and accommodation would beready by the date prescribed in the statute. The educationauthorities would complete their preparations in time largely because of the special steps which had been taken to convince themthat the Government would honour their pledge to introduce thisreform on 1st April.   If the Government now went back on this?
the education authorities would relax all their efforts and were moreunlikely to be ready for 1st September than they were now for1st April. Moreover, the success of any future efforts by otherDepartments to get local authorities to complete a task by a givendate would be gravely prejudiced.The Secretary of State for Scotland endorsed these views. Inparagraph 21 of CP. (47) 25 reference was made to a memorandum the difficulties of providing the additional accommodation requiredin Scotland by the prescribed date. He wished, therefore, to makeit clear that this memorandum had been submitted, not for thepurpose of suggesting postponement, but to secure special priority for his building requirements. He was fully prepared to meet anyadministrative difficulties which might arise from the raising of theage on 1st April.In discussion the point was made that this proposal would produce great social and educational hardship for very littleeconomic advantage. It had often been suggested that the with-drawal of cheap juvenile labour would be one effective means offorcing employers to achieve greater efficiency in their use of labour;and some of the best employers in industry were now reluctant to employ children below the age of 16. it was also pointed out thatthis was a short-sightedi proposal; for if, as was admitted, we mustin the long run rely for increased industrial output on greater skill and productivity rather than numbers, the loss in education wouldin the end outweigh the benefit derived from bringing these childireninto industry a year in advance of their normal time. Finally, itwas felt that the political disadvantage of breaking the definitepledges which had been given in Parliament out-balanced theeconomic benefits which would be derived from this proposal.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in view of the cabinet&apos;s attitude he did not desire to press this particular recom-mendation. If, however, this were withdrawn it became all themore important that the Cabinet should adopt the other measures recommended in the Committee&apos;s Report.Tne Cabinet (1) Agreed that the statutory date for the raising of the school-leaving age should not be postponed.The Cabinet next considered the recommendation, in para-graphs 16-19 of CP. (47) 25, that young women should be requiredto undertake work of national importance for a period of two years.The President of the Board of Trade said that the essence ofthis proposal was that all young women should, for a period equalto that for which men would be called up to the Forces, be requiredto work in one or other of the occupations of national importance which were suitable for the employment of women. Women whopreferred to serve in the Armed Forces would be allowed to do so,to the extent that the Services could absorb them. The proposal would not only bring into useful employment women who were doing no work at all, but would also enable women to be diverted to those industries and services, such as the textile industries ornursing, where the shortage of female labour was most acute.The Minister of Labour said that in his view the proposal couldbe defended on the ground that it meant equal treatment for menand women. It would be necessary to ensure that the conditions ofemployment in the industries and services to which women were directed were satisfactory. The number of women in each ao-e group would be about 345,000. &apos; 0In discussion several Ministers expressed doubts about thisproposal. j.n particular, it was argued that it would not meanequality of sacrifice as between men and women, or even among thewomen themselves, since some women would be directed into lessDirection ofWomen intoNationalService.
53CM. 8 (47)attractive work than others. Thus, most of those in Lancashirewould be required to work in the cotton industry, while in other areas they would be able to choose more congenial occupations.Further, in many parts of the country there would not be enoughsuitable occupations for the available women, with the result that women would have to be required to undertake work away from home. On this and other grounds the direction of women hadprovoked strong feeling even during the war; and the difficultiesof administering such a system would be very much greater in peace-time conditions, If women had to be directed to employment away from their homes, would they receive lodging allowances and, if so, would the cost fall on their employers or on the Exchequer?Could young women, in the limited period for which they would serve, acquire sufficient skill to make them a useful addition tothe female labour force in the occupations into which they wouldbe directed ?In further discussion it was agreed that, before the Cabinetreached a decision on this proposal, they should have more informa-tion on the points noted above and on such matters as the numbersof women in the appropriate age group who, if not required to perform national service, would undertake no work or would beemployed in non-productive occupations, the numbers who could be absorbed in the various industries and services of national importance and the numbers who might have to be transferred fromtheir existing occupations or from their home areas. The cabinet should also be informed what numbers were to be absorbed into the armed Forces under existing plans, and whether the Forces could1not absorb more women in substitution for men.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Minister of Labour to prepare, in the light ofthe discussion, a memorandum giving full information about the effect of a scheme for the direction of women on the lines proposed in paragraphs 16-19 of CP.(47) 25.(3) Agreed to discuss the remaining recommendations in CP.(47) 25 at a meeting on the following day.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,17th January, 1947.
