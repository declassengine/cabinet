Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Third Beading of the Transport Bill would be taken on 5th May.The Committee Stage of the National Service Bill would betaken on 6th, 7th and 8th May.On 9th May the Report Stage and Third Reading of the statistics of Trade BUI would be taken.Duringthe week opportunity would be found to take the Com-mittee and Report Stage of a new Financial Resolution on the Townand Country Planning Bill.Fubiic Boards.political activities ofMembers and staff.(previous reference:C.M.(47)34thConclusions,Minute 6.)2. The Prime Minister read to the Cabinet the draft of a state-ment which he proposed to make in the House of Commons that day in reply to Questions by Mr. Charles Smith, M.P., about the extentto which persons employed in socialised industries would be free to eno-a.P-e in political activities.O  &quot;O SlDiscussion turned on two points:- (a) The Prime Minister had proposed to say that the Boardof a socialised industry must reserve the right to review the positionof an employee who devoted so much time to outside activities asto impair his efficiency as an employee. It was recognised that inpractice each such case would have to be considered on its individualmerits; and some Ministers felt that undue weight might be attachedto this point if it were included in a general statement of this kind.It was agreed that this sentence should be omitted from thestatement.(b) Supplementary Questions were likelyJLo be asked about theposition of the members of public Boards. Persons holding theseappointments, whether whole-time or part-time, were disqualifiedby statute from serving as Members of the House of Commons; andit would be inappropriate that full-time members of public boards should be active in party politics. It would, however, be incOn-venient to impose such an absolute restriction on part-time membersof public Boards. The Cabinet were informed that the Chancellorof the Exchequer was not anxious to impose any restriction on thepolitical activities of some of the part-time Governors of the Bankof England. The Prime Minister thought it would suffice to say, ifthis point was raised, that members of the Boards would appreciate the need to maintain a measure of discretion appropriate to thepublic responsibilities with Which they Were charged. The cabinet endorsed the Prime Ministers view.The Cabinet-Approved, subject to the points noted in paragraphs (a)and (b) above, the terms of the statement whichWhe PrimeMinister proposed to make in the House of Commons onthe extent to which persons employed in socialised industries might engage in political activities.Palestine. 3.   The Prime Minister recalled that on 19th December, 1946,illegal the Cabinet had considered a proposal that officers commanding Hisimmigration Majesty&apos;s ships should be authorised to arrest on the high seascertain specified categories of vessels suspected of carrying illegal(Previous immigrants to Palestine, but had rejected that proposal as the Lordrff^Wr - Chancellor had advised that it could not be justified in internationalo.M (46) 107th law The Foreign 0ffide and Colonial Office had subsequently putconclusions, forward the alternative proposal that His Majesty&apos;s ships should minute 7.) kg authorised to arrest on the high seas any illegal immigrant shipswhose flag State had agreed to interception; and the Lord Chan-cellor had advised that this Would not be open to the same legal[33612-1]b 2
objection. If this policy were approved, it might be applied tothe President Warfteld, a 5,000-ton ship now at Genoa which was known to be embarking illegal immigrants for Palestine and wascapable of carrying 5,000 immigrants.The Cabinet were informed that the Admiralty were opposedto this proposal on two grounds. First, the conclusion of bilateral agreements with individual States for rights of interception might prove an embarrassing precedent. It might lead other States to demand riphts of interee/ntiori and search nf British vessels whichwould be unacceptable to us. It was contrary to our long-term interests to encroach upon the doctrine of the inviolability of thehigh seas. Secondly, interception involved serious practical diffi-culties. Illegal immigrants usually sabotaged their ship&apos;s engineson interception, and had to be towed into harbour. This&quot;created no special difficulty when ships were intercepted off the Palestine coast and towed into a local port. If, however, they were intercepted onthe high seas and diverted to Cyprus, the immigrants were likelyto resist being taken into tow and effective control of the interceptedship could only be secured by placing a large guard on board.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that every possible step should be taken to prevent the arrival in Palestine waters ofa ship carrying as many as 5,000 illegal immigrants. Their custodyand transfer to Cyprus would present very great difficulties.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider this matter further, in consultation with the Minister of Defence, theSecretary of State for the Colonies, the First Lord of theAdmiralty and the Minister of Transport.Coal.Allocationsfor Industry.(previous reference:CM. (47) 40thConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the coal alloca-tions to be made to industry during the period 1st June to 31st Oeto-ber, 1947. They had before them (i) a note by the Secretary to theCabinet (CP. (47) 139) covering the memorandum submitted to the fuel Committee by the President of the Board of Trade; and (ii) amemorandum by the Minister of Health, the Secretary of State forScotland and the Minister of &quot;Works (CP. (47) 141) drawing atten-tion to the effect on the building programme of the allocationsproposed by the Fuel Committee.The Minister of Health said that when he had accepted thedecision of the Fuel Committee at their meeting on 21st April hehad understood that each industry would receive during the summer months of 1947 86 - 8 per cent, of its current requirements: it wasonly at a later stage that he had realised that although industry as a whole was to receive 86 - 8 per cent, of its current requirements,each particular industry was to receive what it had used in thecorresponding period of 1946. As the building materials industries had been expanding throughout that period, this method of alloca-tion would have the result that in the summer of 1947 they would receive only about 60 per cent, of their current requirements. this reduction would have a disastrous effect on the housing programme,and he urged that additional coal should be supplied to the building materials industries, even at the expense of cutting the allocations to other industries.The President of the Board of Trade said that the additionalcoal required to give the building materials industries 86 - 6 per cent,of their current requirements plus the agreed stocking-up allowance would amount to 548,000 tons; and he estimated that if this amountof coal were found by cutting the allocations to other industries;there would be a reduction of about  50 million in manufacture forexport. If there were no increase in the total amount of coalallocated to industry for the summer months, an increase of 548,000tons in the allocations to the building materials industries would
involve very heavy cuts in the allocations to industries such as foodprocessing, chemicals and engineering. This must cause a heavyloss in exports, which would mean that by the end of 1947 we shouldhave failed to raise our exports even to 100 per cent, of the 1938figure. We should thus be driven into a situation which we couldonly retrieve by the most drastic reduction of imports or by recourse to further borrowing from dollar countries.Other points in discussion were : (a) Any serious shortage of building materials in 1947 wouldhave a most adverse effect on the plans for expanding the building labour force and would reinforce the demand of the building opera-tives&apos; unions for the closing of the building training centres.(5) During 1946 large quantities of cement had been exported.Though these exports had now been reduced, the coal saving wasoffset by the increased home demand for cement.(c) The Cabinet were informed that the Chancellor of theExchequer would regard the loss of  50 million of exports as a most      oo ... j.    ^In further discussion there was general recognition of the gravepolitical and economic difficulties which would arise if the building materials industries obtained only 60 per cent, of the coal requiredto maintain their present level of output. On the other hand, itwas recognised that this coal could not safely be provided at theexpense of the allocations proposed for other industries. It wastherefore suggested that the total allocation to industry for the summer months should be increased by some 500,000 tons so as toenable the building materials industries to receive about 85 per cent,of their current requirements without any reduction in the alloca-tions to other industries.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that at the meeting ofthe Fuel Committee on 21st April he had drawn attention to therisk involved in allocating to industry for the summer months evenas much as 24-3 million tons of coal.&quot; On the other hand, the latestcoal production figures were encouraging, and it was also possiblethat stocks at the end of the 1946-47 coal year would be found tohave been rather over the 5 million tons for which he had budgeted.11id Oaomet_(1) Agreed that the total amount of coal allocated to industry for the period 1st June to 31st October, 1947, should beincreased by such an amount as would enable the building materials industries to receive about 85 per cent, of their requirements during that period without reducing the allocations to other industries, on the understanding thatthe allocation scheme would be reviewed during the summer in the light of the level of coal production andthe prospective stock position at the beginning of thewinter.(2) Agreed that the President of the Board of Trade shouldmake a statement in the House of Commons on the linesof Annex II to CP. (47) 139, subject to the additionof a sentence explaining: that the allocation scheme wouldmake special provision&quot; for the expansion in production which had taken place in the building materialsindustries since the summer of 1946.umber. 5    The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the PresidentInternational of the Board of Trade (CP. (47) 136 and 137) on the internationalAllocations.      allocation of timber.The President of the Board of Trade said that purchases ofsawn softwood timber were subject to allocation by a Timber Sub-Committee of the Emergency Economic Committee for Europe. InFebruary the Sub-Committee had estimated that 1,913,000 standardswould be available in 1947, and the United Kingdom had accepted
1,122,000 standards as her buying limit. If, however, we were successful in our negotiations for the purchase of timber fromRussia, we should probably be able to make from all sources pur-chases in excess of our quota; Our requirements of softwood for1947 were estimated at 1,671,000 standards, largely for housing and railways, and we were thus under some temptation to buy all -wecould. On the other hand, if we refused to limit or transfer someof our own purchases in the interests of other countries whose needswere equally great, we should probably cause the collapse of theSubcommittee and prejudice the operation of similar machineryfor the international allocation of scarce commodities. The Presi-dent therefore proposed that we should give an assurance that, if further purchases which we might make in Kussia or elsewhereshould bring our total probable arrivals in 1947 above 1,122,000standards, we should be ready to make available to other member countries that proportion of the excess (i.e., a total of eight-nine-teenths) to which they would be entitled in accordance with their original quota of the total allocation.The Foreign Secretary said that he had at first feared that therecommendations in CP. (47) 136 might involve our sacrificingtimber purchases secured by the diversion of exports which would otherwise have earned hard currencies. He had, however, received an assurance from the President of the Board of Trade that, if itshould prove necessary in order to secure Russian timber to make available supplies equivalent to hard currencies, we should make our undertaking conditional upon the other importing countries taking their fair share of dollar timber and paying for it either in dollarsor in supplies equivalent to dollars.The Cabinet Approved the recommendations made by the President ofthe Board of Trade in paragraph 10 of CP. (47) 136.Iron and SteelIndustryNationalisa-tion jBIH.(previous reference:CM. (47)40thConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The Minister of Supply recalled that at their meeting on28th April the Cabinet had agreed that he should defer until alater stage consultations with the Iron and Steel Federation on theGovernments plan for bringing under public ownership certain sections of the iron and steel industry. Since then, however,information about the Governments decision had been published in the Press, and in view of this he would find it difficult to refrain from making any communication to the employers&apos; side of theindustry. He therefore sought authority to inform the Chairmanof the Iron and Steel Federation, in confidence, that the Govern-ment had decided to bring an appropriate area of the industry under public ownership, by buying the shares of a number of companies,with a view to securing the reorganisation of the industry. Hewould add that he would be glad to consider any technical commentswhich the Federation might wish to offer on this decision.The Prime Minister said that it Was most embarrassing to theGovernment that information about this decision should have become known to the Press; but, as this disclosure had been made, he thoughtthat the Minister of Supply had now no alternative but to make a communication on the lines proposed to the Chairman of the Ironand Steel Federation. He should, however, decline at this stage to disclose any of the details of the Governments scheme.The Cabinet -Authorised the Minister of Supply to make a confidentialcommunication to the Chairman of the Iron and steel federation, in the terms indicated above, regarding theGovernments decision to bring under public ownershipcertain sections of the iron and steel industry.

Poland.

Financial and Trade Agreements.

7. The Foreign Secretary said that on his return journey from Moscow he had taken the opportunity of seeing the new Prime Minister of Poland and had had a satisfactory conversation with him about the Anglo-Polish Financial Agreement and the question of compensation for British subjects who had suffered financial loss through Polish schemes of nationalisation. As a result of this conversation he had reason to believe that, if the Anglo-Polish Financial Agreement were concluded a satisfactory settlement would be reached immediately thereafter on the compensation question. He therefore sought the authority of the Cabinet to proceed with the conclusion of the Financial Agreement. He read to the Cabinet the instructions which he proposed to send to our Chargé d&apos;Affaires in Warsaw with the object of securing that agreement on both questions would be reached within the same week.

The Cabinet were informed that the terms of a Trade Agreement with Poland had also been settled and that this could be concluded as soon as the Financial Agreement was signed.

The Cabinet-

(1) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to proceed with the conclusion of the Anglo-Polish Financial Agreement.

Displaced Persons.

The Foreign Secretary said that the Polish Government were now ready to take up a more helpful attitude about the return of displaced persons to Poland. He had been assured that an effective amnesty had been declared and that no political tests would be applied to persons desiring to return to Poland. There were indications that the Polish Government were now genuinely anxious to secure the return of substantial numbers of their nationals from abroad; and there was a good prospect of our being able to return to Poland a large proportion of the 135,000 Poles still in the British Zone of Germany.

The Cabinet-

(2) Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement about the return of displaced Poles to Poland.

Germany. Fusion of British and United States Zones.

(Previous References: C.M. (46)102nd Conclusions, and C.M.(47)26th Conclusions, Minute 4.)

8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum (C.P.(47) 143) by the Foreign Secretary on the divergence of view between the British and United States authorities in Germany on the means of implementing the economic fusion of the British and United States Zones.

The Foreign Secretary said that he thought it unlikely that these differences would be resolved by discussions in Berlin; and he intended that, if agreement was not reached within a specified time, the issue should be taken up with the United States Government in Washington. He therefore proposed that our representative in Berlin should be authorised to bring the matter to a head by presenting to his United States colleague the specific proposals summarised in Appendix A of C.P.(47) 143; and that if, at the end of the time-limits therein specified, it was clear that agreement would not be reached between them, these discussions should be suspended and the issues taken up with the United States Government.

The Foreign Secretary said that the United States authorities in Germany would be more ready to agree to effective central control in the combined Zone if it were exercised under the direction of a bi-zonal Parliament; but he was satisfied that political fusion of the two Zones by the constitution of a bi-zonal Parliament would be premature and would prejudice the prospects of reaching agreement with the Soviet Union when the Council of Foreign Ministers resumed discussion of the German question in November. The Cabinet endorsed the Foreign Secretary&apos;s view on this point.


In further discussion reference was made to the ToreignSecretary&apos;s assurance that the proposals in CP. (47) 143 would not affect the Cabinets policy for socialising the principal industries in the British Zone. Was it intended to put on record, in anywritten communication to the United States Government, ouradherence to the policy of socialisation ?The Foreign Secretary said that the first step must be to discuss with the Governments of France and Belgium the question of safe-guarding the interests held by their nationals in the Ruhr industries.Similar discussions might thereafter be necessary with the Govern-ments of Luxembourg and the Netherlands. These governments were still apprehensive about our policy of socialisation. Therewere, however, indications that the United States authorities mightnot raise objection to this policy if the ownership of the industries were vested in a Land, rather than a zonal authority.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that our representative in Berlin should be instructed to put to his United States colleague the specific proposals summarised in Appendix A of cp. (47) 143 for implementing the economic fusion ofthe British and United States Zones;(2) Agreed that, if the existing differences were not resolved bydiscussions in Berlin within the time-limits specified in cp. (47) 143, the Foreign Secretary should arrange forthese issues to be taken up with the United StatesGovernment through the diplomatic channel.Dockers&apos;Strike.(previous reference:CM. (47) 41stConclusions,Minute 1.)9. The Cabinet were informed that the Executive Council ofthe Scottish Transport and General Workers&apos; Union had recom-mended that the Glasgow dockers should accept the offer of an enquiry into the question of redundancy at Glasgow and shouldmeanwhile resume work. The local branches of the Union had not,however, accepted this recommendation; and at a meeting of the strikers that morning a majority had voted in favour of continuing the strike. Steps were now being taken to determine the matterfinally by a secret ballot.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,1st May, 1947.
