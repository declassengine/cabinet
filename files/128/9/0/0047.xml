The Cabinet were informed that on 19th May LordLlewellin would initiate a debate in the House of Lords on a Motioncalling attention to the proposal to build a large power station atBankside and moving for Papers; and Lord Latham had indicated that he would feel bound to express in this debate the objectionstaken to this proposal by the London County Council. The termsof the Motion were such that the Government would not be embarrassed ifwere earned; but it weimportant that theGovernment spokesman should know whether there was any prospect that the Cabinefs decision on this matter might be reconsidered.The Prime Minister said that much of the public agitation against this proposal was misconceived. He was not, however,entirely satisfied that the possibility of building on an alternativesite had been fully explored, and he had asked the Minister of Pueland Power whether it would be possible for the additionalgenerating capacity to be provided by the municipal undertakingat Poplar.The Minister of Health said that after inspecting the site atBankside he felt that valid objection could be taken on amenitygrounds even to the modified proposal approved by the Cabinet on1st April. He had been informed that the necessary generating capacity could be provided at Botherhithe with much less delay thanthe Cabinet had been led to believe. He would be glad if some further enquiry could be made into the matter.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had not previously been aware that the additional generating capacity to be providedby the first section of the new station at Bankside would representless than 5 per cent, of the programme for London of nearlvA&quot;fj   -UXllJLJAJll   JVJ.X\J VV Clrl/uo.The Minister of Labour said that he remained in favour of proceeding with the, modified proposal which the Cabinet had approved, since this would be a first step towards the satisfactoryre-development of the North Southwark area.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord President to consider with the Ministerof Labour, the Minister of Fuel and Power, the Ministerof Health and the Minister of Town and Country Planningwhether in the light of further information it would bedesirable to modify their decision of 1st April to proceedwith the erection of a power station at Bankside.[33688-2] b 2
NationalService Bill.(previous reference:C.M.(47)41stConclusions.Minute 3.)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Ministerof Defence (CP. (47) 152) on the provision in Clause 6 (2) of theNational Service Bill empowering Service Departments to canceltraining notices.The Minister af Defence said that this provision was designedto enable a Service Department to cancel a training notice if forsome emergency reason the date and place appointed proved to beunsuitable. During the Committee stage it had been represented that cancellation at short notice might impose considerable hardshipor financial loss on the men concerned, and an undertaking had beengiven that the point would be reconsidered before the Report Stage.He believed that there was a real risk of hardship, and he recoui-mended that the Government should abandon the proposal to take power to cancel training notices, while retaining the power to varyty means of a supplementary notice the place or the time of day at which a man should report. He understood that the Secretaryof State for Air favoured this course. The alternative of retainingClause 6 (2) unchanged, while giving assurances that the power to cancel would be used only in real emergency, was likely to leadto a demand for financial compensation for any losses suffered by persons affected by the cancellation of training notices.The First Lord of the A dwAralty said that the number of menliable to be called up for training in the Navy at any one time wouldbe relatively small and he saw no serious difficulty in dispensing withthe power to cancel training notices.The Secretary of State for War said that if it proved impossibleto hold a large-scale formation training exercise because of a railway strike, the War Office would be in an awkward position ifthey had no power to cancel the training notices which they had issued. He would therefore prefer to retain the power to canceltraining notices while giving the fullest assurances that it wouldnot be used unreasonably.In further discussion it was urged that the retention of this power might involve the Exchequer in a liability to pay compensa-tion to an extent which could not be foreseen or calculated: it might also encourage lax administration.cabinet-As-reed that Clause 6 (2) of the National Service BillO ---- ^should be amended so as to remove the power to canceltraining notices, while retaining power to vary by meansof a supplementary notice the place or time of day ofreporting.Parliament.legislative programme for the 1947-48 Session.(previous reference:CM. (47) 37thConclusions,Minute 8.)4. The Cabinet had before them a joint memorandum by theLord President and the Minister without Portfolio (CP. (47) 151)submitting a revised provisional programme of major and medium-sized Bills for the 1947-48 Session.ThePresident said that in accordance with the Cabinetsdecision of 20th March the Future Legislation Committee had discussed with the Ministers concerned means of lightening theprovisional programme for the 1947^48 Session, and had drawn upthe revised lists set out in paragraph 3 of CP. (47) 151. A numberof the Bills originally proposed had been omitted altogether and six other Bills were now included in a list of measures to be intro-duced only if time allowed. The final programme would also haveto incude the usual essential Bills and emergency measures the needfor which could not yet be foreseen : this would be submitted to theCabinet when the time came to consider the terms of The King&apos;sSpeech on the Opening of Parliament. The strain imposed onParliament, Ministers and officials by the heavy programmes oflegislation undertaken during the first two Sessions of the present
Parliament must be relieved; and be hoped the Cabinet would agreethat the programme for the third Session should be limited to bills which were not merely desirable but were also urgent in point oftime.Points made in discussion were : (a) The Secretary of State for War said that the exclusion from the programme of a Territorial and Reserve Forces Bill wouldmean a further delay in bringing into operation a calling-outprocedure enabling the most effective use to be made of reserves in the Territorial Army.(6) The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that he hoped that time would be found for a Veterinary Surgeons Bill,which was urgently needed to enable the universities to holdexaminations in veterinary science and so to expand the training facilities for veterinary surgeons.(c) The Lord Chancellor urged that an undertaking should begiven in The King&apos;s Speech to introduce a Legal Aid Bill in the1947-48 Session. This Bill would be based on proposals drawn upby the Labour Party which had been adopted by the RushcliffeCommittee. A detailed scheme of administration had beenprepared by the Law Society and approved by the Lord presidents committee; and the Bill, which would be supported by all Parties,could be introduced in the House of Lords and passed without making excessive demands on Parliamentary time.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that parallel legisla-tion for Scotland should be passed concurrently.It was pointed out that the legislation proposed, even though in itself non-contentious, might still take up a substantial amount ofParliamentary time. The Cabinet might, however, be able to reconsider the claims of the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary ofState for Scotland if, after consulting the Opposition and lawyersof all Parties in both Houses, they were able to give a firm assurance that the demands on Parliamentary time would be small and if theprovisions relating to both England and Scotland could be combinedin a single Bill.(d) The Minister of Health said that he hoped that at a later stage a Nurses Bill might be included in the final programme.(e) The Minister of Food said that the Secretary of State forthe Colonies had suggested that the scope of the Overseas resources development Bill, which had originally been limited to the purposesof the East African ground nuts scheme, should be widened toauthorise other similar schemes of Colonial development. this might mean a considerable increase in the size of the Bill.(/) The Minister of Labour said that he hoped that it wouldbe possible to find time in the 1947-48 Session for a Bill to con-solidate the National Service Acts.(g) The Home Secretary pointed out that the Defence Regula-tions in Parts I and II of the First Schedule to the EmergencyLaws (Transitional Provisions) Act, 1946, would expire on31st December, 1947. A limited number of these could be continued in force thereafter by the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill. If,however, a substantial number of them had to be continued separate legislation would probably be necessary.(h) The Secretary of State for Scotland said that he thoughtit would be possible to introduce the Agriculture (Scotland) Bill inthe House of Lords.The Cabinet. (1) Approved the lists in paragraph 3 of OP. (47) 151 as a provisional programme of major and medium-sizedBills for the 1947-48 Session, and agreed that, subject
to the prior claims of the Bills in this programme, the bills listed in paragraph 4 of CP. (47) 151 might beprepared with a view to their introduction in the 1947-48Session if time allowed.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland to take soundings with a view to ascer-taining whether legislation on the subject of legal aidcould be passed in the 1947-48 Session without making any substantial demands on Parliamentary time andwhether the provisions applying to England and scotland could be included in a single Bill, and to reportthe results of their enquiries to the Future legislation committee.(3) Took note that the Future Legislation Committee would keep under review the progress made with the prepara-tion of the Bills listed in paragraphs 3 and 4 of cp, (47) 151 and that a final programme for the 1947-48Session would be submitted to the Cabinet when thetime came to consider the terms of The King&apos;s speech on the Opening of Parliament.Paper for(previous reference:C.M.(47)21stConclusions,Minute 6.)5.   On 13th February the Cabinet had invited the Homeefftpc   C0U.ldpropeny oe taKen to prevent tne proprietors irom resuming puonca-tion of A ction, the periodical issued up to June 1940, by the british union of Fascists. The Cabinet now had before them a memo-randum by the Home Secretary (CP. (47) 135) reporting that, after full discussion with both the Lord Chancellor and the President ofthe Board of Trade, he had been forced to the conclusion that therewas no means of preventing the publication of Action short of fresh legislation specifically directed to that purpose. Moreover, as itwould be useless: to legislate in respect of a particular namedpublication, because other publications might replace it, and as itwould be impossible to define the term &apos;&apos; Fascist&apos;&apos; or to leave itto the Courts to decide whether any particular publication was&quot; Fascist,&quot; legislation would have to take the form of empowering the Home Secretary to suppress publications which he considered to be &quot; Fascist.&quot; To confer such power on a Minister would be inconsistent with the principle of a free Press, would antagonisethose who genuinely cared for freedom and would be represented as constituting a political censorship. He could not therefore recommend the introduction of such legislation.In discussion Ministers expressed agreement with the HomeSecretary&apos;s reasoning but were reluctant to -accept the conclusionthat nothing could be done to prevent the publication of Action.Its reappearance would give rise to controversy and ill-feeling inthis country; and the effects on public opinion abroad would be evenTV. nT* l     **J    c&quot; + 11 tiIm &apos;  J&quot; y-vrt \rit-1 geddrs.\     t\\^.-nr\e\ r$     ttt/mi 1 A     nil A r\11        a.r\ 1 an &quot;Pf AT1if we allowed the publication of this periodical to be resumed.It was the view of the Cabinet that a further attempt shouldbe made to find means of preventing the publication of thisperiouicai, siiuilioi legislation on uie iiiius ucsciuuea. m \j.r. \fti) s.oo.Thus, would it be practicable for the President of the Board ofTrade, with the authority of the Cabinet, to direct the PaperControl to refuse any allocation of paper for this purpose; andfor Ministers to defend that decision, not as one taken in the discretion of the Paper Control on grounds of paper shortage, butas a Government decision taken on broad political grounds?The Cabinet-Invited the Home Secretary to consider further, in consul-tation with the Lord Chancellor and the President of theBoard of Trade, whether means other than those outlined in CP. (47) 135 could not be devised for preventing thepublication of Action; and agreed to resume their discus-sion of this question at a future meeting.
India.constitutional position.(previous reference:CM. (47)23rdConclusions,Minute 1.)6. The Prime Minister informed tihe Cabinet that the Indiaand Burma Committee had for some days past been consideringproposals submitted by the Viceroy for determining successorauthorities to whom power could be transferred in India. TheCommittee had had the advantage of conferring with the Viceroy&apos;principal advisers, who had come to London for the purpose; but since they left India the Viceroy had been continuing his conversa-tions with. Indian leaders and the Committee had reached theconclusion that, before final decisions were taken, it would be expedient that the Viceroy should come to Londonhimself to giveMinisters his latest appreciation of the position. He had therefore been asked to come to London on a short visit as soon as possible, sothat he might be able to return to India by the date (2nd June)on which he had undertaken to place definite proposals before theIndian leaders.The Prime Minister read to the Cabinet the draft of anannouncement, which was to be issued that afternoon regarding theme v^aomtsL-Took note of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement and of theterms of the announcement which was to be made later that day.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,15th May, 1947.
