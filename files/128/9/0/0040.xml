Coal.Allocationsfor Industry.(previous reference:CM. (47) 34thConclusions,Minute 1.)1.   The Minister of Health said that at their meeting on21st April the Fuel Committee had considered what allocations ofcoal could be made to industry during the period 1st June to31st October, 1947, and had decided that industries should receiveduring that period, for both consumption and stocking, the amounts which they had consumed in the same period of 1946.   The Com-mittee had been informed that on this basis industry as a whole would receive 86-8 per cent, of their present requirements for current consumption and stock-building.   Since then he had been considering, with the Minister of &quot;Works, the effect of these proposedallocations on the building materials industries.    During the summer of 1946 the capacity of those industries had been substan-tially expanded; and, if they were now to receive allocations basedon that period, they would obtain this summer far less than 86 - 8 percent, of their requirements of coal.   The effect on tihe building programmes would be disastrous. He had already planned to reducethe number of new houses to be started in 1947; but, if tihe coalrequirements of the building materials industries were to be cutto the extent now proposed, it would also become necessary to stop the building of houses&apos;already under construction.  Serious dislocation-tion must &quot;also be expected in the building materials industries themselves.   They would be unable to maintain output at the levelto Which it had been raised; and the efforts which had been madeto bring additional labour into the industries would be frustrated.If these developments were allowed to occur at a time when Govern-ment spokesmen were stressing the urgency of providing houses for miners and farm workers, and the importance of increasing thelabour force in undermanned industries, it would be difficult tomeet the criticism that there was a lack of consistency in theGovernments economic planning.In these circumstances the Minister asked that the Presidentof the Board of Trade should defer the announcement, which he was proposing to make in the House of Commons that afternoon, aboutthe allocation of coal to industry during the coming summer or,alternatively, that he should make an announcement in terms whichwould permit reconsideration of the allocations to be made to thebuilding materials industries.In discussion, reference was also made to the pressure frombuilding operatives&apos; unions for the closing of the government training centres for builders. If there was any substantial curtail-ment of building programmes, it would be more difficult to resistthis pressure.Some Ministers suggested that the Government should adopt amore selective policy in the allocation of coal to industry. Inlandconsumption of coal was now higher than it had been before thewar; and it was clear that, economically, the country was attemptingmore than it could achieve. A uniform percentage reduction in coal supplies to all industries might produce widespread dislocation-tion. Would it not be preferable, by a deliberate act of policy,to shut down some industries altogether and reduce tihe coal con-sumption of some others, so that the essential industries might be assured of their fuel requirements?The President of the Board of Trade said that he had been satisfied that it would not be possible, in the time available, towork out the intricate details of a selective scheme designed toensure that the available coal was used to the best advantage inthe national interest. It was, however, essential that supplies shouldbe reduced in such a way as to avoid disrupting the relation ofone industry with another. He had therefore taken as a basis the coal consumption) of industry in the summer of 1946, when theinter-relation between industries was fairly satisfactory; and he believed that, if industries received this summer the same amounts of coal as they had used last summer, it might be possible to avoid the serious dislocation which would in his view be caused by a selective policy which had not been worked out in sufficient detail.The building materials industries were not by any means the onlyindustries which had been expanded during 1946; and they wouldnot suffer on this account more than many other industries.
After further discussion The Prime Minister said that, as theCabinet evidently desired to review the decision taken by the FuelCommittee on 21st April, it would be,preferable that they should postpone further consideration of this question until memorandacould, be circulated by the Ministers concerned.The Cabinet. (1) Asked the President of the Board of Trade to defer forthe time being the announcement which he had proposedto make about the allocation of coal to industry duringthe summer months;(2) Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to circulate to them the memorandum on this question which had beensubmitted to the Fuel Committee by the President ofthe Board of Trade;(3) Invited the Ministers of Health and Works to submit amemorandum setting out the effect of the proposedallocations on the Government building programme;(4) Agreed to resume further discussion of this question when these memoranda were available.2. The Cabinet resumed consideration of the memorandumby the Minister of Supply (CP. (47) 123) outlining his scheme for bringing certain sections of the iron and steel industry under public-ownership. They also had before them a further memorandum bythe Minister of Supply (CP. (47) 132) on the three questions onwhich their previous discussion had mainly turned.The Cabinet agreed that, for the reasons given in paragraphs and 9 of CP. (47) 132, it would be expedient to acquire the wholeof the shares of the companies concerned.The Cabinet then considered on what basis the shares shouldbe bought.In favour of purchase on the basis of Stock Exchange prices,it was pointed out that this method had been adopted in theTransport and Electricity Bills, and had been defended as a fair and objective system of valuation. The Socialisation of industries committee had. already decided that it would be unprofitable toattempt to make any allowance for past State action in furtheringthe development of the industry; and it seemed clear that the only practicable alternative to acquisition at Stock Exchange prices would be valuation by an independent tribunal with terms ofreference so drawn as to cover all relevant considerations, includingthe condition of the physical assets to be transferred. It wouldbe difficult to obtain the services of the necessary valuers andaccountants for this purpose and great delay and expense wouldbe involved in carrying out the valuation. All the available evidencesuggested that the values of the quoted shares had been discountedto take account of obsolescent and obsolete plant; and the tribunalset up to value the unquoted shares would naturally take intoaccount, not only past yields, but also prospective yields, for whichpurpose they would have regard to the degree of obsolescence of the plant. This was, in fact, the procedure in valuing such sharesfor the purpose of death duties. It was also pointed out that,though much of the existing plant would eventually become obsolete,the process of re-equipping the iron and steel industry could hardly be completed in less than ten years and the great bulk of the existingplant would have to continue in use during that period.In these circumstances the Cabinet approved the proposal ofthe Minister of Supply that purchase should be on the basis of stock Exchange prices..The Cabinet then discussed whether the form of organisationof the industry after nationalisation should, at least in the initial stages, be based on the retention of the existing company structure.Against this proposal, it was argued that, if the Governmentacquired the whole of the shares of the companies concerned, it was
difficult to see what incentive the companies would have to initiative and enterprise. Moreover, though there would be a plausible case for bringing under public ownership a thoroughly efficient firm onthe ground that it was only by this means that it could be integrated with other firms, would the Government not find it difficult tojustify the acquisition of such a firm if it were to remain anindependent unit? And was it not likely that, in such a case,the more enterprising directors and staff would transfer to some,sector of the industry which was not to be nationalised ?On the other hand, it was pointed out that these companies were engaged on a great variety of processes and depended largely on the sale of products made to individual specifications for particular buyers both in the United Kingdom and in the highlycompetitive markets overseas. There would, therefore, be great advantage in maintaining the identity at least of the majority ofthe firms, and the experience of large combines under private enter-prise showed that this was not incompatible with a spirit ofemulation in efficiency between the directors and staffs of differentcompanies within a combine. Moreover, at the finishing end of theindustry there would be competition between companies brought under public ownership and private companies.The Cabinet approved the proposal of the Minister of supply to retain the existing company structure, though it was recognisedthat the case for so doing would have to be carefully presented whenthe Governments intentions were made public.The Lord Chancellor said that, in his view, it would be unwise to proceed with this scheme at the present time, and that the better course would be to acquire not more than 51 per cent, of the shares of the existing companies; to empower a statutory Central board to give directions to these companies; and to make the Boardresponsible for all new developments. He believed that a scheme on those lines would promote efficiency and save an enormous expen-diture of public money. He recognised, however, that the pre-dominant view in the Cabinet was clearly in favour of proceeding with a scheme on the lines proposed by the Minister of Supply.The following additional points were made in discussion :-(a) Where an engineering firm had an ancillary steel-producingplant the whole of whose produce was consumed by the firm, thegeneral intention was to allow the firm to continue to operate thatplant under licence.(b) The proposed Bill would be supplemented by a White paper setting out more fully the intentions of the Government and thearguments for bringing the iron and steel industry under public ownership.(c) The Minister of Supply bad already given the trade unions concerned a general indication of the lines on which he was working and was satisfied that his proposals would meet with their approval.He suggested, and it was agreed, that any consultation with the Ironand Steel Federation and other representatives of employers in theindustry should be deferred until a later stage.The Cabinet (1) Approved the scheme outlined in Appendix II to CP. (47)123 for bringing under public ownership certain sectionsof the iron and steel industry, and authorised theMinister of Supply to arrange for the drafting of a Billon the lines set out in Appendix I to CP. (47) 123 witha view to its being ready for introduction early in the1947-48 Session;(2) Invited the Minister of Supply in due course to circulate for their consideration a draft of the explanatory white paper which he proposed to publish simultaneously with cabinet Office, S.W. 1,28th April, 1947
