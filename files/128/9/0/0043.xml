Germany.Meeting ofForeignMinistersin Moscow.(previous reference:C.M.(47)25thConclusionsMinute 3.)1. The Foreign Secretary gave the Cabinet a full report onthe proceedings at the Moscow meeting of the Council of foreign ministers.The main features of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s report may besummarised as follows : Reparations and Level of German Industry. In reply to theRussian claim for reparations from current production in Germany,the Foreign Secretary had argued that he could not accept anyii-pciiutions policy which would impose a further burden on the British taxpayer. If reparations were taken from current production before Germany had achieved a favourable balance oftrade and had repaid the cost of the essential supplies with which she was now being provided at the expense of the Western Powers,these Powers would in effect be paying reparations to Russia. While,therefore, he had not rejected in principle the Russian request for reparations from current production, he had insisted that furtherconsideration of this claim must be postponed until Germany had achieved a balanced economy.For this purpose he had urged a revision of the authorised levelof German industry. His aim had been to secure agreement toan annual level of steel production of 10 million tons. The russians were now willing to agree to a higher level, and had suggestedthat the permitted level of steel production should be raised to between 10 and 12 million tons. The United States authorities were now understood to be thinking in terms of 14 million tons of steel;and were proposing that the general level of German industry shouldbe raised to 75 or 80 per cent, of the level of 1938. The way was now open to initiate a further study of the proper level of german industry. The Foreign Secretary said that he was arranging forpreliminary enquiries to be put in hand by the interested Depart-ments of the United Kingdom Government, in the course of which full acount would be taken of British commercial and industrial interests.In the course of the discussions on the German economy, theRussians had urged that the agreement for the economic fusion ofthe British and United States Zones should be cancelled. It hadbeen made clear to them that the British and United States Govern-ments had been forced to take this step by the Russian refusal to implement the agreement reached at Potsdam for treating the wholeof Germany as an economic unit. The Anglo-American agree-ment for the economic fusion of their Zones would stand until satis-factory arrangements had been made for securing the economic unity of the whole of Germany. Meanwhile, the Russians could not properly claim rights to participate in tbe economic control of theBritish and United States Zones while treating the Russian Zoneas a closed preserve of their own.Political Organisation of Germany:- The Russians had begunby advocating a strongly centralised State, but had subsequentlyfavoured a political organisation based mainly on the Weimar Con-stitution. Their attention had been drawn to the risks involvedin conferring such wide powers on the President of a centralisedGerman State : this might well enable a second Hitler to usurpdictatorial powers over the whole of G-rm-^uv. The foreign secretary had suggested that it would be preferable to approachthis problem by denning the powers which must be conferred on a central Government and leaving the remainder to the Land Govern-ments. In discussion the Russians had moved some way towardsacceptance of the British proposals : in particular, they had agreedthat executive responsibility for the police might vest in the land governments, subject only to powers of co-ordination at the centre.The French, on the other hand, had favoured an extreme form of de-centralisation which Would leave even the conduct of finance andforeign affairs to the Land Governments.While no agreement had been reached on the future political organisation of Germany, some progress had been made towards thereconciliation of the conflicting views originally advanced on behalfof the four Powers on this subject.
Denazification.- Agreement had been reached on the basis of allowing the German authorities to complete the progress ofdenazification.Demilitarisation-It had been difficult to defend our use ofGerman ex-Service men, under German officers, in the Dienstgrup-pen. The Russians had, however, eventually accepted our assurance that these organisations would be completely disbanded by the endof 1947, except for any which were still required to complete thework of minesweeping. In return, the Russians had agreed to com-plete by August 1947 the demolition of German warships in their possession.There had also been criticisms of our failure to complete the demolition of Category I industrial plants, viz., those usable only for the production of munitions. The destruction of some of theseplants had been delayed by the decision of the United states authorities to suspend the dismantling of plants earmarked for reparation deliveries. It had now been agreed that the demolition of these plants should be completed by 1st July, i948.There would be greater difficulty in reaching clear-cut decisions on the disposal of industrial plants in Categories II to IV, viz., thosewhich, though valuable as war potential, had a legitimate peace-timepurpose. The Foreign Secretary had declined to agree to the demolition of plants in these categories in the British Zone until agreement had been reached on a new level of Germarn industry.TTft had. however, instructed the British Element in the control commission to consider which of these plants could be demolished,on various hypotheses for the new level of German industry; and,when this information was available, he would submit his recom-mendations on this question to the Cabinet.Democratisation. It seemed doubtful whether we should beable to sustain our objection to the application of the principle of proportional representation in German elections. The foreign secretary was, however, considering whether the risks of a singlecentral list of candidates could be avoided by separate voting inthe Lander.We had now undertaken to complete the introduction of landreform in the British Zone by the end of 1947. There was a generalfear that, unless the larger estates were broken up, the Junkerswould regain their political influence in Germany. In the british zone all estates above 150 hectares were to be broken up.Some progress had been made towards the breaking down ofbarriers between the various Zones by an agreement providing for free exchange of information and democratic ideas between theZones. It had not, however, been possible to secure freedom of move-ment between the Zones. Nor had agreement been reached on theposition of Trade Unions in Germany.Territorial Claims. Discussion of the territorial claims on germany had been inconclusive. The Foreign Secretary had pro-posed the appointment of a Boundary Commission to report on thequestion of Poland&apos;s western frontier. There was reason to believethat in the area between the Eastern and Western Neisse the Poles,while they had settled the industrial districts, had left relativelyunpopulated a large tract of agricultural land to the south of Stettinand Gdynia. If the Poles were in fact unable to cultivate this areaadequately, this was bound to be a source of future trouble withGermany.We had been willing to agree that the Saar should be incor-porated in the French economy; but, in doing so, the French were proposing to incorporate territory to the north and west of thearea which included as many as 50,000 Germans.The Dutch were preferring a claim to compensate them for damage suffered in military operations towards the end of the war.The territory for which they were asking included industrial resources, particularly in oil, which could earn for Germany about 1 million a j^ear in foreign exchange.33612-2] B 2
Luxembourg was putting forward a claim designed to bring two important power stations within her territory. This should be resisted.Belgium was asking for small frontier rectifications for whichstrong arguments could be adduced on grounds of efficiency of communications.The French had abandoned their claim for the political separa-tion of the Ruhr and the Rhineland from Germany. As regards the rhineland, they would probably be satisfied by a provision for along-term Allied occupation. They were still pressing for four-Power control over the Ruhr, though they were now content that itshould remain part of Germany.Repatriation of German Prisoners.- There was little doubt thatour efforts to restore the German economy would soon be handi-capped by a shortage of labour. Many German refugees had returned to the British Zone; and, so long as substantial numbersof young Germans were retained as prisoners of war in Allied hands,there was a serious lack of balance in the age distribution of theindustrial population. If we insisted on retaining German prisoners to supplement our labour force in this country, we could not expect to restore full industrial production in the British Zone of Germany.The Foreign Secretary suggested that we should aim at completing the repatriation of German prisoners from this country by the endof 1948; and should increase our efforts to secure, in replacement,more displaced persons from Europe. Meanwhile, in future calcula-tions of our net expenditure on the British Zone, the Treasury shouldoffset the value to the British economy of the labour of german prisoners of war and other advantages which we had secured from our occupation of Germany.The Minister of Labour said that the organisation for trans-ferring displaced persons for employment in the United kingdom had now been completed, and displaced persons were being broughtover to this country at the rate of 4,000 a week.Peace Conference Procedure. Agreement had not beenreached on the report of the Deputies regarding the procedure tobe followed in the preparation and discussion of a peace treaty with Germany.The main point of difference between the Deputies had beenthe participation of belligerents other than the Four Powers in thework of preparing the draft treaty. Dominion Governments hadbeen insistent that some of the ether belligerents should be repre-sented on the drafting Committees. The Russians had insisted that these Committees should be confined to representatives of theFour Powers, though they were prepared to make some concession in respect of consultation with the other belligerents.There was also disagreement about the composition of thePeace Conference itself. It had hitherto been assumed that thiswould be confined to States which had taken an active part in thewar against Germany. The United States Government were now,however, proposing that the Conference should include representa-tives of all the 54 States who declared war on Germany. TheForeign Secretary had proposed that, while membership of the Con-ferenoe should be confined to the active belligerents, the remainder of the 54 nations should be kept officially in touch with the progressof the proceedings.There had also been some difference of view on the questionwhether the treaty should be signed on behalf of the German Govern-ment. The United States view was that it would be preferable not to associate a German Government with the treaty; and that acceptance of its provisions by the German people might be signifiedby incorporating it in a new constitution which would be adopted byplebiscite.All these questions had been remitted for further study by the deputies.
In summing up his report The Foreign Secretary said that thetime spent at this Moscow meeting had not been wasted. agreement had been reached on a number of minor points. On many of the major questions there had been a useful exchange of views and theattitude of the various Governments had been more clearly defined.The main obstacle to progress had been the failure to reach any agreement on the economic problems of Germany. The discussions were to be resumed in November; and it had been agreed that inthe meantime the exchange of views would be continued throughthe diplomatic channel. The discussions already held, and thesecontinued contacts through the diplomatic channel, should make it easier for the four Governments to make a fresh approach to these problems in November. Tha-t would be the critical meeting; andthe most strenuous efforts would have to be made to secure agreementthen on these vital questions which affected the whole future ofEurope.2. The Foreign Secretary said that he had hoped that thenegotiations for a peace treaty with Austria might have been successfully concluded in Moscow, in spite of the many points of disagreement recorded by the Deputies in their preliminary discus-sions in London. The major issue, on which no agreement had beenreached, was the definition of the German assets in Austria to bemade available for reparations. He had maintained the view that only assets secured before the Anschluss or by normal purchaseshould be included, and not those acquired by the Germans afterthe occupation and under duress. Adoption of the Russian formulawould nearly double the amount of the assets to be taken over. Inparticular, the question of the treatment of the Austrian oil industry had raised complex issues : the Russians had argued that no effectivedevelopment of the oil-field had taken place until after the german occupation. In the end, the Russians had agreed that the question should be re-examined by the Deputies in the light of a detailed investigation of the relevant facts of each of the specific assets underconsideration.The Russians had also pressed the claim of Yugoslavia for reparations from Austria. He had only been prepared to agreethat Yugoslavia should retain ex-enemy assets within her borders.He was also opposed to Yugoslavia^ territorial claims againstAustria, and had stood out for the maintenance of a TpTe-AnscMussfrontier. With regard, however, to Yugoslav complaints about theuse of water-power on the River Drau, he had suggested that thebest solution would be the establishment of an Austro-YugoslavBoard to administer the power supply on the border in the interestsof both countries.The Prime Minister thanked the Foreign Secretary for his full account, summarised in this and the preceding Minute, of theproceedings at the Moscow meeting of the Council of foreign ministers.Austria.Peace Treaty.(PreviousBeferen.ce:CM. (47)2ndConclusions,Minute 3.)Four-Power Treaty.--When the Council of Foreign ministers had discussed the United States draft of a Four-Power Treaty forthe disarmament and demilitarisation of Germany the Russians had attempted to secure the incorporation in the draft of provisionscovering most of the disputed points arising from the PotsdamProtocol. This was an attempt to delay effective discussion of thedraft treaty; and the United States Secretary of State had rejected the suggestion that these proposals for amendment of the treaty should be referred for examination by the Deputies. At the endof the meeting the United States Secretary of State had stated thathe would raise the project for a Four-Power Treaty at the next meeting of the Council in November. This confirmed certain otherindications that the United States Government were not orooosincto withdraw from Europe.
The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that he hadreceived from Dominion Governments the most cordial expressions of their gratitude to the Foreign Secretary for the trouble whichhe had taken to keep them currently informed of the progress ofthe discussions in Moscow.The Cabinet expressed their appreciation of the great patiencearid skill which the Foreign Secretary had shown in the conduct ofthese difficult negotiations.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,2nd May, 1947.
