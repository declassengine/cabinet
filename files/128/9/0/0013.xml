83CM. 13 (47)3&apos;defence estimates.(previous reference:CM. (47) 10thConclusions,Minute 2.)1 The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the memorandumby the Minister of Defence (CP (47) 33) on the Defence Estimates.The Minister of Defence said that he had considered on whatitems of expenditure reductions could be made with the leastdetriment to efficiency if it were decided to reduce by  80 million the figure of  822 million which he had proposed as the net current expenditure for the year 1947-48, and what the effect of thosereductions would be. &quot;lie reminded the Cabinet that the Estimatessubmitted to them in CP. (47) 33 had been subjected to a most careful examination, with the result that the figure for net current expenditure had been reduced from approximately  914 million toj?qoo ty,;ilir.n Tn imnose a further cut of 10 per cent, on thisreduced figure would mean a total cut on the Departmental pro-t. Further, many items in the estimates were not susceptible of reduction, with the result that if an overallcut of 10 per cent, was to be achieved those items which weresusceptible of reduction would have to bear a much higher per-centage cut.A total reduction of  80 million, if applied proportionately,woukTmean individual reductions of  19 - 5 million in the AdmiraltyEstimates,  36 million in the War Office Estimates,  20-5 million in the Air Ministry Estimates and  4 million in the Ministry ofSupply Estimates.To achieve a reduction of  19 - 5 million the Admiralty wouldhave to reduce their uniformed personnel by lt5,00U and their non-uniformed personnel by 6,000. As a result, it would be necessaryto pay off all aircraft carriers east of Suez, with their attendantdestroyers and servicing air stations, and all submarines in theMediterranean. The present reduced complements of ships wouldhave to be further diluted, and it would be necessary to abandon the Combined Operations provision for a Brigade lift, to closeadditional training establishments, virtually to cease all navalbuilding, to abandon re-fits in the Reserve Fleet, to restrict main-tenance in the Active Fleet and to reduce Gibraltar, Simonstownand either Singapore or Hong&apos; Kong to a care and maintenancebasis. Dockyard labour would have to be cut by 3,500 to 4,000;there would have to be a complete moratorium on new major works,including works for the improvement of living conditions and con-struction of married quarters, and a further reduction would&apos; haveto be made in the provision for research and development.To save  36 million the War Office would have&quot;to abandon all new production items included in the programme outlined in D.O.(47) 5, which would involve compensation in respect of contractsalready entered into, loss of war potential and a stop to even themodest beginnings of capital rearmament. In addition, it wouldbe impossible to continue the current year&apos;s programme of married quarters, to begin the first instalments of the new programmes, orto provide reasonable living accommodation for the Forces inPalestine and the Far Jiast. These measures would not in practicesave more than  20 million, and the only way of saving a further 16 million would be to make an additional &quot;cut of 100,000 in thestrength of the Army at 31st March, 1948. A cut of this kind would increase by approximately  7 million the terminal charges for 1947-48 and, when added to the deficiency of 82,000 men whichthe Army would, in any event, have to carry at 31st March, 1948,would make it impossible to. meet all our occupational commitmentsA further economy of  20 - 5 million in the Air Ministry Esti-mates would involve abandoning most of the provision for married quarters and the improvement of amenities and cutting the provi-sion for new aircraft. These economies would not, however, produce more than about one-third of the sum required and the rest wouldhave to be found by a reduction of about 85,000 in the size of theForce at 31st March, 1948. This would result in an increase ofapproximately  5 million in terminal charges and would mean a cut m the forces held for policing and transport commitments andthe virtual elimination of one at least of the home commands
As regards the Ministry of Supply, the only way of achieving]an economy on defence expenditure of the order of  4 million wouldbe to cut the provision for research and development, which woulimean delaying new projects or existing programmes, which ahead]fell short of what the Services required. On aircraft such a cmwould, if concentrated on new projects, entail a delay of a year.To sum up, the Estimates had already been so severely pruneibefore they had been presented to the Cabinet, and such a higiproportion of defence expenditure was virtually unavoidable, thaia further cut of the order proposed would have the most serious consequences on the efficiency and welfare of the Forces, their abilitjSto undertake current or immediately prospective commitments anilany plan for the establishment of balanced forces in future years!The Cabinet first discussed the information given by thjMinister of Defence about the effect of the proposed additions!cut of 10 per cent.   The following points arose : (a) New ship construction had already been slowed down to themaximum extent desirable. Any further suspension of new buildingwould mean leaving unfinished ships in private yards and thuspreventing firms from meeting demands for new merchant shipbuilding. In naval dockyards, it would lead to the discharge of par!of the nucleus labour force. Moreover, new types of aircraft werfrapidly coming into production, and if the completion of up-to-date aircraft carriers were to be slowed dbwn, we should, in a yesor two, find ourselves without suitable carriers for these new types.(6) The Admiralty Estimates were arranged in such a way asto make it difficult to give a figure for the overhead charges for thupkeep of naval dockyards at home and abroad, though it was clearthat the closing down of dockyards overseas would produce only a relatively small saving in 1947-48.(c) In the figure of  7-1 million for naval aviation require-ments in Annex I to D.O. (47) 5, an allowance had already beenmade for any shortfall in delivery of aircraft. To make the furthercuts in the naval aviation programme would mean cancelling alorders for Service aircraft from Short Brothers and breaking upthe design teams in four other aircraft firms.(d) A further cut of 10 per cent, in expenditure might enablia consequential cut of about 40,000-50,000 to be made in the manpower requirements of the production programmes.(e) The direct savings in expenditure which would result fromthe cuts in the strengths of the Forces mentioned by the Minister olDefence had been taken into account. But, until final decision&apos;had been, reached on where the reductions in strengths should fallit was impossible to estimate precisely what indirect savings iiexpenditure there would be.The Cabinet then turned to discuss the amount of the total sum to be provided in the Defence Estimates.The Prime Minister recalled that, at their meeting fflj21st January, a figure of  500 million had been quoted asCoalition Governments estimate of the post-war expenditure olDefence. This figure had been no more than a guess made &apos;the then Chancellor of the Exchequer as part of a tentative estifmate of the major items of expenditure in post-war years whelthe Coalition Government were considering the Beveridge social insurance plan. It had related to the year 1948, which had 1taken as the third year after the conclusion of the main hostilities!and had been based on the assumption that there would be 1 millwfmen in the Forces paid at 1942 rates, and that the total national[income would be about  8,000 million.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the total expend!^ture for which he had expected to make provision in his forthcoming budget would be around  3,000 million. If the proposals of minister of Defence were accepted, the position would be that afthe end of 1947-48, nearly three years after the end of the vm
85CM. 18 (17)with Germany, defence expenditure would be around one-third, or,if terminal charges were disregarded, one-quarter of the totalexpenditure provided for in the Budget. He had hoped originallythat defence expenditure might be of the order of  750 million,including terminal charges, and he was disappointed that theMinister of Defence had not been able to bring the expendituredown to about  860 million. A reduction of this order would makea very great difference to the Budget; and, as he had already :indicated, he would be prepared to consider sympathetically any ;proposal for Supplementary Estimates should it be found impossible jfor any one of the Service Departments to keep within the reducedexpenditure. He would also give an assurance that the treasury would make no difficulty with regard to vi?-ement within the JJepart-mATtt^! Estimates So far as could be foreseen, there was no dangerof a major war in the immediate future; but we were actually con-fronted at the moment with a very grave economic situation andthe figures to be included in the forthcoming Budget were of vitalimportance in this respect.The Minister of Defence said that he fully recognised theimportance of safeguarding the national economy and was most anxious to do everything in his power to help the Chancellor of the&quot;T71 !__..........

V c/Apnioovuto the Cabinet that any substantial Service cut would undoubtedly have a most serious effect on the ability of the Services to discharge their commitments and to begin the&quot; task of rebuilding balancedpeace-time Forces. Accordingly, he must press for approval ofthe programmes and strengths of the Forces proposed in CP. (47)33. He was, however, prepared in the special circumstances of )this year to make an additional cut of 5 per cent, in the financial ;provision, which would effect a saving of about  40 million. he made this offer on the strict understanding that the chancellor would make no difficulty about Supplementary Estimates should itprove impossible for the Services to keep within, the reduced figure and that the application of an overall percentage cut to the Esti-mates for 1947-48 would not be regarded as a precedent for future years. .The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was grateful tothe Minister of Defence for the offer which he had made and was prepared to acquiesce in a reduction sufficient to bring the total pro-vision in the Estimates down to a figure of  899 million, if theCabinet felt that this was the most that could be done. He willinglygave the assurances asked for by the Minister of Defence.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that, before agreeing tothe, revised proposals of the Minister of Defence, he would have preferred to see a further analysis of the proposed expenditure,showing what was attributable to the aftermath of war and whatto expenditure on the peace-time Forces. He found it difficult tobelieve that in the present grave economic situation, when we were faced with, an acute shortage of man-power and there was little likelihood of being able to achieve a satisfactory balance of pay-ments, expenditure on the Forces of the order proposed was justifi-able. It seemed., clear that there was no danger of our having tofight a major war for two or three years to come and, in thesecircumstances, he thought that the Forces could well afford to slowdown their re-equipment and training programmes.The Foreign Secretary said that he would be opposed to anyfurther substantial reduction in the production programmes or in research and development. Once expert design staff had been dis-sipated it was most difficult to restore war potential. It shouldalso be borne in mind that work for the Services frequently pro-duced results useful to civilian industry. He believed that theEstimates presented by the Minister of Defence represented a very substantial achievement, when allowance was made for the abnormalconditions of the present time, and he felt sure that, when theMinister had been able to consider his long-term plans for the
Services, he would! be able to make further improvements in the presentation of the Estimates. In particular, it would be desirableto make a clear distinction between expenditure attributable to theaftermath of the war and expenditure on the peace-time Forces andin addition to show separately expenditure of the nature of standingcharges.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the Defence Estimates for 1947-48 as set out&quot;in CP. (47) 38, on the understanding that, in view ofthe special circumstances affecting the Budget for1947-48, the Minister of Defence would arrange forsuch reductions in the financial provision for net currentexpeiiciiture as would oring tne total expenditure ctowuto a figure not exceeding  899 million.(2) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would con-sider sympathetically any requests for supplementary estimates which might be put forward by service departments as a result of their being unable to keepwithin the reduced expenditure and that Treasury con-sent to virement within the Estimates of individual departments would be freely given.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerof Defence, in consultation with the Service Ministers,to consider whether the form of the Service Estimatescould not be modified in future years with a view to(i) showing in more detail the constituent items of eachheading of the votes and enabling comparisons to bemade between the expenditure incurred by each service on similar items; (ii) separating expenditure attri-attributable to the aftermath of war from expenditure onthe development of the peace-time Forces; (iii) showing what amount of current expenditure was attributable tostanding charges.commercial policy.economic co-operationwith western europe.(previous reference:CM. (46) 91stConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (47) 35) proposing that a study should be made ofthe possibilities of closer economic co-operation between this countryand. w estern iiurope.The Foreign Secretary recalled that, when this proposal hadbeen before the Cabinet in an earlier paper (Q.F. (46) 886) on25th October, 1946, he had suggested that the Cabinet should deferconsideration of it until after the elections in France. He nowinvited the Cabinet to authorise the Departments concerned to makea comprehensive study of the implications of a customs union or,alternatively, some special economic regime falling short of a fullcustoms union between (i) the United Kingdom and MetropolitanFrance; (ii) the United Kingdom and the French Union; (iii) theUnited Kingdom and Western Europe as a whole, including thewestern zones of Germany. These possibilities should be examinedon. three alternative assumptions about the plans for an Inter-national Trade Organisation, viz., (a) that these plans came intooperation substantially throughout the western world; (&amp;) that they came into partial operation; (c) that they failed to come into opera-tion at all.The Foreign Secretary said that there would be obvious political advantage in promoting a closer association between the BritishCommonwealth and the countries of Western Europe; and it seemed likely that this could best be achieved by creating a community ofcommercial interest. It could not, however, be assumed that suchan arrangement would necessarily be of economic advantage to theUnited Kingdom; and it might be that economic disadvantageswould have to be weighed against political advantages. It was forthis reason that he suggested that a preliminary study should bemade of the implications of such a policy.
The President of the Board of Trade said a full assessment of the economic merits of such a policy could not be made withoutdetailed examination of the effects on our commercial and industrial position of the tariff changes which would be involved, e.g., in a customs union. This detailed examination could not be made with-out the assistance of departmental officials whose time was nowfully engaged in preparing for the International Trade Con-ferences. It must still be our first objective to seek to create an effective International Trade Organisation, and it would be a mis-take to relax our effort^ in that direction as we must do if the officials concerned were averted to the detailed study of alterna-tive policies. At the 1 .:ne time, he recognised that some thought should be given to alternative policies which might be adopted ifit proved impossible to establish an International Trade Organisa-tion on the lines now under discussion; and he was in favour ofinitiating a more general study, on broad lines, of the various alter-natives which would then be open. While a detailed examinationon the lines contemplated in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s paper couldnot be made without the collaboration of departmental officials, he believed that a broad appreciation could be made by economists out-side the Government service without encroaching on the time ofthe officials now working for the International Trade Conferences.The Chancellor of the Exchequer supported the views expressedi       .1      -o------ -1--j.

TO___J ^  T1,..,,]^Uy X ICOXUClllj m  uiici jl*uax m ui   -i.xciO.O.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that theDominions would be vitally concerned in any such developments;and he asked that his Department should be kept in touch with theprogress of any such study which might be set on foot.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that it would be useful if some pre-liminary study could be made of the alternative policies which might be adopted in the event of a complete or partial breakdown of the plans for an international trade Organisation, e.g., what other multilateralarrangements would be practicable or whether it wouldbe preferable to resort to bilateral arrangements.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade, the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Foreign Secretary to consider,and report to the Prime Minister, what arrangements could be made to have such a preliminary study carriedout by a group of economists outside Government service.(3) Agreed that the Dominions Office should be kept in touchwith the progress of any enquiry instituted in accord-ance with Conclusion (2) above.Food.British food supplies.(previous reference:CM. (46) 91stConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary(CP. (47) 40) covering a minute in which the Minister of Foodsought the Prime Minister&apos;s permission to pay an early visit to theUnited States to discuss means of maintaining the supply of essential food-stuffs to the United Kingdom.The Minister of Food said that the disposition of the UnitedStates Government to bring to an end the existing system of controland international allocation of food-stuffs might in some respectsbe turned to our advantage if the opportunity were taken to makefirm purchases on behalf of the United Kingdom; and it had been represented to him by the British Food Mission in North America,that early conversations at the Ministerial level would afford thebest opportunity for concluding such bargains. On future suppliesof meat, sugar, fats, wheat and coarse grains, there was much whichhe could profitably discuss with members of the United states administration. It had originally been suggested that he might seek such an opportunity for personal discussions by attending theforthcoming meeting of the International Emergency Food Council;
and, if that meeting could have been postponed for a few days, hewould have proposed to leave this country by ship on 30th January.It had been found, however, that this meeting could not be post-poned; and he no longer suggested that he should combine his visitwith attendance a,t this meeting. He now proposed that he should!go to the United States for the sole purpose of personal discussions with United States Ministers and that, to avoid any appearance ofspecial urgency, he should leave by sea some time during the courseof the next two or three weeks.In discussion the following points were made :-(a) The Foreign Secretary said that it was important to avoid giving any impression that we were making any further demands on the charity of the United States. In announcing his visit, andin any connected publicity, the Minister of Food should stress thefact that he was going on a purely business basis to buy food fromthe United States. It would be useful if all our dealings with theUnited States over food supplies could be seen more in the light ofbusiness transactions.(&amp;) The Cabinet should be consulted before any bargains were finally concluded which involved further departures from the systemof international allocation of food supplies.(c) Any purchases of food from the United States must be within the total of the approved programme of food imports from dollar sources.(d) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs suggested thatthe Canadian Government should be informed in advance of theMinisters visit, and that the Minister should also visit Canada atthe same time. The Minister of Food agreed to both these suggestions.The Cabinet Approved, subject to the points noted in paragraphs (a)-(d)above, the proposal that the Minister of Food should payan early visit to the United States and Canada to discussfuture food supplies from North America to the UnitedKingdom.Palestine.Public Order.(previous reference:CM. (47) 12thConclusions,Minute 3.)which theThe Cabinet&apos;s attention was drawn to the circumstances inBritish President of the District Court at Tel Aviv hadbeen kidnapped on the previous day, while his Court was sitting.The Cabinet expressed surprise that no arrangements appeared tohave been made for police or military guards at this Court.The Cabinet were also informed that the execution of the death sentence on the Jewish terrorist, Dov Groner, had been respited, ashe intended to apply for leave to appeal to the Privy Council.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he had alreadyasked for full information on both these matters; and, as soon as this was received, he would submit a report to the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office, S.
