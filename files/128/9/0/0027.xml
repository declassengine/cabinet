177G.M. 27 (47)1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (47) 75) recommending the withdrawal from southern Iraq of the brigade group known as Force 401.The Minister of State recalled that in July, 1946, the cabinet had authorised the despatch of this Force to Southern Iraq in viewOf the imminent risk of serious disturbances in Southern Persia,which might threaten the lives of British and Indian employees ofthe Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and disrupt the flow of essentialoil supplies. In recent months the situation in Persia had greatly improved; and His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Tehran had now recommended that, if the present Prime Minister obtained amajority in the new Persian Parliament, the Force should be with-drawn. Although the elections were not yet complete, the PrimeMinister now seemed assured of a substantial majority. It wastherefore recommended that (i) The Government of India should be asked to concur in thewithdrawal of Force 401 as soon as His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in tehran confirmed that the maintenance of that Force in SouthernIraq was no longer necessary;(ii) The Foreign Office, in consultation with the other Depart-ments concerned, should consider the desirability of making a public announcement about the withdrawal of Force 401;(iii) As soon as this Force hadjDeen withdrawn, the withdrawalof the remaining land forces in Iraq should be resumed;(iv) The Chiefs of Staff should prepare an outline standingplan for action in South Persia in case serious disturbances shouldoccur in the future.The Chief of the Air Staff said that the Chiefs of Staffsupported these proposals. They hoped that any announcement thatmight be made would contain no suggestion that the withdrawalwas due to military weakness. The Commanders-in-Chief,Mediterranean, had already been asked to prepare an alternative plan for action in South Persia; but this would necessarily be lessprecise and less effective than earlier plans and would be dependenton the forces available at the time.The Minister of Defence said that it should be recognised thatthis withdrawal involved talcing some risk in an area which was of great strategic importance by reason of our oil supplies. any alternative plan for future action in South Persia would impose aserious strain on our air resources in the Middle East.In further discussion, Ministers questioned the need for any public announcement about the withdrawal of Force 401. Couldnot this withdrawal be treated as part of the general evacuation of British troops from Iraq under the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty? TheSecretary of State for India said that some announcement about thewithdrawal would probably be expected in India. It was, however,the view of the Cabinet that efforts should be made to induce theGovernment of India to agree that no such public announcement should be made.The Cabinet (1) Approved the recommendations made in CP. (47) 75 and summarised in paragraphs (i), (iii) and (iv) aboveregarding the withdrawal of Force 401 from SouthernIraq.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for India to seek to persuade the Government of India that no public announcement should be made about the withdrawal of this Force; butagreed that, if these efforts were unsuccessful, theMinister of State should have discretion to settle, inconsultation with the other Ministers Concerned, theterms in which the withdrawal should be announced.
Reform ofLegalProcedure.(previous reference:CM. (46) 45thConclusions,Minute 10.)TinC^.f* Kin of      nr\r\ ct r\ ar* \tAa memorandum by the LordChancellor (CP. (47) 77) embodying the Final &quot;Report of the ministerial Committee on the Reform of Legal Procedure.The Lord Chancellor recalled that in their First and second interim Reports the Committee had discharged the second part oftheir terms of reference on practice and procedure in Divorceproceedings. They had now considered the remainder of the field and had come to the conclusion that a review of practice and proce-dure in other Divisions of the Supreme Court, and in the county court, would be likely to lead to reduction in the cost of litigation.They therefore recommended the appointment of two committees to enquire into the present practice and procedure of the SupremeCourt and the County Court, respectively. It was contemplated that, while these Committees would contain a number of laymen,the bulk of the preliminary&apos; work would be undertaken by Sub-riAmmiMpM consi&apos;s&apos;tincr of the Chairmen and four or five membersacquainted with the technicalities of the subject.The Lord Chancellor said that he would encourage both Com-mittees to submit interim reports, so that all remedial action neednot await the final conclusion of the enquiries. He asked that thefinal selection of the members of these Committees should be leftto his discretion.Tn discussion, the following points were raised : \0j) xiia j.reasuiy ouhCiluj., ur mc ooiicibOr iu une ox me mamGovernment Departments, should be a member of the Supreme CourtCommittee.   This was agreed to.(b) It was proposed that the Supreme Court Committee should include a representative of the Trades Union Congress; but thatthe County Court Committee should include a representative of theTrades Union Congress or the National Union of Mineworkers orthe National Union of Railwaymen. The Minister of Labour saidthat this distinction would be embarrassing : it would be preferable that the Trades Union representative on both Committees shouldbe a representative of the Trades Union Congress. The LordChancellor accepted this suggestion and undertook to consult withthe Minister of Labour regarding the selection, for both Committees,of a representative of the Trades Lnion Congress,The Cabinet-(1) Approved, subject to the points noted in paragraphs (a)and (b) above, the Final Report of the Ministerial Com-mittee on the Reform of Legal Procedure.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor to arrange for the appointmentof Comnrittees to enquire into the present practice and procedure of the Supreme Court and the County Court,respectively, on the basis suggested in that Report.M  .. ,. .     3-   The Minister of Civil AviaHon informed the Cabinet that bill proposed that a new Clause should be added to the Air Naviga-tion Bill in order to protect him and airline operators againstactions for nuisance in respect of noise caused by aircraft on theground at airports. When the Crown Proceedings Bill became law,it would be possible to bring actions against the Crown for nuisancecaused by&apos; a civil aircraft on the ground, and such actions might affect foreign operators using airports which he had designatedunder international agreements. He had hoped that the necessaryprotection might have been given in the Crown Proceedings Bill,but, after discussion with the Lord Chancellor, he had agreed thatit would be preferable to deal with the matter in the Air Navigationtfill. The proposed new Clause would enable Orders in Councilto be made regulating the conditions under which noise and vibra-tion might be caused by aircraft at airports and providing that no action for nuisance should lie so long as the provisions of the Order
EleoreicityBill.compensation of LocalAuthorities.(previous reference:b.M.(47)26thonclusions,Minute 5.)4. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the memoranda by the Minister of Fuel and Power (CP. (47) 73) and the Ministerof Transport (CP. (47) 76) on the proposal that provision shouldbe made in the Electricity Bill for additional compensation inrespect of the acquisition of municipal electricity undertakings.The Prime Minister said that at his meeting with the Associa-tion of Municipal Corporations on 7th March he had formed theimpression that, though the Association did not press the point very strongly, they felt that they had a good case for some additional compensastion in respect of severance.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that some of the Govern-ment supporters with whom he had discussed the matter had putforward claims for compensation in respect of the loss of the benefitof income tax set-off. In his opinion, however, provided that theamount of the additional compensation was reasonable, there wouldbe no objection to its being given in respect of severance only. Hehad considered an alternative method of distribution based on thecapital expenditure of individual undertakings, but had come tothe conclusion that this would give a less equitable result than themethod proposed in CP. (47)- 73. On the other hand, the Ministerof Transport might conceivably find that capital expenditure would form a more suitable basis for the distribution of any additional compensastion given to local authorities whose transport under-takings were acquired under the Transport Bill.The Minister of Transport said that, though it would not be easy to devise a corresponding scheme for the Transport Bill,particularly since the transfer of municipal undertakings wouldtake place under schemes made at various dates in the future, hisdifficulties would be mitigated if the additional compensationgranted under the Electricity Bill were expressly related toseverance. He would do his best to work out a scheme of additional compensastion under the Transport Bill which would be consistent with what was proposed for electricity.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was satisfied thatthe logical course was to relate the additional compensation toseverance, and he hoped that any suggestion that such compensa-tion should be given in respect of the loss of income tax set-offwould be resisted. It would no doubt be necessary to provide for compensation in respect of severance when the gas undertakings oflocal authorities were nationalised.were duly complied with. The Clause would cover only civil air-craft, since the position of military aircraft was safeguarded inthe Crown Proceedings Bill.The Lord Chancellor said that the new Clause would be criti-cised on the ground that it made no provision for ascertaining theviews of the local residents before an Order in Council was made.He agreed, however, that the right course was to resist any proposalfor local enquiries into objections to such Orders.In further discussion it was agreed that, if the point were pressed, Orders under the new Clause might be made subject tonegative resolution.The Cabinet Approved the ornnosa! to add a new Clause to the air navigation Bill protecting the Minister of Civil aviation and airline operators against actions for nuisance inrespect of noise caused by aircraft on the ground atairports.
Coa*&quot; 5.   The Cabinet discussed the line to be taken by Government(Previous spokesmen on two aspects of the coal situation which had been reference: raised in the House of Commons Debate on the Economic Situation.C.M.(47)23rd Some further statement would have to be made on behalf of conclusions, the Government about the introduction of the five-day week in the minute 4.) coalmining industry. Opposition speakers would probably pressFive-day the Government to state whether, in their view, the target whichWeek. : they had set for coal production in 1947 could be achieved if thefive-day week were introduced. This depended on the nature of theconditions accepted by the men in return for the five-day week, andthe extent to which those conditions were observed in practice.The Minister of Fuel and Power informed the Cabinet of the stage reached in the current negotiations between the National Coal Boardand the National Union of Mineworkers about these conditions and suggested that, as those discussions were still proceeding, it wouldbe inexpedient to offer any estimate of the effect on output of intro-ducing the five-day week.After further discussion, the Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Labour to deal with this point,when speaking in the Debate later that day, by statingthat the Government had indicated in 1946 that theywould raise no objection in principle to the introduction jof the five-day week, subject to the negotiation of satis-1factory conditions for its operation; that the Governmenthad not modified its attitude, though they attached greatimportance to the principle, stated in the economic survey for 1947 (Cmd. 7046), that, in present circum-stances the nation could not afford shorter hours of workunless these could be shown to increase output per man-year; and that the conditions to be attached to tineintroduction of the five-day week were now underdiscussion between the National Coal Board and theNational Union of Mineworkers and had not yet been finally determined.Imports. The Cabinet then discussed the suggestion, made in the Debate,that coal should be imported from abroad for the purpose of aug-menting stocks for the coming winter.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the United states had an export surplus of coal, and ships in which it could be broughtto this country. As much as 200,000 tons a month might perhaps be obtained from this source. It was also possible that coal mightbe obtainable from South Africa. The disadvantages of importingcoal must, however, be considered. Thus, there might be difficultyin securing the agreement of the European Coal Organisation, andThe Cabinet-(1) Agreed that a global sum of  5 millions should be allocated to local authorities whose electricity undertakings wereacquired under the Electricity Bill, as compensation forthe reduction of the field over which overhead expensescould be spread by reason of the severance of theelectricity undertaking from the remainder of the localauthority organisation, and agreed that this sum shouldbe distributed among local authorities according to the units of electricity sold by each undertaking in 1946.(2) Took note that the Minister&quot; of Transport would work out a corresponding scheme for the grant of additional *compensation in respect of local authority transport undertakings acquired under the powers conferred bythe Transport Bill.
the cost in terms of hard currencies would be considerable. TheChancellor of the Exchequer said that dollar expenditure on coal would have to be offset by reductions in other parts of the import programme.The Cabinet-(2) Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power to submit to the fuel Committee a memorandum summarising the argu-ments for and against a policy of importing foreigncoal for stock building.(3) Agreed that the Minister of Defence, when speaking in the debate later that day, should indicate, in terms to beagreed in consultation with the Minister of Fuel and power, that the Government were considering thepossibility of importing foreign coal.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,11th March, 1947.
