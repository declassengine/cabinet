4 r*idUse of Liberty-Ships forImportProgramme.(previous reference:CM. (47)33rdConclusions,Minute 3.)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (CP. (47) 113) covering areport by an inter-departmental Committee on the safeguards tobe proposed by His Majesty&apos;s Government in supporting the sugges-tion that American Liberty ships should be used for the import of essential supplies into the Combined Zones of Germany.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that he hoped the Cabinet would not insist that these ships should be manned by non-German crews, as this would be regarded in the UnitedStates as an attempt to protect our own commercial interests andmight well make it harder to obtain the necessary approval from congress. He also doubted the wisdom of stipulating, as suggestedin paragraph 12 of the report, that there should be no question ofGerrnany&apos;s continuing the charters or acquiring the ships after a balance of payments had been achieved in the Combined Zones,particularly as this point was already safeguarded under existingquadripartite decisions.The Civil Lord of the Admiralty said that the Admiralty stillconsidered that the ships should be manned by non-German crews.They also suggested that, if this plan were brought into operation,it should be subject to review in a year&apos;s time.The Minister of Tram-sport said that, even if German crews hadto be employed on these ships, the officers at least should not beGermans.In further discussion there was general agreement with theview that the prospective saving of dollar expenditure and the other advantages of the scheme far outweighed the remote risk that itmight facilitate the re-establishment of a German mercantilemarine; and that, in supporting the scheme, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should not insist on conditions which might lead to its beingrejected by Congress.The Cabinet-Agreed that in supporting the proposal for the use of american Liberty ships for the import of essential suppliesinto the Combined Zones of Germany His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should propose the safeguards recommended in paragraphs 5-11 of the report annexed to CP. (47) 113.International 2.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secre-Meteorologioal  tary of State for Air (CP. (47) 81) proposing that the ForeignOrganisation.    Secretary should  discuss with his United  States and  Sovietcolleagues in Moscow the question of securing more effective inter-national co-operation in applied meteorology.The Cabinet were informed that the Soviet Government were likely to favour the development of a more effective internationalmeteorological organisation; and that the Foreign Secretary wouldprobably welcome the opportunity of raising this question with themand with the United States representatives in Moscow.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of State to inform the Foreign Secre-tary that, if a suitable opportunity occurred while hewas in Moscow, he had the authority of the Cabinet to try to enlist the interest of his United States and Sovietcolleagues in the question of securing more effectiveinternational co-operation in applied meteorology, on thegeneral lines proposed in paragraph 12 of CP. (47) 81.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Air to arrange for detailed proposals for strengthening the internationalmeteorological organisation to be submitted for con-sideration in the first instance by the Steering Committeeon International Organisations.[33486-2]

(46) 71stConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofState (CP. (47) 114) covering Reports prepared by an official working party on (i) the efficiency of the Secretariats of the united nations and the Specialised Agencies; (ii) the co-ordination of thework of International Organisations; and (iii) the location of Inter-governmental Organisations. The Cabinet also had before them amemorandum by the Minister of Labour (CP. (47) 120) commenting on these Reports.The Cabinet first discussed the Report on the secretarialarrangements, which had been prepared in pursuance of theOclUllieL S QeuisiujJ. ui  i lii i\uvoluuoi, io^cu.The main recommendation in this Report was that theSecretary-General of the United Nations should have the assistanceof an efficient Deputy, who would have special responsibility forall questions of administration and could take the place of theSecretary-General when the latter was away. The Minister ofLabour, in his memorandum, had suggested that it might be easier to secure the concurrence of the Soviet Government in a proposal toappoint two Deputies, one concerned with political and securityquestions and the other with economic and social questions andwith administration. The Minister of State said that he would much prefer to rest our case on the need for a single Deputyresponsible for administration; and the Minister of Labour saidthat he did not wish to press -the alternative suggestion put forward in his memorandum.The Cabinet-(1) Endorsed the conclusions set out in paragraph 7 of theReport A. annexed to CP. (47) 114; and invited theMinister of State to explore, on the basis contemplated in paragraph 7 (xiv) of that Report, the possibility of strengthening the Secretariats of the United nations and the Specialised Agencies - by the means suggestedin the Report.The Cabinet next considered the Report, submitted inpursuance of the Cabinefs decision of 22nd July, 1946, on meansof co-ordinating the work of the various International Organisa-tions.The following points were made in discussion : (a) In paragraph 6 (v) of the Report it was recommended that,in order to avoid duplication of work, the United Nations andthe Specialised Agencies should as far as possible absorb regionalor local agencies dealing with the same subjects.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that this recommended-mendation should not be regarded as applying to regional bodieslike the Caribbean Commission which were formed to promotecollaboration between Colonial Powers and between the peoples of dependent territories in the economic and social field.(b) In paragraph 6 (vi) of the Report it was recommended that,with a view to preventing the dissipation of international effort,the United Nations and the Specialised Agencies should be invitedto observe the following order of priority for international work first, action required to safe^xxbrd world security: second, action required to secure economic rehabilitation; and, only after these,other desirable projects for which time could be found.In discussion it was suggested that the future of international collaboration might well be prejudiced if undue prominence weregiven to the international discussion of political and securityproblems, on which agreement was most difficult to reach. Success-ful international co-operation on technical questions might pavethe way for easier international working on political issues.It was also pointed out that the phase of &apos;&apos; economic rehabilitation-:-,\-,r-. &quot;  -.-.TXX  a-r11--    -J  &apos;v.----11---i&quot;  -1*---U K,-. loir!  rafhpr OilLIOII YY*i&amp;   Cutting,   O-iiU.

In any directive issued to Depart-ments on this subject the phrase &quot; economic co-operation&quot; shouldbe substituted for &apos;&apos; economic rehabilitation.&quot;
of liltgoveriOrganisations.(previous reference:CM. (46) 95thConclusions,Minute 2.)The Cabinets conclusion was that it would! be inexpedient to seek to lay down any precise order of priorities; but delegatesspeaking on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government should take theline that the United Nations and the Specialised Agencies should for the time being give first and equal priority to matters affectingworld security and international economic co-operation.The Cabinet-(2) Approved, subject to the points noted in paragraphs (a)and (b) above, the recommendations made in the Report C&apos; (47) 114 for co-ordinating the work of,       war!        r* &quot;OInternational Organisations.disperse 1Aeded to discuss the Report on the loca-tion of Intergovernmental Organisations.The Minister of State said that, since this matter had beenconsidered by the Cabinet on 7th November, 1946, the question ofthe permanent headquarters of the United Nations had been deter-mined by the acceptance of the Manhattan site in New York.Decisions must shortly be reached about the siting of the permanentheadquarters of the World Health Organisation^ the international trade Organisation and the Food and Agriculture Organisation;and the Cabinet might wish, in the light of the changed situation,to review the question generally. In his opinion, there were strong arguments against dispersal and the practical alternatives wereconcentration in Geneva or concentration in New York. The former,though preferable to complete dispersal, might result in the transfer to Geneva of the Economic and Social Council; and such a separa-tion of the political from the economic and social functions of theUnited Nations would be most unfortunate. Concentration in new york would ensure the most effective co-operation and co-co-ordination between the United Nations and the Specialised Agencies; and theadditional cost, which would not in any event be substantially greater than that of concentration in Geneva, would be offset by increased efficiency and administrative savings. Dispersal, or evenconcentration at Geneva, would greatly increase the difficulties ofco-ordination and consultation between the Specialised Agencies andthe headquarters of the United Nations.The Secretary of State for Air supported the view that thesal of the Specialised Agencies would involve wastefuluupxiuation of administrative machinery and would render co-operation and consultation with the United Nations and the otherAgencies both difficult and expensive. Experience suggested thatan isolated Agency could secure little publicity for its activities and that it would be more susceptible to outside pressure than ifit formed part of a powerful concentration of international bodies.The following were the main points made in discussion : (a) Members of the Executive of the Food and agriculture organisation were strongly opposed to the establishment of theOrganisation&apos;s headquarters in New York. They were particularly anxious about the activities of American &quot; pressure groups &quot; andthe high costs in the United States. The problems of food produc-tion were of special interest to European countries, and there weresrood arguments for locating the headauarters of this organisation in a European capital.(b) The British Delegation to the Preparatory Commission ofthe International Trade Organisation had, in accordance with the cabinets decision of 7th November, 1946, advocated the establish-ment of the headquarters of the Organisation outside the UnitedStates. The United States Government had themselves desired thatthe Preparatory Commission should meet in Geneva because of the increasing influence of &quot;pressure groups&quot; in the United States.(c) The Cabinet were reminded of the circumstances in Whichit had been decided to establish the headquarters of the ProvisionalInternational Civil Aviation Organisation in Montreal. There hadbeen general agreement in favour of Montreal, and it would be most unfortunate if any attempt were made now to reverse thatdecision. Transfer to New York would expose the Organisation to heavy pressure from the American civil aviation interests.
id) The concentration of the Specialised Agencies at thepolitical headquarters of the United Nations might have the resultthat technical and specialised activities were unduly subordinate to political considerations, and technical appointments were madeon a political basis. This might deprive the Agencies of the servicesof the best-qualified technical men.(e) Every effort should be made to avoid the concentration of specialised Agencies in Geneva. It would be preferable that theyshould be established in one or other of the Western Europeancapitals; and some might well be established in London.The Cabinet-/g\ t^,oQ.ffl^rngri the conclusions reached at their meeting on 7th November, 1946, on the location of international organisations.(4) Agreed that the Provisional International Civil AviationOrganisation should continue to maintain its head-quarters in Montreal.(5) Agreed that the concentration of Specialised Agencies in geneva should be avoided and that an attempt shouldbe made to secure the establishment of the headquarters of at least one Agency in London.(6) Instructed the Steering Committee on international organisations to keep continuously in mind the needfor taking all possible steps to prevent overlapping inthe activities of the Specialised Agencies.U.N.B.S.C.O. 4.    rne Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the report  of       Minister of Education (OP. (47) 97) seeking authority for theFirst General   publication of a White Paper embodying the main resolutionsConference.     approved by the First General Conference of the United nations educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation.The Cabinet were reminded that it was the accepted practice to keep Parliament informed in this way of the proceedings atinternational conferences in which His Majesty&apos;s Government hadparticipated. On the other hand, the publication of a White paper on the lines proposed would draw attention to the extent to whichtJhis Organisation was in danger of trespassing on the field ofother international agencies, and was also likely to provoke ademand that the Government should find time for a debate on thissubject. The Prime Minister said that he would consult with theLord Privy Seal on the Parliamentary aspects of this question. Itmight suffice for the Minister of Education to make an oral reportin the forthcoming debate on his Vote: alternatively, if there wasto be a White Paper, this might be published in time for it to bediscussed in that debate.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Steering Committee on international organisations should consider means of preventing thework of U.N.E.S.C.O. from overlapping with that ofother international agencies; and invited the Ministerof Education, in the light of advice received from the steering Committee, to impress on the Director-Generalof the Organisation the importance of avoiding suchoverlapping.(2) Invited the Minister of Education to arrange for the steering Committee on International Organisations toexamine the draft of a White Paper reporting theproceedings at the First General Conference of u.N.E.S.C.O.(3) Authorised the Prime Minister to decide on their behalf,after consulting the Lord Privy Seal, whether and, if so, when such a White Paper should be presented toParliament.
NationalService Bill.(previous reference erence:CM, (47)20thConclusions,Minute 5.)U:1950 in such a way as to keepiiited Kingdom or in Germany and.5. The Minister of Defence said that in the further discussionof the National Service Bill the Government would be strongly pressed to reduce the period of whole-time service provided for in clause 1 (1) (a). At a meeting of the Defence Committee on theprevious day (D.O. (47) 10th Meeting, Minute 4) he had discussed with the Service Ministers and the Chiefs of Staff whether it wouldbe possible to reduce this period from 18 to 12 months without serious detriment to the Services. So far as concerned the royal navy, national service men with only 12 months&apos; training would form a less effective reserve, and the possibilities of using themto man ships in the Mediterranean during their period of whole-time service would also be reduced.  The Army was to be redeployedost of its strength in theprovided that it were notprecluded from using national service men overseas, a period of12 months&apos; whole-time service would be acceptable. In the RoyalAir Force, 12 months&apos; whole-time service would not enable adequatetraining to be given in most of the technical branches and wouldmake it difficult to man the auxiliary squadrons from the reserve.The Minister of Defence said that, after considering these points, he had reached the conclusion that the right course wouldbe to put down a Government amendment reducing the period of whole-time service from 18 to 12 months.In discussion the following points were made : (a) The Secretary of State for Air said that, from the pointof view of the Royal Air Force, it would be preferable to have a smaller number of men for 18 months&apos; whole-time service. would it not be possible to adopt a scheme by which a proportion of thoseliable were called up for this longer period, while the remainder were directed into under-manned industries&apos;?It was the view of the Cabinet that a scheme of this kind would not be practicable.(b) The Civil Lord of the A dmiralty said that a period of only12 months&apos; whole-time service would prevent the Navy from findingofficers from among the national service men.The Cabinet-Agreed that the National Service Bill should be amended so as to reduce from1 18 to 12 months the period of whole-time service, and authorised the Minister of Defence togive immediate notice of an amendment to this effect.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,3rd April, 1947.

C .x .GI have consulted the Cabinet Secretariat about yourMinute of the 9th April.     They confirm my own opinion that theCabinet were under no misapprehension about the fact that if, aswe can reasonably hope will not be the case, developments overseas,e.g. in Palestine and India, are unfavourable then the Army re-deployment plan? which makes it possible to accept a twelve monthsperiod of continuous National Service under the Bill, will have tobe reconsidered.I am giving instructions that this exchange of minutesis to be placed on record by the Secretariat with, the cabinet minutes to ?.-hich you refer.     This, together with your specificreservation in the Minutes of the previous day&apos;s Defence Committee,should ensure that the point is suitably recorded for reference should it unhappily be necessary to seek to revise the cabinets decision at a later date.(Intld)    A.V.A.11th April, 1947.
