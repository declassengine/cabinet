$ t 15foreign The Foreign Secretary recalled that on 10th January MarshalAffairs. Stalin had indicated to the Chief of the Imperial General StaffAnglo-Soviet that, in view of the establishment of the United Nations Organisa-Treaty. tion, the position of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty was not clear, andthat on 15th January Pravda had suggested that the foreign secretary in his broadcast of 22nd December had implied that theTreaty was regarded by His Majesty&apos;s Government as &quot; suspendedin the air.&quot; He had accordingly thought it right to send messages to Marshal Stalin pointing out that the attitude of His Majesty.&apos;sGovernment had not changed, that it had never occurred to themthat the Treaty could have been superseded or suspended, and thattney desired an extension oi tne Treaty, m ms reply to these qmessages Marshal Stalin had indicated that he was now satisfied that both Governments shared the same viewpoint with regard tothe Treaty, but had suggested that before the Treaty could beextended it would be necessary to change it by removing some ofthe reservations contained in it.The Foreign Secretary said that, in his view, the next step should be to make it clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government &quot;were willing to enter into negotiations for bringing the Treaty up to %date and to ask Marshal Stalin if he would be good enough to say what revisions of the Treaty he proposed. By this means it wouldbe possible to see what Marshal Stalin had in mind.

At that discussion Marshal Stalin had indicated that he was not opposed to an Anglo-American military alliance, provided that it was not directed against the Soviet Union.At the same time, he had referred to the possibility of an Anglo- fSoviet military alliance without, however, making it clear whetheror not he intended that this alliance should be directed solely tocontaining Germany.   The Foreign Secretary reminded the Cabinetthat he had already told the Council of Foreign Ministers that HisMajesty&apos;s  Government were willing to  support Mr.  Byrnes&apos;draft Four-Power Treaty for the disarmament and containing ofGermany, and pointed out that it was most important that any negotiations with the Soviet Government on the subject of a military alliance should not estrange the United States Government, since we should be placed in an impossible position if the United StatesGovernment withdrew from Europe and left the task of containingGermany to ourselves and the Soviet and French Governments. Itwas, moreover, of the utmost importance that the Four powers should pursue a common policy towards Germany, who still con-stituted the biggest menace to peace in Europe.   The conclusionwhich he had reached was that for the present we ought to avoidtaking up the question of an Anglo-Soviet military alliance, thoughit was, of course, possible that Marshal Stalin would raise it inconnexion with the revision of the Treaty.The Foreign Secretary said that he had sent a message toGeneral Marshall indicating the line that he proposed to take in replying to Marshal Stalin, but that, so far, he had had no reply jto this message.  He could not delay a reply to Marshal Stalin any!longer and, subject to the&apos;Cabinet&apos;s views, proposed to despatchhis reply later in the day.Discussion turned mainly on the implications of the sugges-tion that His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Soviet Governmentshould conclude a military alliance.  The main points made were : (a) It was impossible to be sure what attitude the United StatesGovernment would adopt towards an Anglo-Soviet military alliance,but the Chiefs of Staff were convinced that the conclusion of suchan alliance would seriously prejudice the arrangements for theexchange of military information between ourselves and the UnitedStates.(5) The Foreign Secretary had made it clear both to the UnitedStates Government and to the&apos; Soviet Government that we could not
99CM. 15 (17)in any future war play the role of an outpost to engage the eneinyuntil the United States or the Soviet Union were ready to join in;and, if we wished to be sure of having the United States with us from the beginning in any future conflict, it was important to main-tain close collaboration with them on matters of common militaryinterest. ,(c) The question was raised whether the Soviet orovernment desire for a military alliance was not primarily due to their fearof a conflict with .the United States in the Far East and theiranxiety to avoid a simultaneous attack on their western front.As against this it was pointed cut that there was in russia long-standing fear of German aggression and that it was stilla main preoccupation of the Soviet Government to secure theirwestern frontier.(d) The suggestion was made that it might be preferable to seek an improvement in relations with the Soviet Government inthe economic sphere, e.g., by proposing co-operation in the develop-ment of Middle East oil resources.On the other hand, it was urged that it was idle to expect thata new approach in the economic field would in itself lead to animprovement in Anglo-Soviet relations unless there could be a simultaneous advance in the political sphere.(e) The Soviet Government were no doubt apprehensive ofUnited States economic penetration into Europe and from the atti-tude of the United States Government in the discussions on thePeace Treaties with the ex-enemy satellite States it was clear thatthey were concerned to maintain and extend their commercial interests in Europe and the Middle East. It would help to allaySoviet suspicions if the Soviet Government could be given a loan for reconstruction purposes by the International Bank for Recon-struction and Development. So far, however, the Soviet Governmenthad not agreed to become a member of the Bank.(/) Any military alliance with the Soviet Government would presumably have to be so framed as to come within the definition of a regional arrangement under Article 52 of the United nations charter. In approaching the Soviet Government it would be important not to^suggest that we regarded the existence of theUnited Nations Organisation as a possible bar to the proposedalliance, but to take the line that the alliance would naturally fall within the United Nations framework.(g) The suggestion was made that when the time came to pursue the suggestion of a military alliance, the Foreign Secretary should try to broaden it into a pact in which the United States and Franceand also the smaller European nations should be invited toparticipate.The Foreign Secretary said that he would aim at securing a four-Power Pact, but that he would be opposed to bringing in thesmaller European nations.(h) Attention was drawn to the importance of full consulta-.tion with the Dominion Governments on any proposal for a military alliance.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Foreign Secretary should send a telegram to Marshal Stalin making it clear that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were willing to enter into negotiations for bringing the Anglo-Soviet Treaty up to date and asking him what revisions of the Treatv he Wished to propose.(2) Agreed that at the present stage nothing should be&quot; said to marshal Stalin about the possibility of an Anglo-soviet military alliance.(3) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would bring thematter before the Cabinet again when Marshal stalin had indicated what revision of the Anglo-Soviet Treatvhe had in mind.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,3rd February, 1947.
