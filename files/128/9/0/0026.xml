2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken ini     the House of Commons in the following week,of On 10th, 11th and 12th March there would be a debate on theEconomic Situation, on a Government Motion. The terms of the motion were approved, after amendment, by the Cabinet. the motion would be moved by the President of the Board of Trade,and the Prime Minister would reply to the debate on the third day. Other Government spokesmen would be the Minister ofDefence, the Minister of Labour and, if an Opposition Amendmentwere moved, the Lord Privy Seal. The Chancellor of the exchequer would be prepared to make a brief statement if financial issues were raised. The order of speaking would be determined by thePrime Minister in the light of any Amendment tabled by theOpposition.On 13th March the House would discuss the Army estimates in Committee of Supply.On 14th March the Committee and remaining Stages of theAir Navigation Bill would be taken, and further consideration would be given to Supplementary Estimates.i The Cabinet were informed that, when the Civic Restaurantsof Bill was considered in the House of Lords, there would be strong pressure for the withdrawal of the provision empowering localauthorities to apply for licences to serve intoxicating liquor in civicrestaurants operated by them. The Cabinet agreed that this pro-vision should be retained in the Bill.Two subsidiary points would also be made, namely, that a localauthority should not be entitled to apply for a licence where a civic14th restaurant was being operated in premises belonging to a churchand that any licence granted should be restricted to the service ofdrink with meals. It was the view of the Cabinet that the questionwhether a licence should be granted in respect of religious premisescould properly be left to the local authority and the local licensingjustices, and that it had not been intended that liquor should be served in civic restaurants except with meals.33350-6]1. The Cabinet discussed two points which were likely to beraised in the House of Commons that day on the resumption of the debate on India.(a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was possiblethat Mr. Churchill might refer to the question of India&apos;s sterling).. balances. If so, he would argue that a substantial part of thisdebt should be wiped out in consideration of our defence of india during the war. Though Mr. Churchill might put this claim in an extreme form, it was important that nothing should be said bythe Government spokesmen which would prevent the government from using this argument in the forthcoming negotiations with indian Ministers about these sterling balances.(b) Government spokesmen were likely to be pressed to make some statement about the future of European members of theSecretary of State Services and the Indian Armed Forces. Whileit was important that nothing should be said to prejudge thequestion whether compensation should be paid to those who were willing to continue serving in India, an unequivocal assuranceshould be given that the Government would ensure that no injusticewas done to its servants in India. It should be said that the Govern-ment fully accepted their obligations in this matter, but Govern-ment spokesmen should decline to be drawn into making a more detailed statement, on the ground that the details were now under,discussion.
Man-power .Civil ServiceStaffs.(previous reference:C.M.(47)9thConclusions,Minute 2.)3.   The Prime Minister drew attention to an instruction!(T.C. No. 7/47), issued to all Government Departments by the!Treasury on 3rd March, that their total staffs on 1st January, 1947,1should not be increased without specific permission from the gMinisterial Committee on Civil Service Man-Power.    He had authorised the issue of this instruction, without prior reference tothe Cabinet, in order that Departments whose staffs had increased since that date might be able to effect reductions before the nextquarterly staff return on 1st April.The Home Secretary said that this was a preliminary instruc-tion designed to prevent further increases of staff. When the Com-mittee on Civil Service Man-Power had completed their review ofthe position, more drastic measures might have to be recommended,in order to secure staff reductions. He asked that all Ministers in!charge of Departments should make a special point of supporting the efforts which his Committee were making to reduce the numbers employed in the Civil Service.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of treasury Circular No. 7/47.the instructions givenGermany.socialisation of basic industries.(previous reference:CM. (47) 16thConclusions,Minute 8.)4.   The Prime Minister recalled that at their meetingAi-V.  T?nU.....TL11 LitAonary the Cabinet had agreed upon action in furtherance ofthe Government&apos;s policy for socialising the basic industries in theBritish Zone of Germany, including the appointment of Germancustodians for the coal industry and the iron and steel industry.Since that meeting strong representations had been made by theGovernments of France, Holland and Luxembourg on behalf ofnationals of theirs who owned substantial interests in particularfirms in those industries. The Foreign Secretary had, therefore,suggested that the appointment of custodians should be deferred until he had been able to consider means of allaying the apprehen-1sions expressed by these Governments. The Prime Minister said jthat there was no intention of departing from the Governments &apos;settled policy for socialising these industries; but he had thoughtit expedient in all the circumstances to advise the Foreign secretary and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to defer for the timebeing giving effect to the decisions reached by the Cabinet on/l ^-T-i     T^aimiii r% TiirThe Cabinet-Took note that action to give effect to their conclusions on 4th February regarding the socialisation of the basic industries in the British Zone of Germany would be deferred pending consideration of the representations made jby the Governments of France, Holland and Luxembourg 1on behalf of nationals of theirs owning substantial interestsin particular firms in those industries.Bectnoity 5    The Cabinet considered memoranda bv the Minister of fuel and Power (CP. (47) 73) and the Minister of TransportCompensation (CP. (47) 76) on a proposal that provision should be made in theto Local Electricity Bill for additional compensation in respect of theAuthorities.     acquisition of municipal electricity undertakings.(Previous The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the existing pro-pmma^v      visions of the Bill for compensation to local authorities had give no.m. (46) 107th rise to strong criticism, and unless some concession was made theconclusions,     Government were likely to be defeated on this issue in StandingMmute 5.)      Committee.  He proposed to adhere to the principle that in generalthe amount of compensation should be based on the net outstanding ]debt of each undertaking, but he felt that local authorities should Ireceive in addition some payment in respect of the loss of contri-butions to their general rate funds, the loss of the income tax set-off,
the reduction of the field over which overhead expenses could bespread owing to the severance of the undertaking from theremainder of their organisation, and the disturbance of the balanceof their superannuation funds. To compensate for these losses he proposed that he should make provision for a global sum of about 5 million by way of additional compensation, which would be divided among local authorities according to the size of theirelectricity undertakings.The Minister of Transport said that hitherto he had success-fully resisted pressure to provide in the Transport Bill for additional compensation to local authorities whose transport under-takings were to be taken over. If, however, the present proposalsof the Minister of Fuel and Fower were accepted, he would be unableto refuse a corresponding concession. This point would arise inStanding Committee on the Transport Bill in the following week,and he should know before then whether the concession proposedby the Minister of Fuel and Power was to be made.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while he agreedthat a sum of the order of  5 million might be provided by way ofadditional compensation under the Electricity Bill, he would prefer to relate the concession entirely to the fact that the severance ofthe undertakings from the remainder of the local authorities&apos;organisations would reduce the field over which overhead expensescould be spread. This would enable the Minister of Transport to resist any claim for additional compensation from railway and canalstockholders.In further discussion the following points were made : (a) Would the grant of additional compensation in respect ofseverance not constitute a precedent? No such compensation hadbeen paid in respect of the transfer of education or health functions.As against this, it was urged that a distinction could be drawn between the transfer of ordinary local government functions, suchas education, and the transfer of trading undertakings.(b) Was it defensible to distribute any such additional com-pensation by reference to the size of the electricity undertaking?Would it not be better to try to devise a formula which would goat least some way towards meeting the claims of those localauthorities who would receive less than their due under the appli-cation of the principle of compensation by reference to netoutstanding debt ?The Prime Minister said that he had undertaken to receive adeputation from the Association of Municipal Corporations on thefollowing day to hear their representations on the compensation tobe paid to local authorities in respect of the transfer of tradingundertakings; and it would be preferable to defer a final decisionon the method of allocating additional compensation until theirviews had been put before him. Meanwhile the Minister of fuel and Power might, if necessary, inform those Government sup-porters who were pressing for a decision on this point that, whilethe Government must adhere to the principle that compensation to local authorities must be based on net outstanding debt, theywould be prepared to make some concession by way of a limited sumof additional compensation and were considering how this additional compensation might best be distributed.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed to resume discussion of CP. (47) 73 and CP. (47) 76at their meeting on 11th March, in the light of the repre-sentations made to the Prime Minister by the deputationwhich he had agreed to receive from the Association of municipal Corporations.(2) Agreed that, if before 11th March the Minister of Fuel and power found it necessary to give Government supportersan indication of the Government&apos;s intentions, he shouldmake a statement on the lines proposed by the PrimeMinister.
Migration.Shipping forMigrants toAustralia.(previous reference:C.M.(46)2ndConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs and the Minister of Labour (C P(47) 67) and by the Minister of Transport (CP. (47) 70) about theprovision of shipping for emigrants to Australia.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs recalled that twoagreements between the United Kingdom and the commonwealth governments covering schemes for free and assisted passages hadbeen signed on 5th March, 1946. These schemes had not beenbrought into force in 1946 and it had been estimated that, unlessspecial steps were taken to provide additional shipping, themaximum number of passages available for emigrants in 1947 wouldbe about 3,500. This was far short of the original figure contem-plated, and in December last the Prime Minister of Australia hadappealed to the Prime Minister to ensure that shipping was madeavailable to lift a minimum of 25,000 emigrants during 1947. Hehad discussed the question of providing additional shipping withthe Minister of Transport and they were agreed that three ships at present employed as troop-ships should be released during theyear so as to raise the total number of passages available foremigrants in 1947 from 3,500 to 6,900. This figure includeddependents and the Minister of Labour was satisfied that the lossof man-power involved was not significant.The Minister of Transport said that the passenger shipping atthe disposal of the Government was inadequate to meet all thedemands which were being made on it; but ire had no objection tothe proposal that the three troopships mentioned in paragraph 5of CP. (47) 67 should be used for the transport of emigrants toAustralia, so long as it was understood that the amount of shipping available for other purposes would be to that extent reduced. he hoped that we should make it clear to the Commonwealth Govern-ment that the Aquitania could not be used for the transport of emigrants for the time being. In planning the use of additionalshipping for the transport of emigrants to Australia account wasbeing taken of the possible need for shipping to bring Britishresidents back from India to the United Kingdom.In discussion there was general agreement that, while it wouldbe inexpedient to give much encouragement to emigration in thepresent conditions of man-power shortage in the United Kingdom,it would be difficult to decline to afford any additional facilitiesfor emigration to Australia in 1947.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the number of passages to be made availablefor emigrants to Australia in 1947 should be increasedto about 6,900, and that for this purpose the three troop-ships mentioned in paragraph 5 of CP. (47) 67 shouldbe used for the carriage of emigrants on the terms setout in paragraph 6 of CP. (47) 67.(2) Agreed that the Commonwealth Government should beinformed that it was not possible to release the A quitania,for the Australian traffic at the present time.Parliament.ElectoralLegislation.(previous reference:C.M.(45)29thConclusions,Minute 5.)7. The Cabinet had. before them a memorandum bv the HomeSecretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. (47) 74)proposing that a Ministerial Committee should be appointed toconsider the form and scope of prospective electoral legislation.The Home Secretary said that it would be necessary to introducean Electoral Reform Bill in the 1947-48 Session in order to dealwith the recommendations of the Committee on Electoral Registra-tion, and it was desirable that the same Bill should cover a numberof other matters relating to electoral reform arising from the reportsof the Speaker&apos;s Conference and of the Committee on electoral law Reform. The question of discontinuing the university and business premises franchises should also be considered; and, if therecommendation for spring and autumn registers were accepted, thequestion of altering the date of English borough council elections and local elections in Scotland would arise.
The Cabinet (1) Approved the appointment of a Committee to consider,in the light of the reports of the Committee on electoral registration, the Speaker&apos;s Conference and the Com-mittee on Electoral Law Reform, what should be thescope and form of any legislation on electoral reform tobe introduced in the 1947-48 Session.(2) Agreed that the membership of the Committee should be : I-Iorae Secretary (mSecretary of State for Scotland.Minister of Labour.Minister of Health.Secretary of State for Air.Attorney-General.Lord Advocate.Chief Whip.Financial Secretary to the Treasury.Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for theHome Department.international organisation.Constitution.8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Labour (CP. (47) 72) recommending that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should ratify the Constitution of the International)-nn-n vn n o 4-1 s\-r\      T-*-* cj f vm -rvi f*V 4&quot; A m qti     m an f       &quot;I Q/Tfi/JlgCllllOaUlUU      J-XiOUJL IxlliUl-L L*     WA      XJL-ALH-vi-H^AX-H^AAUj      JLVTUFinal Articles Revision Convention, 1946, which were adopted atthe Interntaional Labour Conference held in Montreal in the autumn of 1946.In discussion it was pointed out that, under the Preamble ofthe amended Constitution, one of the objects of the InternationalLabour Organisation was to secure &apos;&apos; recognition of the principle of equal remuneration for work of equal value.&quot; Was it expedient that, by ratifying this new Constitution, the Government shouldcommit themselves to supporting the principle of equal pay % would this embarrass them in dealing with the recent report of the RoyalCommission on Equal Pay ?mittee which had been considering the Royal Commission^ report were inclined to the view that it would be possible for the Govern-ment to take the line that, while they accepted the principle of equal pay, current economic conditions made it impracticable forthem to give effect to that principle at the present time. If thereport of the Royal Commission were to be handled on those lines,the Government would not be embarrassed by having endorsed thedeclaration in favour of the principle of equal pay in the preamble to the new Constitution of the International Labour Organisation.The Cabinet -(1) Agreed that His Majesty&apos;s Government should ratify theConstitution of the International Labour OrganisationInstrument of Amendment, 1946, and the Final ArticlesRevision Convention, 1946.(2) Authorised the Minister of Labour to present to parliamentary White Paper in the terms of the draft annexed to cp. (47) 72.Cabinet Office, S.W. LQth March, 1947.
