The Minister of Labour might alsocirculate periodical reports on the extent of the unemploymentcaused by the fuel cuts. A small body of Ministers might meet at intervals to keep the position under review on the Cabinefs behalf.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power to arrange that,during the present emergency, daily reports on the fuelsituation should be circulated to all members of theCabinet; and invited the Minister of Labour to arrangefor periodical reports to be circulated on the employmentaspects of the situation.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would consider whatspecial procedure was required for keeping the situation under review and authorising on the Cabinefs behalfsuch action as was required to meet further developments.defence estimates.(PreviousT? i* -- - ^ ^ .CM. (47) 13thConclusions,Minute 1.)draft white Paper.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Defence (CP. (47) 52) covering the draft of a white paper embodying the annual Statement relating to Defence.The following were the main -ooints raised in discussion of this draft: (a) The draft made no reference to the role of the dominions in Commonwealth defence. The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs would prefer that this question should not be raised.Difficulties had already arisen with Dominion Govermhents as aresult of the criticisms expressed on this point in the debates on theWhite Paper on the Central Organisation for Defence (Cmd. 6923).The Chancellor of the Ecccheqtier said that he would have beenglad if some general reference could have been made to the discus-sions now proceeding with Dominion Governments on the possibilityof their taking some share of the burden of Commonwealth defence.[33260-6] b 2
The Cabinet agreed that the repercussions of any such state-ment would have to be carefully weighed; and The Minister ofDefence undertook to consider, in consultation with the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs, whether he could make some referenceto this when speaking in the House of Commons in the debate on theWhite Paper.(b) In paragraph 9 (iii) of the draft it was stated that british forces were being retained in India and Burma &quot; to assist in main-lubiivual security wnilstthe new Constitutions ot tnesecountries are being formulated.&quot;The Cabinet agreed that it would be preferable to state merelythat British Forces were being retained in India and Burma &quot; forthe present.&quot;(c) Paragraph 16 of the draft admitted that the demands ofthe Armed Forces would impose a heavy strain on the man-power resources of the country. The proposals in the draft were likely tobe criticised in Parliament on the ground that this strain was greater than we could bear. The Cabinet therefore agreed that thisparagraph of the draft should include some reference to the possi-bility that the strengths proposed might be reduced if during thecourse of the year there were changes in the international situationwhich had the effect of reducing our military commitments.in paragraphs 14 to 16 of the draft should take account of theOl V lliaUO OlliJJJ-Uy CU   kJJ    LiiO   KJV^i V XV.C.O.The Minister of Defence undertook to consider what adjust-ments could be made in the draft to cover this point.The Cabinet also approved certain other drafting amendments which were suggested in the discussion.The Minister of Defence said that he was planning to presentthe White Paper on 14th February, with a view to a debate in theHouse of Commons on 24th February. It was hoped that the white paper on the Economic Situation would have been published before that debate took nlace.(1) Approved, subject to the amendments agreed upon in thediscussion and to such other minor or drafting amend-ments as the Minister of Defence might find it necessaryto make, the draft White Paper annexed to CP. (47) 52.(2) Authorised the Minister of Defence to arrange for theWhite Paper, as so amended, to be presented to Parlia-ment on 14th February.National5J_____s__v-. .11(previous reference:CM. (46)90thConclusions,Minute 4.) :5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofLabour (CP. (47) 47) covering notes on certain questions which had arisen in the preparation of the National Service Bill.In discussion the following points were made : (a) The Minister of Labour suggested that, in order to forestallan amendment by opponents of thejnal service proposals, theBill should be expressed as expiring on 1st January, 1954, unlessParliament otherwise determined.The Minister of Defence said that he and the Service ministers would prefer that the Bill should include no time limit. As a compromise, however, they suggested that the Bill might empower the Minister by order (i) to suspend the general call-up at any dateafter January 1954, and (ii) to reduce the period of training to something less than 18 months.
In further discussion it was suggested that the best coursewould be to include in the Bill a provision on the lines of Section 21of the Military Training Act, 1939, enabling the Acts to be con-tinued in force by Order in Council on an Address from both houses of Parliament.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Bill should provide that the NationalService Acts should continue in force until January1954, and that they might thereafter be continued inforce for a further &quot;period (not necessarily for one year at a time) by Order in Council made on an Addresspresented to His Majesty by each House of Parliament.(2) Agreed that the Bill should empower the Minister to make an order reducing the period of service to less thanAO   iJiuii vxxu .(b) The Cabinet were informed that the initial training andbasic flying training of men accepted for aircraft duties could becompleted in twelve months, and it would be uneconomic to attemptto give advanced flying training in the remainder of the eighteen months for which men would normally be called up. It had there-fore been proposed that air crew entrants should (with certain exceptions) be released after serving twelve months. They would,however, after their transfer to the Reserve be liable for the equivalent of 36 days&apos; training a year in each of the followingsix years, which would give a total of 216 days as compared withthe 242 days which would be served by the ordinary entrant v/hoserved for 18 months with the colours and for 60 days in the Reserve.The Cabinet-(3) Agreed that the Bill should confer a general power to trans-fer men to the Reserve before they had completed their full period of whole-time service.(c) The Education Act, 1944, and the Education (Scotland) Act,1945, required education authorities to provide for the further education of persons over compulsory school age. The EducationMinisters felt that on general grounds it was unreasonable thateducation authorities should have a statutory duty to provide further education for men who had been called up; and that, inparticular, it would be unfair to impose on an individual educationauthority the financial liability of contributing from the ratestowards the cost of providing further education for all the NationalService entrants who might be stationed in the authority&apos;s area.At the same time, they saw no objection to an arrangement by whichthe Services would employ education authorities as their agents for providing further education for men v/ho were called up.On the other hand, the Service Ministers, while willing to accepta general liability for the provision of facilities for such further education, felt that it should be realised that it would not be possibleto make such provision in all cases.The Minister of Defence said that the present inconsistenciesbetween the arrangements made for the provision of general educa-tion in the three Services should be removed.The Cabinet (4) Agreed that the Bill should impose a general duty on theService Ministers to make available facilities for thefurther education of men who were called up, the costbeing met out of Service Estimates; and that the services should, wherever possible, use local authorities as theiragents for this purpose.(5) Agreed in principle that the arrangements for the provisionof further education in each of the three Services shouldbe on the same lines.
(d) It was explained that under the existing law a man inholy orders or a regular minister of any religious denomination wasexempt from liability for call-up and that it^ was not proposed to alter the law in this respect. Theological students would be eligiblefor deferment to enable them to complete their training; but, if theywere treated like other students, their deferment would be endedbefore they reached the upper age-limit for call-up and they wouldthen have to do their period of national service. This was acceptable to the Church of England, but the Roman Catholic Church had represented that candidates for the priesthood who were finallyselected for ordination should not be liable to be called up. they realised that it would be impossible to exempt theological studentsas a class and their proposal was, in effect, that indefinite defermentwould be granted administratively to candidates for the roman catholic priesthood until ordination, when they would automaticallybecome exempt from call-up. The number affected was not likelyto be more than 200 a year.There was general agreement that it would be indefensible tomake such an exception in favour of candidates preparing for the roman Catholic priesthood.The Cabinet-(6) Agreed that, theological students should not be exempted1u l/ivmll    OVil  YlVl;.On the remaining points raised in the memorandum by theMinister of Labour, the Cabinet reached the following con-clusions : &apos; .(7) The Bill should give power to commute reserve trainingin whole or in part to evening and week-end trainingperiods.(8) The existing power to register conscientious objectorsunconditionally should be continued, and conditionallyregistered conscientious objectors should be registeredf or a period of twenty months.(9) The Minister of Labour and National Service should cir-culate a draft of the Bill to the Legislation committee as soon as possible; and the Bill should be published afterthe general debate on Defence, but before the debates onthe Service Estimates.Cyprus.(previous reference:CM. (46) 66thConclusions,Minute &apos;4.)6. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Secretaryof State for the Colonies (CP. (47) 55) and by the Foreign Secretary(CP. (47) 56) on the future of Cyprus.The Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the Cabinetthat the campaign for union of the Colony with Greece continuedunchecked, and a deputation which claimed to be widely repre-sentative was at the moment in this country urging the transferof sovereignty to Greece. This question aroused strong emotionsin Cyprus and, whilo things reiiiaineuJ as at present, tnere vVwSlittle hope of securing co-operation for our policy of constitutional reform and of economic and social development. The colonial secretary was advised that, if such co-operation was to be obtained,there should be a precise and definite announcement that the colonywas to remain under British sovereignty. He recognised thedifficulty of making such a statement at the present time, but he felt that the Cabinet should be aware of the situation.The Foreign Secretary said that such a declaration would notbe accepted as final and would bring the question to the forefrontof international discussion. After many months of negotiationin the Council of Foreign Ministers, the Soviet Government had accepted our proposal that the Dodecanese should be ceded to greece and demilitarised: if the question were raised, they were bound
to urge that the same course should be taken in respect of Cyprus.We should also find it embarrassing to defend such a declaration in view of the line which we had recently taken in regard to therelations between India and Burma and ourselves and in regardto relations between the Sudan and Egypt.The Foreign Secretary said that, until our future position inEgypt and Palestine was clearer, the wiser course would be todamp down discussion of Cyprus. The Greek Government were inno position to add to their responsibilities at the moment and were under great obligations to us. It should therefore be possible tocome to an arrangement with them by which neither Governmentwould raise the matter for some years to come and the GreekGovernment would do nothing meanwhile to encourage agitation in Cyprus. It might be agreed that after ten years the people of cyprus should be free to determine their own future.The Chief of the Air Staff said that, in view of the uncertainty of our position in Egypt and Palestine, the Chiefs of Staff wouldview with the gravest misgiving any proposal to surrender oursovereignty over Cyprus. If all our bases in the Mediterranean andthe Middle East were lost, the strategic foundations of our defenceof the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth would be undermined.The Minister of Defence hoped that a firm decision might betaken that British sovereignty over Cyprus should be maintained.Recent events had changed fundamentally our position in Asia andthe Middle East; for there was now no guarantee that India orBurma would remain within the Empire or that we should main-tain our foothold in Palestine or Egypt. It was now much moreimportant than it had been a few years ago that Cyprus should remain a secure base for our Forces^In support of this view other Ministers urged that, insteadof taking any action which would indicate a willingness to surrendersovereignty, we should press ahead with our plans for the economicand social development of the island.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would find difficulty in agreeing that we should incur any substantial expendi-ture for these purposes if it was likely that in a few years&apos; timeCyprus would cease to be a part of the Commonwealth. It shouldbe represented to Cypriot leaders that the amount of assistancethey would receive from the United Kingdom was bound to beaffected if agitation for the withdrawal of Cyprus from theCommonwealth continued.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that no public declaration should be made for thepresent about the future of Cyprus.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to explore the possibilityof reaching an understanding with the Greek Govern-ment by which neither they nor His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would raise the question of the status of Cyprusfor some years to come and the Greek Government would seek in the meantime to discourage agitation in Cyprus.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,11th February, 1947.
