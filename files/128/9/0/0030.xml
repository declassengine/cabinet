1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secre-tary of State for the Colonies (CP. (47) 05) on the state of public-order in Palestine.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that on 2nd Marchmartial law had been imposed in the Tel Aviv and Jerusalem areas.This had involved the withdrawal of all Government services fromthose areas; it had paralysed their economic life and caused large-scale unemployment; and no Government revenue had been collected.The police and military had been enabled to conduct a thoroughsearch for known terrorists; and 60 arrests had been made. Therehad been an encouraging degree of co-operation from the jewish community, though not from the Jewish representative bodies.After two weeks, the High Commissioner and the local militaryauthorities had decided that martial law had.reached the limit ofits usefulness and it was withdrawn on 17th March.  Some relaxation-u * 0&quot; a   &apos;&quot;-&quot;Tr^-   ^ ^   -71    &quot;^*&apos;^f   ^y^]] f,   ?&quot;*f*VPL  jjQQjj   71AQPr3g^ V\T   171   fyVf^QT&apos; 771S!.? T&quot;*       ! &apos;*1the life of the country; but the Jewish community had been madeto realise the consequences of their continued passive attitudetowards terrorism. It had not been supposed that the impositionof martial law would in itself bring terrorism to an end, and someoutrages, involving loss of life, had since occurred.The Secretary of State for War said that the imposition of martial law had given the Army valuable freedom of action intheir search for terrorists; 24 suspected terrorists had been arrested and the Jewish community had been shocked into giving some co-operation to the authorities.The Y ice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff added thatmartial law had enabled the Army to proceed with greater speedin the search for terrorists and to act on suspicion. The areas fromwhich the terrorists operated were limited and could be cordonedoff by a restricted application of martial law. The success of theaction taken was indicated by the fact that a greater number ofknown terrorists had been arrested than ever before. But the intensive application of these measures involved the deployment oflarge numbers of troops and imposed a strain on local military resources which - could riot be maintained indefinitely. ,-::Points made in discussion were:- .(a) It was the general view of the Cabinet that the results achieved by this imposition of martial law were disappointing:Some arrests had been made, but terrorism had not been broughtto an end. Serious outrages had continued, both during the periodof martial law and afterwards.(b) The withdrawal of martial law after so short a period had given an impression of weakness and must have encouraged theJewish community and the terrorists to think that they had success^fully resisted it.(c) The system of martial law which had been imposed seemedneedlessly drastic; its effect had been as damaging to the Adminis-tration as to the Jewish community. But the remedy for this wasnor, necessarily&quot; to wluluravv iilarciai raw entirely; uue uimCUiuiesmight have been met by maintaining martial law but relaxing therestrictions imposed under it. Martial law could be the most flexiblesystem of government.The Cabinet next considered the policy to be pursued duringthe intervening period before the future of Palestine could beconsidered by the United Nations. Reference was made to thestatement in CP. (47) 95 that warning had been given to theJewish community that the Government would not- hesitate, ifnecessary, to reimpose martial law. Did this mean that it mightbe imposed on specified areas for a similarly limited period orapplied in somewhat different form to the whole of Palestine ?The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that the objectionsto imposing martial law over the whole country arose partly fromthe heavy strain which this had been expected to impose on the97-4] b 2

(47) 95 that for the should be no increase in the Jewishquota, and no modification of the LandTransfers Regulations.The First Sea Lord informed the Cabinet that four escort vessels had been transferred from the Pacific to the mediterranean in order to enable the preventive measures against illegal immiszrat-V,^...immigrationtion to be strengthened without- prejudice to the minesweepingprogramme. He also warned the Cabinet that ships carrying illegal immigrants were now being beached if they succeeded in eludingthe Naval patrols; and that, in view of the overcrowding of these ships, this increased the risk of a major disaster involving heavyloss of life.The Secretary of State for War said that arrangements werebeing made to provide accommodation in Cyprus for an additional10,000 illegal immigrants. This might involve the provision ofsome building materials from the United Kingdom. The cabinet considered that no building materials should be provided for thispurpose which were not surplus to &quot;United Kingdom requirements.^jho 5^Hr3iT\inTVT!] rtiTTYiHo-yo sIlOLllcl  xGI* tllS LTlOSt J33.I*L \yq 3CCQS3T710fl&apos; 11(Hdin tented camps.Greece.&quot;Withdrawal ofMilitaryMission.2. The Minister of State informed the Cabinet that theForeign Secretary had asked (Moscow telegram No. 176 of 18thMarch) for authority to accede to a request from the Unitedstates Secretary of State for the retention of the British military mission in Greece. The same request had been made through theUnited States Ambassador in London. Refusal might make it moredifficult for the United States Administration to secure the agree-ment of Congress to their proposals for the grant of financial assis-tance to Greece.The Cabinet were informed that the present strength of theMilitary Mission was about 300 officers and 1,200 other ranks. Inaddition there was a very small Naval Mission (which had existedArmy and partly from the danger of hostile Arab reactions. Thedecision to limit it to certain areas had been based on the consideration-tion that these were the areas from which the terrorists operated.Searches by police and military would continue; and there was reason to suppose that the Jewish community would continue toco-operate to the same extent as in recent weeks. But, if terroristoutrages continued, martial law in some form would have to bereimposed.The Cabinet considered that a more definite plan should havebeen made for handling the situation in Palestine during the nextfew months. The imposition of martial law in specified areas for limited periods and its subsequent- withdrawal while terrorismcontinued would give an impression of weakness and might- under-mine the morale of the Army. The Chiefs of Staff should novrconsider the possibility of maintaining martial law over the whole country so long as terrorism&apos; continued, but applying nnrfer h reetrictions of varying severity in different areas and at different times,as circumstances required. The High Commissioner and the GeneralOfficer Commanding should be summoned home for consultation onthese matters.The Cabinet-(1) Instructed the Chiefs of Staff to submit a report on themeasures necessary for maintaining law and order inPalestine during the next- six months, with special reference to the possibility of imposing martial law overthe whole of the countrv.
Parliament. 3.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in     the House of Commons in the following week.-ie House of On 24th March, on the Second Reading of the ConsolidatedCommons.

(46) 68thinclusions,-Suite 5.)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord privy seal (CP. (47) 79) setting out a provisional plan for the prepara-tion of legislation for the 1947-48 Session.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Committee on Future Legis-lation had assumed that the new Session would begin in October,which would allow more time for legislation than in the current session. Moreover, some saving of time might be secured by the modifications in Parliamentary procedure which it was intendedto introduce in the new Session. On the other hand, it would benecessary to allow more time for general debates on such matters asthe economic situation; the Committee Stages of four major Bills,since 1908) and a Police Mission. There was no formal Air Mission,but a small detachment of the Royal Air Force was engaged intraining the Greek Air Force, which was equipped solely with british aircraft.Points made in discussion were : (a) The total annual charge on the United Kingdom exchequer for these Missions was about  1 million. If the Military mission was to remain, the Greek Government should defray the cost, ifnecessary with assistance from the United States Government.(6) The Greek Army had been equipped entirely from thiscountry, and its efficiency would be seriously prejudiced by theabrupt withdrawal of the Military Mission, whose primary dutieswere in connexion with training.(c) The Greek Navy had been operating under the command of the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, and had given usefulservice.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Prime Minister to authorise the Foreign Secre-tary to inform the United States Secretary of State thatHis Majesty3 s Government were prepared to retain theBritish Military Mission in Greece for the time being;^&quot;    4.      n *. svwrr    y . . n&apos; si     ti     i-    rtrnif lima    v/.    diiKriT    ^&quot;&quot;ilJj    T^T&apos;Vi .&quot;.1 ^    j&quot;Vpuui  Liiav tiixcjf   wmu jiuu wvaauaajh^v ^ L/Cxi I V   wilt:  WiiVitr  -J-the cost, which should in their view be repaid by theGreek Government, with or without the assistance ofthe United States Government.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for War to consider meansof reducing the strength of the Military Mission in greece.(3) Took note that the Naval and Police Missions, and thedetachment of the Royal Air Force would be retained in Greece on the existing basis.
at least two of which, would be controversial, would have to be taken on the Floor of the House; and the Government might have to make some concession on Private Members&apos; time. The legislation intro-duced in the current Session had imposed a heavy strain on ministers, officials and Members of Parliament; and it seemed clearthat, when allowance was made for essential legislation which couldnot yet be foreseen, the provisional programme set out in para-graph 5 of CP. (47) 79 was too heavy. There seemed, therefore,to be a good case for postponing as much legislation as possibleuntil the last two Sessions of this Parliament, Meanwhile, it was important that work should proceed on the drafting of those bills which would have to figure in the 1947-48,Programme in any event,and the Committee had therefore listed the Bills, in paragraph 5 ofv^.x .   \tl)   IV,   xxx   liic uiuci   ill   \yxxxuxx uxxvy   icuuiuiucuucu  LllclL   U1J.work should be undertaken. The Committee were satisfied that itwould be a mistake to attempt to pass in the 1947-48 Session bothan iron ana oteei industry in ationansalion mu ana a vjhs industryNationalisation Bill; and they invited the Cabinet to decide which of these Bills should be included in the Programme.The Prime Minister said that the provisional Programme in cp. (47) 79 would impose too great a strain both on Ministers andon Parliament, and it would be essential to omit some of the Billswhen the final Programme came to be drawn up.  He did not thinknationalisation Bills should be introduced during the 1947-48Session.The following points were made in further discussion : (a) The Sea Fish Industry Bill should be put first in order of priority in paragraph 5 (6) (i) of CP. (47) 79, and the Patents Billshould be added to paragraph 5 (b) (ii).(b) A Women&apos;s Forces Bill and a Territorial and reserve forces Bill would probably have to be added to the 1947-48Programme.(c) It was proposed to combine the Electoral Reform Bill withthe Redistribution Bill.       .&quot;. . -. i(d) The Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of ,State ;fonDominion Affairs proposed to circulate to the Cabinet a memoran-dum on the question of House of Lords reform. Should it be decidedto legislate on this subject, the necessary Bill would have to be passedduring the 1947-48 Session.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that, subject to the points noted in paragraph (a)above, Parliamentary Counsel should, pending the formulation of a final Legislative Programme for the1947-48 Session, proceed with the drafting of the Billsmentioned in paragraph 5 of CP. (47) 79, in the orderof priority in which the Bills were listed in that paragraph.(2) Invited the Legislation Committee to carry out a monthlyreview of the progress made with the preparation oflegislation for the 1947-48 Session.(3) Agreed to defer for the present a decision on the questionwhether an Iron and Steel Industry Nationalisation bill and a Gas Industry Nationalisation Bill should beincluded in the Legislative Programme for the 1947-48Session.(4) Invited the Committee on Future Legislation to give further consideration to the legislation proposed in cp.

6^1 1Food. 5.   The Cabinet had before them a report by the Minister ofBritish Pood Food (CP. (47) 94) on the results of his visit to Canada and theSupplies.        United States.(Previous Discussion turned mainly on the proposal that the sugar rationBeference:      should be increased from 8 ozs. to 10 ozs. a week from 27th April.CM. (47) 13th The Minister of Food said that as a result of the agreementConclusions, made between his Director of Sugar and the United States Adminis-Minute 3.) tration we cOuld rely on receiving at least 170,000 tons more sugarthan we had received in 1946. It was reasonable, therefore, toassume that we should not need to make any further dollar purchases of sugar; for the supplies now secured would carry us over until1949; by which time it should be possible for us to meet all our needs from Commonwealth sources. He understood that the Chan-cellor of the Exchequer was anxious that an increase in the sugar ration should not involve an increase in the total Exchequer___i-*-i * ^     ___      -i  ix-.ct?- -:.---1   i--__.__----------i-J   x1   ----.-x   x&quot;U^  ^^Z^i-bUUbiUiob  Uii  iOUU.-obU.iib,   ciiiU.  lit;   VV ctb  pi&apos;t5jJciioU   IU xix\^5u   Lxxxo  puxxiuby making a corresponding increase in the price of some other food.The Minister said that he was most anxious to be able to make some improvement in the nation&apos;s diet at the present time, and he thoughtit specially appropriate that there should be an increase in the ration of an energy food like sugar. He had recently received adisturbing report showing, for the first time, a perceptible declinein the nutritional standards of the population. Whereas in 1944the nation5 s diet had been sufficient to meet, on average, 100 percent, of the physiological needs of the population, only 98 per cent,of these needs had been met in 1945, and in the last quarter of 1946the figure had dropped to 93 per cent.  Within this general average,. yi&amp;i. utuiai uiatincn OI biie uOpuicttxuii were xctniig muCil wurse.    liiuo,it was estimated that the existing diet for adolescent boys met only60 per cent, of their physiological needs. In these circumstances,the Minister hoped that the Cabinet would authorise him to announce at once that the sugar ration would be raised by 2 ozs.a week from 27th April.The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked that the Cabinet shoulddefer a decision until they had been able to consider other aspectsof the import programme. He would shortly be submitting a memo-randum on the import programme for the second half of 1947. Thiswould show that the United States Loan was being exhausted at avery rapid rate, and the Cabinet would have some difficult decisions to take. It might be expedient that the additional sugar whichhad recently been bought in the United States should be held in stockfor use in future months when our difficulties in importing foodmight be even greater than they were now. This proposal for animmediate increase in the sugar ration should not, in his view, beconsidered in isolation.The Minister of Food pointed out that a change in the sugar ration could only be made at the beginning of a new rationingperiod, and must be announced some time in advance in order thatthe necessary administrative preparations might be made. Unlessthe Cabinet&apos;s decision were taken early in the following week, thechange could not come into effect until 25th May.Other points raised in discussion were as follows :: (d) It was suggested that special efforts should be made toincrease the production of sugar in British Guiana.   The cabinet were informed that all practicable steps were being taken for this.   purpose.(&amp;) Additional supplies of maize had been obtained from theArgentine and the United States, and it was therefore proposedto increase, from 1st May, the rations of animal feeding stuffs. TheUnited States Secretary for Agriculture had already been askedwhether this additional maize was to be used for human eohsiirnp-tion; and it was suggested that, in order to forestall further com-ment, it would be expedient to mention, when the increase in the rations of animal feeding stuffs was announced, that no countryin Europe could use any more maize for human consumption. TheMinister of Agriculture undertook to do this.
(c). Special attention was idrawn to the statement, in para-graph 7 of CP. (47) 94, about the action of the Dutch Governmentin preventing British and American ships from moving food supplies from Indonesia. The Prime Minister said that he was going into this matter.(d) Was there any prospect of increased supplies of linseed oilfor industrial use?The Minister of Food said that the allocations to industry couldnot be increased unless additional supplies could be obtained. Therewas some possibility that we might- obtain more from the Argentine.There seemed little chance of any increased supply from India.(e) The Minister of Food said that during his recent visit hehad found the United States Administration more ready to recog-nise the food requirements of the United Kingdom; but the extentof the practical help which they could give was still limited by the prevailing world shortages of food.The Prime Minister said that the new United States Ambas-ambassador was ready to give all the help that he could; and, as had been stated previously in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on 2nd January. (CM.(47) 1st Conclusions, Minute 5), it was desirable that full use should in future be made of the United States Embassy in London as achannel for communication on questions of food supplies.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the report by the Minister of Food (CP. (47)94) on the results of his mission to Canada and theUnited States.(2) Invited the Minister of Food to circulate to the Cabinet thereport, to which he had referred in the discussion, onne in the nutritional standards of the popula-tion, together with any comments which might be madeon that report by the nutritional advisers of the Ministerof Health, the Secretary of State for Scotland and theMinister of Education.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to submit a memo-randum on those aspects of the import programme whichhe wished the Cabinet to take into account in reaching a decision on the proposed increase of the sugar ration(4) Agreed that, in the light of the memoranda to be submitted in pursuance of Conclusions (2) and (3) above, they would resume at their meeting on 25th March their discussionof the proposal for an increase of the sugar ration.Statute of Q,   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the SecretaryWestminster,    of State for Dominion Affairs (CP.
