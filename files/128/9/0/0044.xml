(45) 53rdConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum (CP. (47) 144) onthe constitutional position in Ceylon, submitted by the minister without Portfolio as Chairman of the Colonial Affairs Committee.They also had before them a report by the Chiefs of Staff (CP.(47) 147) on the military implications of the proposals put forward in that memorandum.The Secretary of State for the Colonies recalled that, in thediscussions in 1945 on the Report of the Souibury Commission,Mr. P.. S. Senanayake, the Vice-Chairman of the Ceylon Board ofMinisters, had proposed the immediate grant of Dominion statusto Ceylon. This proposal had been rejected by the Cabinet, butthe constitution granted on the basis of the Statement of Policyof October 1945 (Cmd. 6690) gave the Ceylon Government full control of the internal affairs of the-Island in the expectation ofeventual evolution to Dominion status. In view of recent develop-ments in India and Burma, Mr. Senanayake had now reopened thematter by asking that Ceylon should be promised &quot; independence within the British Commonwealth &quot;- as soon as possible after the inauguration of the new Constitution in October 1947. He had undertaken that Ceylon would enter into agreements with HisMajesty&apos;s Government for safeguards in respect of ImperialDefence and external affairs, but had asked that the promise of independence should not be made conditional on those agreements.Acceptance of this proposal would involve taking a risk on mr. Senanayake&apos;s good faith and his chances of being returned to power; but refusal would strengthen the hands of the extremistsin Ceylon, who were pressing for complete independence, and might prejudice the inauguration of the new Constitution. In that event,we might fail both to secure our defence requirements and to retainCeylon within the Commonwealth.   The Secretary of State there-of Ceylonmended that a statement should be made on the lines suggested by Mr. Senanayake. His proposals had the fall supportof the Governor of Ceylon, and had been endorsed by the colonial affairs Oonirmttee, subject to the views of the Chiefs of Staff and dominion Governments.The Chief of the Air Staff stressed the strategic importance was an essential base for the defence of the indian ocean. It was also an essential link in our air, cable and wirelesscommunications with the Far East. The Chiefs of Staff consideredthat the grant of independence to Ceylon should be accompanied byreservations which would ensure that our defence requirements would be adequately and permanently met.In discussion there was strong support for the view that itwould be unwise to reach a hurried decision on a question of suchmajor importance, which was of close concern to all the Common-wealth countries. The Dominion Governments should have full opportunity for comment before any commitment was made to ceylon; and Australia and New Zealand, in particular, should beinformed of the views of the Chiefs of Staff on the military implications-tions of the proposal. The Cabinet should not expose themselves tothe criticism of acting precipitately in response to an overture froma party leader on the eve of&apos; an election, of committing themselveswithout adequate consultation either within or outside Ceylon, andof ignoring the position of the minorities whose interests hadT33612-3] b 2
hitherto been carefully safeguarded. There was also a risk thatan announcement on the lines proposed would be interpreted asan indication of weakness : there could be no assurance thatMr. Senanayake would keep his promise: and we should beencouraging demands for similar political concessions in malaya and elsewhere. In any event was it not premature to agree to anyfurther measure of constitutional reform in Ceylon 1 The new Con-stitution, which had been drawn up after full investigation and consultation in the Island and embodied a scheme put forward byCeylon Ministers themselves, had not yet come into operation. Theannouncement now proposed would involve abandoning it even before an election had been held.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that, a negativereply might have serious political results in Ceylon.In discussion the following further points were made: (a) The implications of the term &apos;&apos; independence within theBritish Commonwealth&quot; should be carefully considered. The useof the word &quot; independence,&quot; apart from giving Ceylon a rightto apply for membership of the United Nations, might place HisMajesty&apos;s Government in an embarrassing position in connectionwith demands for the withdrawal of troops from &quot;independent&quot;bUUIItl ICC(5) Mr. Senanayake had suggested that it was unrealistic to suppose that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be willing to face a major clash with India in order to protect Ceylon&apos;s interests.It should be made clear to him that His Majesty&apos;s Government couldnot accept such an argument.(c) Consideration should be given to the definition of an appro-priate constitutional status for Colonial territories whose political development would soon enable them to expect some degree of independence within the Commonwealth.(d) The arrangements agreed with the Union of South Africafor the naval base at Simonstown might provide an appropriateprecedent for the agreement which would ultimately have to be madewith the Ceylon Government for the safeguarding of our defence requirements in the Island.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to submit,for consideration by the Cabinet, the draft of the com-munication to be made to Mr. Senanayake in the lightof their discussion;(2) Invited the Chiefs of Staff to consider what arrangementsfor safeguarding our defence interests would have tobe made with the Ceylon Government, if the Islandattained a position of independence within the Common-wealth.railway charges andWage Claims.(previous reference:CM. (46) 96thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Transport (CP. (47) 145) submitting recommendations for adjusting railway charges and handling the claims of railway workers for shorter hours and increased wages.The Minister of Transport said that these questions had beendiscussed by the Lord Presidents Committee, who were in generalagreement^ with his recommendations. It was estimated that theKailway Control Account for 1947 would show a deficiency of 32^ million, of which  22f million would be incurred during thefirst half of the year. The deficiency in the year 1st July, 1947,to 30th June, 1948, was likely to. be  24^ million and it seemed tohim essential that railway charges should be increased in order tobring the Account into balance. He had hoped that it would havebeen possible to bring into operation on 1st July, 1947, increased charges on the scale shown in paragraph 4 of CP. (47) 145.  These
19CM. M (47)would have yielded  11-9 million in the second half of 1947 and 11-1 million in the first-half of 1948. The Exchequer would then have borne about  20^ million of the deficiency in 1947, and in thefirst half of 1948 there would have been a deficiency of only about 4 million, which might well have disappeared if there were some improvement in traffic receipts. These estimates, however, took no account of the additional costs which would be incurred if the rail-waymen&apos;s claims for increased wages and reduced working hourswere granted. If these claims were met in full, the additional cost would amount to  88 million; and the concession of a 44-hour weekalone would involve an increase of  15 million. The Lord Presi-dents Committee had felt that no increases in railway charges should be announced until these claims had been decided; and theyhad suggested that he should meet the general managers of therailway companies and the trade unions in order to explain to them the increases in charges which would have to be made in any eventand urge them to reach an early settlement on the claims. It wasalso proposed that, failing agreement, the claims should be referredto the National Arbitration Tribunal or to a Court of Enquiry.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was now impos-sible to avoid a deficiency of at least  204 million in the RailwayControl Account for the year 1947 and the Exchequer would haveto bear this deficiency. It was, however, important that the account should be brought into balance before the railways came under public ownership and, since a delay of even a month or two would impose a substantial additional burden on the Exchequer, he would prefer that the higher charges proposed in paragraph 4 of CP. (47) 145should be brought into force on 1st July, 1947, on the understandingthat any further increases arising from the acceptance of any partof the workers&apos; claims might take effect from a later date.The Minister of Labour said that it would be impossible to reach a settlement on the claims of the unions by 19th May, when anannouncement about the higher charges would have to be made ifthey were to come into force on 1st July. If, as seemed likely, agree-ment could not be reached between the companies and the unions,he would favour the appointment of a Court of Enquiry. Thiswould enable the claims of all the unions to be considered together and the enquiry could also include a comparison of railway wage rates with those in other industries and the effect of the claims onthe level of railway charges.In further discussion the following points were made : (a) It was essential to bring the Hallway Control Account intobalance as soon as possible. There were, however, strong objectionsto making two successive increases in charges within a short periodof time or to increasing fares during the summer months. Moreover,thoueh there should be no unnecessary delay in settling the claims of the unions it was desirable to allow time for them to be adequatelyconsidered. This being so, the aim should be to bring the revisedcharges into force by 1st October, 1947.\b) There was general approval of the incidence of the increases in the proposed revised scale of charges in paragraph 4 of CP.(47) 145, under which the smallest increase fell on season and workmen&apos;s tickets.(c) The proposed increase in coal freights would involve anaverage increase of Is. Id. per ton in coal prices; and if coal freightshad to be increased to take account of the full claims of the unions is a further 4s. a ton would have to be added to the price of coal.(d) Experience had shown that with efficient management itwas possible to make up for higher labour costs by improved methodsof operation, and there would be considerable scope for sucheconomies when the railways were brought under public ownership.It might therefore be reasonable to accept deficiencies in the workingof the railways during the first year or two, provided that theiraccounts balanced over a period.
On the other hand, there was no likelihood of covering the wholeof the prospective deficiency by economies due to changes in organisation; and it would be inexpedient that Charges should beincreased soon after the railways had been brought under public ownership.(e) The Minister of Transport should hold a joint meeting withthe railway companies and the unions and should leave them in nodoubt about the increases in charges which would have to be madein any event and the further increases which would be necessary if the claims of the unions were conceded, He- should also bring out the effect of increases in railway charges on the operating costs of industry generally.: The Cabinet-(1.) Agreed in principle that before the railways came under public ownership their charges should be increased inorder to meet the full cost of their operation, including any increase in cost due to the concession of any partof fhe claims for shorter working hours or higher wages;(2) Agreed that the Minister of Transport should aim atbringing any necessary increase in charges into operation by 1st October, 1947;(3) Invited the Minister of Transport, in consultation with theMinister of Labour, to expedite the negotiations betweenthe railway companies and the unions on the claims forliUillC   IAJ   UXJiJXl   OIUCO   WiC   lUIi   JLXllpJ.1 VOjVJ.VJAJ.O   \JJL 1J.iCaCO.OCOin charges which would have to be made in any eventand of the further increases which would have to be made if . these claims were conceded; and authorised theMinister of Labour and the Minister of Transport,failing agreement between the companies and the unions,to arrange for the claims to be referred to a Court ofEnquiry or to the National Arbitration Tribunal.Wages Policy.(previous reference:C.M.(46)42ndConclusions,Minute 6.)4. In connection with the discussion recorded in the preceding minute the Cabinet took note of a memorandum by the Lord Presi-dent and the Minister of Labour (CP. (47) 146) reporting the inten-tion of the Lord Presidents Committee to consider the possibilityof consolidating into a Central Arbitral Body the existing machineryfor arbitration and conciliation on questions of wages and conditionsof work. :Iron andsteei        5   The Prime Minister recalled that on 1st May the CabinetNationahsa-     had authorised the Minister of Supply to make a confidential com-tipn Bjll,        munication to the Chairman of the Iron and Steel Federation about(Previous       the Governments decision to bring under public ownership certain reference:      sections of the iron and steel industry.   In view of the statementsCM. (47)42nd   which had appeared in the Press, requests for information of theConclusions,     Governments intentions had now been made by the Chairman of minute 6.)      the Iron and steel Uoard, the Chairman of the group of companies which were to undertake the new steel development scheme in SouthWales, and the Iron and Steel Group of the Parliamentary LabourParty.   The Minister felt that, if he withheld information of theGovernments intentions from the first two of these, he might prejudice the progress of the South Wales development scheme; buthe thought the Cabinet should recognise that, if knowledge of theGovernments plans were thus conveyed to the leaders of theindustry, it would be very difficult for the Government to decidethereafter to postpone the introduction of the Bill. At the Cabinet&apos;discussions on 24th and 28th April some Ministers had expressed a desire to see a reasoned statement of the case for proceeding withthis scheme, and they had been assured that the case would be fullystated in a White Paper which would be issued simultaneously with
Information.(PreviousEeferences:CM. (47) 42ndConclusions,Minute 6; and cm.(47)9thConclusions,Minute 1.)6. In connection with the discussion recorded in the preceding minute further reference was made to the embarrassment causedby the premature disclosure of the Cabinet&apos;s decision to proceedwith the scheme for nationalising certain sections of the iron andsteel industry. This disclosure, apart from the political embarrass-ment which it involved, had impaired the prospects of securing theco-operation of the Iron and Steel Federation.Attention was also drawn to an apparent disclosure, in the newspapers of 4th May, of matters discussed at a meeting of theEmergencies Committee on 1st May.Ministers expressed serious concern at the continuance of thesedisclosures of matters which were under discussion by the cabinet or its Committees.the issue of the Bill. In view, however, of the political implications of the statements which were now to be made to Some of the leadersof the industry, the Prime Minister thought it desirable that theCabinet should satisfy themselves at this stage as to the strengthof the case which would be presented in that White Paper. he therefore invited their attention to the paper (CP. (46) 120) sub-fnitted to the Cabinet by the Minister of &quot;Supply in March 1946in which the case for proceeding with the nationalisation of theindustry Was fully stated.The Cabinet Were reminded that the case had also been fully developed in the speeches made by Government spokesmen in the debate in the House of Commons on 27th and 28th May, 1946.After a short discussion the Cabinet agreed that it was in thenational interest to proceed without delay with a scheme, on thelines set out in CP. (47) 123, for bringing certain sections of theiron and steel industry under public ownership; and that a sufficientcase&apos; could be made out, in the White Paper which was to bepublished simultaneously with the Bill, for proceeding at the present justice with a scheme on these lines.Discussion then turned on the nature of the information whichthe Minister of Supply should give to leaders of the industry aboutthe main features of the Governments plan. It was agreed thatthe Minister should be free to disclose, in these conversations, whichsections of the industry were to be brought under public ownership and to name the particular companies which were to be taken over.It was also agreed that he should disclose the Governments inten-tion to buy the whole of the securities of these companies.There was some danger that the Minister might be exposed toa charge of breach of Parliamentary privilege if at too early a stagehe discussed the details of the Governments proposals with the Ironand Steel Group of the Parliamentary Labour Party.The Cabinet (1) Reaffirmed their decision that an Iron and Steel Nationali-sation Bill, on the lines indicated in CP. (47) 123,should be included in the programme of government legislation for the 1947-48 Session;(2) Authorised the Minister of Supply to inform the Chairmanof the Iron and Steel Federation, the Chairman of theIron and Steel Board and the Chairman of the group of companies responsible for the new steel development scheme in South Wales about the Governments intentionto bring certain sections of the iron and steel industry under public ownership by buying the whole of the securities of the companies concerned;(3) Asked the Minister of Supply to consult with the lord president regarding the stage at which the Governmentsscheme should be further discussed with the Iron andSteel Group of the Parliamentary Labour Party.
Strike ofWindingEnginemenin Durham.The Prime Ml/lister said that the r resident oi tiie IN ationaiUnion of Mineworkers had sent him a copy of the statement whichhe&apos; had issued condemning the strike called by a small Union ofwinding enginemen in Durham, and had asked for Government sup-port in his efforts to defeat the attempt of this Union to securerecognition as a separate negotiating body.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the National coal board were not proposing to countenance this Union and were taking urgent steps to train substitutes to take the place of windingenginemen in Durham who were unwilling to resume work. In this they had the full support of the National Union of Mineworkers.Two of the pits affected had already been able to reopen by securingvolunteers to operate the winding gear.The Foreign Secretary suggested that the Government mightleave it to the National Union of Mineworkers to defeat the attemptof this Union to secure recognition as a separate negotiating body.The Cabinet took note of these statements.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,6th May, 1947.
