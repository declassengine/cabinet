Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.FutureBusiness.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken bythe House of Commons in the following week.On 24th February the Secretary of State for Scotland wouldmove the Second Reading of the Town and Country Planning(Scotland) Bill.On 25th February there would be a debate on Palestine, on the motion for the Adjournment.

As paragraph 3of that Statement invited debate, and some Government supporters would have welcomed a discussion, it was important that theMinister of Defence should not appear to be avoiding such a debate;and it was desirable that he should be given an opportunity, in thegeneral debate on the Economic Situation, to defend the proportionof our total resources which was to be allotted to Defence. It wouldbe convenient that some part of this three-day debate should be devoted to the economic implications of our Defence requirements;and it was agreed that the Minister of Defence should speak on thesecond day of that debate.Germany and austria.CurrencyTransactionsby OccupationForces.2. The Prime Minister said that he proposed to discuss withthe Secretary of State for War whether there were not grounds fordisciplinary action against officers who had been responsible forfailing to stop at an earlier date the currency transactions bymembers of our occupation forces in Germany and Austria. these transactions had involved the Exchequer in a loss of  20 million.He would also consider whether it would be expedient to institutesome formal enquiry into this matter.The Minister of Defence pointed out that the transactions had started as soon as the forces of occupation entered Germany and austria; and that as far back as May 1946 the former Secretaryof State for War had disclosed to Parliament what had beenhappening. He believed that the House of Commons might be satis-fied if on the Report Stage of the Supplementary Estimates a fullexplanation were given of the action taken, without any suggestionthat these transactions were condoned.PolishBill.3. The Cabinet were informed that there was likely to be somecontroversy m the House of Commons that afternoon, on the Com-mittee Stage of the Polish Resettlement Bill, over a new Clauseproviding for the disciplinary control of members of the polish forces who had not yet opted either to join the Polish Resettlement[33350-4] B 2
Corps or to return to Poland. Under this Clause the Allied Forces act, 1940, would apply to these Forces as if they had not ceased 1to be recognised by the Government of Poland, and their officers Iwould be empowered to deal with disciplinary offences under the law 1of Poland as it stood before 5th July, 1945-snbiect onlv to t-v,, iprovision that a sentence of death could not be imposed and a Isentence of. imprisonment for more than three months would have Ito be confirmed by the British G.O.C. of the Command in which the Isentence was passed. These men, though resident in this countrv Iwould thus be denied the protection of the British Courts; and their Iofficers, who no longer owed allegiance to any existing Government Iwould be free to punish them under a Polish law repudiated by 1the existing Government of Poland with which His Majestv&apos;s government^ were in diplomatic relations.The Home Secretary explained that these men could not be 1subjected to British military law so long as they remained under the control of their own officers; and the War Office were unable to iprovide Polish-speaking British officers to take charge of them. It ihad thus appeared that, during the relatively short interval before 1they decided whether to join the Polish Resettlement Corps or return Ito Poland, they must remain under the control of their own Polish 1officers and subject to discipline under the Polish military code to which they were accustomed.X JUtv^fctLM-iicL, Willie avA^cp o xng Liiaij pucitrjii, xcxi uitau mo jju-juiou- pments awarded by these Polish officers for disciplinary offences ishould be subject to control by some British authority. This jprinciple had already been admitted by providing that sentences 1of imprisonment for more than three months should require con- Ifirmation by the British G.O.C. of the Command in which the jsentence was passed. The Cabinet therefore provisionally agreed jthat a senior officer of the British Army should be given supreme control over the discipline of these forces. In practice, he would Iexercise that control through the Polish officers; but, if these officers jabused their authority, he would have power to remove them. If Ithe Foreign Office saw objection, on political grounds, to conferring Ithis jurisdiction on a military officer, it might be conferred on a iperson appointed for the purpose by the Lord Chancellor or the home Secretary.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Chancellor to consider, in consultation iwith Parliamentary Counsel and officials of the Foreign jOffice and other Departments concerned, whether (supreme control over the discipline of these Polish Forces i could not be exercised by a senior British officer or other jperson responsible to His Majesty&apos;s Government; and fwhether provision to that effect could not be included in Ithe new Clause which was to be inserted in the Polish IResettlement Bill.(2) Authorised the Home Secretary, in the light of the consulta- jtions to be held by the Lord Chancellor under the pre- Iceding Conclusion, to undertake to propose an amendment Ein this sense on the Report Stage of the Bill.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (47) 62) proposing the establishment of a PoliceCollege for England and Wales.The Home Secretary explained that the establishment of sucha College had been recommended by the Police Post-War Committee,and the Committee&apos;s recommendations were generally acceptable tothe local authority associations and the representatives of the police service. He proposed that the decision to establish the Collegeshould be announced in a White Paper, a draft of which was annexed to CP. (47) 62.  The College would be open only to persons
who had actually served In a police force, and normally a police-man would have to attain the rank of sergeant before becomingeligible for admission. Where, however, a constable was otherwisequalified to benefit from attendance at the College but had notattained the rank of sergeant owing to the limited number of vacancies in his own force, he might be exceptionally admitted onthe recommendation of his Constable with the approval of theHome Secretary. Among the policemen now serving were men whohad valuable experience as omcers in the Services, and many ofthese would no doubt qualify for admission to the College. Itwas, however, important to maintain the principle that the primaryconsideration for admission to the Uoiiege was a man!s qualificationsas a policeman.The Cabinet Approved the Home Secretary&apos;s proposals for the establish-mum, ox a jruiice v-/unegc xur juiigiaiiuj ana vvaies anaauthorised him to issue a White Paper in the form annexed to CP.
