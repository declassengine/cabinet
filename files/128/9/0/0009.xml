The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the issues raised in the papers on the Economic Survey for 1947 (CP. (47) 19, 20,25 and 29).They first considered the recommendation in paragraph 11 of cp. (47) 25 that the direct requirements of man-power for the armed Forces and the supply industries should not exceed,400,000 at the end of 1947.The Minister of Defence said that for the purposes of theDefence Estimates for 1947-48 he had made an exhaustive reviewof these requirements and, with the co-operation of the service ministers and the Chiefs of Staff, had made substantial reductions in the proposals originally submitted to him. The Estimates hadbeen considered by the Defence Committee on 14th January (D.O.(47) 2nd Meeting) and since then he had been able to make stillfurther reductions. In his view, the minimum requirements at31st December, 1947, were 1,167,000 in the Armed Forces and450,000 in the supply industries a total of 1,617,000, which corn-pared with the figure of 1,400,000 proposed by the Ministerial Com-mittee on Economic Planning. In arriving at this figure he hadtaken full account of any savings which would accrue from thewithdrawal of British troops from Greece, Venezia Giulia and austria, and had made provision only for the minimum strengthrequired to meet our vital commitments in Germany, the middle east and India. He had already put in hand the preparation of long-term plans for our permanent peace-time Forces, and he hoped to put these before his colleagues later in the year. Meanwhile, hehad to make allowance for the fact that during the transition period there was a very rapid release of trained men from the Forces anda corresponding need for large training organisations. The figureof 450,000 proposed for the supply industries represented a saving of 80,000 on the original figure given in the Economic Survey, andhad been achieved only by a vigorous application of the principlethat the Services should rely on existing stocks rather than new production.The Minister added that he had approached his task of co-ordinating the demands of the Services with the aim of securingall possible economies, and he was convinced that any further reduction in the figures which he had put before the Cabinet wouldmake it impossible for the Services either to discharge their present commitments or to evolve towards balanced peace-time Forces.The First Lord of the A dmiralty explained that there had beena more rapid reduction in the man-power of the Navy than in theman-power of the other two Services. The bare minimum of shipswas being kept in commission, but the Navy also had to providesubstantial numbers for the Fleet Air Arm and for the maintenanceof ships in reserve. Modern developments in the technical equip-ment of warships required increased complements and a largertraining organisation.[33073-2] B 2
The Secretary of State for War pointed out that, as a resultof the pledges given on the release of men from the forces, the army would lose about 700,000 trained men in 1947 and 1948 and bythe end of December 1948 would be reduced to a strength of about320,000. At 31st March, 1948, the strength of the Army wouldbe 82,000 less than the figure regarded as the minimum required tomeet its foreseeable commitments. In these circumstances, it hadbeen necessary to forgo the preliminary training of recruits and tocarry out training in operational units.The Secretary of State for A ir said that the Royal Air Forcenot only gave valuable assistance to the Army in carrying out policeduties, but also provided extensive services for civil aviation. Inthe next two years the Royal Air Force would lose 200,000 of their275,000 trained men, and&quot; at 31st March, 194ST about 40 per cent,of the total strength would be employed on training.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, whatever doubtshad been expressed about the value to industry of the proposalsfor postponement of the raising of the school-leaving age anddirecting young women to work of national importance, it was clearthat any reduction in the size of the Armed Forces or in the man-power employed in the supply industries would be of direct and immediate value to civil industry. It had been pointed out thatthe operation of the pledges already gives would mean a very largereduction in the size of the Army by the end of 1948 and, in his view, it would be well worth while to accept a temporary weakening of the Armed Forces during the next year or two in order to relieve the strain on the national economy. Even if the figure of 1,400,000proposed by the Economic Planning Committee could not beaccepted, would it not be possible to bring the total man-powerrequirement at the end of 1947 down to 1.500.000?Other points in discussion were : (a) Since our balance of payments position made it imperativeto maintain the export trade at the level already decided upon bythe Cabinet, the only alternatives to making a substantial reductionin the requirements of the Armed Forces were to reduce deliberatelythe standard of home- consumption or to allow the man-power gapto close itself. If the latter alternative were adopted, the result was likely to be a series of crippling dislocations in our national economy.(&amp;) Nothing would be gained by maintaining the strengths ofthe Armed Forces at the cost of overstraining the industrial resources of the country or reducing the standard of home consump-tion. Our influence in international affairs and our strength inany future war depended on our industrial and social stability atleast as much as on the size of our peace-time Forces. Comparedwith the United States we were allocating a disproportionateamount of man-power to the Armed Forces.(c) Was it not possible to carry out police duties abroad withsmaller Forces ? Was it not the presence of British troops ratherthan their strength that prevented trouble?As against this, it that the tasks to be discharged inGermany, Palestine and Venezia Giulia called for seasoned anddisciplined troops in substantial numbers.(d) Attention was drawn to the importance of maintainingadequate Forces in the Middle East to protect our oil supplies fromthat area.(e) The man-power requirements of the Forces might be met tosome extent by the enlistment of Poles and other foreign nationals.The experience of the Royal Air Force had shown that Polishnationals could be used successfully in mixed&apos; units. Some prelim-inary enquiries into the possibility of enlisting foreigners had beenmade in the Foreign Office, and the Foreign Secretary had suggestedthat the matter might be pursued after the forthcoming meeting
NationalGovernmentStaffs.LocalGovernmentStaffs.of Foreign Ministers in Moscow. The employment of foreigners inthe United&apos; Kingdom Forces would be easier if they could benaturalized.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of argument appeared to be in favour of accepting thefigures proposed by the Minister of Defence. Experience after thewar of 1914-18 showed the disastrous effect on British foreign policyof allowing the Armed Forces to bs unduly weakened. The extentto which the Forces were having to release trained men under the demobilisation scheme made it imperative that they should retainsufficient numbers to allow for the training of new recruits and topermit the evolution of efficient peace-time Forces. He recognisedfxv^nbTMift nf t.hA nrnnnsals nf thfi Minister nf Deffinnfi mftanf.ossiS ox ms iviiiiiSucr oi jjeienct; meantiat a large gap would remain, but he thought it inexpedient torequire the Services to make such a large contribution towardsbridging the gap as had been proposed by the Economic planning committee. A solution should rather be sought through economies in the use of man-power by industry and in the attainment of ahigher level of productivity.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he greatly regretted that the Cabinet were not prepared to reduce the strengths of theServices to something nearer the figure recommended by theEconomic Planning Committee. The Cabinet had rejected theCommittee&apos;s proposal to postpone the raising of the school-leaving age, and if they were also to withhold approval for the proposalfor a national service scheme for women none of the Committee&apos;smajor recommendations for bridging the man-power gap would havebeen adopted. The result could only be that the national economy would be seriously dislocated and we might well find ourselves inan extremely critical situation in the next year or two.In paragraph 12 of CP. (47) 25 it was recommended that asubstantial reduction should be made in Civil Service staffs.The Home Secretary said that his Committee on Civil ServiceMan-Power would do their best to secure reductions; but he mustwarn the Cabinet that, according to the latest estimates, the present one direction in which staff economies could be secured was by using for the local work of the Ministry of National Insurance thelocal offices of another Department. This, however, would involvereversing a decision that this Ministry should establish separatelocal offices. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he hadalready ascertained from the Ministry of Labour that in most partsof the country it should be possible for the Ministry of national insurance in the initial period to use, on an agency basis, the localmachinery of the Ministry of Labour. He hoped to persuade theMinister of National Insurance to adopt this course. The Ministerof Works asked to be kept informed of the progress of these negotia-tions, as he was at present under an obligation to provide accommo-dation for separate local offices for the Ministry of national insurance.In paragraph 13 of CP. (47) 25 it was recommended that steps should be taken to secure a reduction in local government staffs.The Minister of Health said that he had already made a con-tribution towards this by declining to compensate for loss of officepersons displaced from local government service by the transfer of functions from local authorities to the central Government; and hewas proposing to employ some of those so displaced in the national health Service. While he was willing to make further efforts tosecure reductions in local authority staffs, it must be rememberedthat the central Government had no direct powers of control in thismatter, and also that the Government were asking local authoritiesto undertake fresh administrative burdens. The recent request forfurther information about forthcoming capital expenditure, which[33073-2] B 3
ForeignLabour.Housing for miners andAgriculturalWorkers.White Paper.3ed to the employment of Poles in the coalmining industry,ugh the numbers directly concerned would not be large,was essential for the operation of the Government&apos;s employment policy, was likely to entail additions to the technical staffs of localauthorities.In discussion of the recommendations in paragraphs 14 to 15of CP. (47) 25 about the employment of foreign labour, the cabinet were informed that the National Union of Mineworkers had now agreed to.i nuugiithis change in the attitude of the National Union of Mineworkerswas likely to make it easier to secure the admission of Poles to otherindustries in which the Trade Unions had hitherto been unco-opera-tive.The Home Secretary suggested that, in view of the general shortage of man-power, there might be a greater readiness to grantapplications from individual foreigners seeking to enter this country who were willing and qualified to undertake industrial employment.Such persons were admitted to this country on condition that theyentered specified employment and did not leave it without the per-mission of the Ministry of Labour. If the Ministry of Labour were ready to grant such permits more freely, the Home Office would raise no objection. The Cabinet endorsed the Home Secretary&apos;proposal on the understanding that no publicity need be given tothis modification of existing policy.The Home Secretary also said that some prisoners of war whohad been repatriated were applying for permission to return to thiscountry to resume their former employment here, mainly in agri-culture. Some German prisoners were also anxious to remain inemployment here rather than accept repatriation. He suggestedthat, as a general rule, such applications might be granted. TheCabinet also endorsed these proposals.The Cabinet then considered the recommendations, in para-graphs 30 and 48 of CP. (47) 25, that special efforts should be madeto increase the provision of houses for miners and agricultural workers.The Minister of Health said that the low .which couiol be completed in 1947 had aliyact f\\\T  Jn of all the housesbeen settled, andit would not be reasonable to require local authorities to let houses to miners or agricultural workers without regard to the claims ofother applicants. There were already proportionately more houses under construction in rural areas than in urban areas, and he hadtaken special steps to stimulate the provision of additional houses in rural areas in the 1948 programme.The Secretary of State for Scotland, said that he was not satis-fied that the needs of agricultural workers in Scotland were beingadequately met by the provision of houses by local authorities, andthat he had instituted a special enquiry to ascertain the facts. Asregards housing for miners, he had proposed that the scottish special Housing Association should undertake the erection of houses for the National Coal Board in those areas where the developmentof new mines had led to a demand for additional labour.It was the view of the Cabinet that the Minister of Health andthe Secretary of State for Scotland should take all possible stepsto provide additional housing accommodation for miners and agri-cultural workers.In paragraphs 54 and 55 of CP. (47) 25 it was recommendedthat a White Paper based on the Committee&apos;s report should be presented to Parliament with a view to a debate on economic affairs in the second half of February.The President of the Board of Trade said that, as the cabinet had not felt able to accept the main recommendations made in thereport for closing the gap between our requirements and our pro-ductive resources, he doubted whether it would be wise to proceedwith this proposal for the publication of a White Paper. TheGovernment would be exposed to serious criticism if they presented a White Paper which disclosed the seriousness of the economic
position without proposing measures sufficient to remedy the situa-tion. The Chancellor of the Exchequer concurred in this view, and suggested that it might be preferable to defer until the autumn the project for a debate on the general economic position and meanwhileto prepare an economic plan for 1948 on which such a debate mightbe held.In discussion divergent views were expressed on this question.Some Ministers thought that the publication of the facts disclosed in the Economic Survey would cause the Government political embarrassment. The Government would be caught between two firesof criticism from those who complained that they were notadopting measures of economic planning to meet the situation, andfrom those who would inferan intention to introduce a fully-plannedeconomy inconsistent with -British conceptions of personal liberty.Other Ministers saw advantages in publishing the full facts ofthe economic situation, as a background both for the appeals whichwould have to be made for increased productivity and for the efforts which must be made to resist applications for increased wages orshorter hours. Some Ministers were of opinion that, with these objects in view, it was not essential that the Government should beable to announce that specific measures would be taken, by adjust-mATitS rvf GnvSTrimenf, nnlir.v   to close thft whnlp nf fhp crnr\ Kofwo .nn/.rtniTiATVi/\n4-(i     i I 1. 1 ]     .1 KI \ 1 i 1 ; (1    1 11 /1. 111 1&apos; /1 !&quot;1 (iThe Prime Minister, in summing up this part of the discussion,said that it would be preferable to defer reaching any final con-elusion on the recommendation for the early publication of a white paper on the general economic position.The Cabinet-(1) Reaffirmed the general export target for the second halfof 1947, approved by the Cabinet on 4th November, 1946;and invited the President of the Board of Trade toarrange for the appointment of an inter-DepartmentalCommittee to review export targets for particular industries as recommended in paragraph 7 of OP.//C7\ OK.V1&apos; ) &quot;V J(2) Agreed that the Minister of Defence should Dlan on theassumption that a^t Slst December, 1947, the strength ofthe Armed Forces would be 1,167,000 and the man-power employed in supply industries 450,000;(3) Took note that the Committee on Civil Service Man-power would seek to secure substantial reductions in CivilService staffs;(4) Invited the Minister of Health, the Minister of education and the Secretary of State for Scotland to take all practicable steps to secure a reduction in local govern-ment staffs;(5) Took note that the Minister of Labour would submit anearly report to the Cabinet on the progress made in securing the admission of Poles to civilian employmentin this country;(6) Invited the Home Secretary and the Minister of labour to arrange that the employment of individual foreignersin this country, including ex-prisoners of war, would be facilitated in proper cases;(7) Invited the Minister of Labour to arrange for the recruit-ment of suitable labour from among displaced personsin Kurope as soon as this could be done without prejudicing the existing scheme for the recruitment offoreign women for domestic service in hospitals and similar institutions;(8) Invited the Minister of Supply and other Ministers con-cerned to see that all possible facilities were given to expedite the provision of mechanical equipment for the coalmining industry;

The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of the course of constitutional the discussions with the Delegation of the Burma Executive CouncilPosition.        which was now in this country.(Previous The point to which the Delegation attached most importanceReference-. was the election of a Constituent Assembly. It had been plannedCM. (46) 107th that there should be elections in April for a Legislature under theConclusions, Government of Burma Act, 1935; and that the Burmese membersMinute 2.) Qf this Legislature should then form themselves into a ConstituentAssembly. It now appeared that the composition of the Legislatureunder the 1935 Act was much disliked in Burma on the ground thatit gave undue representation to non-Burman interests. The Delega-tion were therefore anxious to avoid another Legislature chosenunder the 1935 Act and to secure that the Constituent assembly should be based directly on the elections, in which only Burmanationals would take part. It seemed to the United kingdom ministers taking part in the conversations that there was substance in this claim. It would be practicable substantially to meet it byretaining in force the present emergency powers. Elections could then take place, in the 91 general constituencies, of persons whowould form the Constituent Assembly. Ministers intended to pro-pose this course to the Delegation. They felt that a concession onthis point should greatly facilitate negotiations on other matters.The Legislature would have to be nominated by the Governor,but it was suggested that he should nominate the greater part of
its members from among the members of the Constituent Assembly.This would give it a representative character. The balance wouldbe nominated to represent the non-Burman interests who had not taken part in the elections for the Constituent Assembly. It wouldbe necessary to obtain the approval of Parliament to an amendmentof an existing Order in Council if the members of the Legislatureexceeded 50.The Delegation were anxious that the Governor&apos;s ExecutiveCouncil should be given the full powers of a Dominion government during the interim period before the new constitution came intoforce. Ministers had explained that during this period action couldonly be taken within the framework of the existing law, under whichconstitutional powers must be distributed as at present. It would,however, be possible to establish a convention as to the manner inwhich those powers would be exercised. Ministers would suggest to the Delegation that the Governor should send a letter to the.Executive Council to the effect that during the interim period HisMajesty&apos;s Government would treat them with the same close eon-sultation and consideration as a Dominion Government, and wouldgive them the greatest possible freedom in the exercise of the day-to-day administration of the country. This would be exactly on the analogy of the course followed in India.The Cabinet Approved the line which it was proposed to take in thenegotiations.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,17 ih January, 1947.
