31 CM. S (47)&quot; 20Road Haulage 1.   The Minister of Labour gave the Cabinet the latestStrike. information about the unofficial strike of road transport workers.This had begun on 6th January, when transport drivers employedby some of the large contractors in East London had gone on strike,without warning, as a protest against the proposals announced bythe Road Haulage Wages Board on 31st December. Driversworking in Smithfield meat market joined the strike at once, andit quickly spread to other large contractors, including two handlingmails. The Minister said that the merits of the men&apos;s claim were strong and there had certainly been undue delay in dealing with it;but they had put themselves in the wrong by striking, against theadvice of Union officials, while the claim was still under considera-tion by the Wages Board. The best hope of restoring the position was to convince the men that their claim could not be met while they remained on strike but that, if they returned to work, they hada good prospect of obtaining an early and satisfactory settlement.The Board were meeting that day and it was possible that, beforethe end of the statutory period for receiving objections, they mightbe ready to make some announcement indicating their intentionto modify their original proposals. Alternatively, it might bepossible to secure the establishment of a Joint Industrial council for the industry, which might negotiate conditions acceptable to themen and submit them thereafter for ratification by the Board. Hewas himself disposed, to favour the second course.The Minister sought the views of the Cabinet on the questionwhether some member of the Government should make a statementindicating that, if the men would return to work, there was a good prospect that a settlement satisfactory to them would be reached-in the near future. It was the view of the Cabinet that no assurance of this kind should be given on behalf of the Government. TheTrade Union officials would no doubt continue to take all practicable steps to bring this home to the men.In further discussion, the following points were made : (a) Following a meeting held on 10th January under theChairmanship of the Minister of Defence, arrangements had beenmade for the employment of troops in maintaining food supplies in the London area. These arrangements had been brought intooperation that morning and were working satisfactorily. Thenumber of lorries operating under these arrangements would rise from 600 at the outset to 1,300 on 16th January.The suggestion was made that employers for Whom Servicetransport was made available should be required to pay to theGovernment a sum roughly equivalent to the civilian wages whichthey would otherwise have had to pay.(b) It was estimated that about 14,000 men were now on strike in London. Outside London, Liverpool and Manchester thenumbers on strike were relatively small; and it was mainly theprovincial branches of London firms that were affected. It waspossible that the situation might become more serious in London :,the strike had already spread to some of the flour mills and therewas some risk that milk delivery might be affected.(c) A committee of officials had been formed to secure inter-departmental collaboration in maintaining essential services. Itwas desirable that a Ministerial Committee should also meet, as necessary, to take on the Cabinefs behalf the urgent decisions which would be required if the strike continued for some time or became more widespread. The action so far authorised by ministers applied only to the maintenance of essential food supplies.(d) It might be represented to the B.B.C. that the position was not likely to be improved by frequent announcements of freshareas to Which the strike had spread. The Lord Privy Seal under-took, in the Lord Presidents absence, to raise this matter withthe B.B.C.(e) The procedure under the Road Haulage Wages Act, 1938,was undoubtedly cumbersome and the delays to which it had given[33047-1] b 2
rise on this occasion could not be defended. There was something to be said for making permanent the emergency procedure Whichhad been introduced during the war by the Trade Boards and road Haulage Wages (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1940. TheMinister&apos; of Labour said that he was looking into this whole ques-tion of delays in procedure: he was, in particular, considering whether he could make a regulation requiring the Road HaulageWages Boards to deal with applications within a prescribed period.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, expressed theCabinet&apos;s approval of the proposal of the Minister of Labour for promoting the satisfactory settlement of the men&apos;s claim throughthe establishment of a Joint Industrial Council. Meanwhile, itwas not desirable that any member of the Government should give any public assurance that the men had a good prospect of securing a satisfactory settlement if they returned to work; and, so long asthe strike continued, it was the duty of the Government to take all necessary steps to maintain essential services. For this purposea Committee of officials had already been appointed and metregularly; and he would arrange for a Ministerial Committee tomeet, as necessary, to give such urgent decisions as might berequired on the Cabinet&apos;s behalf.Leakage of 2.

The Lord Chancellor undertook to makeinquiries, in accordance with the procedure approved by theCabinet on 4th April, 1946.Production of ground Matsin EastAfrica./t*_____:____^xreviuutjReference:CM.(46)93rdConclusions,Minute 6.)3. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister ofFood (CP. (47) 4 and 10) about the project for the large-scale pro-duction of ground nuts in East Africa.The Minister of Food recalled that on 31st October, 1946, theCabinet had sanctioned a limited scheme, at a cost of not more than 3 million, on the understanding that the implications of the largerscheme which had then been outlined to them would be fully investigated by the Departments concerned. Satisfactory progress had been made with the limited scheme, and he now sought authority to proceed with the full scheme, involving Treasuryadvances of about  25 million. The financial details and thearguments in favour of proceeding with the large-scale develop-ment were set out in the two memoranda which he had circulatedto Cabinet. There was undoubtedly some element of risk in under-taking this project; but he was satisfied that there would be even greater risk in refraining from developing some such alternativesource of supply of edible fats. The maintenance: of adequate supplies of margarine for this country by 1950 was likely to dependon the success or failure of this scheme. Much of the capital cost,particularly for machinery, would involve dollar expenditure; but,if the scheme were successful, a limited initial expenditure of dollars should ultimately relieve us of a heavy continuing dollar expenditure.
SS CM. 6 (47)He had been asked whether it could be assumed! that the ground-nuts produced under this scheme would be available for our ownuse and not subject to international allocation. He thought it likely that the system of international allocation of fats would have beendiscontinued by the end of 1947, and any production under thisscheme would then be a net gain for us. Even if it were continued,however, we should be able to take the whole of this productionagainst our allocation and to reduce by that amount the quantitywhich we had to buy from dollar sources.If his proposals were approved, he would make an annual reportto the Cabinet on the progress of the scheme. In the first instance,the United Africa Company would administer it as a managingagency; but he proposed that legislation should be introduced in theautumn to establish a Government Corporation to which respon-sibility for the scheme would be transferred in August 1948.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had discussed thethe details of the scheme with the Minister of Food, and he was satisfied that the balance of the argument was in favour of under-taking this development. He was glad that the Minister had beenable to give the Cabinet satisfactory assurances on two points towhich he had attached importance, viz., that this country, ratherthan an international pool, should get the benefit of all this new production, and that annual reports should be made to the Cabineton the progress of the scheme. A third point which he hoped theCabinet would accept in principle was that the Colonial Govern-ments, who would derive substantial benefit from the scheme, shouldbe asked to consider making some contribution towards the capital cost.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that his Depart-ment had been associated with the Ministry of Food in the detailed examination of these schemes and he supported the proposals whichthe Minister of Food had placed before the Cabinet. Substantialdifficulties would have to be overcome. In particular, there mightbe difficulties in obtaining adequate supplies of labour in this area;much machinery would have to be imported; large supplies of fertilisers would have to be obtained; and a good deal of irrigationwork would be required. On these and other points, however, theDepartments had take great trouble to secure the best advice obtain-able; and the balance of argument was, in his view, in favour of proceeding with the scheme. He would discuss with the Chancellorof the Exchequer the question of securing some contribution fromthe Colonial Governments towards the capital cost of the scheme.Points in further discussion were :  (a) If any substantial part of the machinery required were tobe supplied from this country, this would prejudice the productionof agricultural machinery for use in the United Kingdom.The Cabinet were informed that the bulk of the machinery required was to be obtained from Canada(b) It was said that the full scheme would involve the annualconsumption of 400,000 tons of fertilisers. Might not this pre-judice the supply of fertilisers for use in the United Kingdom?The Cabinet were informed that extensive new deposits ofphosphates had been discovered in Uganda, and it was hoped thatthese might be exploited for the purposes of this scheme.(c) Large numbers of soil chemists and other technical expertswould be required. Might not this also prejudice the interestsof British agriculture?The Cabinet were informed that the Colonial Service alreadyincluded a number of competent soil chemists, who would formthe nucleus of the technical staff required for this scheme. Thoughothers would be required, it was unlikely that recruitment forthis staff would seriously prejudice British agriculture.
Japanese 4.   The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Foreign Secre-Keparationa. tary (CP. (47) 9), the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs andthe Secretary of State for India (CP. (46) 457 and CP. (47) 23and 27) regarding a deadlock which had been reached over japanese reparations.The Soviet Government, having removed large quantities of plant from Manchuria which they regarded as war booty, were unwilling to agree that Japanese external assets should be includedin the reparations pool. The other members of the Far eastern commission considered it essential that external assets should beincluded in order to secure an equitable division of all JapaneseUnited States Government were now anxious to issue &quot; interimdirectives &quot; to the Supreme Commander, Allied Powers. this they were entitled to do when urgent matters arose which were not covered by policies already formulated by the Commission. It was their intention to obtain the concurrence of the members of theCommission, other than Russia, in such interim directives; and theyhad sought our view on this course of action.The Governments of India and of the interested dominions had been consulted. The Government of India were ready to agreeto the United States proposal. The Governments of Canada,Australia and New Zealand were anxious that the appropriate international machinery should continue to be used for as long aspossible. The Canadian Government proposed reference to theCouncil of Foreign Ministers, while the Australian Governmentsuggested that the first step should be to establish clearly the Soviet. attitude by pressing the issue to a vote on the Far Eastern Corn-mission, the Commission being also asked to determine the levels of industry before detailed decisions on the allocation of repara-tions were made. In the last resort the Commonwealth Govern-ment would be ready to agree to the United States proposal.id) Was it not possible that, by the time the scheme producedfull results, ample supplies of butter would be available to relieve the present shortage of fats?The Minister of Food said that the prospective world shortageof fats was so great that there was no risk of our being unableto make effective use of this additional production.(e) The view was expressed that the success of this scheme would depend largely on management; and it was suggested thatfor this reason progress reports should be submitted to Ministersmore frequently than once a year.The Minister of Food undertook that, in the early stages, hewould submit more frequent progress reports to the Cabinet.(/) The &quot;necessary legislation would not be introduced in thepresent Session. It would assist the arrangement of the Legisla-tive Programme if it could be prepared in time for introductionat the beginning of the 1947-48 Session. The legislation might with advantage be framed in terms sufficiently wide to cover other similar schemes for Colonial development.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals outlined in CP.  (47) 4 and 10for the development of the large-scale production of ground nuts in East Africa.(2) Authorised  the  Minister  of  Food  to  make  an early announcement of this scheme in the form of a white paper.(3) Invited the Minister of Food to arrange for the necessary legislation to be prepared in time for its introductionat the outset of the 1947-48 Session of Parliament.
35cm. 3 (47)       2 2The Foreign Secretary pointed out that the disadvantages ofthe course proposed by the United States Government were thatit would impair the authority of the Commission and might have repercussions on our general relations with Russia. On the otherhand, it appeared to be the only means of permitting the desiresof the majority to prevail against the obstruction of the SovietGovernment, The balance of advantage seemed to be in favour ofacquiescing in the proposal of the United States Government.In discussion Ministers recalled the advantages of working in close accord with Dominion Governments in matters of foreignpolicy. As against the Australian proposal, however, it waspointed out that, if the matter were pressed to a vote on the far eastern Commission, the Soviet Government might exercise theirveto and this would prejudice the work of the Far Eastern Corn-mission even more seriously.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs suggested thatthis point should be put to the Australian Government as a reasonfor acquiescing in the United States proposal.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the reply to be returned to the United StatesGovernment should explain the political objections tothe course proposed by the United States Government,but should promise our support if, after considering these objections, they decided to proceed with their proposal. The reply should be on the lines of the draft in Annex B to CP. (47) 9 amended to take account of later developments and of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion.(2) Agreed that, before a reply on these lines was sent to theUnited States Government, the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs should send a further telegram to dominion Governments explaining why we proposed togive our support to the United States proposal in thelast resort ding, in particular, our apprehensionthat the authority of the Far Eastern Commission wouldbe further undermined if the Soviet Government felt obliged to invoke the veto over this reparations issue.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for India to send a similartelegram to the Government of India,Malta. 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum (CP. (47) 24)Constitution. submitted by the Lord Privy Seal, as Chairman of the colonial affairs Committee, covering the draft of a White Paper setting out proposals for a new constitution for Malta. A promise had beengiven in 1943 that after the war responsible government would be restored in Malta within the same sphere as between 1921 and 1933.Sir Harold MacMichael had therefore visited the Colony as Con-stitutional Commissioner to discuss the form of the new constitutionwith representatives of local opinion. His report, which was also attached to CP. (47) 24, and was to be published simultaneously with the White Paper, contained detailed proposals which were substantially acceptable to Maltese opinion. The Secretary of Statefor the Colonies submitted that Sir Harold MacMichael&apos;s proposals should be accepted, save on certain points, not of major importance,on which he suggested some modification, as set out in the draft white Paper.The Lord Privy Seal informed the Cabinet that the draft white paper had been considered by the Colonial Affairs Committee. Theyhad devoted particular attention to the powers which could beexercised by the United Kingdom Government in emergency. Theywere now satisfied on this point; and the draft White Paper hadbeen amended to make it clear that full power could be taken by theBritish Government in emergency.
The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he was anxious that the White Paper should be issued forthwith so that it mightbe available when the debate on the Malta (Reconstruction) Bill tookplace in the House of Commons on 24th January.The Cabinet-Authorised the Secretary of State for the Colonies topresent to Parliament a White Paper, in the terms of thedraft attached to CP.
