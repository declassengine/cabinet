Cyrenaica.(previous reference erence:CM, (47) 38thConclusions,Minute 4.)1. The Prime Minister said that, in accordance with theCabinet&apos;s conclusion of 22ncl April, the Foreign Secretary had nowdiscussed with the other Ministers concerned the expediency ofmaking a public statement about the long-term intentions of HisMajesty&apos;s Government in respect of Cyrenaica. They all agreedthat there would be undesirable international repercussions if anysuch statement were made before the proposed four-Power Corn-mission was sent out to Cyrenaica to ascertain the wishes of theinhabitants; and they recommended that the question of making such a public statement should be postponed indefinitely.The Cabinet Agreed that, unless circumstances changed, no public state-ment should be made about the long-term intentions ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government in respect of Cyrenaica.X/UUUXl  UtbOUIndies.(previous reference erence:CM. (46) 98thConclusions,Minute \J\2.   1 he crime Ministersee, in recent telegrams from our represaid that he had been disturbed totative in Batavia, indica-tions of increasing strain between the Dutch and the Indonesianleaders, The negotiations seemed to be making little progress andthere was some reason to suspect that the Dutch intended in theend to resort to armed force. Such an attempt to compel agreement by the use of troops would be violently resisted by the Republicans,and the Dutch would become involved in a war of re-conquest. Thepolitical and economic consequences for us would be so serious thatwe should spare no effort to dissuade the Dutch from adopting sucha policy. Politically, we should be criticised for having made sucha situation possible by keeping British forces in the Dutch east indies until Dutch troops could be brought in; and an armedconflict between the Dutch and the Indonesians was also boundto disturb our own relations with native populations throughoutSouth-East Asia. Economically, a war of re-conquest Avould delayfor years the development of food exports from the Dutch east indies which we were anxious to encourage in order to reduce oue independence on hard-currency countries.There- Avas general agreement that strong pressure should nowbe brought to bear on the Dutch Government to induce them to reachearly agreement Avith the Indonesian leaders and to put aside allthought of compelling their submission by force of arms.The Minister of State said that he had suggested to the foreign secretary that the United States Government might be asked tojoin with us in such an approach to the Dutch Government.The Cabinet -Took note that the Prime Minister would ask the foreign secretary to take an early opportunity of seeing the DutchAmbassador in London and impressing on him the urgent need for a prompIndonesian leaders.mctul settlement with thecoal.Imports.(previous reference erence:CM. (47) 34thConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister of fuel and Power (CP. (47) 159) and the Minister of State (CP. (47) 162)about a proposal, approved by the Fuel Committee on 16th April,that the European Coal Organisation should be asked to make an allocation of coal to the United Kingdom.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that there Avas no hopeof obtaining such an allocation for the second quarter of 1947, asall the supplies available had already been allocated to other coun-tries. No firm figures were yet available of the amounts of american and German coal which would be placed at Lhe disposal of theEuropean Coal Organisation during the third quarter. In theapplication submitted to the Organisation, the text of which was[33688-3] b 2
annexed to C.F. (47) 159, he had asked for an allocation of unto 400,000 tons a month (less any coal obtained from Poland underthe new commercial agreement), provided that the total amount of american coal available to the Organisation exceeded the second quarter&apos;s figure of 2-6 million tons a month. It was, however, forthe Foreign Office to advise how far this application should be pressed, as discussions with the French had shown that theirattitude would depend largely on our being able to meet their viewson the disposal of coal from the Saar and acceptance of these viewsmight have an adverse effect on coal production in the Ruhr. TheUnited States authorities had announced that they were makino- acertain amount of coal available for shipment to Europe outsidethe European Coal Organisation arrangements. The National coal board had advised against offering to purchase this coal, which was of poor quality and would cost about  8 a ton. Certain steel and cotton firms were trying to buy coal on their own account in theUnited States. He hoped the Cabinet would endorse the view thatall imports of coal should be handled by the National Coal Boardand should go into the general pool.The Minister of Fuel and Power added that the production of deep-mined and open-cast coal in the past week had exceeded4 million tons and that absenteeism had fallen to 8 per cent., whichwas the lowest level since 1938.The Minister of State said that the French request that weshould support a tripartite declaration to the European CoalOrganisation concerning the incorporation of the Saar in france for purposes of the coal allocation did not seem to be unreasonable.It would, however, be necessary for us to consult the United StatesGovernment before agreeing to it, and for this reason it would beimpossible to give the French Government satisfactory assurancesbefore the meeting of the Organisation on 21st May. It was there-fore proposed that we should tell the French Government that,though we saw no objection to their request in principle, we couldnot pursue it further until the questions of the Saar frontiers andthe reparations value of the Saar had been settled. The result-might be that our application for an allocation of coal wouldencounter considerable opposition in the European Coal Organisa-tion, and it would be undesirable to press it to the point of alienatingFrance and other Western European countries.The President of the Board of Trade, while agreeing with thisview, hoped that our application would not be withdrawn tooreadily.Other points made in the discussion were : (a) While it was expedient that all coal imports should be handled for the present by the National Coal Board, as proposed inparagraph 10 of OP. (47) 159, it was desirable that the board should take steps to obtain all the information they could from theprivate interests which were claiming that they could obtain coal from the United States.(b) Although the National Coal Board should continue to handleall imports of coal so long as coal supplies were rationed, so thatany coal imported could go into the general pool, it did not follow that after the period of shortage had passed the Board shouldcontinue to have a monopoly of coal imports.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that, while the United Kingdom representatives should do what they could to obtain from the european coal Organisation an allocation of United States coajfor the United Kingdom in the third quarter of 194 ^on the lines proposed in the Appendix to OP. (47) 159.the United Kingdom application should not be pressesin the face of serious opposition from the representativesof France and other countries;
(2) Agreed that no offer should be made to purchase the coal which the United States Government were making available for shipment to Europe outside the allocationsmade by the European Coal Organisation.Palestine.. Financial? Situation.(previous reference erence:CM. (46) 75thConclusions,Minute 1.)4.The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secre-tary of State for the Colonies (CP. (47) 161) on the financial effects of Jewish terrorism and other illegal activities in Palestine.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that the palestine government were concerned at the extent of the damage done byterrorists to public and private property, and the heavy cost of themeasures necessary to check disorder and illegal immigration. TheGovernment&apos;s annual expenditure on security measures was alreadyover  8 million in a Budget of  25 million, and it was likely toincrease. The Defence Committee had decided (D.O. (47) 7thMeeting) that the British Exchequer should not bear the cost ofthe arrangements for detaining illegal immigrants in Cyprus, and substantial expenditure on this account would also fall on thePalestine Government. The High Commissioner was examining thepossibilities of inroosins- additional taxation, though this would undoubtedly provoke Arab resentment. Meanwhile, he had raised the question of compensation for the damage to the Shell Company&apos;sinstallations at Haifa Bay. Although the Palestine Governmenthad not hitherto accepted responsibility for the payment of compensation for loss or damage caused by terrorists, the magnitude of the damage caused by this incident ( 400,000) was thought to warrantspecial treatment and it was proposed that an arrangement shouldbe made with the oil companies under which the proceeds of ageneral increase to local prices would be made available in part tothe Shell Company and in part for the development of backwardArab areas. The Cabinet should also be aware that the HighCommissioner had put forward a proposal for the establishmentof a general compensation fund by the arbitrary sequestration ofcertain Jewish communal funds. Recommendation on this question would be submitted to the Cabinet in due course.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the financial positionof the Palestine Government was not unduly serious. For thefinancial year 1948-47 they were likely to have a small surplus, inspite of special security expenditure of over  3 million. They had,moreover, an untouched balance of  3 million which could properly be drawn upon. The British taxpayer could not be expected toassume further burdens in respect of Palestine; and the localGovernment should lose no time in imposing additional taxation.There was no need or justification for taxation discriminatingbetween Jews and Arabs. He would deprecate the payment ofcompensation to the Shell Company which would place them ina favoured, position vis-a-vis other private interests in Palestine :it was reasonable to expect the company to have insured againstthe risk of terrorist damage.The Cabinet-(1) Asked the Secretary of State for the Colonies to informthe High Commissioner for Palestine that the palestine government should not look for further financial assis-tance from His Majesty&apos;s Government at the presenttime, and should take immediate steps to ensure a balanced budget by imposing additional measures ofgeneral taxation;(2) Decided that the High Commissioner for Palestine shouldnot be authorised to impose or approve any measures designed to provide special compensation for the Shellri^^,-__jlo,j______.__.____.1 i  j- _____i- at wGmpaixy  iui   me uama-ge uauscu uy   Msrrurists lu uxicijlHaifa Bay oil installations.
Expenses ofMembers ofLocalAuthorities.(previous reference:C.M.(46)44thConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Cabinet had before them a joint memorandum by theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Health(CP! (47) 156) seeking authority to announce that the Governmentwere in general agreement with the recommendations of the majority report of the Lindsay Committee on Expenses of Members of LocalAuthorities, a summary of which was annexed to the memorandum.The Minister of Health recalled that the Committee had beenappointed in pursuance of the Cabinet&apos;s decision of 9th May, 1946.Their recommendations had been approved by the Lord presidents committee (L.P. (47) 14th Meeting, Minute 1), subject to further examination of certain points of detail which he proposed to bring before that Committee at a later stage. He now proposed to publish the report and to state in the House of Commons on 22nd May, onbehalf of the Secretary of State for Scotland and himself, thatthe Government accepted the recommendation that local authoritiesshould provide for payments to Members, in appropriate cases andsubject to suitable safeguards, in respect of travelling expenses,subsistence and loss of remunerative time. He would also say thatthe Government were looking into the detailed provisions required and would take steps to- obtain the necessary legislative authority as soon as Parliamentary time permitted. This would, he hoped,be secured by a provision in the Block Grant and Rating and valuation Bill.In discussion it was oointed but that there mi ght be occasions when it would not be justifiable to pay allowances both for subsistence-tence and for loss of remunerative time. The Minister&apos;s statement should therefore avoid implying that both forms of allowance would always be payable.The Cabinet (1) Approved generally the recommendations of the majority report of the Lindsay Committee on the Expenses ofMembers of Local Authorities and authorised theMinister of Health to make a statement in the Houseof Commons on the lines which he proposed, subject toan adjustment of the wording to avoid implying that both subsistence allowances and allowances for loss of renumerative time would be payable on all occasions;(2) Took note that the Lord Presidents Committee would discuss further the detailed application of the recom-mendations.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,20th May, 1947.
