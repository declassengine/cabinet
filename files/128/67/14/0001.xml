CONFIDENTIAL1. THE PRIME MINISTER, on behalf of all members of the Cabinet,offered warm congratulations to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on thepresentation of his Budget the previous day.    Following the initial Pressand public reception to the Budget, Ministers now faced the importanttask of sustaining a clear and consistent presentation of the strategy andthe measures in the Budget.    The Paymaster General would arrange forthe circulation of speaking notes for all Ministers, and she hoped thatevery opportunity would be taken of putting acioss the Government case.The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House ofCommons during the following week.2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe crisis over the American hostages in Tehran was becoming moreacute: this could create problems for President Carter in the presentpolitical situation in the United States.    Meanwhile it was clear that theformer Shah was very gravely ill.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theBritish Olympic Association&apos;s decision to participate in the MoscowGames was regrettable.    The Secretary of State for the Environmentand he had tried vithout success to persuade the Chairman,Sir Denis Follows, that the Association&apos;s decision should at least bemade dependent not only on events in Afghanistan but also on the Gameshaving a genuinely international character.     The British athletes wouldnow be somewhat isolated if, as the United States Government expected,the American National Olympic Committee (NOC) decided on 12 Aprilagainst participation and were in due course followed by the Germanand French NOCs.THE HOME SECRETARY referred to Press reports of 26 March that theBritish Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) would give massive coverage tothe Moscow Olympics.    He had been assured that no such decision hadin fact been taken.     But the reports were known to have come from BBCsources; and it was clear that opinions within the Corporation weresharply divided on the matter.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that Jamaicawas in serious economic trouble, and difficult decisions might in duecourse be involved for Britain.    Negotiations between the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF) and Mr Manley&apos;s Government had broken down.The capable Minister of Finance and his deputy had resigned, and1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALMr Manley was becoming increasingly dependent on his party&apos;s pro-Cuban left wing.    Elections were due in October, and might well happensooner.    There seemed an even chance that they would be won by theOpposition under Mr Seaga.    If so, negotiations with the IMF would nodoubt be resumed; but economic aid would also be required and Britainwould need to participate in an international rescue operation. IfMr Manley won, it was improbable that anyone would bail him out. Heseemed unlikely to get much more support from Social DemocratGovernments in Europe.The Cabinet -Took ncte.3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that,after a cursory attempt at consultation, the Italian Presidency haddecided to postpone the European Council scheduled for 31 March-1 April.    We had indicated that we would not object provided that a newdate, within two or three weeks, could be fixed.    The most likoly datenow seemed to be 27-28 April; postponement until after the end of Aprilwould be unacceptable.    The Italian domestic crisis and the extent towhich it was preoccupying Signor Cossiga was a reasonable justixicationfor the postponement, but Signor Cossiga had clearly felt that theprospects for a European Council next week were poor.    So far theItalian Presidency had done very little towards finding a solution to theproblem of our net contribution to the Community budget, but it seemedthat Signor Cossiga, who appeared to have a good chance of forming anew Government soon, was anxious to be helpful.    While his chances ofmaking any significant advance during the next few weeks were dotibtful,we could not object to any attempt he mi&apos;ght make to secure somepreliminary agreement before the European Council met.In a brief discussion the following points were made -a.      The latest Commission document, to which reference hadbeen made in the House of Commons debate on 24 March,contained a more explicit statement of ways in which additionalCommunity expenditure could benefit the United Kingdom, and inthis sense was an advance on earlier documents.    It aleocontained the Commission&apos;s latest estimates which showed thatour net contribution in 1980 might be  1,12?- 1, 209 million.On the other hand, the document was not particularly helpful aboutthe duration of any settlement and, since it had not at the time ofthe debate been tabled, it would not be helpful to play up itsimportance in Parliament.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALb. The postponement of the European Council made it evenmore important to come as dose as possible to settling thebudget problem at that meeting,c. After prolonged debate, the European Parliament hadadopted a resolution on agricultural prices which had beenproposed by Italian Communist members.    It did not commit theEuropean Parliament to any particular increase in price levels.d. The forthcoming meeting with Chancellor Schmidt andHerr Genscher on 27-28 March would provide a useful opportunityfor further discussions on the problem of our net budgetcontribution as well as other issues.The Cabinet -Took note.4. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND saidthat the Conference on the future government of Northern Ireland hadadjourned on 24 March after 34 sessions during which the whole agendahad been covered at least once.    Its major achievement was that theGovernment and each of the three parties involved now knew where thenot insignificant areas of agreement lay; and, in areas of disagreement,where each party&apos;s position was immovable and where there might beroom for later compromise.    It was notable that all three party leadershad said as much when they appeared together on television on 24 March.There was a general expectation that the Government would make thenext move when the Conference came tot reconvene.    He would beconsulting the Cabinet on this, after preliminary discussions had takenplace in the Ministerial Group chaired by the Home Secretary.The Cabinet -Took note.3CONFIDENTIAL
l CONFIDENTIALL 5. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that a three-man inquiry had now been established, with the agreement of both sidesin the dispute.    The Chairman would be Lord Lever, and the othermembers would be Sir Richard Marsh and Mr William Keys.    It was forconsideration whether he should write or speak to the Chairman of theBritish Steel Corporation, restating the Government1 b position, whichremained that the previous cash limits established for the industiyshould not be exceeded.THE PRIME MINISTEP., summing up a brief discussion, said that it wasto be hoped that the dispute might now be in its final stages.    It was notclear what view the inquiry would form.   The Government&apos;s position wasalready on the record, and there was no need for the Government tovolunteer any evidence tc the inquiry.    If the inquiry sought Governmentevidence, it would be furnished with copies of Ministerial statements andof the relevant correspondence.    Beyond that, it was undesirable for theGovernment to make any further statement or to be drawn into theinquiry in any way.The Cabinet -1.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that there was apossibility of industrial action, at least by members of the Transportand General Workers&apos; Union, at British Leyland plants beginning on8 April.    The Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers, representingthe majority of the workforce, were however taking a more constructiveattitude.    It would be wrong for the Government to intervene.The Cabinet -2.      Took note.Cabinet Office27 March 1980CONFIDENTIAL4
