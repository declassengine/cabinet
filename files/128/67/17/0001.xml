CONFIDENTIALNTARY  1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.s THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said thatLegislation Committee had discussed the previous day a further problemin the progress of the Local Government, Planning and Land (No 2) Bill.Clause 106 of the Bill raised the statutory borrowing limit for the NewTowns.    The Development Corporations would exceed the present limiton 14 September, when they had to make interest payments of 150 million to the National Loan Fund.    The Local Government Billcould not become law until October.    Legislation Committee had beenassured that the Government could not make a special grant to the NewTowns in the expectation of later repayment, since that would betantamount to a loan and would breach - or at least be a palpable evasionof - the statutory borrowing limit.    There was no other way in whichmoney could properly be made available.    The rules of the House ofCommons precluded the withdrawal of Clause 106 and its replacement bya clause in the Housing Bill, which would become law in time, or by aone-clause Bill.    The only course was to lay before the House aninstruction to the Standing Committee considering the Local GovernmentBill to report Clause 106 in advance of the rest of the Bill.    It would thenbecome a separate Bill requiring Report and Third Reading in theCommons, but, as a money Bill, should not encounter difficulties in theLords.    The Standing Committee considering the Local Government Billwere at present likely to reach Clause 106 the following week, whereasthere was unlikely to be time available before the Whit sun Recess todebate the necessary instruction on the Floor of the House.    For thecourse proposed to be feasible, therefore, a Motion would have to bepassed in the Standing Committee altering the order in which theyconsidered the clauses in the Local Government Bill.    He and the ChiefWhip would do their best to see that the need to proceed separately withClause 106 did not impede the passage of other Bills required before theSummer Recess.    There was, however, a real risk that the Oppositionwould make capital out of the use of the procedure for splitting the Bill.In discussion concern was expressed about Parliamentary reaction to theprocedure suggested.    There were means for giving short-term financialassistance to private companies in financial difficulties, and the Cabinetneeded to be fully satisfied that there was no proper way of findingbridging finance for the New Towns for a period of less than two months.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the New Towns had to makepayments to private contractors as well as the payments due to theNational Loan Fund, and that for public bodies to default on theirfinancial obligations or for the Government to be seen to be advancingmoney to the New Towns in breach of a specific statutory limit would inthe end cause more Parliamentary criticism than the use of the proposed1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALprocedure.    There was no doubt about the power of the House to give aninstruction to a Standing Committee, although one in this precise formhad not been given since 1871.In further discussion it was agreed that it was not possible to solve theproblem by advancing the Local Government Bill at the expense of theHousing Bill, since that Bill contained provisions raising the borrowinglimits of the Housing Corporation, which also required to be enactedbefore September.    It was in any event now too late to make majorchanges in the order of priority of Bills agreed by the Cabinet in March.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that, though the procedure proposed was not attractive, itmight be the only means available of ensuring that the New Towns werenot forced into default.    It was desirable to test once again the advicethat the New Towns could not properly defer interest payments to theNational Loan Fund which were due in mid-September and that there wereno lawful means of providing bridging finance to the New Towns in theshort period between then and the end of the Parliamentary Session, TheCabinet recognised that the Local Government Bill could not become lawbefore the Summer Recess and that the rules of the House precluded theintroduction of a separate Bill to increase the borrowing limits of theNew Towns.    It was, however, most unsatisfactory that the problem,which had been identified several months earlier, had only that weekbeen brought before Legislation Committee; and that the Cabinet had notbeen made fully aware of the implications of their decision on the timingof the Local Government Bill.    The Chief Secretary, Treasury, shouldexamine urgently with the Secretary of State for the Environment thepossibility of enabling the New Towns to stay within their existingborrowing limits until the Bill received Royal Assent at the end of theSession.    If, as seemed likely, it was necessary to increase thestatutory borrowing limits of the New Towns before mid-September, theyagreed that Clause 106 should be separated from the rest of the LocalGovernment Bill by the procedure outlined by the Chancellor of the Duchyof Lancaster.    Time would have to be found to debate the necessaryinstruction to the Standing Committee and to secure the passage of theresultant Bill before the Summer Recess.The Cabinet -1.       Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for theEnvironment, to consider whether there was any wayof enabling the New Towns to remain within the presentIstatutory borrowing limits until the Local GovernmentBill received Royal Assent, by means wMch were bothlawful and did not involve a substantial increase inpublic expenditure; and to report urgently to the PrimeMinister and other Ministers concerned.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL2. If such means could not urgently be found, agreedthat Clause 106 of the Local Government, Planning andLand (No 2) Bill should be separated from that Bill andbrought to Royal Assent by the Summer Recess.3. Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,in consultation with the Secretary of State for theEnvironment and the Chief Whip, to make the necessaryarrangements with as little disruption as possible to thelegislative programme as a whole.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that he was under an obligation to talkfurther to Lord Wade about his Bill of Rights Bill, which sought to makethe European Convention on Human Rights part of our domestic law. Hehimself was on the whole in favour of such a Bill.    He had earlier toldthe House of Lords that there was no prospect of the Bill becoming lawthis Session, but he had undertaken to write to the other political partiesabout the holding of all-party talks.    The Liberal Party had respondedenthusiastically, but he had had no reply from the Labour Party. Inaddition to talks between the political parties, it was desirable that thereshould be interdepartmental discussion to see how a Bill of Rights wouldaffect domestic legislation, and to identify any real problems.    A Billmight be a possible candidate for the third Session of this Parliament.He proposed to see Lord Wade, whose Bill was now blocked in the Houseof Commons, to let him know that he was still pursuing an answer fromthe Labour Party and that, in any case, all-party talks on this subjectcould not take place before the conclusion of the all-party discussions onthe government of Scotland and on Northern Ireland.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theHome Secretary had indicated that, despite his personal views, he wasprepared to see his Department take the lead in examining with otherDepartments the implications of a Bill of Rights for existing legislation,and updating two earlier reports as necessary.    Departments should notbe burdened with a lot  f extra work, nor should matters of higherpriority be sacrificed.    Officials should, kowever, be asked to report toMinisters in due course on the questions requiring decision.    There wasno prospect of holding all-party talks until those on Scotland and NorthernIreland had been concluded; effectively that meant not before the nextSession.    Much would turn on the attitude of the Labour Party. Intalking to Lord Wade, the Lord Chancellor should explain how mattersstood on all-party talks, and counsel patience.    She would take the sameline in replying to Mr Alan Beith MP, who had written to her about thepresent Bill.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe Cabinet -4. Invited the Home Secretary to arrange forinterdepartmental consultation to take place on theeffect of a Bill of Rights on existing legislation, andfor officials to report to Ministers.5. Invited the Lord Chancellor to be guided by thePrime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion inhis further talks with Lord Wade.THE HOME SECRETARY said that he had now received a full reportfrom the Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset about the seriousdisorder that had taken place on 2 April in the St Paul&apos;s area of Bristol.The Chief Constable accepted that the police had made errors in theinitial stages of the incident but the Chief Constable&apos;s subsequentdecision to withdraw all police officers from the area for several hourshad been the only one open to him at the time.    Bristol City Council wasamong the organisations pressing for a full public inquiry.    Such aninquiry would be undesirable: the Chief Constable and the police wouldbe pilloried to no good purpose; there would be demands for substantialsums of Government money to be spent in the area, which he believedwas not necessary; a public inquiry would duplicate the on-the-spotinvestigation of the Sub-Committee on Race Relations and Immigration,who were determined to take evidence in Bristol into the background ofthe disturbances; and, more generally, the pressure to hold a publicinquiry into every controversial matter affecting the police ought to beresisted, not least because of the demands such inquiries made on thetime of senior judges.    Nevertheless, it was important to see whatconclusions could be drawn from the serious disturbances in Bristol.He proposed that the Home Office and the Association  f Chief PoliceOfficers should study the lessons the police might learn for the futureand that the conclusions of their study should be published. Inannouncing this to the House of Commons he would also welcome theinvestigation which the Sub-Committee on Race Relations and Immigra-tion proposed to make and the proposal of the Chairman of the CountyCouncil to hold a conference of all concerned locally, even though itmight not, in fact, achieve much.    He had secured the support ofMr Merlyn Rees, the Opposition spokesman for Home Affairs, for thisapproach and proposed, if the Cabinet agreed, to see all the localMembers of Parliament before making a statement in the House ofCommons the following week.    There would, undoubtedly, becriticism of the actions of the Chief Constable and of the decision not tohold a full public inquiry, but he thought the approach he suggestedprovided the best way forward.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe Cabinet -6.      Endorsed the proposals of the Secretary ofState for the Home Department and invited him, afterconsultation with the Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster, to make a statement on the lines he hadindicated in the House of Commons the following week.5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL2         THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat there appeared to be some chance that the Saudi reaction to theBritish television film on the executed Saudi Princess might not beextended beyond their request for the withdrawal of HM Ambassador,Planned Ministerial and Parliamentary visits to Saudi Arabia and theforthcoming State Visit of King Khalid to Britain had all been put off.It had been possible to get a proposed television film about the case ofMrs Penelope Arnott postponed.    If such a film were shown, it wouldbe likely to make her position in Saudi Arabia worse.    The televisioncompany who had produced the original film which had been offensiveto the Saudi Arabians had shown little concern for its possibleconsequences.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theDefence and Oversea Policy Committee would be considering indetail that afternoon the outcome of his meeting with CommunityForeign Ministers in Luxembourg on 22 April.   Some reduction inenthusiasm for economic sanctions had been shown by die French,West G jrman and Italian Governments when they realised that thesewould involve existing as well as new contracts. Neverthelessagreement had been reached.    The Government was now firmlycommitted to legislation by 17 May to implement the sanctions,should they then be decided to be necessary.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe position described by the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretarywas in accordance with the decision taken by the Cabinet at theirprevious meeting.    Although legal powers already existed to controlimports and exports, new legislation in the form of a short EnablingBill would be needed to control shipment of goods to Iran and newservice contracts.   Such legislation might face opposition frombackoenchers on both sides of the House, even though the officialOpposition had agreed to co-operate over it.    Nevertheless theGovernment had an inescapable commitment to pass such legislationby 17 May.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that hehad attended the independence ceremonies in Zimbabwe which hadgone off well.    He had, however, been concerned at the extent towhich Mr. Nkomo felt that he had been humiliated by being pushedinto the background, and by the refusal of middle ranking whiteofficers of the old Rhodesian Army to co-operate with the new forcesin Zimbabwe.   He was discussing with the Secretary of State forDefence the possible provision of a few more British officers toassist in the merger of the forces.6CONFIDENTIAL
confidentialTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that heexpected South Africa to send a temporising reply to the UnitedJ8 Nations (UN) Secretary General, Dr Waldheim, next week.    It waslce: not clear that this would satisfy the Front Line States.    The Iranianprecedent of applying economic sanctions without the backuig of as*ons&gt; formal UN resolution could well be embarrassing in this connection.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatBritain had agreed to accept a handful of the refugees who wished toescape from the Peruvian Embassy in Havana, as a gesture to balanceits readiness to accept refugees with left-wing sympathies from Chilein the past.    Further trouble in Cuba seemed likely.d Islands THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theMinister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Mr NicholasRidley) would be shortly visiting the Argentine for exploratorydiscussions on the future position of the Falkland Islands,    It wouldbe his aim not to allow any such discussion to reach a point at whicha decision would need to be taken.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that thereseemed to be a considerable risk that the forthcoming EuropeanCouncil might be interrupted by the funeral of President Tito, ashis death now seemed imminent.cGames THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theboycott of the Moscow Olympics now seemed to be going better. TheGerman National Olympic Committee (NOC) was likely to accept theirGovernment&apos;s advice not to go to Moscow and other countries such asFrance and Canada seemed likely to follow suit*    British athleteswere therefore being left in an increasingly isolated position. Itwould be timely to apply further pressure to the British NOC whensome more NOCs in other countries had formally declared theirintention not to go to Moscow.7confidential
SECRET3.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat, in preparation for die European Council in Luxembourg on27-28 April, there had been considerable discussion of the UnitedKingdom&apos;s Budget problem at meetings earlier in the week of theCouncil of Ministers (Finance) and the Council of Ministers (ForeignAffairs).    No real progress had been made on the central issuesremaining to be solved.    The French Foreign Minister had made anumber of unhelpful interventions and had circulated a tendentiousdraft about Community principles which the French Governmentwished to see endorsed.    These were predictable tactics whichwould not endear them to some of their partners.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthat a long session of the Council of Ministers (Agriculture) hadended in the early hours of that morning.    The French Minister ofAgriculture had tried to exert pressure on his colleagues to reachagreement on agricultural prices in advance of the forthcomingCouncil and much play had been made with the statement byPresident Giscard that there would be little prospect of progress onthe United Kingdom&apos;s budgetary problem if the Agriculture Ministersfailed to agree.    The Council had agreed to a document for theEuropean Council recording the different positions but the FrenchPermanent Representation in Brussels were now arguing that it wasunsuitable for submission to the European Council.   On substance,the French had set out their requirements including an averageincrease in agricultural prices for 1980-81 of 5 per cent. Thisfigure had been supported by the Belgians and the Irish.    The Italianshad proposed a 4c\ per cent average increase.    The others had refusedto go along with these figures but all member states apart from theUnited Kingdom were agreed that the average increase should behigher than the 2.4 per cent originally proposed by the Commission.No agreement had been reached on the co-responsibility levies to beapplied in the milk sector and there had been no discussion onsheepmeat.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said itseemed likely that the forthcoming European Council meeting wouldbe difficult.    No real progress had been made recently on an accept-able level for the United Kingdom&apos;s net contribution in 1980; nor on anadequate duration for the special arrangements for the UnitedKingdom or the possibility of adjusting amounts in future years so asto prevent the problem recurring.    But as compared with thesituation before the previous European Council meeting we had morecards in our hands through our ability to block progress on agricul-tural prices, sheepmeat and the 1980 Community Budget.    She woulduse these weapons in negotiation in order to try to achieve asatisfactory settlement.    Chancellor Schmidt was aware, and hadbeen telling our partners, that if no settlement was reached therewas a serious risk that the Government would decide to withhold8SECRET
