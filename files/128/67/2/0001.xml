It wasproposed to hold a debate on the crisis in South-West Asia onThursday 24 January and a debate on the role of nuclear weaponsin Britain&apos;s defence on Monday 28 January.10US ence:3) 1sttusions,te 1THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Lord Privy Seal would not return from his visits to Communitycapitals until late in the evening of Wednesday 23 January; to givehim time to prepare for the debate on South-West Asia, it shouldbe held on Monday 28 January.    The debate on the role of nuclearweapons in Britain&apos;s defence should be brought forward toThursday 24 January.The Cabinet -1. Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster to revise the business as indicated inthe Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of theirdiscussion.2. Noted that the Chancellor of the Exchequerwould open his Budget on Tuesday 25 March.osion at the THE HOME SECRETARY reported that there had been an explosionit Royal Hotel     that morning at the Mount Royal Hotel, Oxford Street.    One man,apparently of Near Eastern origin, who may have been handlingexplosives, had been killed, and a West German businessman hadbeen injured.    He did not propose to make a statement about theexplosion to the House, but might have to answer a Private NoticeQuestion.The Cabinet -3.        Took note.1confidential

Mr Nkomohad been conciliatory and co-operative since his return, and seemedto have more support outside his own tribal area than had beenexpected.    Mr Mugabe, who might now return on 19 January, wascausing more difficulty, not least by failing to release some70 detainees he was holding in Mozambique, who included potentialParliamentary candidates from other parties.    There waswidespread international criticism of the presence of South Africantroops inpide Rhodesia at Beitbridge; but in the Governor&apos;s view itwould not be possible at the present juncture to persuade General Wallsand the Rhodesian forces to agree to their withdrawal. TheRhodesians were also being difficult over retraining schemes forPatriotic Front forces which could help to relieve pressures in theassembly areas.    The European Community&apos;s agreement on a traderegime for Rhodesia was a welcome development.ugoslaviaTHE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the emergency meetings of theYugoslav Presidium and Central Committee, and the partialcancellation of army leave, were evidence of the country&apos;sapprehensions at the prospect that President Tito might not havelong to live.    The statements of support by the Prime Minister andother Western leaders were certain to have been very welcome.Direct Soviet intervention seemed unlikely, although afterAfghanistan it could not be ruled out; but the Russian*) wouldcertainly seek to achieve what they could by subversion. Theywould be assisted by Yugoslavia&apos;s fissiparous tendencies, and bythe weakness inherent in the arrangements for President Tito&apos;ssuccessors to hold office by rotation.randeviousleference::C(80)|stConclusions,vfinute 2THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the Security Council&apos;s Resolutionon sanctions had been vetoed by the &apos;Soviet Union and appeared tohave had little impact in Iran.    The Americans had announced thatthey would be implementing sanctions as if the Resolution had beenadopted and had asked Britain and their other principal allies to dothe same.    The Prime Minister and others had explained thedifficulties and dangers of that course, and there were some signs ofthe United States Government having second thoughts about theirpolicy in the light of events in Afghanistan.    But they remainedunder strong internal pressure.    At the same time there werereports, which were being investigated, that certain Americancompanies were circumventing the sanctions regime.confidential
confidentialIn the course of a brief discussion it was pointed out that it wouldnot be possible for Britain to agree to a trade boy-.ott, including anarms embargo, unless our partners were also prepared to agree.Particular difficulty was likely to arise over the fleet replenishmentship for the Iranian Navy which Swan Hunter would soon be ready todeliver.    Considerable expense would be involved if the Governmentrefused to allow this.    The French and Italian Governments, whofaced comparable problems, were being consulted.tan THE PRIME MINISTER said that on 16 January a meeting ofMinisters principally concerned had considered what measuresmight be taken against the Soviet Union in the light of the invasione: of Afghanistan and of the disappointing attitude of many of ourit partners at the North Atlantic Council and the European Community&apos;sons Foreign Affairs Council on 15 January.    The meeting had notedthe Community&apos;s satisfactory if unimportant decision not to undercutAmerican action by selling grain to the Soviet Union.    It haddecided that Britain should remain privately and publicly opposedto the subsidised sale of butter and of sugar, despite the potentialconsequences for Community expenditure.    The Commission&apos;saction in suspending the prefixation of export restitutions for butterhad ensured a temporary cessation of exports of subsidised butter;but the French and Irish in particular were in favour of continuingwith subsidised sales of butter to the Soviet Union, and a permanentcessation of sucn sales would add to the costs of the CommonAgricultural Policy and to the United Kingdom net budgetarycontribution.    The meeting had further agreed that the Anglo-Sovietcredit agreement should not be renewed when it expired inFebruary; and that we should study with our partners thepossibility of tightening the Co-ordinating Committee on theInternational Strategic Embargo (COCOM) rules on strategic exportsto the Soviet Union and of extending their scope to include morepotential exports of technology.    It was noted that it would be amajor propaganda victory for the Russians if the Olympic Gamestook place in Moscow as planned in spite of events in Afghanistan.Further consideration would therefore be given to how this mightbe prevented.    British action would need to be concerted with theAmericans and perhaps others, eg the Germans. Possibilitiesincluded approaching the Canadians about the availability ofMontreal as an alternative; urging the International OlympicCommittee to transfer the Games away from the Soviet Union,perhaps to several other sites; calling on British athletes and theBritish public to refuse to go to Moscow; and ensuring (preferablyin concert with other members of NATO) that no official visitorswent to Moscow in connection with the Games.The Cabinet -Took note.confidential

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that apart from thediscussions on Afghanistan and the Soviet Union, to which referencehad already been made, the Foreign Affairs Council on 15 Januaryhad agreed that negotiations for a trade agreement between theEuropean Economic Community (EEC) and Yogoslavia should bespeeded up.    The Council had also agreed, subject to consultationwith the European Parliament and with the Greeks, on a suitableregime for trade between the EEC and Rhodesia.    Before theCouncil meeting, he had met the Belgian Prime Minister and otherBelgian Ministers to discuss our budget problem.   Although theyhad been preoccupied with a Government crisis, the Belgian ForeignMinister had promised help to find a solution based on the final &apos;communique of the Dublin European Council.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthat the Commission had now decided to refer the French action onsheepmeat back to the European Court.    In these circumstanceshe would consider with the Lord Privy Seal whether it would be rightfor the United Kingdom to refuse to discuss sheepmeat at theforthcoming meeting of the Council of Ministers (Agriculture).THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Italian Prime Minister wouldbe visiting London at the end of the month.    She was not optimisticthat it would prove possible to hold a meeting of the European Councilearlier than the scheduled date at the end of March.    This wouldmean that the issue might not be settled before the Chancellor of theExchequer presented his Budget.    Our approach to the Communitybudget issue still rested on achieving the correction to our excesscontribution which had been discussed in Dublin; increasingCommunity spending in the United Kingdom in substitution for ourown public expenditure; and in the longer term restructuring theCommunity budget notably through reducing the cost of the CommonAgricultural Policy.   A more fundamental long-term reform wouldbe to change the basis of contributions by member states to relatethem to Gross National Product shares.The Cabinet -Took note.confidential
confidentialPRICES 4.        THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that hehad announced the previous day new financial targets for the gasand the electricity industries, in line with the decisions of theMinisterial Committee on Economic Strategy.    These new financialtargets implied large real price increases for gas over the nextthree years, and somewhat smaller increases for electricity, overand above the general level of inflation.    The early announcementof these increases had been designed to stem rising demand for gas,since at present prices related to other fuels demand was rising tolevels which the gas industry could not meet.    The timing of thestatement had been forced on him by premature disclosure of theGovernment&apos;s intentions.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe increases were inevitable and it was right that consumersshould be forewarned of Government decisions affecting their choiceof fuel.    Consideration was already being given to possible ways ofhelping the poorest consumers to meet rising energy costs.The Cabinet -Took note.5confidential
confidential&apos;ARTMENTALECT1/UyflTTEESvtioussrence:79| 6thelusionsute 55.        The Cabinet considered a memorandum (C(80) 1) by theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster on issues reised by the workof the new Departmental Select Committees.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said thatthe initial work of the Departmental Select Committees had givenrise to certain issues of general importance which requiredcollective Ministerial consideration.    These issues were:i. the wish of Select Committees to examine matterscovered by current legislation or otherwise likely to bedebated in the House;ii. requests for evidence that would disclose advicegiven to Ministers;iii. queries concerning the &quot;associated public bodies&quot;into whose activities the Committees may enquire.The formal powers of the new Committees were no greater thanthose of the former Select Committee on Expenditure, but the scopeof their activities would be wider.    The Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster considered that any problems which arose should so faras possible be dealt with either by informal discussion between thedepartmental Minister concerned and the particular SelectCommittee or between himself and the proposed Liaison Committee,of which chairmen of the Departmental Select Committees would bemembers.   Direct conflict between the Executive and the SelectCommittees should be avoided unless a major question of principlewas at stake.In discussion, the following points were made -a.        The Environment Select Committee were proposingto examine the sale of council houses, dealt with in theHousing Bill which would shortly go to Standing Committee.Such overlap had not been envisaged&apos;in the report of theProcedure Committee.    Select Committees should bediscouraged from examining matters d alt with in Bills duringthe course of their passage through the legislative process,and particularly when they were before a Standing Committee.It could be argued that the Select Committees had been set upto improve the Parliamentary scrutiny of government in itsexecutive capacity and that they should not examine mattersdealt with in legislation currently before Parliament. Thepotential for duplication, increased work-load and heightenedpolitical controversy would be greatest during the Standingconfidential
confidentialCommittee stage of a Bill.    The Chancellor of the Duchyof Lancaster should raise this with the Liaison Committeeas a general issue; it would also be appropriate for him,rather than the Secretary of State for the En/ironment, topursue the particular problem of the Housing Bill as aparticular case of the general rule, in the first instance withthe Chairman of the Liaison Committee and as necessarythereafter with the Chairman of the Environment SelectCommittee.b. Where a Select Committee sought evidence fromofficial witnesses about a statutory instrument or any othermatter likely to be debated in Parliament, the informationwas likely to be used in debate on the floor of the House;it would therefore be appropriate for Ministers to attendthe Committee for such hearings, so as to avoidinconsistencies and attempts tc extract information fromofficials for subsequent use against their Ministers in debate,c. Select Committees had powers to send for persons,paper3 and records, though they had no sub-poena powersto enforce their summonses to persons.    Generally theyleft it to Departments to decide which officials should giveevidence, though on occasion they asked for named officialsas witnesses.   A Minister could, if necessary, offer toattend himself, with or without officials.    Guidance toofficials, contained in a revised Memorandum which hadrecently been circulated to Ministers, suggested that officialsattended only as representatives and with the permission oftheir Ministers, and a Select Committee would not normallybe expected to press for the attendance of officials, or of anamed official, if the Minister himself undertook to attendIt was possible, however, that a Select Committee wouldtry to insist on the attendance of a named official; and it wasnot clear exactly what powers Select Committees had torequire the attendance of officials, or what rights Ministershad to attend themselves or to direct officials not to attendor not to answer certain questions.   A note of guidance forMinisters, agreed as necessary with the House authorities,should be prepared for consideration.d.        The Environment Committee had asked to see adocument, prepared during the time of the previousAdministration, about the sale of council houses which hadbe en leaked to the Press.    The Opposition spokesman hadsupported its release.   The records of a previousAdministration were the property of the Government of theconfidential
confidentialduy although by convention present Ministers did not haveaccess to them.    They could not therefore be releasedwithout the agreement of the Government of the day. Arepresentative of the former Administrati01. would normallybe consulted about any release; a document would not normallybe released without his consent, but he would not have theright to require or insist upon release.    There was generalagreement in the Cabinet upon the proposition that documentsof a former Admini strati on which had not been released orpublished during the period of that Administration should notas a rule be released or published by another Administrationthereafter, even at the request of the former Administration:only so could the politically selective release of records beavoided.    Refusal could be justified on the general basisthat the advice of officials given in confidence to previousor present Ministers should remain confidential.e. More generally, there should be no departure fromthe rules that the advice of the Law Officers to the Government,and the advice of officials to Ministers, including legal advice,should not be disclosed.f. The terms of reference of the Select Committeesextended to the &quot;associated public bodies&quot; of the Departmentsconcerned.    The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,during the procedure debate in June 1979, had avoided aprecise definition of what constituted an &quot;associated publicbody&quot;, but had suggested that it should be one for whichthere was a significant degree of Ministerial responsibility.It was for the Select Committees themselves, subject to theviews of the House, to interpret their terms of reference.Where Departments were asked by Select Committees toprovide lists of associated public bodies, they could take intoaccount the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster&apos;s definition,the lists contained in Sir Leo Pliatzky&apos;s report on non-departmental public bodies and the extent to which Ministersanswered questions about bodies of this kind in Parliament.The Home Affairs Select Committee were showing signs oftrying to interest themselves in the affairs of the SecurityService.    Ministers did not answer Questions in Parliamentabout security and intelligence matters, ana it would bewrong for them to give information to Departmental SelectCommittees about them.    Agencies concerned with suchmatters should not be listed as associated public bodies.It was for consideration whether police forces should beregarded as associated public bodies of the Home, Scottishand Northern Ireland Offices.    It was pointed out that8confidential
CLief Constables were appointed (except for the Commissionerof Police of the Metropolis) by local police authorities andwere not responsible to the Government or to Parliamentfor operational matters.    They should not be listed asassociated public bodies.g.        It would be best for Departmental Ministers not tonegotiate further with their Select Committees on the generalmatters covered by the Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster&apos;s memorandum.    Discussions should take placebetween the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and theLiaison Committee as soon as it had been established. Theproblem that had arisen about the release of documents ofthe previous Administration on council house sales to theEnvironment Select Committee should be handled in the sameway, since it raised a general issue of principle, and it couldbe politically invidious for the Secretary of State for theEnvironment to take up a particular case with the Chairmanof the Environment Select Committee.   In bringing to thenotice of the Liaison Committee questions of duplication onBills in Standing Committee, the Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster should also point to the need to avoid any overlapbetween the work of Select Committees and the work of thePublic Accounts Committee.    It would be useful for theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the Chief Whip tokeep in touch, through the chairman of the LiaisonCommittee, with the Conservative chairmen and the majorityleaders on the Select Committees as the need arose.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said mat theCabinet agreed that Departmental Select Committees should bediscouraged from examining matters covered by Bills which hadreceived a Second Reading, and particularly while they were beingexamined by a Standing Committee,    The principle that the adviceof the Law Officers and official advice to Ministers is confidentialshould be maintained.    Papers of a previous Administration whichhad not been disclosed or published during the period of thatAdministration should not as a rule be disclosed to SelectCommittees.   Departments requested to provide lists of theirassociated public bodies should take account of the points made inthe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster&apos;s memorandum and indiscussion when preparing them.    The Chancellor of the Duchyshould discuss the various issues with the Liaison Committee. IfMinisters experienced further problems with Select Committees,they should be brought to the notice of the Chancellor of the Duchy,so that he could raise them with the Liaison Committee.9confidential
confidentialThe Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2. Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy- ofLancaster to be guided accordingly, taking accountof the points made in discussion, in his discussionswith the Chairman of the Liaison Committee.3. Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster to enter into discussions with theChairman of the Liaison Committee, and if necessarywith the Chairman of the Environment SelectCommittee, with a view to discouraging theEnvironment Select Committee from discussingmatters covered in the Housing Bill while that Billwas in Standing Committee, and to explaining whythe Government did not propose to accede to theSelect Committee&apos;s request for the release ofdocuments of the previous Administration relatingto council house sales, in accordance with theprinciple agreed by the Cabinet in the course ofthe discussion.4. Took note that the Prime Minister wouldconsider whether any further guidance was calledfor on the question of releasing documents ofprevious Administrations.5. Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster, after consultation with the Houseauthorities, to prepare for consideration by theCabinet a memorandum of guidance for Ministerson the powers of Select Committees to summonofficials in relation to the rights of Ministers todetermine who should represent their Departments,and to summon members of the House of Lordsand other non-goverm ntaJ witnesses.10confidential
confidentialSL STRIKEiousfence:10) 1stlusicjns,te 56. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said thatPress reports of the effects of the strike had been exaggerated.Supplies of steel from the private sector of the industry and *romstock holders were generally moving fairly freely.    Some userscould, however, soon begin to experience (or at least, to foreseethe imminence of) difficulties.    The British Steel Corporation (BSC)were now planning to circularise all their workers with full detailsof the pay offer already made.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that theAdvisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) were stillengaged in talks with both parties.    No fresh developments wereexpected until the following week, when there might be anopportunity for movement.THE HOME SECRETARY said that there were signs of some slightincreases in the level of picketing, but the police had the situationwell under control.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Government would continue to keep the situation under review,but that no intervention was necessary at this stage.    The leadersof the two main unions concerned had asked to see her.    It was herpractice never to refuse such requests, but, with the Cabinet&apos;sagreement, she would ask the two leaders to see the Secretariesof State for Industry and fox Employment first.The Cabinet -Agreed to resume their discussion of thesteel strike at a future meeting as necessary.7.        THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT saidthat the local authority manual workers&apos; pay settlement was likelyto be agreed the following day, at an acceptable figure. Followingthis, pay negotiations in the water industry, which had hithertobeen kept moving slowly, would be resumed.    A settlement herewas likely to involve uncomfortably large pay increases, becauseof the undertakings given the previous year about comparabilitybetween the water industry and workers in gas and electricity.The water industry was not labour-intensive, however, and thecosts were likely to be containable within the approved cash limitswithout serious implications for charges.    At the same time therewere signs of rising militancy in the industry, and there was athreat of industrial action if an early settlement was not reached.11confidential
confidentialTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet took note of the situation.   A water st:?ike would posea serious threat to the life of the community, and the CivilContingencies Unit should again review the state of preparations todeal with the effects of industrial action.The Cabinet -Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for theCivil Contingencies Unit to review again thestate of preparations against the possibility ofindustrial action in the water industry.Cabinet Office17 January 198012confidential
