CONFIDENTIALENTARY       *  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.1CONFIDENTIALTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that theHigh Court had held that the directions he had given in August 1979under Section 86 of the National Health Service Act 1977 appointingCommissioners to manage the affairs of die Lambeth, Southwarkand Lewisham Area Health Authority were invalid.   He hadconcluded, after consultation with the Attorney General, that theprospects of success were not sufficiently good to justify appealingagainst the judgment.   Nor would it be possible to make furtherdirections enabling the Commissioners to continue to act until theend of March, since such directions could be given only in anemergency, and the present situation did not constitute an emergency.He therefore proposed to make arrangements for a rapid but orderlytransfer of responsibility hack to the members of the HealthAuthority.   He had already discussed with the chairmen of theCommissioners and the Health Authority how this might be done.He would need to do all that was possible within the powers givenhim under existing legislation to ensure that the Authority keptwithin the cash limits which they had previously been unwilling toaccept.   His actions on this point would be watched closely by otherHealth Authorities in London.    New powers requiring authoritiesto stick to their cash limits were contained in the Health ServicesBill now before Parliament*    The High Court judgment meant notonly that the appointment of the Commissioners was invalid but thatthe actions they had taken were now open to legal challenge. Theyhad, for example, recruited staff and entered into commercialcontracts.   A Bill would need to be passed quickly to validate theiractions.   He had considered including in such a Bill the new powersrequiring Health Authorities to observe their cash limits; but haddecided not to do so in the interests of securing its speedy passage.It was possible that the three London Borough Councils would applyto the court tomorrow for a writ of certiorari.   His Counsel coulduse the occasion, if necessary, to say that he was not proposing toappeal.   He him oel.C could make a statement in the House on Monday3 March announcing, inter alia, the Government&apos;s intention to introducea validation Bill.    He very twich regretted that the action he hadtaken on departmental legal advice to secure adequate financialcontrol over spending in the Health Authority&apos;s area had, in theevent, created an embarrassing situation for the Government.THE ATTORNEY GENERAL said that the Secretary of State forSocial Services was entitled to take reasonable time to decidewhether or not to appeal.   He confirmed that the prospects ofsuccess were not good and that further directions under Section 86,in the absence of an emergency, would be open to challenge. Inthe event of court proceedings the following day it would be open to1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.
CONFIDENTIALthe Secretary of State&apos;s Counsel to state what the Government&apos;sintentions were.    He had no doubt that, in the absence of an appeal,,an early validation Bill would be necessary to safeguard thosewith whom the Commissioners had entered into contracts and alsothe position of the Commissioners themselves unless the HealthAuthority were willing (as they might well not be) to give priorundertakings to accept what they had done.In discussion, there was general support for the action theSecretary of State proposed to take.    The hope was expressed thatany court proceedings the following morning would not result indemands for an immediate Parliamentary statement which wouldinterrupt the proceedings on the Abortion (Amendment) Bill. Thebusiness announced for the House of Commons the following weekcould be rearranged to make time for the proposed validationmeasure.    The Opposition would seek to make maximum capitalout of the court&apos;s judgment, but it should be possible to obtainthrough the usual channels their agreement to the speedy passageof legislation.    Debate in the House of Lords would have to befitted into a timetable that was already congested because of theneed for the Education (No. 2) Bill to become law before Easter.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Secretary of State for Social Services shouldaccept the judgment of the court and make the best possiblearrangements for the early and orderly transfer of responsibility tothe Lambeth, Southwark and Lewisham Area Health Authority.If necessary, the decision not to appeal against the Hgh Courtjudgment could be announced in any court proceedings the followingday.    The Cabinet accepted that an immediate Bill would be neededto validate the actions taken by the Commissioners during theirperiod of responsibility.    It should be drafted as soon as possiblewith a view to early introduction.    The Secretary of State forSocial Services should make a statement to the House of Commonson Monday, 3 March.The Cabinet -1. Took note that it would not be advisable to appealagainst the decision of the High Court that the appointmentof Commissioners to manage the affairs of the Lambeth,Southwark and Lewisham Area Health Authority had beeninvalid.2. Noted that the Secretary of State for Social Serviceswould arrange for the members of the Health Authority toresume responsibility as early as practicable.2CONFIDENTIAL

Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services,in consultation with the Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster, to make a statement in the House of Commonson Monday, 3 March, and to arrange for the earlyintroduction of a Bill to validate the actions of theCommissioners,5. Agreed that Parliamentary Counsel should beauthorised forthwith to draft the validation Bill.3CONFIDENTIALTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that .Mr Gordon Wilson, MP, would seek leave on 4 March to introducea ten-minute rule Bill to establish an elected Convention in Scotlandwhich would draw up proposals for the Government of Scotland by anelected Assembly.    It was the normal practice for die Governmentnot to oppose the introduction of ten-minute rule Bills but to ensurethat their further progress was blocked.    He understood, however,that Mr Tarn Dalyell, MP, would speak against the Motion, andGovernment backbenchers from Scotland thought that the Bill shouldbe opposed.    In his view the Government should arrange for theMotion to be defeated.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that, if Government backbenchers from Scotlandwere determined to vote against Mr Wilson&apos;s Motion, the Chief Whipshould take the necessary steps to ensure that the Motion wasdefeated.it*The Cabinet -6,      Invited the Chief Whip to arrange for theMotion to give leave to introduce a Government ofScotland (Scottish Convention) Bill to be defeated.
confidential2.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat, following the European Community&apos;s endorsement of the Britishinitiative on the neutrality of Afghanistan, detailed proposals werecurrently being examined by a meeting in Rome of officials of theNine.   The attitude of the French might give rise to difficulty.Meanwhile there were certain pointers - President Brezhnev&apos;srecent speech, his interview with Mr Hammer, President ofOccidental Petroleum, and a report in the Evening News for28 February - to the possibility that the Russians might be interestedin the idea.    It was not clear whether their interest was genuine ormerely a diversionary tactic to mitigate international hostility overeg the Olympic Games.   Increasing unrest in Afghanistan might inary case make it harder for the Russians to withdraw their troopseven if they wanted to do so.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that votingin Rhodesia was proceeding satisfactorily and even with something ofa festive air.    Despite the intimidation which had occurred duringthe campaign, the elections would probably represent as fair anexpression of the electorate&apos;s views as was possible.    The presenceof British policemen at polling stations had helped to establish theconfidence of voters in the secrecy of the ballot; it was unfortunatein that context that a British television reporter should have beenshown asking Rhodesians outside a polling station how they had voted.The Governor was doing all he could to provide suitable facilities forthe various international observers, including the BritishParliamentary delegation who had been showing some signs ofdissatisfaction with their treatment.    The outcome of the electionswas impossible to predict.    If Mr Mugabe&apos;s party won the largestnumber of seats, the crucial question would be what kind of coalitionMr Nkomo would be willing to form.    There would be strongpressure from other African States for him to join with Mr Mugabe,but his personal inclinations might be more in favour of a&apos; coalitionwith Bishop Muzorewa and the white representatives, which he mighthope to dominate.   A coalition between all the parties was also apossibility.   The situation had been complicated by Mr Mugabe&apos;sabrupt departure from Rhodesia the previous day.    He had not beensummoned to see President Machel of Mozambique, as originallysupposed, and might have acted out of fear for his personal safety.Efforts were being made to persuade him to return, not least so thathe could as planned help maintain calm among his armed supportersin their assembly areas.    Internationally, President Nyerere ofTanzania had overreached himself by his apparent unwillingness toaccept as fair any result other than a Patriotic Front victory; and atthe recent meeting of the Front Line States he had had to agree to aconfidential
identialvery mildly-worded communique.    The United States Governmenthad issued a most helpful statement.    But the Australian Government&apos;sattitude had been less constructive.    Surprisingly, there had been asuccessful meeting between General Walls and President Machel;and even some contact between Mr Mugabe and the South Africans.The Cabinet -Took note.5confidential3.        THE PRIME MINISTER said that, contrary to newspaperreports, she had had a successful discussion with the Federal GermanChancellor on 25 February.    Herr Schmidt&apos;s main concern had beenwith East-West relations but he was anxious for an early settlementof our Budget issue.    He envisaged a Summit meeting at which otheroutstanding questions particularly fisheries and sheepmeat wouldalso be settled.    Chancellor Schmidt was also very keen that theUnited Kingdom should join the exchange rate mechanism of theEuropean Monetary System (EMS), and she had asked the Treasuryfor a further study.    He also wanted the United Kingdom to take theinitiative in calling for reform of the Common Agricultural Policy(CAP): an initiative which would hardly be welcomed by the FrenchGove ram ent.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said therehad also been talks with other German Ministers on the Budgetissue; he had met the Luxembourg Foreign Minister and would beseeing the Belgian and Irish Foreign Ministers in the following week.The French were trying to exploit the Prime Minister&apos;s remarksduring the BBC Panorama interview about the possibility ofwithholding our Budget contribution.I&apos;MIn a brief discussion reference was made to President Giscard&apos;srecent television interview at which he had explicitly linked theUnited Kingdom Budget problem with CAP prices, fisheries andsheepmeat.    It was clear that the French and Germans were workingclosely together.    French tactics were irritating, but we should notover-react. It was not envisaged that the consequences of furtherenlargement of the Community should be included in the discussionsat this stage, although it would pose problems for the existingmembers.
CONFIDENTIAL6CONFIDENTIALTHE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthat he had discussed the latest Commission initiative with theLord Privy Seal and proposed to take the line that interimarrangements following the French removal of their illegal importrestrictions and pending negotiation of a Community sheepmeatregime would be acceptable only if the Community finance madeavailable to the French was not spent on intervention measuresand the French made it clear that they would never revert toillegal import restrictions in the future.    We should have to acceptthat this put us into a minority at the forthcoming Council ofMinisters (Agriculture), with other member States favouring aninterim solution along the lines suggested by the Commission.The Cabinet -Took note.

The Cabinet considered two memoranda by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C(80) 14 and 16) and a memorandum by theMinister of State, Civil Service Department (C(80) 15) about cashlimits for 1980-81 and the 1980 pay settlement for the non-industrialCivil Service.The Cabinet&apos;s discussion and detailed conclusions have beenseparately recorded.The Cabinet -
secretAND PERSONALPS(80) 3Cabinet Office,Whitehall,London, SW1.7th March, 1980Dear Private Secretary,Pay Research and Cash LimitsIt has been agreed that we should in certain respects enlarge uponthe conclusions recorded on this subject in CC(80) 8th Conclusions, Minute 4.As recorded, the Cabinet agreed upon the basis on which theMinister of State, Civil Service Department should conduct negotiationswith the National Staff Side on the Civil Service pay settlement due from1 April 1980.    They also agreed upon a cash limit for the Estimate forthe Civil Service pay vote for 1980-81.The Cabinet further agreed that, in so far as the cost of the outcomeof the negotiations on the amount and timing of payment of the pay increasesexceeded what would be provided for in the Estimate, the savings requiredshould be achieved by further manpower reductions.    It was thought thatreductions totalling 2j per cent should be manageable.    Ministers in chargeof Departments were invited to give immediate consideration to the meansof reducing the costs of manpower in their Departments by 2 to 2j per centin 1980-81.    The Cabinet recognised that some Departments would findsavings of this order easier to achieve than others, and that the savingsneed not be uniformly distributed among Departments; but, if someDepartments were to reduce by less than the average, others would needto reduce by more.    The Cabinet invited the Minister of State, CivilService Department, to discuss with his colleagues in charge ofDepartments how to achieve the necessary reductions, and to circulateproposals in due course.I am sending copies of this letter to the Private Secretaries of allmembers of the Cabinet.Yours sincerely,(Signed) D.J.

secret MENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCOPY NOCABINETNO CIRCULATION ANNEXCC(80) 8th Conclusions, Minute 4Thursday 28 February 1980 at 10. 30 amsecretThe Cabinet considered two memoranda by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C(3C) 14 and 16), and a memorandum by the Minister ofState, Civil Service Department (C(80) 15) about cash limits for1980-81 and the 1980 pay settlement for the son-industrial CivilService.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that his first paper(C(80) 14) dealt with the cash limits which had already been establishedfor all central Government expenditure except Civil Service pay, andfor the Rate Support Grant and external financing limits of thenationalised industries.   It concluded that, although the maintenanceof these limits would apply a volume squeeze of between3 and 3. 5 per cent on the expenditure concerned, the limits should bestrictly observed.    This conclusion had been endorsed by the Groupof Ministers (MISC 38) which had recently been considering thesematters.    The second paper (C(80) 16), which had been discussed bythe same Group, considered the problems presented by the resultsof pay research for the non-industrial Civil Service, which indicateda settlement of around 18.75 per cent on average, after making theincreased deduction for the value of index-linked pension rightsnow recommended by the Government Actuary.   If a cash limitallowing for 14 per cent increase in costs were set for the CivilService vote, in line with those already approved for other services,there would be a gap of over 4 per cent to be bridged.    This wouldrequire a combination of tough negotiation on the amounts of the paysettlement, of some staging of the pay settlement, and of reductionsin manpower.    Various permutations of these were possible. TheMinisters concerned had also agreed that there should be a furtherreview of the principle of comparability and the machinery of payresearch; and that management information systems already underdevelopment, by the Civil Service Department, should be furtherimproved, with the assistance of Sir Derek Rayner, to help Ministersto control their own Departmental numbers and costs.1
secretTHE MINISTER OF STATE, CIVIL SERVICE DEPARTMENT, saidthat the review of pay research was a long-term project.   It was notpossible to depart from the present pay negotiating machinerywithout provoking immediate and far-reaching industrial action. Ifcolleagues wished to avoid this, and to maintain a 14 per cent cashlimit for the Civil Service vote, they would have to be prepared tomake considerable reductions in manpower, on top of those alreadyagreed in earlier discussions.    There was a strong case for suchreductions.    They were politically desirable, they would demonstratethat the Government meant business over containing the costs andimproving the efficiency of central Government, and they were likelyto be less strenuously opposed by the Civil Service trade unions thanany other course.    Those Ministers he had consulted wereunderstandably concerned about the possible effects on theirDepartments&apos; activities; but the effects of a long strike would beeven more damaging.    He therefore recommended that the mainburden of adjustment should be found by reductions in manpower.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Civil Service unions had calledto see her and the Minister of State, Civil Service Department, theprevious day.    It had been clear that they gave first priority toreaching an acceptable pay settlement based on the pay researchevidence and maintaining the existing negotiating machinery,including arbitration.   They appeared prepared for furthermanpower reductions, and wished to avoid precipitating industrialaction.   The Head of the Civil Service had assured her that he wasconvinced that there was still scope for further reductions of up to3 per cent in the cost of Civil Service manpower in 1980-81.In discussion, the following main points were made -a. The evidence produced by the Pay Research Unitwas a basis for negotiation, not an award.    The evidencepointed to a range of increases, varying between grades,and benefiting particularly groups of staff where skills werein short supply.    The largest groups in the Service wouldreceive the smaller increases, and this helped to keep downthe average increase in the wage bill.b. The increases indicated by the pay research evidencewere unacceptably large.    They would do great damage tothe Government&apos;s strategy of containing wage inflation.They would give renewed currency to the idea that peoplewere entitled to automatic compensation for price increases,even at a time when gross national product was likely to fall.Other groups in the public sector had been persuaded,through the discipline of cash limits, to settle at a much lowerlevel.    For these reasons the Government should seek toreduce the overall cost of the settlement by at least 2 per cent.secret
secretc. Any attempt to insist upon a settlement substantiallybelow the levels suggested by the pay research evidence wouldresult in the Official Side being taken to arbitration, whichthey would certainly lose.   The only way of avoiding this wasto refuse arbitration in advance.    This would precipitateimmediate and damaging industrial action, which would bewidespread and would extend to sensitive groups like prisonofficers and computer staff responsible for paying pensions.In the longer term, it would help the militants to take overthe Civil Service unions and to achieve their objective ofsubstituting direct confrontation on pay for the disciplinesof the present negotiating machinery.d. There was more hope of persuading the unions toaccept a degree of staging which could reduce the totalaverage cost over the year.    Various possible stagingformulae were available.   Such an approach would bepublicly defensible.    It could be argued that staging, byestablishing higher eventual rates of pay, simply raised thebase for further claims the following year; but this shouldnot be the case in the Civil Service because pay researchproceeded by comparisons with outside analogues.e. Some part of the cost would have to be met byreductions in manpower.    These would come on top of cutsalready agreed by the Cabinet.    It was argued that it wouldbe very damaging to efficiency and morale to go on seekingmanpower cuts in this way.    Many Departments were,however, still below authorised complement, and should thusbe able to find further cuts without too much difficulty. SomeDepartments&apos; staff needs were demand-led, and could noteasily be further reduced: for instance, further reductionsin the local offices of the Department of Health and SocialSecurity would put at risk the Government&apos;s anti-fraud policyand the payment of benefits.    Other Departments, like theMinistry of Defence, were committed to a particular level ofeffort, and could not easily find further manpower savings inthe short term, though studies already in hand in the Ministryof Defence would yield further savings in due course.f. An average reduction of as much as 3 per cent in thecost of manpower over the year would imply cuts of5 or 6 per cent by the end of the year.    Despite the highnatural wastage and retirement rate, cuts of this scale couldbe found only by redundancy or by enforced transfer. Bothwere costly and would increase the total pay bill for the yearin question.    More modest manpower cuts should however bepracticable and would be more easily accepted by the unionsagainst the background of a relatively generous pay settlement.3secret
secretg. Manpower cuts were politically more acceptable thana breach in the Pay Agreement for which, in any case, sixmonths notice of termination was required.    The Governmentwas committed to a policy of paying people properly butinsisting upon an efficient and cost-conscious public service.There was no doubt that further manpower reductions couldbe made without loss of efficiency.    Cuts should therefore beapplied as widely and as uniformly as circumstancesallowed.    Some specialist groups, like prison officers,could not be further cut but other previously exempt groups,including those providing supporting services in the law andorder field, should be stringently re-examined.h. Despite the care with which pay research comparisonswere made, there was considerable doubt whether the resultswere in fact representative, or whether the principle ofcomparability could any longer be sustained.   A furtherreview of the pay research machine, and of the future ofthe Standing Commission on Pay Comparability, was thereforenecessary.    This was a longer term problem, which shouldnot be introduced into the present pay negotiations, but whichshould be reconsidered by Ministers in time, if necessary,to end the present Pay Agreement before the next round ofnegotiations began.i. There was insufficient information available toMinisters to allow them to impose manpower reductionssensibly or to monitor the performance of their Departments.The Civil Service Department have already begun work ondesigning suitable information systems.    This should becarried further, in consultation with Sir Derek Rayner.j.        Any premature disclosure of the Cabinet&apos;s decisionsor of the Government&apos;s negotiating position would prejudicethe negotiating position of the Minister of State, Civil ServiceDepartment.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the cash limits which had already been approvedfor 1980-81 should not be reopened.    The Minister of Transportshould discuss with the Chief Secretary, Treasury, the particularproblems this would cause for the road programme.    Cabinet agreedthat the cash limit for the central Civil Service vote should be set ata level which allowed for a 14 per cent increase in the cost of theCivil Service,    They noted that the evidence from the Pay ResearchUnit reports indicated a pay increase of around 18.75 per cent onaverage.    They agreed that expenditure would have to be broughtwithin the cash limit by a combination of tight negotiations on pay,4secret
secretstaging of the pay increases and reductions in manpower. Theprecise balance between the three would depend on the outcome ofthe pay negotiations, but the Cabinet accepted that it would benecessary to achieve by means of manpower cuts whatever part ofthe necessary reduction in costs could not be achieved by hardbargaining on the amount and staging of the pay increases. Inconducting the negotiations the Minister of State, Civil ServiceDepartment, should seek to avoid a breakdown which might make itnecessary for the Government to refuse arbitration.    The Cabinetwere anxious to avoid such a course and the industrial action whichmight follow it.   Within that overall limitation the Minister of State,Civil Service Department, should negotiate as tightly as possible onthe amounts of the pay increases.    On the assumption that therewould remain a difference of about four percentage points betweenthe cost of the pay increases at present staff numbers and the cashlimit, the balance of view In the Cabinet favoured looking more tomanpower reductions than to staging to cover it.   A reduction of3 per cent by way of manpower reductions might be too stiff, but2f per cent should be manageable.    It should therefore be theobjective of negotiations to conclude an agreement on the amountand staging of the pay settlement so as to leave not less than 2 andnot more than Z\ percentage points to be found by manpowerreductions.    The Cabinet recognised that some Departments wouldfind savings of this order easier to achieve than others; the savingsneed not be uniformly distributed among Departments. TheMinister of State, Civil Service Department, should prepareproposals for achieving the necessary reductions once the outcomeof the pay negotiations was known.    It was particularly importantthat absolute secrecy should be maintained on the Government&apos;sdecisions while the negotiations were in train. Neverthelessindividual Ministers should give urgent consideration to the waysin which further reductions in staff could be found in theirDepartments.    The Cabinet also agreed that the future of the payresearch system, and of the comparability principle in public servicepay determination, should be reviewed.   It was also agreed thatimproved management information systems were needed to helpMinisters control departmental staff costs.The Cabinet -1, Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2. Agreed that the public sector cash limitsalready approved, and listed in sub-paragraphs 1-4of paragraph 2 of C(80) 14, should be maintained.5secret
3. Invited the Minister of Transport todiscuss with the Chief Secretary, Treasury,the particular problem of the road programmefor that year.4. Agreed that the cash limit fer the Civil ServiceVote for 1980-81 should be sat at a level which impliedan increase of 14 per cent in the cost of earnings as aresult of now settlements.5. Invited the Minister of State, Civil ServiceDepartment, to negotiate on the 1980 paysettlement for the non-industrial Civil Service onthe basis of and with the aims described in thePrime Minister&apos;s summing up.6. Agreed that the balance of the requiredsavings, over and above what could be realisedby hard bargaining on the amounts and staging ofthe pay increases, should be achieved by furthermanpower reductions, which should in any caseaverage at least 2 per cent over the Civil Serviceas a whole.7. Invited the Minister of State, Civil ServiceDepartment, to circulate proposals for achieving thenecessary reductions in due course.8. Invited all Ministers in charge of Departmentsto give immediate consideration to the means ofreducing the costs of manpower in their Departmentsby 2 to 2| per cent in 1980-81.9. Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for Employmentand the Minister of State, Civil Service Department,once the current pay negotiations had been concluded,to arrange for officials to carry out a complete reviewof the pay research system and of the comparabilityprinciple in public service pay determination, andto bring proposals before them before the summer Recess.10.
