CONFIDENTIALNTARY 1.        The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenin the House of Commons during the following week.JluropeanCommon1 Policy,ommunityTHE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthat the documents to be debated on Thursday 20 March includedthe European Commission&apos;s paper on the United Kingdom&apos;scontribution to the Community Budget in addition to a series ofCommunity documents on agricultural matters that had alsobeen recommended for debate by the Select Committee onEuropean Legislation, etc.    He recognised the advantages ofconcentrating discussion so far as possible on the issues raisedby the agricultural documents, but it seemed very likely that theOpposition would want to debate the issues raised by the Budgetdocument, and the Government would need to be able to respondaccordingly,It was noted in discussion that the Government intended to tablea single expanded take-note Motion covering both the agriculturaldocuments and the Budget document.    There would be advantagesin a broadly-based debate which did not concentrate on thequestion of the United Kingdom contribution to the Budget. Thepresent indications were that the leading speakers for theOpposition would be their front bench spokesmen on agriculture.On the other hand, the Opposition might, in the event, decide touse the debate to draw attention to the forthcoming negotiationson the United Kingdom&apos;s contribution to the Community Budget.In previous debates the House had passed Motions urging theGovernment to ensure that Britain&apos;s contribution to the Budget&apos;was not greater than ita receipts.    It was desirable, however,that the outcome of the present debate should not tie theGovernment&apos;s hands at the next meeting of the European Council.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that it was important that the outcome of thedebate on 20 March should not prejudice the United Kingdom&apos;snegotiating position at the forthcoming meeting of the EuropeanCouncil.   All the Ministers concerned would be consulted onthe terms of an expanded take-note Motion.    So far as practicablethe Government speakers in the debate should concentrate onagricultural matters rather than on the Community Buc&apos;get. ATreasury Ministers should not be offered as a spokesman in thedebate.    It would be appropriate, subject to the Opposition&apos;sfinal choice of spokesmen, for the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food to open the debate and for the Lord Privy Sealto wind up.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2. Invited the Chief Whip to consult theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Lord Privy Seal,the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Foodand the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster onthe terms of the Motion to be tabled for the debateon 20 March about European Community documentsrelating to agricultural matters and the documentabout the United Kingdom&apos;s contribution to theCommunity Budget. tenarce THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said nual that, following the withdrawal of Mr Robert Taylor&apos;s ChildJP-^ Maintenance Orders (Annual Uprating and Exemption) Bill, aH Bill and full day would be available on Friday, 14 March for the ReportAmendment)      Stage of the Abortion (Amendment) Bill.    It was probable,however, that opponents of the 3ill would succeed in preventingthe completion of the Report Stage of the Bill on that day.The Cabinet -3.Took note.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL2.        THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the Governor, who wouldbe coming to London for consultations on 18 March, was negotiatingabout the date for independence.    Mr Mugabe had wanted it postponeduntil the end of May, and failing that was now pressing for the end ofApril.   Postponement to mid-April seemed the likeliest outcome.Even that would involve dangers from Britain&apos;s point of view; butthere would also be advantage in going some way to meet local wishes.Mr Mugabe&apos;s Government included two very suitable representativesof the white community; Mr Nkomo had also been given a prominentpost, although his supporters had fared less well.    The independenceceremony was likely to be attended by a member of the Royal Family,probably the Prince of Wales.    Although most of the monitoring forcehad now left Rhodesia, two small training teams remained and furtherBrif&apos;sh help with military training had been offered.    The independenceGovernment would probably be dissatisfied with the amount of Britisheconomic aid which could be offered, and it would be necessary forBritain&apos;s allies to be urged to contribute.    Events in Rhodesia werecontinuing to complicate the problem of Namibia.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said mat the crisis over the Americanhostages in Tehran remained grave,   Ayatollah Khomeini appearedto have sabotaged the arrangements worked out between die IranianGovernment and the United Nations Commission, and it now seemedunlikely that the hostages would be handed over to the IranianGovernment&apos;s custody before parliamentary elections were completedin late April or early May.    The United States Government had so farreacted with great restraint.    Sanctions were once again beingconsidered but would not in the circumstances be wholly appropriate:the new Iranian Government was probably disposed to return thehostages if they could, but they were not in control of the situation,and in particular of the so-called students who were holding thehostages.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that President Giscard of France,during his recent visit to the Gulf and Jordan, had publicly called forthe recognition of the Palestine Liberation Organisation but had notcoupled this issue (as the prime Minister had done in her interviewon French television on 10 March) with recognition of Israel&apos;s rightto exist.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE LORD &quot;PRIVY SEAL said that the somewhat delphic Soviet replyto the British proposals for the neutrality of Afghanistan did notamount either to acceptance or to rejection.    Meanwhile it was notclear what, if anything, lay behind rumours of an unsuccessfulmilitary coup d&apos;etat in Pakistan.mes       THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the Swiss Government were raisingdifficulties over the proposal to hold in Geneva the forthcoming inter-national meeting on 17-18 March to consider alternative Games. Ifthey could not be persuaded, the meeting might have to be held inLondon or in Washington, although there were objections to either, course.The Cabinet -Took note.Y 3.        THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that there were contradictorysignals coming from Paris about the attitude of the FrenchGovernment towards the problem of the British Budget contribution.They had agreed to discussions at official level and had told theBelgians earlier in the week that they were anxious for a seriousnegotiation.    On the other hand an official statement on 12 March&gt;  took a hard line over prospects of a satisfactory discussion at theforthcoming meeting of the European Council.    This suggested thatthe French might be worried by the unfavourable reaction in theFrench Press to the way they had handled the sheepmeat issue at therecent Council of Ministers (Agriculture); and by the favourableimpact of the Prime Minister&apos;s recent interview on French television.In a brief discussion it was reported that the Elysee had also put out astrong statement about the Common Agricultural Policy which said,inter alia, that there would be no concessions to Britain until ourattitude on sheepmeat changed.    On the other hand the French Ministerresponsible for fisheries was still being very co-operative.    It waspossible that the effect of French intransigence might be to inclineother Member States to take a more helpful attitude towards theBritish on the Budget contribution.    It would be necessary to considerthe line to be taken in discussions on the Budget issue at the Council ofMinisters (Finance) on 17 March and the Council of Ministers(Foreign Affairs) on 18 March.The Cabinet -Took note,4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALNCIAL       4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the SecretaryNT  F       of the Cabinet (C(80) 18) reporting the outcome of detailedsand consideration of the financial support of strikers and their familiesMILIES      conducted by a Group of Ministers under the chairmanship of thePrime Minister.THE PRIME MINISTER said that when they last discussed the matterth (CC(79) 26th Conclusions, Minute 6) the Cabinet had felt thatns, &quot;deeming&quot; strikers who were not members of trade unions to be inreceipt of strike pay was not acceptable, and had been much excercisedby the difficulty of distinguishing between members and non-membersof trade unions when making payment of supplementary benefit.They had accordingly asked for the issues to be re-examined. Thishad been done and the results were recorded in the paper now beforethe Cabinet.   This concluded that it would be practicable todistinguish between unionists and non-unionists for supplementarybenefit purposes.    Thus it would be possible to deem a certain levelof strike pay for unionists only.    On the other hand it had beenargued by some members of her Group that a preferable coursewould be to reduce supplementary benefit payments to the familiesof all strikers, irrespective of union membership, by reducing the&quot;requirements level&quot; used in calculating entitlement to supplementarybenefit.   This course would not involve deeming that non-unionistsreceived strike pay but would rest on the proposition that the publicwas less willing to support the families of strikers than of peopleunemployed through no fault of their own.    The Group had felt thatthis fundamental issue should be reserved for decision by the Cabinet*Subject to this decision, however, the Group had agreed to recommendto the Cabinet the package of measures set out in C(80) 18.The Cabinet discussed the details of the measures to be introduced,and agreed the proposals in paragraphs 5 and 6 of C(80) 18.The Cabinet then considered whether the reduction in supplementarybenefit should apply to the families of members of trade unions onlyor to those of all strikers.    In favour of applying the penalty only tqstrikers who were members of unions, it was argued that those whowere not members of unions were unable by definition to receivestrike pay.    Reducing supplementary benefit payments to mem by 12 a week would leave them  27 a week worse o/f man if they wereunemployed, and  12 worse off than unionist strikers, whose unionsmade up the reduction through strike pay.     That could giverise to cases of extreme (and no doubt well publicised) cases ofhardship among non-unionists, including some who would be lockedout or laid off but would be treated for supplementary benefit purposesas if they were on otrike.    The Manifesto commitment was to ensurethat unions bore their fair share of the cost of supporting those oftheir members who were on strike, and a measure which bore equallyon all strikers would dilute the pressure on the unions to this end.5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALMcreover, to the extent that the measures encouraged unionsactually to pay strike pay, they would put non-unionists undereven greater pressure to join a union.In favour of applying the penalty to all stzikers, whether members ofunions or not, it was argued that public concern focussed on the factthat Government funds were used t&gt;&gt; support the families of strikersas such, whether or not they were members of a trade union. Inany case the number of non-unionists involved in major strikes wassmall.    Moreover trade union subscriptions included an elementof insurance premium forwards strike pay.    The non-unionistdid not pay union subscriptions, and it was reasonable to expect thathe would make his own financial provision against the contingency ofa Ptrike.   A measure which applied to unionists only would beattacked as anti-union.    It could also involve difficulties in definingwho was and who was not a union member, and there would no doubtbe abuses as unions tried to find ways round die regulations. Ameasure which applied equally to all strikers would avoid thesedifficulties.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discus si on, said that thebalance of view in the Cabinet was clearly in favour of applying thereduction in supplementary benefit +o all strikers, whether or notthey were trade union members.    The Government&apos;s decisions onall the proposals agreed in discussion should be announced in theBudget Debate.The Cabinet -1. Agreed that supplementary benefit paymentsto strikers should be reduced by a reduced requirementslevel applicable to all strikers, whether or not they weremembers of trade unions.2. Agreed the proposals set out in paragraphs 5 and6 of C(80) 18.3. Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theSecretary of State for Social Services to make thenecessary arrangements to implement the Cabinet&apos;sdecisions and to announce them in the Budget Debate,6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIrERM 5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (C(80) 17) proposing the publication in the context ofhis forthcoming Budget of a statement about the Governmentsmedium-term financial strategy.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the economicoutlook was difficult in the short term, but there was no practicablealternative to the course of monetary discipline on which the iGovernment was now embarked.    There would be advantage inpresenting the Government&apos;s policies in a longer-term context, in away which would demonstrate that they were consistent, and technicallysound, and held out a credible prospect of eventual success. TheCabinet had decided on public expenditure plans for the next fouryears, which would be published at the time of the Budget.    It waspossible to predict the likely course of Government revenues over thesame period, making a realistic allowance for the yield from NorthSea oil.    Taken together, these indicated that the Public SectorBorrowing Requirement (PSBR) should be falling sufficiently over theperiod to allow some room for tax reduction in real terms in 1982-83and 1983-84, while still bringing the growth in the money supply downto an annual rate of 4 - 8 per cent by the end of the period.    Much ofthe information which he proposed to bring together in the FinancialStatement and Budget Report (FSBR) would in any case be publishedin other ways or would be elicited from Government witnesses beforeSelect Committees and spokesmen in debates.    There was muchadvantage to be gained from presenting it in a coherent fashion. Atthe seme time he would make it clear that the Government v/as notlocked in to an inflexible policy.    The precise path by which thegrowth of money stock would be brought down to the level envisagedfor 1983-84 would of necessity have to be adjusted as time passed,and in the short term the Government would not be tying its handsunduly by publication in the manner proposed.In discussion there was general agreement that there would be muchadvantage in being able to hold out credible hope that, despite allthe economic problems in the short term, the Government&apos;s policieswjuld lead to eventual success, in terms not only of monetary growthbut also of the Government&apos;s fiscal objectives and of inflation andgrowth.    Some members of the Cabinet doubted whether it wasprudent or desirable to proceed by way of a statement whichcontained forecasts im quantitative terms.    The Government would beexposed to questions about the underlying assumptions on the move-ment of wages, interest rates, unemployment and output. Anyforecast, however cautiously presented, ran die risk of falsification,through external shocks such as movements in commodities prices,or from other events outside the Government&apos;s control. Howeverstrongly it was emphasised that the figures were illustrativefor ecasts, they would tend to acquire the status of a plan; and theGovernment would not wish to repeat the failure of the &apos;National Plan&apos;of 1964.    Critics would watch performance carefully and compare it7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALwith the path set out by the Chancellor.    It was preferable that theGovernment should be judged by the overall success of its measures,rather than by its performance against a series of specifiedindicators.    Events in the real world, rather than Governmentpredictions, were the only wings which influenced investors anddecision-makers.    Other members of the Cabinet saw advantage inbeing able to provide a coherent and quantified basis for theGovernment&apos;s promise of eventual success for its policies, despitethe short-term difficulties.    It was important to show that theGovernment had a credible long term objective, which it waspursuing resolutely, and was able to demonstiate how its policieswould succeed over the long term.    This could help significantly tocolour industrial and financial expectations and intentions. Thepresentation proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer wascautious and realistic.    Publication of figures of this kind wouldprovide a useful basis for the publicity campaign which would beneeded, after the Budget, to present the Government&apos;s economicpolicies to the wider public.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of view in the Cabinet favoured proceeding with the inclusionin the FSBR of a statement on the Government&apos;s medium-termfinancial strategy on the lines proposed by the Chancellor of theExchequer.    In drafting the statement, the Chancellor of the Exchequshould take account of the various points made in discussion. Heshould also consult the Paymaster General about the presentation ofthe Government&apos;s long-term strategy in the period after the Budget.The Cabinet -1. Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to includein his Budget Speech and in the Financial Statement andBudget Report, material about the Government&apos;s medium-term financial strategy on the lines set out in C(80) 17,taking account of the views expressed in discussion.2. Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consultthe Paymaster General about the public presentation ofhis policies during the period after the Budget.Cabinet Office13 March 1980CONFIDENTIAL
