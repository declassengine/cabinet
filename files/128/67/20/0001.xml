CONFIDENTIAL5LIAMENTARY       1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inFAIRS the House of Commons in the period 2-9 June.JEIGN 2.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidFAIRS that the latest position on the boycott of the Moscow Games wasdiscouraging.    British swimmers had now said that they intended;yious to participate in the Games.    Sir Denis Follows, Chairman of thetrence&apos; British Olympic Association, had been unresponsive to the latest80) 19th letter he had received from the Prime Minister.    France and aelusions, number of other countries had failed to respond to the lead giveniite 2 by the decision of the West German National Olympic Committeenot to go to the Games.    This decision had only been taken as aresult of considerable personal efforts by die President,Chancellor and Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic ofGermany.    The West German Government was now starting tofeel isolated.    In view of the robust position in favour of the boycottwhich the British Government had assumed, he believed that it wouldbe helpful to British relations with the Federal Republic of Germanyif senior British Ministers could be seen to be still trying todissuade the Chairmen of the various British Sports Federationsfrom participation in the Moscow Olympics.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe British decision not to make economic sanctions against Iranvious retrospective from 4 November 1979 had caused some irritationtrence: on trie part of the United States and our Community partners. HeSO) 19th had spoken to the American Secretary of State, Mr Muskie whoelusions, seemed to understand the position.    But a problem remained overiite 2 making the necessary Orders in Council.    Our European partnerswho were implementing the sanctions by administrative actionwere doing so from today.    It seemed likely that the equivalentBritish measures could not be taken before the Privy Council hadmet in the following week, possibly on Thursday 29 May.In a brief discussion it was agreed that it was probably necessaryfor Orders to be made under both the 1939 Act and the newlegislation, and that it was essential to get the procedure rightfirst time.   Nevertheless there was no need to delay making theOrders for as long as the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretaryhad feared, in view of the possible adverse effects among ourEuropean partners and in the United States.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theOrders should be made as soon as they were ready, if possible onFriday 23 May.1CONFIDENTIAL
confidentialTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that hehad met Mr Gromyko, the Soviet Foreign Minister, in Vienna andthey had discussed Afghanistan.    It seemed clear that the Sovietswanted to achieve a political settlement, but the terms theyappeared to have in mind involved a recognition of President BabrakKarmal&apos;s regime, and guarantees of non-interference fromAfghanistan&apos;s neighbours, without dealing with the need for thewithdrawl of Soviet troops from the country.    Thus the Soviet andWestern view of tile problem were still a long way apart.sident Giscard&apos;sto WarsawTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that thenews of President Giscard&apos;s meeting with President Brezhnev inWarsaw had been generally badly received in the West.    The factthat he intended to make the visit had been known during the meetingof Foreign Ministers in Vienna even though there had been nospecific French announcement.    Nothing significant had emergedfrom the meeting of the two Presidents.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that itwas not clear what was happening in Uganda since the displacementof President Binaisa, but there did appear to be a strong probabilityeither of the return of Dr Obote to power or of the country slidinginto civil disorder.1 KoreaTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatalthough serious rioting was taking place in several cities in SouthKorea these appeared to be caused by student discontent. Therewere no indications that they had been deliberately caused, or ofNorth Korean involvement.The CabinetTook note.confidential
SECRET(UNITY 3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidS that the informal meeting of Foreign Ministers in Naples had madevery little progress.    The French and German Foreign Ministerswere not willing to discuss figures in advance of a meeting of theunity Council of Ministers (Ecofin) now scheduled for 27 May. Whilet there had been some greater readiness to accept a settlementcovering three years, the offers made in Luxembourg for a limitjus on our net contribution in 1980 had been withdrawn and we would betnce: expected to pay more this year in any agreement covering three119th years.    The Ecofin Council would be considering the latestisions, Commission estimates about the size of the Community Budget and ouri 3 Level of contribution, but it was unlikely that this meeting would makeany progress towards a solution.    To make progress, there wouldneed to be a meeting of the Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs),with Foreign Ministers having a mandate to negotiate from theirHeads of Government.    In the meantime, the French and probablyother Member States were considering national measures to raisethe income of their farmers by the equivalent of the price increaseswhich we were continuing to block.    Thus our bargaining strengthwould be less after the end of May.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthat tha French Government had promised help to their farmers ifthere was no agreement on agricultural prices before the end ofMay.    Whether other Member States would follow suit would dependon the strength of their farming lobby and their domestic budgetarysituation.    There was likely to be distortion of trade within theCommunity and if national aids led to increased production the costof additional surpluses would still fall on the Community Budget.We were examining the legality of the proposed French measures,but they might not be illegal unless condemned by the Commission,and there were signs that the Commission would connive at what theFrench intended to do.In a brief discussion it was suggested that it should be possible toachieve settlement on acceptable terms.    Considerable progresshad already been made - much more than would at one time havebeen thought possible - and an early settlement would be importantfor the unity of Europe.    But the prospects for the next EuropeanCouncil on 12 and 13 June would not be good unless Foreign Ministershad negotiating mandates which would enable them to come close, ifnot all the way, to a settlement.    While there was some risk that anarrangement for only three years would reopen the budget issue justat the time of the next elections to the European Parliament, it wasmore than likely that before then the Community would have had tomake major changes in its budgetary arrangements because of theexhaustion of its existing financial resources.    On the other hand,3SECRET
SECRETeven if we were able, as we should seek, to achieve a settlementwhich was an improvement on what had been on offer at Luxembourg,we should still be the second largest contributor after Germany whichhad for long been gaining at our expense not only through theCommunity Budget but through the offset arrangements, and weshould also still be making a substantially larger net contributionthan France.    National agricultural measures of the kind proposedby the French would not necessarily help our objective of reformingthe Common Agricultural Policy: they might even help to entrenchit.    Nevertheless we should not be unduly concerned about the threatwhich they represented to our negotiating position on the budget issueif the French were to act illegally, that would create a climate inwhich it would be less difficult for the Government to give furtherconsideration to the withholding of our Value Added Tax (VAT)contribution.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that itwas right to use the Council of Foreign Ministers to try to reachan early settlement before the European Council.    She would bediscussing further with the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretaryhis negotiating mandate for such a meeting.The Cabinet -Took note.4SECRET
CONFIDENTIAL54.        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster (C(80) 28) about the cost of Parliament.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that hehad examined the direct costs of running Parliament and. with thehelp of the Minister of State, Civil Service Department, some  f theindirect costs falling on Government Departments.   He hadsuggested in his memorandum ways in which improvements might besought in the control of expenditure and for securing economies.Last year, die running of Parliament had cost  44 million. Thecurrent year&apos;s estimate was  51 million.    The main items ofexpenditure were Members&apos; salaries and allowances ( 16 million inthe current year). House of Commons Administration and catering( 11 million), House of Lords expenditure ( 5 million), the Palaceof Westminster ( 8 million), and Hansard, printing, stationery andcomputer costs ( 8 million).   He had provided figures in Annex C,showing the growth since 1973-74 of House of Commons and House ofLords expenditure: in real terms it had risen by about 60 per centdue to increases in allowances (although not pay), extra staffing andpolicing, and the new arrangements for House of Commons catering.The remaining costs of Parliament, including the Palace ofWestminster, Hansard, printing and stationery, had fluctuated inreal terms in recent years and had amounted to some  14 million inthe previous financial year.    The current year&apos;s estimates did notmake full provision for the most recent commitments, includingimproved secretarial allowances and pensions, and extended freetravel for MPs.    The extra cost might be  3 million.    There wereelements of uncertainty about future years.   He had drawn attentionto likely increases in printing costs, and in pensions for Memberswho had retired before 1964.    The various systems of control whichoperated over different sectors of Parliamentary expenditure weredescribed in the memorandum.    The Cabinet had recently agreed thatParliamentary pay and allowances should continue to be decided afterindependent review.   He would be circulating to his colleaguesproposals for improving the accountability of MPs for their claimsfor allowances.   He proposed no changes in the control of works atthe Palace of Westminster.    He had, however, made proposals fora review by the House of Commons Commission of the system ofcontrol over staffing and administration.    Similar matters in theHouse of Lords might, in addition, need to be looked at. Heproposed that Parliament&apos;s printing, stationery and computerrequirements should be obtained on a repayment basis, so thatfinancial control would rest with the two Houses.    Parliament was,of course, highly sensitive about its constitutional position, andintensely jealous of its independence.    It was essential to proceeddiplomatically.    There would need to be early informal talks withthe Speaker, the Opposition and, later, with the House of CommonsCommission.    He did not favour a comprehensive inquiry into thecost of Parliament.    It might well be counterproductive, leading tostrong demands for better accommodation and more generous
CONFIDENTIALfinancial treatment.    Some improvements were needed, however,and he sought the Cabinet&apos;s agreement to the series of initiativesset out in paragraph 12 of his paper.THE MINISTER OF STATE, CIVIL SERVICE DEPARTMENT, saidthat the indirect costs imposed by Parliament on GovernmentDepartments were difficult to quantify.    Costs of answeringParliamentary Questions had been estimated as less than  2 milliona year; and a similar estimate had been made of the cost forDepartments of dealing with Select Committees.    The overall figureof  10 million for Parliamentary Questions, Select Committees andMPs&apos; letters was lower than he would have expected.    It would beexpensive to conduct a thorough survey across all Departments. Hetherefore suggested that Sir Derek Rayner&apos;s recommendation shouldbe adopted and that one Department should be asked to keep a recordnext session of the resources committed in support of Parliamentarywork.    In the case of Select Committees, it was not simply a matterof the costs themselves so much as the fact that the burden fell onMinisters and senior officials.   An immense amount of briefing wasundertaken for those attending the Treasury and Civil ServiceSelect Committee, for example, and much of it was on matters which,in the event, were not raised.    As for Parliamentary Questions, hesuggested that the  50 limit set in 1965, ie the limit above whichMinisters should consider refusing to answer a Question on groundsof disproportionate cost, should be raised to  100.    The presentlevel was unrealistic and, in his experience, no longer observed.In discussion it was noted that the increase in the direct costs ofParliament since 1973-74 had been substantially greater than therate of inflation and that this increase was continuing at a time whenthe Government were curtailing the growth of other public expenditure.Publication of the relevant figures and of examples of apparent abuseor extravagance would certainly attract public attention; but it wouldbe a mistake to stimulate anti-Parliamentary feelings by so doing.It was in Parliament&apos;s own interests to make such changes as werenecessary.    It would be better to concentrate, as the Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster had proposed, on particular ereas where amore effective and coherent system of control of expenditure wasdesirable.    Parliamentary expenditure should not be immune fromquestioning:  there seemed to be a number of sacred cows.    A desireto avoid the criticism of Members might in the past have led toinadequate scrutiny of proposed expenditure.    There seemed to begrounds for concern over the increases in the staff employed in thetwo Houses; and the need for major expenditure on computers wasnot self-evident.    The House of Commons Commission, who hadstatutory responsibility for the administration of the House, wouldneed to undertake any review of staffing, but they might be encouragedto ask the Civil Service Department to assist in a review, as theHouse of Lords Offices Committee had already done in the case oftheir staff.6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe following were among the points made in further discussion ofthe direct costs of Parliament:*a. There was no realistic possibility of legislation toreduce die total number c f Members of Parliament andthereby the cost of salaries and allowances.    The BoundaryCommissions were reviewing constituency boundaries, butthe House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1949stipulated that there must be at least 71 Scottish Membersand 35 Welsh Members and these numbers, in practice,broadly determined the number of English Members.b. The increase in the number of staff employed in theLibrary of the House of Commons, and other Departments,reflected the increased demands of MPs for researchfacilities and administrative support, and betokened a changein the attitudes of MPs to their role.    Significant economieswould be secured only if this new fashion were challenged.c. Responsibility for the maintenance of the Palace ofWestminster rested at present with the Secretary of State forthe Environment.    It was argued that the Property ServicesAgency of the Department should act solely as contractorsand that responsibility for deciding on the work to be doneshould rest with the Leaders of both Houses or with theHouse of Commons Commission and the House of LordsOffices Committee.    Such a change would be in line with thechangeover to a repayment basis for Parliamentary printing,stationery, etc. recommended by the Chancellor of the Duchyof Lancaster.    On the other hand, the Leaders of the twoHouses had no staff to carry out such functions and the controlof expenditure would he less effective than at present ifresponsibility were transferred to Parliament itself. Controlwas likely to be best exercised by a junior Minister in theDepartment of the Environment as part of his regular duties.d. Examples were quoted of apparent abuse of travel atpublic expense, in this country and abroad, by members ofdepartmental Select Committees.    In such cases, a summaryof the facts ought to be brought to the notice of the House ofCommons Commission or the Liaison Committee, which hadlaid down rules about travel by members of the Committees.e. Although it was stated in the memorandum that arrange-ments for deciding the level of policing were satisfactory, theMetropolitan Police considered that there were too manypolice engaged at the Palace of Westminster.    It might bepossible to reduce the number, or to replace some bysecurity guards.    The Home Secretary undertook to examinethe situation.7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIn further discussion it was suggested that the figures quoted inAnnex D of the memorandum seriously underestimated the costsimposed cn Departments by Parliament.    Considerable numbersof staff were engaged in dealing with letters from Members ofParliament, the number of which appeared to be increasing. Muchwork was also being created by Select Committees.    The preparationof unnecessary briefing material had been referred to.    The problemalso arose as a result of the use of &quot;open&quot; Parliamentary Questions,which the Speaker was now discouraging.    The extent of Parliament&apos;sinfluence on the work of Departments was inherent in the constitutionalrelationship of Parliament to the Executive.    Nonetheless, there wasa need to quantify the indirect costs involved so far as possible andfor individual Ministers to discourage the preparation of unnecessarybackground material when their Departments advised on the answersto Parliamentary Questions and MPs&apos; letters.    The limit of  50 onthe cost of answering a Parliamentary Question was a useful reminderof the need for economy and it would be a mistake to increase it atpresent.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were concerned at the increases in the direct costs ofParliament and in the burdens imposed by Parliament or. Departments.The increases in costs and staffing, and the apparent lack of effectivecontrol, ran counter to the Government&apos;s general policy of reducingpublic expenditure and manpower.    The Cabinet agreed that a wide-ranging enquiry was not appropriate and recognised that account mustbe taken of the constitutional position of Parliament and the statutoryresponsibilities of the House of Commons Commission. Theytherefore supported the proposals made by the Chancellor of the Duchyof Lancaster as a means towards improving the position in the Houseof Commons.    In his informal talks with the Speaker, theOpposition and the House of Commons Commission, he should stressthat Parliament itself would be damaged in the public eye if itsexpenditure were thought to be exempt from the constraints applyingto other expenditure of tax-payers&apos; money.  The damage would bethe greater if there appeared to be no effective controls againstabuses, for example, as regards travel at public expense. Ministersshould let the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster know of anyspecific and well-founded examples of abuse so that he could takethem up with the Liaison Committee or the House of CommonsCommission as appropriate.   A review of the staffing of the House ofLords was in hand, with the help of the Civil Service Department,The House of Lords Offices Committee should be asked to accept thatprinting, stationery and computer requirements should be obtained ona repayment basis*    The Cabinet accepted the offer by the Secretaryof State for Social Services that his Department should keep a recordof the resources committed next Session in support of theParliamentary work of Ministers and senior officials. Ministersshould seek, so far as practicable, to reduce the work of theirDepartments in dealing with Parliamentary Questions and Ministerialcorrespondence*8CONFIDENTIAL
