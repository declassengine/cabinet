confidentialAMfcNTARYRSittviimme&apos;USnee:117thtsions,i 11. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that he hadsummarised the progress made with the legislative programme in hisminute of 21 January to the Prime Minister of which his colleagues hadcopies.    Most of the major B511s in the programme had now beenintroduced.    The Local Government Planning and Land (No. 2) Bill wasbeing introduced in the House of Commons that day and the BroadcastingBill should be ready for introduction the following week.    He wasconcerned, however, at the delay in the preparation of the Petroleumand Submarine Pipelines Bill.    The Competition Bill had received itsThird Reading in the Commons and other Bills, including the Industryand National Heritage Bills, had been through Standing Committee. Aguillotine was being introduced for the Education (No. 2) Bill. Ingeneral the position in the House of Commons was reasonablysatisfactory; but there was risk of serious congestion in the House ofLords later in the Session.    There was no room for new substantialBills to be added to the programme.    The aim must be to complete theSession by the end of October so that a new Session could start at thebeginning of November: delay beyond that in opening the new Sessionwould only lay up problems of congestion and business management forthe future.    To achieve this it might well be necessary for Parliamentto sit into the first week of August as well as for three weeks in Octoberimmediately after the Party Conference.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that asmuch progress as possible must be made with the programme beforethe Summer Recess in order that the spillover could be restricted toabout three weeks in October. In particular, every effort should bemade to secure the passage of the Local Government Planning and Land(No. 2) Bill through the House of Commons by the end of June so as toalleviate the problems foreseen in the House of Lords.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion.
confidentialIGN 2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatIRS he and the Lord Privy Seal would be making statements to Parliamentlater that day on the situation following the Soviet invasion ofoistan Afghanistan, on his own recent travels in the area, and on the stepswhich the Government had already agreed to take.    It was clear thatous Governments in the area, including India, were gravely disturbed by theence: Soviet action, but it was too little realised that subversion was a greateri) 2nd danger than overt aggression.    The development of a common frontusions, against the Soviet threat was hampered by several factors: the intensee 2 mutual suspicions of India and Pakistan; the unpopularity of the CampDavid agreement in most Moslem countries;  and the fear that the currentAmerican sanctions policy was increasing the danger of the break-up ofIran, from which only the Russians would benefit.    Nevertheless it wasstriking that 104 members of the United Nations had voted to condemn theSoviet Union.    That would have been unthinkable until recently. Itshowed in particular the strength of Moslem feeling about the rape ofMoslem Afghanistan.    The forthcoming Islamic Conference in Islamabadwas likely to prove important.    Another satisfactory development wasCuba&apos;s loss of standing within the Non-Aligned Movement and herconsequent decision to withdraw as a candidate for the Security Council.The reactions of Britain&apos;s partners in the European Community and theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation had been mixed.    Germany andFrance were particularly cautious about measures against the SovietUnion.    Germany&apos;s attitude was conditioned by her circumstances andby her stake in her Ostpolitik, but domestic political developmentsseemed nevertheless to be allowing the Federal Government to adoptmore robust attitudes, eg in relation to the Olympic Games. TheFrench Government&apos;s posture was more cynical; but the fate ofDr Sakharov, a leading Soviet dissident, seemed now to be making thesort of impression on French public opinion which the Soviet invasion ofAfghanistan might have been expected to make earlier. Britain&apos;smeasures included steps to discourage cultural exchanges with theRussians.    As regards the Olympics, the Prime Miuister had written tothe Chairman of the British Olympic   Association (BOA) suggestingtransfer away from Moscow; the reaction of the sporting community wasuncertain, but it seemed clear that action against the Moscow Olympicsoffered the best hope of bringing home to the Russians theunacceptability of what they had done.In a brief discussion it was noted that the Chairman of the BOA had nowreplied to the Prime Minister in non-committal but not unfriendly terms-that public opinion seemed increasingly favourable to the Government&apos;sattitude; and that the British Broadcasting Corporation and theIndependent Broadcasting Authority had reached agreement to act inconcert as regards the possibility of restricting coverage of the Gamesin Moscow, on which no decision had yet been taken.2confidential

There seemed to be some possibility that therelease of the American hostages might be secured by negotiationsbehind the scenes.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatPresident Tito&apos;s remarkable recovery was a welcome development. Itremained important to continue to provide Yugoslavia with privateassurances of Western support, but there was a danger of offendingYugoslav susceptibilities if such assurances were over-emphasised inpublic.The CabinetTook note.3confidentialTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that in all thecircumstances the situation in Rhodesia had been developing better thanmight have been expected.    But it remained fragile.    A difficultdecision might shortly have to be taken over Mr Mugabe, who wished toreturn on 27 January but had not yet released the detainees held by hisforces in Mozambique.     International criticism continued over thepresence of South African troops inside Rhodesia at Beitbridge. Thispresence had had to be accepted in order to persuade General Walls andthe Salisbury regime to agree to the ceasefire arrangements.Beitbridge was important to the Whites in Rhodesia as their potentialescape route.    The South Africans could not be replaced by Britishtroops, whom it would be most undesirable to deploy in a military asopposed to a monitoring role.    But it might be possible to announceshortly that the South Africans would withdraw before the elections.I
confidentialIMMUNITY 3.        THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said he had now completed hisFAIRS tour of capitals.   In the Federal Republic of Germany there hadbeen some willingness to resolve our budget problem althoughmmunity Budget doctrinal objections had been raised against several possiblesolutions.    Herr Lahnstein, the State Secretary in the Federalrevious Ministry of Finance, had expressed a readiness to help when theeference: Commission&apos;s paper became available.    In Dublin, the newC(80) 2nd Taoiseach had been anxious to show his moderation and the Irish[inclusions would probably be reasonably helpful provided they could obtaininute 3 some benefit for themselves.    The Danish Prime Minister, whohad not been briefed, had reiterated the position he had adopted at&apos; the Dublin European Council, but the Danish Foreign Minister hadbeen more helpful.   The attitude of the French Government hadbeen one of studied non-commitment, expressed in different waysby the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister and the Minister ofFinance.    The French had made a clear link with the problem ofsheepmeat.   With the exception of France, however, his tour hadrevealed a readiness in the rest of the Community to go beyond whathad been offered in Dublin.    Everyone was anxious, in the light ofthe worsening of East-West relations, to get the Community Budgetproblem out of the way as soon as possible.gri cultureCouncilpreviousReferences:C(80) 2nd(inclusions,l&amp;nute s 2d3THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthat, at the Council of Ministers (Agriculture) on 21-22 January, theother member states had adopted a tougher attitude towards theFrench over sheepmeat, and the President of the Council hadconcluded that the Commission should do everything possible tosecure early French compliance with the judgment of the EuropeanCourt.    Commissioner Gundelach now admitted that the only wayto secure a further judgment from the European Court speedily wasto ask for interim measures.    It was important for Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to put political pressure on the Commission to decidein this sense.The Irish had withdrawn a request for the Council to discuss salesof butter to the Soviet Union, telling the Press that they hadreceived assurances from Commissioner Gundelach that theprefixation of export restitutions - which allows traders to enterinto export contracts without the risk of the Community subsidybeing subsequently reduced or suspended - would be resumed withintwo weeks.    It was clear that the French, Dutch and Irish weredetermined to go on selling butter for commercial reasons and,in the case of the French, because of their wish to maintain politicallinks with the Soviet Union.    Decisions on prefixation and the levelof export restitutions were taken by the Commission underconfidential
confidentialManagement Committee procedure over which we had no vetc.Other member states were reluctant to cut off what was the cheapestmethod of disposing of butter surpluses; it was therefore veryunlikely that the Council of Agriculture Ministers would come outagainst such sales, although the German attitude now seemed to becoming closer to that of the United Kingdom.In a brief discussion it was noted that, in his Statement to the House ofLords about Afghanistan later in the day, the Foreign andCommonwealth Secretary would be indicating that we were pressingour Community partners to restrict sales of butter and othersubsidised agricultural exports to the Soviet Union.    British publicopinion would certainly resent the continuance of these sales andthe consequences of that for the Community Budget and the Britishcontribution to it.   Although this was a matter for Communitydecision, Her Majesty&apos;s Government should be seen to be doingeverything possible to stop subsidised exports to the Soviet Union.The Cabinet -Took note.5confidential

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND saidthat the Conference on the future government of Northern Ireland hadcompleted its second week and had got down to matters of substance.Although agreement had been reached on the agenda, the SocialDemocratic Labour Party were refusing to participate fully until themain item of interest to them was reached;  and it was possible that theymight try to leave the Conference once discussion of that item had beencompleted.    All parties at the Conference appeared to favour aprovincial government with legislative as well as executive powers,rather than a provincial council; and it was important in that contextthat the Conservative Election Manifesto had spoken of establishing oneor more elected councils only if more fully devolved governmentremained unattainable.    The Official Unionist Party had sent the PrimeMinister a statement of their views; but they had refused to allow this tobe put before the Conference, in which they remained unwilling to takepart.The Cabinet -Took note.JSTRIAL 5.        THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that thereAIRS was now a hope that the British Steel Corporation management and thesteel unions would shortly resume negotiations, though there could be noIndustry certainty of an early agreement being reached.

Souslence:12ndisions,le 7THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that themanagement and unions in the water industry would be meeting onMonday 28 January to continue negotiations for a wages settlement.The unions&apos; claim comprised two elements:  a settlement for thecurrent year, and a claim for comparability of treatment with theircounterparts in the gas and electricity industries, to which they arguedthat there was an outstanding commitment from last year&apos;s negotiations.It was too early to assume that a settlement could be reached and thepossibility of a strike remained.THE HOME SECRETARY said that his understanding was that theGovernment could expect seven days&apos; notice before any strike began.A period of notice of this kind would be very valuable in organising thedeployment of troops to assist in maintaining supplies.    The CivilContingencies Unit (CCU) was in close touch with the position and hadpointed to the critical importance which attached to the attitude of thesupervisory staffs in the industry.    With their co-operation the ArmedForces could perhaps maintain supplies for about six weeks.    Without itendurance would be a matter of days only.In discussion attention was drawn to the fact that in Scotland waterworkers were employed by the local authorities alongside other workerswho would be receiving the recently negotiated 13 per cent pay increasefor local authority manual workers generally.    This could lead tocomplications.    The importance of the role of supervisory staffs wasrecognised as was the desirability of obtaining the maximum warning ofthe onset of any strike.    The Secretary of State for the Environmentwould check further on the length of warning of the onset of a strikewhich might be obtained.The Cabinet -2,Took note.SNDITUREtomic andtaryfdtence:I |5thfusions,6.

The Finance Ministers of all the mainindustrialised countries shared the view that there would be littlegrowth in the world economy in the coming year; and each rise inthe price of oil worsened the prospect.    Reduced expectations of thelevel of North Sea oil output in the next ?  years would adversely affectthe prospects for the United Kingdom, and any increased revenueswhich might accrue from rising oil prices would be offset, in the sameperiod, by reduced activity in our export markets.    It was virtuallycertain that this year&apos;s Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR)would prove to be higher than the  8.3 billion budgeted for in June 1979and, unless action were taken, might rise significantly in the next twoyears.    In addition the current steel strike would add to the PSBR inthe first half of 1980 and reduce national output.   He had examineda wide range of suggestions made for direct controls of credit, includingaction on credit cards, but had come to the conclusion that, while theywould require a new bureaucratic apparatus and perhaps new legislation,they could have no more than the most marginal effect on the level ofcredit because of the ease with which the market could now developalternative channels of credit outnide controls.    There was no escapefrom fundamental causes and the solutions appropriate to theral Alarge PSBR was the prime cause of high interest rates.    High interestrates were incompatible with growth.    The high rate of interest payableon new borrowing and on re-financing old borrowing imposed a growingburden on public expenditure and compounded the difficulty.    The onlyalternative to reducing public expenditure was to increase taxation.Unless public expenditure could be reduced, the outlook for furtherreductions in direct taxation was bleak.    Reduced taxation and lowerinteract irate s were the key to the success of the Government&apos;s strategyto resume growth and control inflation.secret
SECRETIn discussion the following points were made:-a. Although there was a respectable arpument for allowingthe PSBP. to increase during a recession, this argument hadmuch le3s force when the PSBR was already at much too higha level.    The previous Government had doubled the NationalDebt during its period of office, and continued accretions of 10 billion a year or so to this debt meart that the cost ofservicing it had become a major item in the public expenditureprogramme.    In addition the present level of the PSBR was anengine for inflation, because the level of borrowing requiredcould not be met from genuine savings, and a disincentive toindustrial investment because of the level of interest rates itimposed.b. Direct controls of credit would have little or no effecton the level of interest rates.    The roots of the problem layin lie huge appetite of the Government and public authoritiesgenerally for borrowed money.    The effective remedy was toget spending down.c. Despite the explanations in the Chancellor&apos;s paper, thelink between present actions and future prospects was still notclear.    The Cabinet would need fuller information on themedium-term economic prospect on present policies, if theywere to be able to judge whether the present strategy offered areasonable prospect of bringing the PSBR, interest rates andinflation to acceptable levels in two or three years&apos; time. Itmight be that much more severe action on public expenditurewas required now, and could be shown to be tolerable, if itoffered a real prospect of substantial improvement in the future.d. There were severe practical and political limitationsto the extent to which public expenditure could be cut.    It mightbe better for the Government to abandon, at least in the shortterm, its expectations of reducing taxes.    On the other hand itwas argued that without further cuts in public expenditure realrates of tax might have to rise.    Such an outcome was to beavoided if at all possible.e. The adverse effect of high interest rates on investment,particularly on small businesses, was a major obstacle toeconomic development.    A reduction in public expenditurewhich brought down the PSBR and with it the level of interestrates was an essential condition of recovery.    But it would notbe enough by itself.    The many other rigidities and restraintson enterprise in the economy would need to be tackled as well.2SECRET
SECRETf. The lack of public awareness of the seriousness of the situation was a hindrance to action.    Considerably moreeffort could be devoted to bringing home the Ties sage that dieGovernment&apos;s actions in cutting public expenditure were in thenational interest, and fully necessitated by the facts of thesituation, and not simply the application of a theoreticaldoctrine.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theChancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s memorandum did not sail for specificdecisions, though its analysis was accepted by the Cabinet asconstituting the background to their discussion of public expenditure.The Cabinet -Took note of the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;sanalysis of the economic outlook, as the backgroundto theiz discussion of public expendituxe.Cabinet Office25 January 19803SECRET

They also had before them a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Social Services about theNovember 1979 uprating of retirement pensions (C(80) 6); amemorandum by the Secretary of State for Employment about specialemployment measures (C(80) 5), and a memorandum by the ChiefSecretary, Treasury (C(80) 7), covering some statistics about thedeployment of local authority manpower.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the Cabinet hadalready agreed to reduce the planned levels of public expenditure by 1 billion in 1980-81 and by  2 billion in each of the subsequent years inaddition to the reductions from previous plans agreed in the autumn.These sums excluded any reductions which might be negotiated in theUnited Kingdom contribution to the budget of the European Community.The cash limits to be imposed on expenditure in 1980-81 would, ifpresent expectations of inflation were borne out, impose a furtherreduction in the volume of expenditure in that year; but this could notbe calculated in advance.    Meanwhile, savings of some  492 millionin 1980-81, juiJ of  1, 363 million in 1981-82, had been identifiedand tentatively agreed with the Ministers concerned, as listed inAnnex A to his paper C(80) 3.    The changes he proposed in ChildBenefit would yield a further  150 million in 1980-81 and  400 millionin subsequent years.    Since his paper was circulated, however, it hadbecome clear in discussion with other colleagues that these savingswould bear too heavily upon the recipients of these benefits.    If thesereductions were to be in part forgone, others would have to be foundinstead.    His paper identified a number of other areas where furthersavings might be sought, but it was clear that every Department wouldhave to find its share.SECRET
SECRETIn discussion it was stressed that final decisions must be taken at thenext meeting of the Cabinet, in order to keep to the Budget timetable.Further bilateral discussions with the spending Ministers wouldcontinue in the meantime.    Some of the savings provisionally identifiedby the Chancellor of the Exchequer were politically very difficult, andthere were probably other and less damaging economies which could bemade, but it was essential to come as dose as possible to the Cabinet&apos;soriginal targets for reductions in expenditure.The Cabinet then turned to the individual programmes.Secur|ity        The Government was committed by a Manifesto pledge to protectretirement pensions, which accounted for almost two-thirds of the costof social security benefits, against increases in prices.    There was nocomparable pledge to maintain the value of shcrt-term benefits. TheMinisterial Committee on Economic Strategy had already decided thatshort-term unemployment and related benefits should be taxed, startingin 1981 or 1982, and proposals were in preparation for the taxing ofshort-term sickness benefits.    Meanwhile, it would be reasonable toreduce the real value of shcrt-term benefits by approximately theamount of the tax to be charged.    The paper proposed that, to achievethis, short-term benefits should be uprated by 10 percentage points lessthan the movement in prices (if prices increased by 15 per cent over theyear, benefits would be uprated by only 5 per cent).    It was alsoproposed to abolish the earnings-related supplement, though it wasarguable that this could not take effect before 1982 without breachingcontractual rights.    This series of measures would however bearespecially hardly on the unemployed.    In the extreme case, somefamilies would lose up to half their income.    Alternatively, it might bepossible to apply a smaller reduction of the up rating in the value of awider range of benefits;  such a measure could be hold to be consistentwith the Manifesto pledge if it protected beneficiaries against pricemovements but not against the effect of increases in indirect taxation.This more uniform approach would be politically more acceptable if thevalue of personal tax allowances was not increased by the full amount ofthe movement in prices, though this would require an Order to overridethe existing &quot;Wise-Rooker&quot; provision in legislation.    This approachwould help in breaking the cycle of inflation, whereby an increase in theRetail Price Index led automatically to increases in certain items ofpublic expenditure and taxation.    In a situation where those at workwere not protected against movements in prices,   those out of work(however deserving their case) could not expect full protection either.Without such a change in policy, there was a risk of a continued,remorseless shift in resources from the productive to the unproductive2SECRET

It would beinconsistent with the other proposals before the Cabinet to do so.There waj no statutory requirement to uprate these benefits in line withthe actual movement in earnings, which had unexpectedly proved to behigher than the forecast increase in prices on which the uprating hadbeen based.th The proposed increases in prescription charges would, given theexemptions for the unemployed and others, tend to narrow the gapbetween the spending power of those in work and those out of work.This was undesirable in itself, but the increase in charges might benecessary to achieve the full reduction in public expenditure beingsought.ation There was little room for further reductions in the level of expenditureon primary and secondary education.    Support for the polytechnicsshould be re-examined, but this was local authority expenditurecontrolled primarily through the Rate Support Grant (RSG).    It wasalready proposed to uprate student grants by less than the full amountneeded to keep pace with inflation.ipean While it was hoped that the Government would successfully conclude themunity current negotiations, it was not yet known what changes would takeribution effect within the calendar year 1980 or the fiscal year 1980-81.    It wasnecessary to go for as nearly as possible the full amounts of thereductions agreed by the Cabinet in December, without taking accountof possible reductions in the net contribution to the Community budget.Serwe Whether or not uniform cuts were applied to all programmes, therewas a case for particularly close scrutiny of Civil Service manpowercosis.    This might extend to a re -examination of the structure of theService and of manning needs in the various grades.    The CivilService Department would continue to co-operate with other3SECRET
SECRETDepartments in the search for economies.    The Minister of State,Civil Service Department, would in due course circulate a further paperon this and on other means of economising on manpower costs in theCivil Service.    But it was no*, just a matter of efficiency and economyin the use of manpower; to achieve savings it was also necessary to cutout some of the functions on which manpower was presently engaged.Separate discussions were taking place about the size of the defencebudget.    The Government had obligations to its allies and to the ArmedForces which had to be taken into account;  but it was difficult to exemptdefence from the cuts at a time when so many politically unpopulardecisions had to be taken and domestic pledges were also at risk. TheCabinet would need to consider these matters further at its next meetingDespite the exemption previously accorded to the law and orderprogrammes, it was necessary that reductions should be made in thisarea, too, not excluding the possibility of cuts in police manpower.The Home Secretary had already offered savings on the fire service butwould examine all of his expenditures to see what further savings mightbe possible.    There was general agreement that he should not be askedto reduce police strengths.It was generally agreed that the housing programmes, although they hadbeen considerably roduced already, offered significant scope for furtherreductions, and that these would be politically less damaging than manyof the other proposals before the Cabinet.    There was a strongargument for making bigger increases in council house rents, at a timewhen private house-owners were being faced with substantial increasesin their mortgage repayment liabilities.    There was also a case forfurther redcutions in the level of new starts, although it was noted thata considerable proportion of the new dwellings concerned were for theold people and the handicapped.    There was a strong case for bigreductions in expenditure on council house improvements, not excludinghome insulation.4SECRET
SECRETWhile there was undoubtedly room for further reductions in localauthority staffs an across-the-board reduction in manpower wouldlargely duplicate reductions which were already being sought onindividual programmes.    In any case the main instrument of controlwas the RSG, on which the Cabinet had already taken its decision, sothat the opportunity for a further general reduction for the followingyear had already passed.The reductions identified by the Chancellor of the Exchequer werebroadly acceptable, but additional expenditure might be needed on theextension of some of the present special employment measures, and ata time of mounting unemployment it would be difficult to eliminate thesealtogether.    These bids would be further considered by the Ministersconcerned.Further reductions might be possible within the programmes of theDepartment of Industry.A case had already been made for additional expenditure on remedialmeasures in areas affected by possible closures of steel plants. TheSecretary of State for Wales should pursue his proposals further withthe Secretary of State for Industry and the Chancellor of the ExchequerFurther reductions might be possible in the transport programmes.The scope for further reductions was limited by our internationalobligations of multilateral aid, and by our existing bilateral commit-ments, but the aid programme should nevertheless be re-examined,with a view to the identification of further savings. Thisre-examination should extend to the cost of administration.Small reductions might be possible in the level of legal aid in criminalcases.    The Lord Chancellor would consider the matter further.5SECRET
SECRETApart from the possible revaluation of personal tax allowances, therewas a good case for increasing indirect taxes, particularly on petrol,by more than the recent increases in prices.    This might be betterunderstood by the public as a crisis response to financial pressures,than some of the other measures before the Cabinet.    The Chancellorof the Exchequer might wish to consider this possibility in framing hisBudget proposals.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet would defer final conclusions until its meeting in the followingweek.    Meanwhile the Ministers concerned should continue to examine,in consultation with others as necessary, the areas of public expenditurefor which they were responsible in order to identify the necessarysavings.    The Cabinet&apos;s discussion had however shown clearly that noprogramme could be exempt from making a contribution.    It had alsoshown that the Cabinet were disposed to moderate the proposals foi*reductions in social security benefits made by tne Secretary of State forSocial Services and to look for a significantly greater contribution thanthat at present agreed from the programmes of the Secretary of Statefor the Environment.The Cabinet -1. Agreed to resume their discussion the followingweek.2. Agreed that the &quot;earnings shortfall&quot; in theNovember 1979 rates of long-term social securitybenefits should not be made good, and that thisdecision should be announced as soon as possible.Cabinet Office25 January 1980SECRET6
