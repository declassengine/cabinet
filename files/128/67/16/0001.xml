confidentialMENTARY        1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said thatthe Employment Bill would complete its remaining stages in theHouse of Commons on 28 April.    The Bill would be introduced inthe House of Lords later that week and could expect to receive aSecond Reading in that House before the Whitsun recess and toreceive Royal Assent in the week beginning 14 July.    Even if ithad proved possible to secure the passage of the Bill through theHouse of Commons a few days earlier, he understood its progresscould not have been advanced in the House of Lords without riskingdelay on other Bills which were required before the summer recess..The Cabinet1.Took note.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said thatthe new aggregate secretarial and research allowances agreed bythe House of Commons on 4 March had effect from 14 February1980.    While the new application forms were not yet available, hehad agreed that the Fees Office should make the relevant paymentsand the Office had now issued an appropriate circular to Members.He was not yet in a position to make proposals about an approvedpension scheme for Members&apos; secretaries.    There were a numberof factors which it was necessary to take into account to meet thedifferent circumstances of Members&apos; secretaries, including theneeds of those who wished to continue their employment after theage of 60.The Cabinet2.Took note.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said thathe hoped that after consultation with the Minister of State in theCivil Service Department and other colleagues he would be ableto bring a memorandum on the cost of Parliament to the Cabinetwithin the next two or three weeks.   He did not propose to consultthe House of Commons Commission or the Opposition until afterCabinet colleagxies had had an opportunity to consider thememorandum.1confidential
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatit would be important for the public to be made aware that increasesin the costs of Parliament were largely determined by decisionsof Parliament itself and not by the Government.The Cabinet -3.      Noted that the Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster would shortly circulate to the Cabinet amemorandum on the cost of Parliament.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL2.        THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that Rhodesia would becomeindependent at midnight on 17&quot; 13 April.    Events seemed to bedeveloping fairly satisfactorily.    The appointment of General Walls tooversee the integration of the various military forces in the countryhad provided a measure of reassurance to white opinion.    The PrimeMinister, Mr Mugabe, appeared to be keeping his distance from theSoviet Union.    For instance, there were no plans for a Soviet embassyto be opened in Salisbury or a Zimbabwean embassy in Moscow. Sofar the United States and five other Western countries in addition toBritain had agreed to offer Zimbabwe economic aid.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the Defence and Oversea PolicyCommittee had agreed on 15 April that joint measures to supportAmerican sanctions against Iran should be discussed with Britain&apos;sEuropean allies as well as with Japan, Canada and Australia, Themeasures under consideration were unlikely to contribute effectivelyto the release of the hostages and were liable to increase Iran&apos;salienation from the West.    Allied action in support of the United Stateswas nevertheless widely recognised to be inevitable, given the state ofAmerican public opinion, the risk of the United States being driven tomore drastic courses of action and the long-term danger to the cohesionof the Western Alliance.    It was hoped to agree on a first package ofmeasures, which would be relatively innocuous from the point of viewof British interests.    But it would be necessary also to consider asecond and more serious package, for which the Government wouldneed to take legislative powers.    There was a reasonable chance thatallied solidarity would be achieved, although hesitation was fordifferent reasons at present being shown by the French, Italian andDanish Governments.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, aaid that itwas to be hoped that the Opposition would co-operate over any necessarylegislation, which would minimise the danger of damage to the existinglegislative programme; but it was noted that the attitude of someOpposition backbenchers was uncertain.    Legislation should if possiblebe avoided in areas where the Government were already achievingsatisfactory results through persuasion.    For this reason, and in thelight of fears expressed by the Governor of the Bank of England, thereshould at this stage be no discussion with allies about the possibilityof legislating to reinforce existing voluntary measures in the financialfield.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALs        THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the National Olympic Committee(NOC) in the United States had met and decided to boycott the MoscowOlympics.    The German NOC was expected to take a similar decisionnext week; and the French and Japanese NOCs were likely to followsuit.    The Soviet Union was now suggesting that the Olympi: rulesshould be bent so that individual athletes could compete even withoutthe support of their NOC.    Besides the United Kingdom, 31 Governmentshad now corne out against participation in the Moscow Olympics; 16were inclined that way;  14 were unlikely to participate anyway; 20were undecided;  11 were inclined towards participation; and 16, inaddition to the East European Governments, were definitely in favour.Most of the Governments opposed to participation were likely topersuade their NOCs to agree.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that theLord Privy Seal, in consultation with the Secretary of State for theEnvironment, the Paymaster General and herself, should arrange forsuitable publicity to be given to the extent of the growing internationalmovement against participation; and should also consider how furtherpressure might be applied to the British NOC and individual athletes,after the decisions of the German and French NOCs were known.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the Foreign and CommonwealthSecretary and the Spanish Foreign Minister, Senor Oreja, had agreedon a declaration under which the Spanish Government would lift theexisting restrictions against Gibraltar and the British Governmentwould agree to start negotiations on the Gibraltar question.  The makingof this declaration had been agreed between the British Governmentand the Gibraltarian leaders, and it had been made quite clear in publicthat Britain stood by her pledge not to surrender sovereignty againstthe wishes of the Gibraltarian people.    This settlement should openthe way to increased defence sales to Spain,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that theSecretary of State for Trade would be pursuing further with theCommission of the European Community a separate problem in Anglo-Spanish relations which had arisen over trade in cars.    It was difficultfor British exporters to sell cars in Spain.    But an increasing numberof Spanish-made cars were being sold in Britain, often as modelswhich the public regarded as British (eg the Ford Fiesta), Britishpractice in this matter should not be more forthcoming than that ofother members of the European Community.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that in early April, following an incidentin which a policeman had been killed, the Cuban Government hadwithdrawn police protection from the Peruvian Embassy in Havana.The unexpected consequence had been that thousands of Cubans whowished to escape from Cuba had crowded into the Embassy.International negotiations were in progress over the future of theserefugees.    The United States had agreed to take a third of them;and Caribbean Governments were also being urged to co-operate.The events usefully demonstrated the oppressiveness and unpopularityof the Communist regime in Cuba.    As a token gesture Britain wasbeing pressed by the United States and the Peruvian Governments totake 100 of the refugees.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that thisproposal should be discussed by the Lord Privy Seal with the HomeSecretary on the latter&apos;s return from abroad.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the trouble caused by the Britishtelevision film on the executed Saudi Princess appeared to be dyingdown.    But members of the Saudi Royal Family had been instructedto leave Britain;  the forthcoming State Visit of King Khalid to Britainwould probably be cancelled; and it was possible that the SaudiGovernment might feel unable to proceed with the proposed visit ofthe Secretary of State for Defence to Saudi Arabia.    A further problemhad now arisen over the intention of a British television company tomake a film about the case of Mrs Penelope Arnot.    In view of theunpleasant background to this case, and of the danger to British liveswhich might be involved, representations were being made to theIndependent Broadcasting Authority, who had powers to prevent the filmbeing shown.    It was recognised that there was likely to be a majoroutcry in this country if Mrs Arnot1 s sentence, which was at presentunder appeal, were carried out.    But her conduct had placed her in aposition where under Saudi law it would have been at least theoreticallypossible to sentence her to death.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the consequences of the recentassassination at the London Mosque were likely to be serious. Thetwo Libyans who had been arrested by the British police weregovernment officials, though without diplomatic status, and it wasclear that the Libyan Government were involved.    Some action wouldhave to be taken but the situation was complicated by the current unrestin Libya, where there were 5,000 British subjects.    British exports toLibya, currently worth some  300 million a year, might also be at risk,5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that President Telbert, who had paid aState Visit to Britain in 1979 and had played a helpful role in thecontext of Rhodesia, had been killed in a coup d&apos;etat led by a LiberianArmy sergeant.    The new regime now appeared to be re-establishingorder.    No British lives had been lost; but there had been extensivelooting, and one British subject had been raped.The Cabinet -Took note.3. THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the President of the ItalianCouncil of Ministers, Signor Cossiga, was expected to embark nextweek on his second tour of Community capitals to prepare for theforthcoming European Council, now postponed to 27-28 April. Hewould be meeting the Prime Minister in London on 22 April. Neitherthe Foreign Affairs nor the Finance Councils scheduled to meet on21-22 April were likely to advance progress on our budget problem,but the associated informal meeting of Finance Ministers in Sicilymight provide a more useful opportunity for further consultationswith our partners.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD seid thathe had met Signor Marcora and M Mehaignerie, his Italian and Frenchcounterparts, for separate bilateral talks on 14 and 15 Aprilrespectively.    Both had confirmed that they wanted agriculturalprice increases well above the levels proposed by the Commission,and M Mehaignerie had made clear that in French eyes a satisfactorysettlement of our budget problem could not be achieved without parallelprogress on .agricultural prices.    He in turn had made it clearthat we were not prepared to make concessions on prices or on sheep-meat at next week&apos;s Agriculture Council in advance of the EuropeanCouncil&apos;s discussions on the budget.The Cabinet -Took note.6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4.        THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that he andSir Michael Edwardes were agreed that the present dispute with theBritish Leyland workforce, which had led the company to threaten todismiss the strikers, should not develop into a confrontation betweenthe Unions and die Government.    The real conflict was essentiallybetween the Transport and General Workers Union and those whowished to continue working normally.    The Board were planning tosend a letter to each employee&apos;s heme address setting out the factsof the situation.    It was important that any Ministerial speeches onthis subject should not appear to engage the Government directly inthe dispute.     He would agree a proposed speaking note with thePaymaster General for circulation to colleagues.THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT said that London Transport werelikely to offer a 12 per cent pay increase to their workers as themaximum they could afford on their present budget.    This wouldprobably not be acceptable, and it was possible that the negotiationsarranged for next week would break down and that a strike would ensueon the Underground and the buses.    Contingency plans were beingmade and would be put into effect if necessary.The Cabinet -1.Took note.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said mat the 25 per centincrease in public sector pay which had been publicised following hisrecent appearance before the Select Committee on the Treasury andthe Civil Service was valid if applied to central government as astraight year on year comparison between Financial Years 1979-80and 1980-81.    The equivalent figure for the whole of the publicservice was 23 per cent.    It was important to recognise however that,as he had explained to the Select Committee, much of this increasewas the inevitable result of the second stage of the catching upoperation initiated by the previous Government.    It was therefore notinconsistent with the 14 per cent cash limit for the Civil Service and13 per cent for Local Government.    Increases in central governmentpay were below the current rate of inflation.    He proposed shortly toput out a further statement clarifying these points and would providespeaking notes for colleagues.In discussion, it was suggested that recent experience underlined thedangers of centralised pay bargaining,    which put excessive leveragein the hands of small groups of Union leaders.    It was essential tobreak bargaining units down.    It was further sugge sted that the Cleggaward for teachers could pose a presentational problem, in that thelocal authorities were likely to argue that the allowance made for thisCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALaward by the Government in the Rate Support Grant (RSG)negotiations was inadequate and that the Government shouldaccordingly now provide further funds.    In fact the assessment ofthe likely Clegg increase made at the time when the RSG was agreedwas 17. 5 per cent, which did not fall far short of the 19.7 per cent nowrecommended, but use could not be made of this argument withoutrevealing the original assessment.    Moreover further comparabilityexercises, for which similar allowances had been made but notpublicised, were still in train.    One answer might be to say that theGovernment had made realistic assumptions in the RSG for all therelevant Clegg references, that the resulting allowance gave localauthorities reasonable freedom to manoeuvre in their pay negotiationsand that the increases proposed for the teachers accordingly providedno excuse for increases in rates.    Further pressure to findcompensating savings could also be exerted on local authorities throughthe publicity given to the quarterly manpower figures published inrespect of named local authorities by the Secretary of State for theEnvironment; and by mobilising the local Party organisations toinfluence Conservative Councillors.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that onpublic sector pay, Ministers should rebut the impression that25 per cent was the going rate on the basis suggested by the Chancellorof the Exchequer.    These large figures were die inevitable result ofan incomes policy for which die present Government was notresponsible and must end once thia phase was over.    The recent Cleggrecommendations for teachers did not justify any claim for moreGovernment money or for rate increases.The Cabinet -2. Took note with approval of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up ox their discussion.3. Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer tocirculate a speaking note designed to enable the25 per cent increase in the provision for public sectorpay to be put in its proper perspective in relation tothe Government&apos;s policy on cash limits,4. Invited the Secretary of State for Education, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for theEnvironment, to circulate a speaking note aimed atforestalling any local authority demands for extraGovernment money to fund the margin between theallowance made in the Rate Support Grant for theexpected Clegg recommendations on teachers&apos; pay andthe increases actually proposed.Cabinet Office17 April 1980 QCONFIDENTIAL
