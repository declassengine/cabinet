ILIAMENTARYTAWS1.        The Cabinet were informed of one change in the business tobe taken in the House of Commons during the following week.    At therequest of the Opposition, the Motion on the Rate Support Grant(Scotland) Order announced for Monday 14 January would now be takenafter the Motions on the equivalent Orders for England and Wales onWednesday 16 January.    There would be pressure for a debate nextweek on the strike in the steel industry, and possibly also for adebate on the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that there should be a Ministerial statement on thesteel strike when the House resumed on Monday 14 January and thatthe Government should provide time for a debate on the strike onThursday 17 January.    The Competition Bill, due to be taken thatday, should be deferred until the following week.    There should alsobe a statement on Afghanistan on Monday 14 January; any subsequentdebate should take place in the following week, after the Foreign andCommonwealth Secretary had returned from his current visit to theMiddle East, and should be separate from the debate on nucleardefence policy which had been promised.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion.)REIGNrFAIRSghanistand Iran2.        THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the Soviet Union&apos;sinvasion of Afghanistan posed a serious threat to the interests of thefree world, not least in relation to Yugoslavia where President Tito&apos;sillness appeared to be graver than reported.    The invasion hadevoked a strong response from the United States Government, whichhad already announced a number of economic and other counter*-      | ISmeasures.    Efforts were being maide by Britain and others toco-ordinate a Western response within the North Atlantic TreatyOrganisation.    The North Atlantic Council meeting on 15 Januarywould be attended by the Minister of State, Foreign and CommonwealthOffice, Mr Hurd.    The attitude of the French seemed unlikely to behelpful.    The German position was not yet clear.    Action by theEuropean Community would also be needed, to prevent any Communitygrain replacing United States supplies to the Soviet Union and perhapsalso to stop further subsidised sales of butter and other agriculturalsurpluses.    Meanwhile the British Ambassador had been withdrawnfrom Kabul and the Embassy&apos;s small staff had been reduced.British aid to Afghanistan was being stopped, but Afghan studentsalready in Britain were being allowed to remain; many of them hadalready asked for political asylum.   As regards Iran, the mission ofthe United Nations Secretary General, Dr Waldheim, had been afailure.    The United States Government were now insisting  n anearly Security Council vote on a sanctions resolution which seemed1confidential
confidentialunlikely to be adopted.    Her Majesty&apos;s Government and otherfriendly Governments were advising the United States Governmentagainst moving too fast in the light of events in Afghanistan, but thedomestic pressures on President Carter were strong, and within afew days the Americans were likely to ask their principal alliesvoluntarily to implement the terms of the sanctions resolution evenif it failed.    This would present great difficulties.    Meanwhile theinternal situation in Iran was deteriorating, and there was a realdanger of break-up.In discussion, it was recognised that a strong stand was necessaryover Afghanistan in order to mitigate damage to the political interest!of the free world in the face of Soviet  aggression; the West had toooften given an appearance of weakness in the past, eg over Angola.There were also serious dangers involved in not offering theAmericans adequate support, both over Afghanistan and over Iran.At the same time it was important to recognise that Biitain wasmuch more exposed than her main allies to serious economic damageresulting from sanctions or other political measures affecting inter-national trade.    Overseas trade accounted for 30 per cent of Britain1gross national product.    The competitive position of British industrywas already weak and was likely to remain exceptionally difficult inthe years immediately ahead.    As in the case of Rhodesia, Britain&apos;spolitical course needed to take account of her economic vulnerability.Several hundred million pounds worth of British exports were atstake both in the Soviet Union and in Iran, and a number of industriesin high unemployment areas were involved.    Any Soviet ban onexports to Britain would damage the diamond industry and thebalance of payments (because most diamonds imported from Russiawere for re-export), and would affect essential supplies of rawmaterials for which in some cases the only alternative source wasSouth Africa.    The Afghanistan crisis had already led to a damagingrush for gold.    Restrictions on credit terms for the Soviet Unionmight be one area where British political and economic interestscoincided.    But in others the Russians were liable to suffer less thanBritain from economic confrontation.    As regards the MoscowOlympic Games, the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary hadwarned his colleagues that the Government might need to consideradvising British athletes not to take part, not least in the light ofadvice already given about sporting contacts with South Africa. Butthe Government could only advise; it could not enforce its advice.Advice against participation in the Olympics would be unpopular,and the Government&apos;s prestige would suffer if it were ignored.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that asregards Afghanistan the Government should clearly be aware of theeconomic risks involved in any action against the Soviet Union.The Secretary of the C .binet should arrange for officials concernedurgently to prepare a paper setting out the factual background.This should cover trade by Britain and her European partners, notonly with the Soviet Union but also with other East European2confidential
confidentialcountries.    As regards Iran, her importance to the West bothstrategically and as an oil supplier made it desirable for newattempts to be made to co-operate with her as soon as   the currentcrisis in Tehran permitted.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion.2.

The forcesof Mr Nkomo had observed the cease-fire reasonably well; and evenMr Mugabe&apos;s forces had assembled in larger numbers than expecteddespite the accidental death of their military commander. TheGovernor was now faced with major problems over the presence ofSouth African units at Beit Bridge on the South African/Rhodesianfrontier and over his need to use the Rhodesian security forces inan operational role.    Meanwhile, the electoral campaign had begun.In the Governor&apos;s view. Bishop Muzorewa&apos;s electoral prospectsremained reasonably good, despite his somewhat colourlessperformance so far.The Cabinet -3.

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that in preparation for thenext European Council discussion of the United Kingdom budgetproblem he had visited Rome, Luxembourg and, together with theChancellor of the Exchequer, The Hague.    These visits were usefulin obliging our Community partners to focus again on the problem.The Italian Prime Minister, as currant President of the EuropeanCouncil, had expressed readiness to help in finding an acceptablesolution.    He had a personal interest in so doing since hisinvolvement in international negotiations would help to bolster hisinternal political position.    The stability of the Italian Governmentwas a matter of serious concern, and had been further threatenedby the recent spate of terrorist activities in Italy.    The visit toThe Hague had also shown understanding for our case, and evidencethat the Dutch were actively looking at practical ways of meeting ourrequirements.    The Commission seemed to understand that for us itwas essential that reductions in our net contribution to theCommunity Budget  should enable us to make a correspondingreduction in domestic public expenditure, but this would causedifficulty with some of our partners who would want Communityexpenditure in the United Kingdom to be additional.    It would beadvisable not to bring this issue too much into the open.eepmeat eviousjference:3(79) 26thinclusions,inute 3THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthat, before Christmas, the Commission had expected the FrenchGovernment to find ways of complying with the European Courtruling on British exports of sheepmeat to France.    La the event,following a rise in the French market price, the French Governmenthad re-imposed a levy amounting to 43 per cent on lamb imports inplace of their previous quantitative restrictions.    This was whollycontrary to the findings of the European Court and, four monthsafter the Court ruling, made it extremely difficult to justifycontinuing patient discussion of a Community sheepmeat regime.He had protested to the Commission and would be discussing thesituation with Commissioner Gundelach later in the day.In a brief discussion it was noted that the French action did not givethe United Kingdom any right to retaliate but might possibly be auseful precedent in the context of negotiations on the United Kingdomcontribution to the European Community Budget.The CabinetTook note.4confidential
confidential4. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELANDsaid that the Conference on the future government of NorthernIreland had opened on 7 January.    The Democratic Unionist Party(DUP), Social Democratic Labour Party (SDLP) and Alliance Partywere taking part, but the Official Unionist Party were still refusingto do so.    The Conference had survived an initial danger ofbreakdown caused by the SDLP&apos;s insistence on discussing Irishunity, contrary both to the wishes of the DUP and to the terms ofthe British document on which the Conference was based. Thefact that the DUP and SDLP leaders, Mr Paisley and Mr Hume,knew each other well and were fellow Members of the EuropeanParliament was proving of some value.    But the delegates remainedsuspicious of each other and of the Government, and more work wasat present being done in the corridors than in full session.The Cabinet -Took note.5confidential1iR.THERN:landjviousierence:(79) 20thaclusions,aute 1
confidential:ELi STRIKE        5.        The Cabinet had before them a minute to the Prime Ministerfrom the Attorney General dated 9 January and a letter to thePrivate Secretary to the Frime Minister from the Private Secretaryto the Secretary of State for Industry dated 8 January, covering areport by Officials on the Steel Strike,THE PRIME MINISTER said that a small Group of Ministers hadbeen keeping the situation under review.    The time had now comefor the Cabinet to consider the position*In discussion the following main points were made:-Pay Negotiationsa. Thj talks between the two sides had broken down eventhough there had been little difference between the quantumof extra pay on offer (12 per cent) and that demanded(13 per cent).    The difficulty was that the employers hadsought to attach to their offer conditions about productivity -including local productivity bargaining - which wereunacceptable to the unions, in part because local bargainingweakened the position of the central union leadership.b. The British Steel Corporation (BSC) was to all intentsand purposes bankrupt, and further improvements in pay -already above the national average - could be financed onlyby improved productivity or additional subsidies from thetaxpayer.    The unions had already agreed to substantialreductions in the total workforce, and their resistance tothe management&apos;s insistence that the whole of any payincrease must be financed from higher productivity (whichwould necessitate further job losses) was perhaps understand-able.   But other steel industries abroad, faced with sirr.ilarproblems, had already made great progress in tackling them.The BSC&apos;s problems were compounded by the industry&apos;sreluctance to come tp grips with reality quickly enough.c. Coal miners in South Wales were particularly concernedabout the prospects for them as the steel industry contracted.They were threatening to strike later in the month in supportof the steel men.    But Mr Gormley, the President of theNational Union of Mineworkers, was reported to have saidthat any strike in the South Wales coal mine would not bemade national.confidential
confidentialEffects of the Stoppaged. The stoppage in the publicly-owned steel industry wasalmost complete, but most private steel firms were continuinto function.    Moreover considerable supplies of steel wereheld by stockholders - though distribution was affected bypicketing - as well as users, and some imports were gettingthrough.    No major problems had yet been reported byconsumers.    British Leyland might soen be short of steelfor body manufacture and there could be difficulties in thecanning industry; but most consumers appeared to be gettingby for the time being by exercising their ingenuity.Offsetting Measurese. OfLcials might be instructed to examine the scope forthe use of volunteers to move steel supplies by road shouldthis become necessary, but no overt steps should be taken atthis stage.    No action should be taken to bring in steel importthrough non-traditional ports.Other Public Sector Wage Claimsf. There was a risk that any large new settlements in thepublic sector in the near future might encourage the steelworkers to increase their claim or prolong their resistance.There was a good prospect that the Local Authority ManualWorkers would settle at about 13 per cent.    Talks atBritish Leyland were still in progress.    Unions in the watersupply industry were balloting their members on an offer of13 per cent: rejection of the offer could be followed by thethreat of industrial action.    British Shipbuilders&apos; paynegotiations were being protracted.    The British Railsettlement, which in some ways most closely resembledsteel, would not fall due for some time.Strikers&apos; Income 8g. Steel workers were not receiving strike pay. Theywould therefore suffer a very considerable reduction infamily income, even after taking full account of tax rebates(high at the end of the financial year) and of supplementarybenefit payments.    Strikers could finance themselves in theshort term by delaying payment of bills and drawing onsavings, but family pressures might be expected to mountafter a few weeks.    In some areas, strikers saw themselvesas defending their jobs as well as  their pay packets, andthis might prolong their resistance.    The endurance of thesteelworkers might prove to be longer than that of industry.But the longer the strike lasted, the heavier would be theeventual redundancies required if the BSC were to break even7confidential
confidentialnext year.    The strikers were thus putting at risk theirown redundancy payments.    The BSC might be encouragedto emphasise this point in its publicity.Publicityh. Ministers had already received one speaking brief foruse tiie previous weekend, and another was in preparation.It was important that the Government should not be seen totake over the negotiations.    At the same time it had anunavoidable responsibility for the finances of the steelindustry and for the health of the economy.    Without beingdrawn into detail, therefore, Government spokesmen shoulddraw attention to the facts of the case as publicised by BSC,They could also emphasise that no workers were entitled toautomatic pay increases to cover the cost of living,irrespective of their own contribution to the national economy,and that the average steel workers was already over S 10 aweek better off than the average worker in manufacturingindustry as a whole, who was being asked to contributethrough taxation to the subsidisation of the steel industry.The details of the pay offers made were complex, and it wasdoubtful if the workforce as a whole understood them. TheBSC should make greater efforts to get the facts across toits employees.Picketingi. The Home Secretary was receiving regular reportsfrom the affected areas, and the Chief Constables could berelied upon to enforce the law on obstruction, disorder andviolence,    For this purpose the law drew no distinctionbetween primary and secondary picketing.    The reportsso far did net indicate many abuses, although action had beentaken by the police in a limited number of cases.State of the Lawj.    Although the criminal law remained unchanged, therecent House of Lords decision in the case of ExpressNewspapers Limited v. McShane had altered the position t civil law on trade union immunities.      rhose immunitieswere now seen to be much wider than bad been understoodby the Courts in recent years.    The position was thus lessfavourable than it had been generally thought to be a year ago.For all practical purposes, blacking and primary andsecondary picketing by unions was now immune from actionat civil law by injured employers.    The Secretary of Statefor Employment intended to introduce amendments to theEmployment Bill, currently before the House of Commons,8confidential
confidentialto deal with this situation.    There were broadly tworoutes: to define more restrictively - on the lines of theCourt of Appeal&apos;s decisions subsequently overturned by theHouse of Lords - what action taken in furtherance of a tradedispute should attract trade union immunities, or to restrictimmunities to contracts of employment.    As experience hadshown, either course was full of difficulty.    He would bringforward proposals to the Ministerial Committee on EconomicStrategy in the near future, with a view to introducingchanges at the Committee Stage of the Bill.    It would taketime to carry the Bill through all its stages, and it couldnot be expected to influence the current dispute.    The Billshould be viewed in the context of the longer term, not as acontribution to the handling of this dispute.    It would be amistake to accelerate the procedure, or to introduce speciallegislation in a hurry, because this would merely inflametrade union opposition to the Bill.    Any abuses of picketingin the current dispute would swing public and Parliamentaryopinion further behind the Government, and assist the passageof the legislation.Further Actionk.      The negotiations had   now broken down twice, and aninterval was needed before any further moves could be made.The Government should not be seen to intervene directly,but it might wish to work behind the scenes to encourage theparties to seek conciliation by one means or another. Itcould be argued that time was against the Government, andthat the price of an eventual settlement would rise as thestrike dragged on.    Against this view, however, it wasIargued that the long-term credibility of the Government&apos;seconomic policies was at stake, and it could not afford to buyoff a strike.    Ministers would need to give full considerationto the balance of the arguments before deciding on furtheraction.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agrement that the Government should continue not tointervene in the dispute.    The Cabinet would resume its discussionthe following week.    Meanwhile the situation must be kept underreview, adequate public relations must be maintained, and anynecessary contingency planning undertaken.The Cabinet -1.      Invited the Secretary of State for Industry toarrange for officials to consider, without publicity,the possible use of volunteers to facilitate the movementof steel supplies.9confidential

\ROYAL COURTS OF JUSTICELONDON. WC2A 2LL-*05 7641 Exw 3201^      It. fe rftMgoPRIME MINISTER1. I attach a Note on the present law -^p/picketing and blacking.A complete survey was not possible in the space of a day, but I haveoutlined the main provisions of the law which are relevant to theitems we discussed yesterday.2. I am afraid that this gives us little comfort.   The position inrespect of the civil law is worse than last winter when the Court ofAppeal was prepared to restrict the words &quot;in contemplation orfurtherance of a trade dispute&quot; (in s.13(1) of TULRA 197*) with theresult that the courts were able to grant injunctions to restrainsome forms of secondary action (including secondary picketing). Butnow the House of Lords in McShane has stopped all that; theirjudgment largely rules out the prospect of obtaining injunctions.3. At the meeting yesterday we discussed the concept of &quot;lawfulintimidation&quot;.   This was an unfortunate phrase which was used by mypredecessor (Hansard, 25 January 1979  Col 712).   In doing so heappears to have been referring to s.l3(l) of TULRA 1971*-* whichinter alia means that certain threats - which earlier had amountedto intimidation at common law   are made lawful.4. Whether particular threats are protected by s.13(1) and henceare &quot;lawful intimidation&quot; in this sense is a question which dependson the? particular facts and cannot be dealt with satisfactorily inthe abstract.   But in the case we discussed, that of threats of futureblacking made to a private employer not involved in the main dispute,the immunity now given by s.l3(l) could well be available. However,this immunity will not be available in respect of action to implementsuch threats once the main action is over.5. Apart from s.l3(l)(which deals solely in respect of threatswith those which relate to breach of or interference with contract),the general principle is that intimidation is not unlawful unlessthe threat itself is unlawful;   clearly .this would be the case wherephysical violence is threatened, because physical Violence is itselfunlawful.   But in the case of, say, a picket who threatens the lossof a union card, the threat might well be held to be unlawful if(but only if) the picket has no authority to make it and (in accordancewith union rules) there is no prospect of the threat being carriedout.   But a warning in good faith that breach of a union rule maylead to loss of membership is not, of course, unlawful.6.

THE PRESENT LAW ON PICKETING AND BLACKINGNote by the Attorney General for Cabinet1. Htrhia Note outlines the present law on picketing and blacking.The relevant Acts are the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974TULRA 1974) as amended by the Trade Union and Labour RelationsAmendment) Act 1976 (TULRA 1976).   This Note does not deal withthe changes in this area in the Employment Bill 1979 now beforeParliament nor with any future amendments to that Bill which mayaffect the position.Picketing2. Picketing may be broadly defined as action taken by strikers toprocure others to support them in their dispute, whether those othersare fellow workers, substitute labour, customers or suppliers ortheitf employees.   Section 15 of TULRA 1974 provides that such actionis nit illegal if it:-8(a) is in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute(for the meaning of this see 9-10 below);  (b) is not at, or near, another person&apos;s home unless hishome is also his place of work or business; and (c) is solely for the purpose of peacefully obtaining orcommunicating information, or peacefully persuading anyperson to work or abstain from working.This means in effect that no legal proceedings can be brought inrespect of picketing unless in the course of that action somecriB or independent tort is committed.   Relevant crimes wouldinclude obstruction of the highway (both a statutory and a commonlaw offence), unlawful assembly, assault, obstruction of a policeofficer in the execution of his duty, causing damage to property,carrying an offensive weapon and causing a breach of the peace.Relevant torts would include trespass to the highway and privatenuisance.   But it follows from the wording of section 15 that wherethe picketing is entirely peaceful no action would lie under any ofthese heads.   In the case of criminal offences this is qualified bythe overriding duty of the police to uphold the law, which wouldenable them eg to require pickets to disperse where it isantifcipated that they would otherwise cause a breach of the peace.In wractice criminal sanctions are often available under the abovehea&lt;B.3.     Apart from section 15  section 13 of TULRA 1974 as amendedgiv B immunity in tort in respect of picketing which results in oris aimed at breaches of or interference with contracts. Thissection relates to all forms of industrial action and is dealt within 5 and following below./BlackingSECRET
Blacking4..JB This form of industrial action may be broadly defined as actionintepded not to promote the withdrawal of labour but to interfere-with the business of the employer, eg refusal by employees of asupplier to handle goods or provide service intended for the employerin dispute.   Such action is not covered by section 15 of TULRA 1974but section 13 as amended is relevant to it as it is to picketing.Immunity in Tort5. j Section 13(1) as amended gives immunity in tort to any personwho acts &quot;in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute&quot; andthatjact -induces a breach of contract by another person or interferesor induces him to interfere with its performance; orconsists in his threatening that a contract will bebroken (whether he is a party to it or not) or itsperformance interfered with, or that he will induceanother person to break a contract or interfere withits performance.6. Section 13(1) was originally confined to contracts of employmentbut by section 3(2) of TULRA 1976 was widened to cover all contractsand Bence gave substantial further protection in respect of directinducement to an employer to break his commercial contracts.7. a To take advantage of the immunity the defendant must first showthat there is a &quot;trade dispute&quot; as defined in section 29(1) ofTULRA 1974 and secondly that the action taken was in &quot;contemplationor furtherance&quot; of it.   The definition of trade dispute is extremelywide and actions rarely succeed on the basis that the definition isnot satisfied.8. IHPrior to the judgment of the House of Lords in Express Newspapersv McShane (December 1979) the courts, and in particular the Court ofAppem, Had favoured a narrow construction of the words &quot;incontemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute&quot;, thus attempting tolimit the immunity in relation to action that could be said to befar removed from the main dispute.   The Courts had held, inter alia,thatlfehe immunity was not available if the action was not reasonablycapaMe, on an objective view, of advancing the interests of thosein dispute.9. 1 But the House of Lords in McShane has now clearly removed thislimitation.   By a majority of four to one the judges favoured asubjective test, so that any defendant can claim the immunity if hecan show that he honestly believed that the action taken was likelyto advance those interests; there was some difference of view as towhether the court can enquire into the reasonableness of the belief,and grant an injunction in cases where it is not satisfied of this,/but
it the clear feeling of the court (Lord Wilberforce dissenting)is that the courts should be reluctant to substitute their ownldgment for that of experienced trade union witnesses where theitter gave evidence that in their view the action taken was likely3 further the dispute.).       In practical terms the result of the McShane judgment is thatLI kinds of picketing and blacking will be protected from successfulroceedings in tort where the existence of a trade dispute can becoved and the defendant can show honesty cf purpose in relation toae action he took.   The importance of the distinction betweenprimary&quot; and more remote forms of industrial action, both picketingid blacking, is much reduced and the likelihood of injunctionssing granted (under section 17 of TULRA 197^- as amended) isDrrespondingly less.   This applies equally to the grant ofxterlocutory relief, having regard to section 17 (2) of TULRA 1974aserted in 1975*aw Officers DepartmentJanuary 1980SECRET

STEEL STRIKE :&apos; 2nd REPORT OP INTERDEPARTMENTALCONTINGENCY GROUPFollowing the breakdown of negotiations between the BSCand the main steel unions, this paper summarises thepresent strike position, and 6ets out possible coursesof action on the assumption that a prolonged strike isnow probable.Effects of the Strike bo Far2 The attached notes at annexes 1 and 2 give the latestsituation reports on the physical effects of the strikefor producers and consumers of steel, and on the movementof steel, respectively.    The general picture is still thatthe private Bector steelmakers and the stockholders aremostly operating normally, despite a steady increase inthe intensity of picketing.    Steel importB are also flowingfairly normally at least as far as stockholders (thoughsome efforts are being made to black them once they havereached the stockholders). There is no reason at thisstage to alter the original judgment that a strike isunlikely to have significant effects on the majority ofsteel users in under a month.   Indeed heavy last-minutemovement from stockholders to users is likely to haveincreased endurance in many cases by 2 3 weeks.Dealing with a Prolonged Strike       - . .3 Now that negotiations between the BSC and the unionshave broken down, union attitudes towards both privatesector steel production and the transport of steel areexpected to harden.    The ability of steel users to withstanda prolonged dispute will depend on private sector andimported steel continuing to reach customers; transportis probably the more vulnerable area. The following para-graphs consider what might be done, by the BSC, by thirdparties (eg BISPA and the road hauliers) and by government,to minimise the damage which the strike might cause (bothto^productive industry and to the governmentrs.

CONFIDENTIALoverall economic strategy), and thereby to maximise thechances of eventually obtaining an acceptable settlementto the dispute*4 Generally speaking-it still seems best to rely &quot;onself-help on the part of producers, transport undertakings,port authorities etc.   A good deal is going on unobtrusivelyand precipitate public action by Government would still belikelier to endanger their success than to improve matters.5 The immediate areas for action and further contingencywork are as follows:a)   Publicity/Public Handling of the DisputeThe BSC must make every- effort to keep putting its caseacross publicly:   Del Ministers and officials are doingwhat they can to encourage and help in this respect. Itwill be particularly important for them to try to exploitany disaffection &quot;with the strike among the union rank-and-file.   Government must also keep up a steady campaign tokeep the fundamental issues before the public, whilstkeeping off the details of the BSCfs offer. The main theresare that &apos;free money1  (Bill Sirs&apos;s term) cannot be providedby the taxpayer except at the expense of something else -higher taxes, cuts in other public spending or &apos;printingmoney&apos;;   and that the stoppage impoverishes everybody, mos~-of all steelv/orkers themselves, and puts their jobs s.t ris&quot;---Ministers might also privately encourage the CBI and itsmembers to take a helpful line in public, and discreetlywith their unions. But direct appeals to steelworkers are _unlikely to be productive:    like miners, steelv/orkers tendto live in tight and close-knit communities. Relationswith its workforce must remain for the BSC itself.b)     Other Public Sector Wage ClaimsIt will be important to minimise the impact on the BSCnegotiations of other &quot;comparable&quot; public sector wageclaims which may be, or appear* to be, settled on markedlymore generous terms than the BSC offer.   This seemsunlikely in the cases of BL (5$ offer with better workingpractices) and British Shipbuilders (no offer as yet inreply to 20^ claim J.   A 20^ settlement for the Nati onalFreight Corporation is about to be announced, though Thisshould contain a substantial local productivity element;hopefully the latter will be emphasised in publicity. Thelocal authority manual workers, and NITS auxiliaries, see::likely to settle for about 13^ with no productivity strings*,VCONFIDENTIA-T.
CONFIDENTIALthe water workers for a good deal more.   In public, thegovernment can try to narrow attention to loss-makingnationalised industries, and point out .that excessivesettlements elsewhere in the public sector (eg localauthorities) are liable to lead both to job losses indue course and to other public expenditure cuts.c) Picketing,(i) Private Sector SteelworksBISPA has already taken up some cases with the ISTC andthe TUC, on the grounds that their members are not indispute, and have received some assistance from the ISTCleadership. They are taking legal advice on the possibleuse of injunctions against secondary picketing should theproblem snowball.    A direct approach to the TUC by theDepartment of Employment, in terms of the TUC guidelines onpicketing (especially the provision that picketing should belimited as far as possible to theostriker&apos;s own employer,or his customers and suppliers - which should exclude manyprivate steelworks) could have some J?R advantages whetheror not they succeeded, but would put at risk theGovernment&apos;s continued ability to avoid direct interventionin this (and other) dispute.(ii) Enforcement of Existing lav;There are signs of intimidation in spme isolated cases, egthreats to report drivers who cross picket lines with therisk that the-Jr lose their union cards, if the practicespreads there &quot;will be a case for publicly reminding peopleof.their rights to protection.   Intimidation is a criminaloffence, but victims are reluctant to report incidents tothe police, as are witnesses.   There might be scope also foremployers to provide some visible support for their ownworkforces or for road haulage drivers eg by the presence ofvolunteer witnesses at sites where intimidation is to befeared.   Home Office officials will be examining thispossiUility further.(iii) Changes in the Law[The Employment Bill will enlarge the scope for civil actionsagainst secondary picketing, though the decision to initiateaction in individual cases would of course remain with the[aggrieved party.   The criminal law will be unaffected. Itis unlikely that this Bill will be enacted during the courseof the present dispute.d)   Use of Colunteers etc.I(i) TransportIThe roost promising scope for voluntary action lies in roadItransport from the docks and flrom stockholders to users whereregular haulage drivers will not cross picket lines.   In thefiONFTDENTIAL
-4-T^X CONFIDENTIALSfe]   *     &apos;first instance firms in the steel trade itself can beexpected to organise this for   themselves - turningv 1 I owner-operators etc. Government could in the longerrun play a i^le by the discreet use of Regional TransportTfi Commissioners and Dol Regional Offices to   effect liaisonH  between users producers and hauliers eg in alerting thepolice to potential trouble spots well in advance. Buttrade associations would be equally effective and lessprovocative.    Direct government involvement would requirethe procurement of a substantial fleet of vehicles (purch3.seor hire), and the establishment of an organisation &quot;capableof matching users* demands to the availability ofvehicles. The effect on industrial relations in the readhaulage industry generally would be .unquantifiable.Ministers are invited to indicate whether further workshould be undertaken on the practical arrangements necessary(including finance).(ii) PortsY/hile imports may enter the UK ports during the disputethrough channels which do not traditionally handle muchsteel (eg roll-on roll-off container ports), there isunlikely to be much scope for government involvement beyrnithe facilitation of road transport already mentioned. Zzis questionable whether MoD port facilities are large er.curhto make a significant impact&quot;&quot; on UK steel requirements.Government involvement of this kind or any attempt to usevolunteer labour to move steel through the ports themselreswould run a severe risk of provoking widespread industrialaction in the docks, involving products other than steel*6     Farther-reaching Government measures, ranging from tiause of troops and requisitioning vehicles to proscribingcertain forms of secondary action would probably requirethe enactment of new emergency legislation - present legs.1advice is that the existing 1920 Emergency Powers wouldnot cover the present strike. The Interdepartmental Grcurhave not examined this are L in any depth and I believe ~culdneed specific Ministerial guidance about the scope of thepowers envisaged before doing so..

A BOTE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTSTEEL DISPUTE :    TRANSPORT SITUATION 1700 HOURS 7 JANUARY 1980British Rail1. Little to report.   Most of BR&apos;s steel consignments are BSCsteel and as expected there is no movement.   The BR EmergencyCommittee meets again on Wednesday 9 January when new rosterscutting out overtime and weekend working on Freightliners willbefdiscussed.    These new rosters will operate as from Monday14 January and will hit many railmen&apos;s pay packets.Road Transport&apos; |rf^.2. The layoffs reported in the Press are at a level anticipatedby the Industry.    As much as 10% of all traffic in the Midlands&quot;and the North is tied to steel movement.    There are no reportsof  mion refusal to carry steel loads and as yet no evidence ofarm clarification of the TGV/U HQ call for support for steel workers.The Industry continues to report that there is little evidence ofenthusiasm by drivers to support their steel colleagues. Indeed,thore is increasing evidence of a mood to cross picket lines ratherthan lose earnings.    Employers are said to be considering the use ofCourt injunctions where appropriate in an effort to stop secondarypicketing.3. SThe Departraenx is taking soundings from Road Haulage AssociationancjBFreight Transport Association contacts as to what might be doneto move steel over picket lines in the event of a lengthy strike.Ports &amp; Docks4. The British Transport Docks Board and the National Associationof Bort Employers report no major problems today.   After the toughline taken by BTDB at Hull in sending men home without pay forrefiking to load private steel all is now well.   Steel machineryforwussia was loaded on Sunday and steel pylons for Indonesia (thesubject of a refusal on Friday) were loaded today.5. A somewhat sophisticated approach is now being adopted by theTGVTJin that while steel imports are being off-loaded and then moved
by road to stockholders, this is strictly on the understandingthai there they remain.    The aim is apparently to avoid Portcongestion and so protect jobs and earnings of Port workers andlorry drivers.6. lAfter the media focus on King&apos;s Lynn last week there is nonioviment in or out of the Port for steel products and latestreports suggest that King&apos;s Lynn may soon become congested;7. iMany other Ports are reported to be working normally andsteel in crates/containers is being handled at Southampton andDovjlr.8. A late report causes&apos; some concern.   One large Internationaloperator has reported that Townsend Thoresen Ferries have concededa National Union of Seamen&apos;s demand to refuse ro-ro facilities toany lorry carrying steel.   We are now investigating whether otherFerry operators have been subjected to the same pressures andwhat, if anything, might be done about it.TipDepartment of Tran^^^
