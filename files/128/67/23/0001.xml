CONFIDENTIALIAMENTARY  1. The Cabinet were informed of the business likely to be taken inIRS the House of Commons during the following week.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion on the Inter-National Development Association (Sixth Replenishment) Order, to bedebated on 17 June, said that the Government were committed by theirmembership of the International Development Association to the paymentof additional subscriptions to the Association.    The necessary provisionhad been included in the Public Expenditure White Paper.    Looking tothe future, however, the Government&apos;s aim must be where possible toincrease the proportion of the aid budget devoted to bilateral rather thanmultilateral aid, in view of the potential benefits to British industry andcommerce.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion.IGN 2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatIRS the situation in the Anglo-French New Hebrides condominium hadbecome more difficult following an outbreak of violence on the island ofHebrides Tanna.    The French Resident had suggested to the British Resident thata contingent of French gendarmerie should be sent from Noumea to Vila,ous The French had then despatched the gendarmerie, taking British agree-ence: ment to the proposal for granted.    TMs action had been at variance with5) 22nd the French Overseas Territories Minister M Dijoud&apos;s previous statementlusions, that any unilateral precautionary deployment of British troops to Vila2 would breach the principles of the condominium.    Accordingly the Frenchhad been told that a company of British Royal Marine Commandos werebeing sent forthwith to Vila.    The French had replied that, if thishappened, they would withdraw the gendarmerie.    The French motiveswere difficult to understand.    They appeared to be aiming at retaininginfluence with the Francophone community in the New Hebrides and up-setting the new constitutional arrangements which would take effect afterindependence on 30 July.    The Minister of State, Foreign andCommonwealth Office (Mr Blaker), would be having further discussionswith M Dijoud.    The Prime Minister might also have an opportunity toraise the matter with President Giscard at the Venice meeting. Mean-while the despatch of the Royal Marines would be announced.ationaliopmentationishment)1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALhanistanviouserence:|80) 20thiclusions,mte 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that a majorSoviet military effort was being mounted against the freedom fighters inAfghanistan, and there had also been a number of executions in thecountry.    It appeared that the Soviet efforts were encounteringconsiderable difficulties.    There had been an announcement in Pravdathat the three-man committee appointed by the Islamic Conference toinvestigate the problems in Afghanistan would not be received.    This hadannoyed members of the Islamic Conference who would probably wish tobring the issue before the United Nations.lpic Games THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that Sovietdifficulties in Afghanistan were likely to be helpful in gaining support forIvious the boycott of the Moscow Olympics.    He would shortly be seeing theerence: chairmen of a number of the sporting bodies which were represented in20th the British National Olympic Committee to seek to persuade them toIdusions, change their mind about going, and to demonstrate to the West Germansate 2 and the Americans that we still strongly supported the boycott.ndaIviouserence:20thIdusions,ute 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that Ugandawas sliding into anarchy and famine.    The problem was aggravated bythe quarrels which had arisen between the East African Presidents.The Overseas Development Administration was considering ways ofproviding assistance to help to alleviate the famine.| Organisationetroleum|ortingatriesTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the Organisationof Petroleum Exporting Countries had appeared to have reached a comp-romise agreement which would raise some oil prices by $2 a barrelrather than the $4-5 which some countries had been demanding. Theprecise outcome depended upon the decision of the Saudi Arabians, whowere still considering the matter.The Cabinet -Took note.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALMUNITY 3. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said thatAIRS preparations were now being made to implement the new budgetaryarrangements agreed following the Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs)munity on 29-30 May.    Under these arrangements we expected to get the bulk ofthe payments to the United Kingdom during the first quarter of thefollowing calendar year although we had the right to ask for advancei us payments.    In the case of calendar year 1980, this presented difficultyrence: for the Germans, who claimed that they did not have provision withiniO) Zlst their 1980 budget for such payments.    He had discussed the problem withlusions the Federal German Finance Minister and hoped that it would be possibleto reach some understanding before the Council of Ministers on 17 June,which would consider the Community budget for 1980.    It would also bedesirable to have this matter settled before the budget settlement wasdebated in the House.pmeatnousrence:80) 21stelusionsTHE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that hehad spoken to Commissioner Gundelach about the negotiations between theCommission and New Zealand over arrangements for the import of NewZealand lamb into the Community.    Agreement had not been reached atofficial level and Commissioner Gundelach was willing to pursue thenegotiations in Wellington at the political level.    The Prime Ministerwould be able to assure the New Zealand Prime Minister on this point.rts oftoesTHE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said thatsubsidised imports of new potatoes from Greece and Spain had threatenedto cause a collapse in our domestic market.    Imports had therefore beensuspended.    Such subsidised trade would have been illegal if thesecountries were members of the European Community.    In the case ofGreece, the quantities involved were small and imports could probably beallowed under licence.The Cabinet -Took note.CONFIDENTIAL3
CONFIDENTIAL3NOMIC 4. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the latestHOME figure for the money supply ( M3) showed it as still running at the topAIRS of the acceptable range.    The Central Government borrowing require-ment was even more substantially up than had been expected, and bankaey Supply lending had not been reduced by as much as at one time seemed likely.In this situation it would not be possible for the Bank of England toreduce the Minimum Lending Rate for the time being.onal THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that the1th nurses&apos; Whitley Council had agreed to negotiate on nurses&apos; pay within thevice Pay 14 per cent cash limit.    He was hopeful that this would lead to a settle-ment, though there would be problems for some of the union leadersconcerned, who would shortly have to face annual conferences whichcould produce resolutions favouring strike action.    National HealthService administrative and clerical staff, who had a long-standing paylink with the non-industrial Civil Service, were demanding increases of|18| per cent, comparable with those agreed for the Civil Service on thebasis of pay research, and were refusing to settle within a 14 per centcash limit.    It would be essential to deal with this on the same lines asCivil Service pay, by means of a combination of staging and staffreductions.In a brief discussion it was emphasised that many firms in the privatesector were now settling pay claims at levels some way below the rulingrate in the public sector.    It was the more important to be as firm aspossible on pay settlements in the public sector.mical THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said thaticides there was a growing campaign against the use of the ktrbicide 2-4-5T,as being dangerous and environmentally prejudicial.    While he hadpowers to ban the use of such a herbicide, it was settled policy to actonly on the advice of a strong committee, which existed to advise theGovernment on such matters and in which he had confidence.    They hadconsidered this particular herbicide on a number of occasions, and inIevery case had rejected proposals that it should be banned.    It wasimportant that he should act only on the advice of the committee. Hewould not therefore propose to ban the herbicide unless the committeewere so to advise.    In public statements he would say that any evidencethat the herbicide was dangerous would be referred immediately to theadvisory committee, and that, if they advised that it should be banned,he would act accordingly.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIme sticn-makingTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that a localgovernment official in North East England had made a public statementwhich suggested that the sale through Women&apos;s Institutes of jam made byprivate persons was contrary to the law.    He was not convinced thatthis statement was technically correct: if it was, the situation wasclearly totally unacceptable.    He was therefore making a statement, inanswer to a Parliamentary Question, to the effect that the matter wasbeing examined and that, if the examination suggested that there was anydoubt about the matter, the law would be changed in order to ensure thatthe sale of privately-made jam through Women&apos;s Institutes and in suchways was able to continue.I: GwynforansTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WALES said that Mr Gwynfor Evans,the leader of Plaid Cymru, was threatening to go on what he called a&quot;hunger strike&quot; in the autumn.    There could be much tension andunpleasantness in Wales later in the year, if he persisted in thisintention, and there would be a danger that Plaid Cymru would fall intothe hands of extreme left wing leaders.    Every effort was being made byMr Gwynfor Evans&apos;s friends to persuade Mm not to proceed with thisintention.The CabinetTook note.Cabinet Office12 June 1980CONFIDENTIAL
