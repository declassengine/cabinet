1secretThe Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign and Commonwealth Affairs (C(80) 29) assessing the resultsof the negotiations at the meeting on 29 and 30 May of the Council ofMinisters of the European Community on the United Kingdom&apos;scontribution to the Community Budget and related questions and at aparallel meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers, to which wasattached a factual note describing the outcome of those negotiationsand showing how matters had progressed since the Dublin andLuxembourg European Council Meetings.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theproposals set out in his memorandum were the result of a long andlaborious negotiation*   The meeting, in which the Lord Privy Sealhad also participated, had started with the French and Germansasserting that the figures on offer for our budget contribution at theLuxembourg  European Council were no longer on the table. TheGermans were under instructions not to agree to a refund for 1980 ashigh as the one on offer in Luxembourg.    The French had also openedwith a set of unacceptable conditions.   A difficult negotiation had ledto the outcome set out in the annex to his paper.    What was now inprospect was a solution to our budgetary problem covering three years.For 1980 the new proposal would result in a higher net contribution thanthe 538 meua offered at Luxembourg, but the figure for 1981 was withinour target area and represented an improvement on what was availableat Luxembourg, while the refund for the two years taken together cameout higher than was offered then.    Overall it amounted to a refund oftwo-thirds of the net British contribution.    It was accompanied by arisk sharing formula which would set clear limits to our additionalfinancial obligations if the unadjusted net contribution proved to behigher than allowed for in the Commission&apos;s estimates.    There was alsoa satisfactory undertaking that should safeguard the position for 1982.In addition the proposals provided for a major review of the Community&apos;sfinances, in which the Community was pledged to resolve the problem bymeans of structural changes within the 1 per cent Value Added Tax (VAT)ceiling aimed at preventing the recurrence of unacceptable situationsfor any member state.   He had reserved the United Kingdom&apos;s positionon the entire package.    While the proposals did not give us all weshould have liked to achieve, he and the Lord Privy Seal were satisfiedthat they were the maximum we could get short of provoking a majorcrisis that would weaken still further the Community&apos;s capacity to copewith world events as well as its own internal problems.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said thatin the parallel negotiations in the Agriculture Council it had been possibleto secure further improvements in the agricultural prices package, whichnow offered substantial benefits for the United Kingdom including thecontinuation of the butter subsidy, a satisfactory suckler cow premiumand refunds on whisky exports.    The average 5 per cent price increasewas higher than we would like, though it would produce an increase ofonly 0. 7 per cent on the food price index and 0. 15 per cent on the retailprice index.    On sheepmeat, we had been able to secure changes in
SECRETthe Commission&apos;s proposals which would be advantageous to Britishfarmers while providing protection for the interests of New Zealand,There would be no intervention buying in the United Kingdom.Instead there would be provision for deficiency payments to Britishproducers from Community funds.    Under this scheme the guaranteedreturn to United Kingdom producers would be increased by 17 per centin 1980-81, and would rise steadily thereafter as reference prices werealigned over a four year period.    Consumers here would benefitbecause the deficiency payments, and their recovery on lamb exports,would keep United Kingdom market prices down; while the provisionsfor New Zealand gave her in effect a veto over the introduction of thescheme and an opportunity to negotiate on the volume cf her importsintc the Community in exchange for a reduction in the existing tariff.There was provision for export refunds, but Commissioner Gundelachhad apsured him and the Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand thatthey would only be used with the agreement of New Zealand*THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that, although theproposals did not measure up to the full scale of the United Kingdom&apos;sfinancial grievance, we should accept them and use the commitment tobudgetary restructuring to achieve necessary changes in the CommonAgricultural Policy (CAP).    As to the public expenditure implicationsof the proposed settlement, unless we were successful in negotiatingadvance payments, we should get the first refund back in the firstquarter of 1981, before the close of our own financial year.    In thisway, the public expenditure savings in the White Paper would beincreased.    It would be important to make clear that the additionalcommunity spending in the United Kingdom would be in substitution forplanned domestic public expenditure.In discussion the following points were made:-a. FishAlthough our partners had pressed for an undertaking toreach decisions on the Common Fisheries Policy by the endof die year as the price for giving up any mention of equalaccess, it was in fact in our interests to make early progressand avoid being pushed up against a deadline when the presentTreaty arrangements expired,b. Agricultural PricesIt was argued that, while the overall package could be seenas a substantial victory in negotiating terms, it did nottackle the fundamental question of the increased resourcecost of the Community to the United Kingdom, nor would itido more than push the problem of the reform of the CAPforward by one or two years to the time when the VAT ceilingwould force a reappraisal anyway.    It would  then coincide |with growing concern about the costs of enlargement, withthe risk that the Government would enter the next GeneralElection under the shadow of continuing controversy over2SECRET
SECRETmembership of the Community.    Although British farmersmight gain about  200 million from the 5 per cent priceincrease, consumers would pay about  300 million in 1980in higher prices.    Moreover, given that the text of theCouncil conclusions required mat budget restructuring takeplace without calling into question the basic principles ofthe CAP, it was questionable whether any substantialprogress could be made in this area.   Against this it wasargued that the propo sed CAP package produced benefitsfor the United Kingdom both in budgetary and resource terms;that the United Kingdom had never called in question the basicprinciples, as distinct from the modalities and distortions, ofthe CAP; and that ample scope existed for negotiating reformwithin the present framework of the CAP.    In addition, itwas argued that with a budget settlement behind us and thecommitment to budget restructuring, with its reference tounacceptable situations, the United Kingdom should be in astronger position to defend her interests when the VAT ceilingbegan to bite.c. SheepmeatIt was suggested that the proposed sheepmeat regime wouldencourage the over-production of lamb and so increasebudgetary costs in which the United Kingdom would eventuallyhave to share.    Taken along with the increase in agricultureprices, it would also give an additional boost to the CAP itself,both in extending its scope and in promoting further surpluses.On the other hand it was suggested that the new regime wouldhave considerable advantages for upland and marginal sheepfarmers in the United Kingdom, given especially the decline inbeef production.    If the New Zealand Government were in factto veto the scheme - which they were in fact unlikely to do -they would risk adding to the growing divergence of interestsbetween their farmers and British farmers.    The NewZealanders had succeeded in diversifying both their productionand their markets in recent years, and there was a feelingamong British farmers that they had overplayed their hand in theCommunity.    There would be no intervention in the Communityduring the season in which New Zealand exported the bulk ofher lamb, so that present markets should be assured; andwith the sheepmeat problem settled she would stand a betterchance to get a satisfactory deal on her dairy exports.3SECRET
SECRETIn further discussion there was general agreement that the termsproposed were the best that was likely to be achieved, and should beaccepted.    The outcome was the result of long and robust negotiationby the Prime Minister and the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.It should be presented in public positively, as the substantial achieve-ment it was.    The alternative would lead us into a new and dangeroussituation whose consequences could not be foreseen but were likely tohave profound implications at least for our membership of the Communitand perhaps for the future of the Community itself.   Although therewere internal political difficulties in the Federal Republic of Germany,and the German government would not take a decision until 4 June,other Governments had already accepted the proposals and it waslikely that all the partners would accept the deal if the BritishGovernment did so, some of mem had already indicated their assent.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed &apos;he Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s viewthat the proposal emerging from the meeting of the Council of Ministerson 29 and 30 May, though giving the United Kingdom less than wouldhave been ideally desirable, brought about a marked improvement inthe United Kingdom&apos;s budgetary position without damaging concessionselsewhere and should thus be accepted.    This decision should beconveyed immediately to the Italian Presidency and announced inParliament that afternoon.    The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretaryand the Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food(Lord Ferrers) would make statements in the Lords and the Lord PrivySeal and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in theCommons.    Further consideration should be given to the question of adebate.    Meanwhile it would be helpful if the Chancellor of the Exchequeprovided colleagues with a note setting out the details of the budgetsettlement and its effect on the Government&apos;s economic policies.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion,2. Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign andCommonwealth Affairs to inform the Italian Presidencyaccordingly.3. Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrangefor an explanatory note on the content and mode ofoperation of the budgetary settlement to be circulated tothe Cabinet,Cabinet Office2 June 19804SECRET
