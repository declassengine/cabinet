confidentialTook note.N 2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that aS difficult situation had arisen in the Anglo-French New HebridesCondominium, which was due to achieve independence on 30 July. Thebrides party led bv the present Chief Minister, Father Lini, was in power inthe capital, Vila, having won both a general election and local electionsin the island of Santo, where it had defeated a faction led by aMr Stephens.    The latter had now made a unilateral declaration ofindependence in Santo, with the support both of local French and half-caste estate owners and also of a Mr Oliver of the Phoenix Foundation inthe United States.    A number of New Hebridean policemen in Santo hadbeen captured; but the evacuation of British subjects from the island hadnow been completed.    The French Government, like Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment, supported Father Lini; but it was believed in somequarters that the attitude of the French Resident Commissioner wasmore equivocal.    The Minister of State, Foreign and CommonwealthOffice (Mr Blaker), had agreed with the French Overseas TerritoriesMinister, M Dijoud, that one last attempt should be made to reach anegotiated settlement, under which Mr Stephens might be persuaded toclimb down in return for some minor concessions from Father Lini. Ifthis attempt failed, force might have to be used to put down the rebellionwhich could otherwise spread and endanger the Vila Government. IfBritish troops had to be used, with or without French troops, it would bepreferable for them to be Gurkhas.    But the commitment of troopsshould if possible be avoided since it could prove controversial, althoughthe Opposition at Westminster seemed at present disposed to favour theuse of force.1confidentialI  1. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER informedthe Cabinet of the business to be taken in the House of Commons duringthe following week.    Looking further ahead, there was not likely to beany shortage of business for the House before the Summer Recess.There would be debates on the remaining stages of a number ofGovernment Bills, including the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill and theLocal Government, Planning and Land (No 2) Bill.    Time had also to befound for 11 Supply Days and for debates in Government time on a numberof important subjects such as the Government&apos;s constitutional proposalsfor Northern Ireland and the outstanding recommendations of the Reportof the Procedure Committee.The Cabinet -
CONFIDENTIALTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that underthe agreement which he had reached at Lisbon with the Spanish Foreign|us Minister, Senor Oreja, the Spanish authorities had been due to open theInce: Gibraltar frontier on 1 June, as a prelude to talks involving the Spanish,16th British and Gibraltarian Governments.    The Spaniards had however beenIsions, moving very slowly and were now suggesting that talks should precedethe opening of the frontier.    An alternative proposal for immediate talksplus a firm agreement that the frontier be opened on a fixed date, eg30 June, had been opposed by the Gibraltarians.    It was now hoped thattalks could take place simultaneously with the opening of the frontier.Despite their dilatoriness the Spanish Government still appeared to besincere in not wanting to keep the frontier closed, not least in order toavoid unnecessary obstacles to their hopes of joining the EuropeanCommunity.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that thesabotage of oil-from-coal installations in the Orange Free State, and theaccidental killing of a black child by the police in Cape Province, hadhad an unfortunate impact on public opinion in South Africa. Currentnegotiations on Namibia might be adversely affected.The CabinetTook note.|UNITY 3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe meeting on 12-13 June of the European Council in Venice was likelyto be mainly concerned with the discussion of Middle East problems andpreparations for the Economic Summit later that month.The CabinetTook note.4. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT saidpRlTY that, as agreed in the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy, heSNT had met the Consultative Council on Local Government Finance on 3 JuneNDITURE        to call for revised budgets designed to bring local authority spending-81 back into line with the public expenditure ceilings which the Cabinet hadagreed for 1980-81.    In order to win the co-operation of the localauthorities, many of which were now Labour-controlled, he had notspelt out the measures which the Government might need to employ toCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALenforce spending limits.    Some sections of the Press had taken this as asign of weakening resolve on the part of the Government, but he had doneit solely as a means of securing the backing of the local authorityassociations to the issue of a circular calling for revised budgets, whichhe proposed to send out in the next day or so when he had received theirfinal comments.    He would do his utmost to secure the necessaryreductions in local authority expenditure.    There were a number ofmeasures which the Government might take should local authorities notcomply with his request.    None of them would preclude a local authorityfrom putting up its rates to maintain an excess level of expenditure. TheGovernment were, of course, committed to the abolition of rates in thelonger term and he had already instituted a comprehensive review. Hehad now asked officials additionally, and as a matter of urgency, toconsider what measures might be needed if local authorities failed toreduce their expenditure sufficiently; and he would put proposals to hiscolleagues shortly.    The most effective sanctions might involveadditional powers by way of amendment to the Local Government,Planning and Land (No 2) Bill, but he recognised that any proposal to addcontroversial provisions would create difficulties for the businessmanagers in both Houses.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office5 June 19803CONFIDENTIAL
