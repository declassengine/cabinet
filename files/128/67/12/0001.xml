CONFIDENTIAL&apos;lENTARY  1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons before the Easter Recess.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that,following representations from the Select Committee on EuropeanLegislation etc and from the Opposition, it had been agreed through theusual channels that there should be a separate debate on the EuropeanCommission&apos;s paper on the United Kingdom&apos;s contribution to theCommunity budget.    It would start at about 10. 00 pm on Monday24 March and last three hours.The Cabinet1.Took note.snts THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he would refer toproposed changes in social security benefits in his Budget Speech onWednesday 26 March.    It would be for the Secretary of State for SocialServices, on the basis of past practice, to make a more detailedstatement on the subject before the resumption of the Budget debate thefollowing day.    Such an arrangement this year would of course, meanthat a weekend would intervene between the statement by the Secretaryof State for Social Services and the third day of the Budget debate, whichwas customarily devoted to the social aspects of the Budget.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up.a brief discussion, said that someof the Government&apos;s proposals for social security benefits would begenerally welcomed.    The proposed arrangements would, however,provide two opportunities for the Opposition to gain publicity forcriticism of controversial proposals.    The alternative would be for theSecretary of State for Social Services to announce details of theGovernment&apos;s social security plans at the outset of the third day&apos;sdebate.    The Ministers concerned should consider, in the light of theprecedents for aarlier Budget debates, which arrangements to adopt.The Cabinet2.      Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for SocialServices and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,to take account of the points made in discussion inconsidering arrangements for the Government&apos;s handlingof the Budget debate.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe United Nations Commission had come near to solving the problem ofthe American hostages in Tehran, and it was clear thatPresident Bani-Sadr alto wanted a solution; but both had been frustratedby the attitude of Ayatollah Khomeini.    President Carter now facedstrong domestic pressures.  He had written to the Prime Minister askingthat Britain should maintain the voluntary measures against Iran whichhad been instituted in January.    This would cause no immediateproblem.    The internal situation in Iran remained confused, and theelections had been accompanied by much violence and intimidation.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theautonomy negotiations between Israel and Egypt were going badly.President Sadat of Egypt seemed now to be searching for an alternativeway forward and might look for a European initiative in that context.The member countries of the European Community were considering thepossibility of promoting a new Security Council resolution, but it wouldnot be right to do this before the autonomy talks had been concluded,unless the United States Government were positively to encourage anearlier initiative.    Meanwhile President Carter had invited the PrimeMinister of Israel, Mr Begin, and President Sadat to visit himseparately in Washington.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that despitesome difficulty with the French, Britain and her European partnerswere continuing to seek support for the proposed neutrality ofAfghanistan, particularly among countries of the Third World. Someprogress was being made, but no early results were to be expected.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Houseof Commons vote on 17 March had been satisfactory but perhaps notdecisive enough to cause the British Olympic Association to agree toboycott the Moscow Games.    The United States National OlympicCommittee would take a formal decision on 12 April.    They wereexpected by the United States Government to accept a boycott, althoughPress reports suggested that their attitude remained uncertain.Council of Europe Ministers of Sport were meeting at Strasbourg on20-21 March; French insistence that any discussion of the Olympicsthere should be technical rather than political had caused generalirritation and might not in practice affect the tenor of the discussion.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that his recentvisit to Romania had, significantly, taken place at the insistence of theRomanians.    He had found them, despite heavy lobbying by the SovietForeign Minister, Mr Gromyko, very critical in private of the Russianinvasion of Afghanistan and of the Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea;and they also agreed that the Palestine Liberation Organisation had tobe brought to acknowledge Israel&apos;s right to exist.    But they had ofcourse been less forthcoming in public; and President Ceaucescu&apos;sindependent international stance did not prevent him maintaining aparticularly unattractive regime of internal repression.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that eventsstrrounding the fall of the Italian Government were following afamiliar pattern.    The Prime Minister and Foreign Minister wouldremain in office on a caretaker basis; and the Prime Minister,Signor Cossiga, was expected to manage to form a new coalition withthe Socialist Party, who were anxious to be in Government even thoughthere was little harmony between their views and those ofSignor Cossiga&apos;s Christian Democrat supporters.The Cabinet -Took note.3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) had decided that thePresidency and the Commission should explain to the Turks that therewould be considerable difficulties if they were to make an earlyapplication for membership of the European Community (EC). TheTurkish Prime Minister had told him in January that they would notapply for membership until the Turkish economy was on a sounderfooting.    The Turkish economy was in no fit state to support theobligations of Community membership.    On the other hand the EC hadto show its support for Turkey.    The Council of Ministers hoped todeter them from applying to join by offering them more generous termsunder the Association Agreement between Turkey and the EC.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said hehad heard from Commissioner Gundelach that most other memberstates were now pressing for higher increases in agricultural pricesfor 1980-81 even than those prepared by the Commission.    The Frenchand the Germans appeared to want increases of 4-5 per cent; there wasmuch agitation among Danish farmers xor higher prices; and the newDutch Minister of Agriculture had said that he intended to do better forfarmers than his predecessor.    The British Government remainedopposed to increases for products in surplus and, in the House ofCommons debate later that day, it would be impossible fcr theGovernment to withhold support for an Opposition amendment urgingthe Government not to agree to a price settlement which did not includeprovisions for the steady reductions of surpluses.4. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND saidthat there was now general agreement that the Belfast Conference onthe future government of Northern Ireland should be adjourned beforeEaster.    As foreseen, it had not reached agreement; but the Presswere wrong to write it off as a failure.    There had been usefulindications of what each of the parties might in practice be willing toaccept, though not to advocate.    There would now be a pause forreflection, during which he would hold bilateral discussions with eachof the parties and with the Official Unionists.    The Conference mightreconvene some time in May.    Meanwhile he proposed to bring beforehis colleagues, initially in the Ministerial Group under the HomeSecretary&apos;s chairmanship, his ideas for the British proposals whichmight at that stage be put forward.    The position of the OfficialUnionists, who had not so far taken part in the Conference, wascomplicated by the ineffectual leadership of Mr James Molyneux and byhis differences with Mr Enoch Powell, who held the unconvincing viewthat there should be no more devolution in Northern Ireland than inEngland.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that thesomewhat unhelpful public attitude of the Prime Minister of theRepublic of Ireland, Mr Haughey, particularly during his recent visitto Paris, underlined the need to maintain Ministerial contact with theDublin Government.    But a meeting between the Secretary of State forNorthern Ireland and the Irish Foreign Minister, Mr Lenihan, asearlier envisaged, would be open to misinterpretation given the presentstage of the Belfast Conference.    It might therefore be moreappropriate for the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary to talk toMr Lenihan in the margin of the forthcoming meeting of the EuropeanCouncil in Brussels.The Cabinet -Took note.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and the Chancellor of theExchequer (C(80) 23), proposing how the Prime .Minister and theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary should deal with the issae of theUnited Kingdom contribution to the budget of the European Community atthe meeting of the European Council to be held in Brussels on 31 Marchand 1 April 1980.The Cabinet&apos;s discussion and conclusions are recorded separately.Cabinet Office20 March 19805CONFIDENTIAL
SECRETMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCOPY NO QC0  JCABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCC(80) 12th Conclusions, Minute 5Thursday 20 March 1980 at 10. 30 amN The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of State forTY        Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and the Chancellor of the Exchequer(C(80) 23) recommending the lines on which a solution to the problem ofthe United Kingdom&apos;s excessive net contribution to the Community Budgetshould be sought at the meeting of the European Council on 31 March and1 April 1980.   Also relevant was a minute on the same subject dated7 March from the Secretary of State for Trade to the Prime Minister,s,        circulated under cover of a letter of 19 March from the PrivateSecretary to the Secretary of State for Trade to the Private Secretary tothe Secretary of State for Employment.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that sincethe Dublin European Council, at which it was virtually agreed that anamended Financial Mechanism could contribute some 520 MEUA to therelief of the problem, the Commission had proposed that the other partof the solution should be a regulation based on Article 235 of the Treatyproviding for extra spending in the United Kingdom for purposesconsistent with Community policies.    Meanwhile revised estimates ofthe net United Kingdom contribution for 1980 suggested that it might nowbe about 1750 MEUA, instead of the 1552 MEUA on which the Dublindiscussions had been based.    Informal discussions with other membercountries over the last few weeks suggested that the total refund onoffer at the next European Council was inching up, but the highest figurewhich had been mentioned was 1000 to 1100 MEUA.    In addition tosecuring a satisfactory figure, it would be necessary to deal with theproblem of duration and the problem of &quot;dynamism&quot;: the protection ofthe net contribution from unacceptable increases in future years becauseof inflation or charges in the structure and size of the Community budget.The United Kingdom had therefore suggested a formula - namelyagreement that in each subsequent year after 1980 British receipts perhead from the Community budget should bear the same relationship toaverage Community receipts per head as in 1980, though it would bedifficult to get this accepted.    For the medium and longer term weshould look to a restructuring of the budget aimed at reducing theproportion of Community expenditure spent on the Common AgriculturalPolicy (CAP).    This would not be easy to implement because of vestedagricultural interests, but some measure of restructuring was likely1SECRET
SECRETto be forced on the Community by the imminent approach of the1 per cent Value Added Tax ceiling.on own resources.    If it was notpossible to settle the problem at the next Council, the objective mustbe to secure the maximum possible degree of progress towards essentialBritish requirements on the amount of the totrl refund, the duration ofthe Financial Mechanism and the Article 235 Regulation, an element ofdynamism to ensure that the net contribution did not rise again to anunacceptable level in future years, and some commitment on restructuringthe budget.Although we had resisted any link between our budget problem and othercurrent issues, it was clear that the other member states would not beable to justify a substantial concession on the British contribution to thebudget unless they were able to take something home themselves. Inaddition, the French had publicly linked the budget question to CAPprices, sheepmeat, fish and energy.    In the case of fish any linkagebeyond a general undertaking to make progress would be unehlpful to aneventual settlement on the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and weshould seek to avoid it.    On agricultural prices, the French attitudehad put a useful card in our hand, by stating that a settlement of theBritish contribution to the budget would be dependent upon a satisfactorysettlement on agricultural prices.    We should therefore maintain ourbasic opposition to price increases for surplus products at the26-27 March Agriculture Council, but should be ready to make somelimited concession at the European Council if it were necessary to securea solution to our budget problem.    Similarly on sheepmeat, we might, ifnecessary, concede limited intervention and a Community financedpremium to satisfy the French on the interim regime, so long as thepermanent regime gave the United Kingdom a net resource benefit.And, if it would help to secure a settlement, the Prime Minister couldmake a purely presentational statement about our energy policies, as agesture of reassurance to our partners involving no substantiveconcessions.    The response to Chancellor Schmidt&apos;s recent referencesto the desirability of our participating in the exchange rate mechanism ofthe European Monetary System (EMS) was being considered separately.The outcome of the Brussels European Council might be totallyinadeauate, but it was more probable that, without getting all we wanted,it would show some advance with the prospect of a final solution at theJune European Council.    Our reaction would have to be modulated to thedegree of progress made and the need to keep the pressure up.    In hisjudgment, only those present at the Council could decide precisely whatthe situation required.    He therefore invited the Cabinet to give thePrime Minister and himself the discretion to act as they thought right,subject to the objectives set out in the joint paper and any supplementaryguidelines the Cabinet wished to lay down.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER, agreeing with the Foreignand Commonwealth Secretary, said that the question of dynamism wasimportant.    This lay behind our attempt to shift the basir of thediscussion away from the concept of a refund for the United KingdomSECRET
SECRETand towards the idea of an acceptable net contribution.    He agreed thatonly the Prime Minister and the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretarywould be in a position to make an on the spot judgment of what wasneeded*    They should therefore be armed by the Cabinet with the fullestauthority, including the discretion to threaten to withhold our contribu-tions if a solution were not found by the June Council-In discussion of the budget issue there was general support for theobjectives and recommendations proposed in the memorandum by theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary and the Chancellor of theExchequer.    The objective should be to obtain a solution which wouldlast as long as the problem persisted.As to the tactics to be followed if it was not possible to resolve theproblem at the March Council, there was general agreement that, ifthere was no solution of the problem of the British budget contribution,we should have to see to it th.it no progress was made on agriculturalprices - on which other member countries were keen to secure earlyand significant increases, larger than those proposed by the Commission-or on other issues which other member countries were seeking to linkwith the problem of our budget contribution.The fact that the size of our net contribution to the budget made us byfar the largest single paymaster of the Community also gave us anegotiating strength which we should be ready to exploit.    To withholdour contribution would be contrary to Community law and our Treatyobligations; it would be presented as incompatible with the Government&apos;sdeclared commitment to the Community, as calling in question ourcontinuing membership of the Community, and as therefore inconsistentwith our national interest in seeking satisfactory terms for continuingmembership.   Actually to withhold the contribution would be a weaponof last resort, and a decision to that effect should not be taken withoutfurther consideration by the Cabinet and the fullest discussion of itsimplications.    Nonetheless, even if no likely outcome of the MarchCouncil was expected to justify an immediate announcement of withholdingaction, it would be important to bring fully home, both to our partnersand to public opinion at home, the seriousness of the issue and thedetermination of the Government to obtain a satisfactory settlement.There was general agreement that at the meeting of the EuropeanCouncil in Brussels the Prime Minister and the Foreign andCommonwealth Secretary should be armed with the authority of theCabinet to make it clear, if they felt it necessary to do so, that theGovernment would have to consider withholding if a satisfactorysettlement was not reached by the meeting of the European Council inJune.   Nor should there be any question but that they would have theunanimous support of the Cabinet in doing so.    No doubt they wouldcontinue to say that the Government would proceed to such action onlyreluctantly, more in sorrow than in anger, and in full awareness of thesignificance of such a step.    Equally, if the threat was to be credibleand effective, it must be clear that it was one which, in the last resort,the Government would not shrink from putting into effect.3
SECRETIn discussion of related issues the following points were made -a* FishIt was essential that the interests of our fishing industry shouldnot be sacrificed as part of the budget settlement.    Even acommitment to make progress on quotas before June wouldcarry risks, given that the Commission were likely to revivetheir earlier proposals on which the United Kingdom had beenisolated.    The wording of any statement would therefore needcareful consideration.    We could make play with the fact thatthe progress so far registered towards a CFP settlement owedmuch to close Anglo-French co-operation.b. Agricultural Pric sSome concession would probably be necessary in the processof securing a budget settlement, but, if we had to concede anyincrease on milk and sugar, the main products in surplus, itshould be as small as possible.    The effect of increases in CAPprices on food prices in the shops should not be exaggerated:many of the increases proposed would be in intervention priceswhich would not be reflected in market prices.    The currentCommission proposals for an average price increase of2. 4 per cent would, for example, raise the food index by only0. 3 per cent and the retail price index by only about 0.15 per cent.c. SheepmeatDespite our basic preference for a light sheepmeat regime, wecould if necessary to secure a satisfactory budget settlementconcede some limited intervention and Community financing fora transitional period, provided mat the permanent regimeyielded a net resource benefit for the United Kingdom.d. EnergyIt was suggested that any statement on North Sea oil might raisefalse hopes*    Nothing must be said which implied a transfer ofcompetence to the Community.    On the other hand, many of eurpartners had made it clear that they would welcome and be contentwith a cosmetic statement which gave nothing substantive away,and it was politically important for us to be ready to say some-thing positive in the context of an eventual budget settlement. Atext along the lines prepared by the Defence and Oversea PolicyCommittee&apos;s Sub-Committee on European Questions should thusbe available for the use of the Prime Minister at her discretion;but care should be taken about any reference to leng-termcontracts.    It was also suggested that an indication that we were4SECRET
SECRETready to consider extending the Seventh Licensing Roundbeyond the 70 blocks now proposed might be helpful in the budgetcontext, though it was noted that the substantive issue had yet tobe considered in the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy,e. EMSCommissioner Tugendhat had suggested that we were under-estimating the value of the EMS card in the budget negotiations,given especially the importance attached to our participation byChancellor Schmidt.   Against mis it was suggested thatChancellor Schmidt&apos;s desire to see us join was not shared by themajority of Community Finance Ministers.    They understoodthat sterling was still exposed to the volatility inseparable fromits status as a petro-currency and that, if we joined now, theconsequent need to qualify the absolute priority of keeping withinour money supply objectives by reference to exchange rateconsiderations would call into question our determination toreduce the rate of inflation.    This argument might well weighless heavily in the balance, once the effectiveness of theGovernment&apos;s monetary strategy in reducing the rate of inflationwas securely established, and it did not therefore rule out anindication of our willingness to participate in the exchange ratemechanism at the right time and on the right conditions.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the recommendations of the Foreign and CommonwealthSecretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in C(80) 23.    She and theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary would go to the meeting of theEuropean Council on 31 March and 1 April with the objective of securinga satisfactory settlement of the problem of the net United Kingdomcontribution of the Community budget.    They had the authority of theCabinet to decide, in the light of this discussion, whether what was onoffer constituted a satisfactory settlement.   Given the course of eventsso far, and the insistence of other countries in linking to that problerrother issues which would not be ripe for settlement so soon, it seemedvery unlikely that the problem would be settled at that meeting.    In matevent the objective would be to make as much progress as possibletowards a settlement to be achieved at the meeting of the EuropeanCouncil in June.    The Cabinet agreed that, unless and until the budgetproblem was satisfactorily settled, there was no question of agreeingto increases in CAP prices, or indeed of resolving other issues thatwere being linked to our budget problem, such as sheepmeat.    If asettlement of the budget problem was not reached at the meeting inBrussels, she and the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary would havethe authority of the Cabinet to use their discretion, depending on thedegree of progress towards a settlement, and taking account of the viewsexpressed in the discussion at this meeting of the Cabinet, to decidewhether and in what terms to make it clear that the Government would be5SECRET
SECRETobliged to consider withholding some part of our net contribution, if asatisfactory settlement was not reached at the European Council in June,They would al so make it clear that the Government was and wouldremain fully committed to membership of the European Communityand had no intention whatever of coming out of it.The Cabinet -1.

The fact is that we have&quot;raphasised our determination to achieve a fair settlement,nd each time we defer the use of a firm sanction weontribute further still to what I regard as our principalational trait - a lack of national self-confidence. Onlyhe British could see the role of paymaster as one ofeakness.    It is inconceivable that the French would fail) exploit the position of strength ih which we find ourselvesj))     in economic terms I believe that we badly need aLOOOa for the next financial year.    I do not know of thelancellor&apos;s Budgetary plans, but if we are to arrive at a&gt;rrowing requirement which is financeable on non-inflationaryInns I cannot see any room for a significant reduction inIrect taxation, particularly at the lower end.   The combinationI a pending recession coupled with a Budget which will belintcd as being highly regressive, not least because of the forras in capital taxation, will in my view be damaging tof Government - and not ju t ir: the long term.    The availabilivy
of an additional  1,000m enabling a 2p reduction in inconetax or comparable broadly based benefits would make anenormous psychological difference to the country&apos;s mood;(c) the British public have a figure of  1,000m fixedin their minds.    It is around that figure that you personallywill be regarded as having achieved a victory or suffered ^defeat;(d) so far as &quot;the future of Europe is concerned, thecombination of enlargement with the prospect of yet moresubsidy for backward agricultural economies, the runaway costsof the CAP in providing dear food for the EC and surplusesto be dumped outside, the intransigent French pursuit ofshort-term self interests, the forthcoming collision betweenCommunity expenditure and the VAT ceiling, have set the stagefor Britain to take a positive role.   These problems are forthe Community and not for Britain alone.herefore draw two conclusions.   First, it would seem to ne outthe question that we could accept any linkage with the Budgetstion.   To allow the Budgetary problem to influe nee our thinkincrEMS would be folly; the EMS decision must rest solely on itsits.   To allow the French to buy us off on sheepmeat or tochase our fishing rights or energy supplies with our own moneyId be depicted as a defeat, and seen as such in the country*ondly, ray inclination is that if v/e cannot accept whatevertlement is offered at the March summit v/e should announce planswithholding on our return.    The proposals set out in paragraph 6Annex A to 0D(80)18 seem to me to be well presented and thoughtough.   Obviously the risks are very great but having nailed ourpurs to the mast at Dublin we cannot afford to haul then covinin now.   YJe should not under-estimate the strength or our positioSECRET2
in the Community or in the political field at home.    The Communityis dependent upon us both to provide a  1,000a .subsidy and aprotective market for its overpriced agricultural produce. The(Cooaunity is on the verge of admitting Portugal, Spain and Greece;the notion that it night expel us to admit new net cash beneficiars ridiculous.    Criticism of a determined attempt to protect ourational interest even at the expense of breaking the club rulesjouli be regarded by the public, and in the Conservative Party,s unpatriotic.    Our critics would be portrayed as fighting underhe French flag.[e would of course be highly unpopular in provoking a major summito consider the future of the Community, but I do believe thathere is now a clear advantage in forcing a more positive approachather than tagging along in what the electors see to be a shamblesam copying this minute to all members of OD and Sir Robertrastrong. ijppartaent of Tradeictoria Streetdon, SVH(Dictated by the Secretary ofState and signed in his absenlarch 1930
