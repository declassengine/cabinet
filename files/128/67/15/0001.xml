CONFIDENTIALMENTARY        1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inS the House of Commons during the week beginning 14 April.ecurityill THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Ministers concerned should consider further, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the ParliamentarSecretary, Treasury, which Departments should be represented onthe Standing Committee on the Social Security (No. 2) Bill, and whoshould wind up the Second Reading debate.The Cabinet -Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for Employment,the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Secretary ofState for Wales, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterand the Parliamentary Secretary, Treasury, to givefurther consideration to he choice of Governmentspokesmen for the Social Security (No, 2) Bill onSecond Reading and in Standing Committee, and to reportthe outcome to the Prime Minister.2.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARYS said that on the previous day it hai looked as though tha UnitedState* hootag j  in Tehran \rere about to be transferred to theIranian Government&apos;s control, but President Bani-Sadr had nowsaid that the latest United States statement on the subject had beeninadequate.    The situation was therefore confused.    In the view ofHer Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, however, some progress towards ae: settlement of the problem had probably been achieved.Ith&gt;ns,THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theSchmidt      recent visit to Britain of the Chancellor of the Federal Republic ofGermany, Herr Schmidt, and his SLoreign Minister, Herr Genscher,had been notable for its excellent atmosphere.    Discussion ofsubjects other than the European Community had concentrated onIran, on East-West relations and on the Middle East and Africa.The meeting had indicated a complete identity of views on thesetopics and had established a relationship which would be of majorvalue in the future.The Cabinet -Took note.1CONFIDENTIAL
confidential3.        THE PRIME MINISTER said that, although it was clearfrom her talks with Chancellor Schmidt, and the Foreign andCommonwealth Secretary&apos;s parallel discussion with Herr Genscher,that it would be unduly optimistic to count on other Members of theEuropean Community (EC) being willing to find the amounts of moneythat would be required for a satisfactory solution of the problem ofBritain&apos;s net contribution to the EC Budget, the talks had taken placein a good atmosphere.    On the related issues, she had resistedChancellor Schmidt&apos;s pressure for any package to include a series ofprinciples for solving the fisheries problem.    But she had acceptedthat it was reasonable to try to settle other outstanding problems inwhich other countries had an interest, like sheepmeat and possiblyagricultural prices, within the same timescale as the budget issue,provided that they were dealt with on their merits.In a brief discussion it was reported that President Giscardappeared from a recent statement to have abandoned the idea of alink between fish and the budget; and that, after consulting theLord Privy Seal, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Foodhad responded favourably to a recent approach from his Frenchcounterpart suggesting bilateral talks on matters of mutual interestbefore the next European Council.The Cabinet -Took note.4. THE HOME SECRETARY said that there was a possibilityof industrial action by Scottish water workers, who unlike theircounterparts in England, had not yet reached agreement with theiremployers.    The danger point was still probably a week or moreaway.    The Civil Contingencies Unit had met and the Secretary ofState for Scotland had discretion to take certain precautionary steps,in consultation with other Ministers concerned, if they should provenecessary.    A further meeting of the Unit would be held if required.In his absence abroad the Secretary of State for Employment hadkindly agreed to act as its chairman.The CabinetTook note.Cabinet Office3 April 1980
