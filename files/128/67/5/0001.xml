confidential1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.2.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the Soviet Union was now estimated to have about 85, 000 troopsin Afghanistan and to have suffered 1, 000-1, 500 casualties. Thesatisfactory outcome of the Islamic Conference in Islamabad hadbeen enhanced by its decision to reconvene again in three months&apos;time.   The joint statement issued by President Giscard of Franceand Chancellor Schmidt of Germany, after their summit meetingon 5 February seemed on balance to indicate that they had movedcloser to the British position; a careful reference to the positionof Third World countries no doubt reflected President Giscard&apos;srecent meeting with the Indian Prime Minister, Mrs Gandhi. TheBritish approach to the crisis had now been set out in a draftStatement of Principles, which had been well received when tabledat the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the European Communityon 5 February with a view to its being considered for endorsementby the Ministers at a further meeting on 19 February. Meanwhilesome 40 governments had now come out against attendance at theMoscow Olympics, although it did not follow that their nationalOlympic committees would all follow suit.    The Council ofMinisters&apos; meeting on 5 February had made some limited progresson this issue, on the basis of a German suggestion that theGovernments of the European Community could not support theholding of the Games in Moscow unless the Russians created therequisite atmosphere, which they seemed unlikely to do. TheAmericans had agreed to call a meeting of certain key governmentsto consider the Olympic problem in Washington on 12-13 February,which it was to be hoped both the French and the Germans wouldagree to attend. *In the course of a brief discussion it was noted that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment had not yet decided what their attitude would be, orwhat advice they would offer potential British participants, if theInternational Olympic Committee decided in favour of going aheadwith the Games in Moscow.   It would certainly not be appropriateto withhold passports.    Much might depend on whether theAmericans decided to hold alternative Games, eg in Los Angeles.confidential
confidential|a THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theIUxdted Nations Security Council Resolution on Rhodesia had been aregrettable development.    Britain&apos;s friends on the Council hadnee: voted for it only from fear that the Africans might otherwise have14th reverted to a more extreme text which Britain would have had tosions veto: that would have led to a meeting of the General Assembly at2 which the African Resolution would no doubt have be en widelysupported*    The speeches made by the representatives of friendlycountries in explanation of their vote had been helpful (particularlythat of France); they could usefully be referred to eg in answeringParliamentary Questions on the subject.   It was now likely that ahostile resolution would be passed at Hie current Organisation ofAfrican Unity meeting in Addis Ababa; but this was not expected toprovoke further activity at the United Nations.The Cabinet -Took note.2confidential
confidential3.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat, during a long tete-a-tete the previous weekeni withMonsieur Francois-Poncet, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs,he had argued our case on the Community Budget.    The discussionhad been friendly; but the French were still taking a very toughline and were expecting a quid pro quo.    It did not seem that thesubsequent Franco-German summit meeting had been particularlyhelpful either.    There was however a general feeling in theCommunity that there were more important things waiting to be doneand that the United Kingdom budget issue should, if possible, besettled soon.In a brief discussion the following points were made -a. It remained important to achieve an early andsatisfactory settlement.    It was still the United Kingdom&apos;sobjective to settle the issue by the time of the EuropeanCouncil at the end of March.b. The Institute of Fiscal Studies had recently publishedestimates suggesting that the total effect on the UnitedKingdom of the budgetary and non-budgetary costs of theCommon Agricultural Policy (CAP) amounted to a netresource transfer of  2,200 million a year. Comparisonswith world prices were difficult to make and officialestimates suggested that this figure was somewhatexaggerated.    Nevertheless, there was no doubt that theCAP represented a sizeable resource cost to the UnitedKingdom and to certain other Community countries.c.        Some of our Community partners were now seekingto argue that the case for a large reduction in the UnitedKingdom&apos;s net contribution to the European Budget wasweakened because the United Kingdom, alone in theCommunity, was benefiting from the rise in oil prices; thatargument could and should be firmly countered.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that for somemonths the UnsLtod Kingdom had bsen pressing the EuropeanCommunity to take action against imports of synthetic textiles fromthe United States of America.    Import penetration irto the UnitedKingdom market by the United States of such products had risensteeply during the course of this year.    The Commission hadrejected action on a Community-wide basis but accepted that therecould be certain regional problems.    He had sought to persuade3confidential
confidentialCommissioner Davignon to agree to Community action on acrylicyarn, nylon carpet yarn and tufted nylon carpets anu a formal requestfor the introduction of quotas for those three products would be madethat day.    It was not yet clear whether the Commission would bewilling to act on all three of them.    They had to take a decisionwithin five days of receiving the formal request.   If they refused,there was in his view no choice but for the United Kingdom to actunilaterally in accordance with the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade (GATT) and Community procedures.   There was a riskthat, if that was done, the Community might require the UnitedKingdom to remove the restrictions at the March meeting of theCouncil of Ministers, although we might expect to get some supportfrom Italy and France.In a brief discussion, it was pointed out that the United States werestrongly opposed to action against their exports and the Commissionwere concerned lest selective action of the kind we were seekingwould lead to a general growth in protectionism and the unravellingof the recently concluded multilateral trade negotiations.    Nor wouldit be good for our general relations with the Community if, in amonth&apos;s time, we were forced to withdraw unilateral measures. Onthe other hand, the origin of the situation lay in the artificially lowfeedstock prices in the United States and there was little doubt that,if the United States were in a similar position, they would reactvigorously to safeguard their domestic industry.   Jobs had alreadybeen lost in this country as a result of the surge in United Statesimports.    The situation was particularly acute in Northern Ireland.The Government&apos;s readiness to protect industries in particulardifficulties, which had been favourably noted by the Trades UnionCongress, would not be credible if no action was taken.The Cabinet -Took note. *4. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELANDsaid that the Conference on the future government of Northern Irelandwcw inn   ccfedi&amp;vdlag the Social Dpxoooratic Labour Party&apos;s proposalsfor the gttveraaioat of the Province, which were wft.il not out and lessextreme in tone than had been feared.    The participants had at lastunderstood that the Government&apos;s approach to the Conference was aserious one and that there was no British formula waiting to beimposed if the Conference failed.    No party seemed disposed to walkout, and the number of meetings to be held in February had beenlimited only by practical considerations - for instance, ttie obligationsof certain participants to attend meetings of the European Parliament.The Cabinet -Took note.confidential
confidential1.Took note.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that BritishLeyland (BL) management were considering that day their responseto the inquiry by the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workersinto the dismissal of Mr Derek Robinson and the demand for hisreinstatement.    The union was indicating informally a willingnessto compromise on the basis that, if Mr Robinson was reinstated inhis employment, he would be removed from union office. Themanagement&apos;s reaction to this was not yet known, but they wouldbe very reluctant to reinstate Mr Robinson.    The results of theballot among BL&apos;s employees on the management&apos;s pay offer wasexpected early in the following week: the outcome was veryuncertain.   A strike on either issue could have the gravestconsequences for BL&apos;s future, particularly in the light of thecontinuing decline in its share of the domestic market, to only15 per cent in January, which was a long way short of the target forthe year as a whole set in their most recent corporate plan. The5confidential5.        THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said thatnegotiations were due to be resumed the following lay between theBritish Steel Corporation (BSC), the Iron and Steel TradesConfederation (ISTC) and National Union of Blastfurnacemen.Mr Sirs of the ISTC had been mistaken in stating that there had beena &quot;silent U-turn&quot; in the Government&apos;s position: the Government&apos;sbasic stance had not changed.    The purpose of these statementsmight, however, be to justify the unions&apos; decision to reopennegotiations with BSC.In discussion the following points were made -a. While the prospects for a settlement looked morehopeful than in recent weeks there were still considerableuncertainties.   In particular Mr Sirs might have considerabledifficulty in persuading the ISTC Executive to accept asettlement on terms the BSC was likely to be able to afford.b. Picketing remained generally peaceful, though therewas a risk of confrontation at the private steelworks atSheerness, where large numbers of pickets were expectedduring the day.    The police were, however, reasonablyconfident that they could contain the situation.The Cabinet -
confidentialJanuary figures did not, however, reflect the effects of the currentsales campaign, which only began towards the end of the month.The Cabinet -2.        Took note.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said duringnegotiations on 1 February the water industry employers hadincreased the offer to their manual workers to 13.2 per cent plusa further  4 per week to take account of the employees&apos; claim forcomparability with the gas and electricity industries; this produceda total of 19.2 per cent.   In addition, the employers had offered toreduce the working week by 1 hour from the next annual settlementdate.    The employers had not consulted him in advance about this.If they had done so, he would have cautioned them against makingsuch an offer in view of the possible repercussions in otherindustries.    The union negotiators were recommending theirmembers to accept the offer and it was likely that the recommendationwould be accepted.In discussion it was noted that this settlement could have awkwardrepercussions in Scotland.    The water workers there would pressfor comparable increases; but in Scotland the water workers werelocal authority employees, and any comparable increases for themcould lead to catching up demands from sewerage workers and otherlocal authority employees in Scotland who had settled at the samerates as English local authority employees.    Moreover, the waterworkers were in a closed shop with their supervisors, who wouldbe likely to be involved in any industrial action.The Cabinet -3.Took note.THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT said that the Port of LondonAuthority management had recently indicated that, unless therewere a significant improvement in working practices by the followingJune, closures would have to take place in the Upper Docks. Theunion reaction had been muted.    At the same time the unions hadrejected a 12 per cent pay offer and a series of strikes was planned.These were unlikely to be prolonged, and had not so far affected otheruocks.    It was not clear whether the strike action would spread toTilbury.The Cabinet -4.Took note.confidential
confidentialolTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that adispute had arisen among ancillary workers at the Zloyal LiverpoolHospital over new work rotas which the management wished tointroduce.    Negotiations had been going on for a very long time,and most but not all the employees had accepted the new arrangements.Among those who had not agreed to the new rotas were kitchenstaff, a strike by whom could be very disruptive. The presentsituation was confused, since it had been reported that a settlementhad been agreed .locally which had been repudiated nationally by theNational Union of Public Employees.In discussion it was reported that officials had reviewed the situationin the Civil Contingencies Unit (CCU).    There might be some scopefor volunteers, but the management feared that many would bereluctant to cross picket lines.    The use of servicemen was likelyto be counter-productive and should be contemplated only as a lastresort.    The situation was being kept under review, and it wouldbe open to the Secretary of State for Social Services to request ameeting of the CCU at Ministerial level at any time.The Cabinet -5.Took note.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that BritishShipbuilders were on the point of beginning their annual wagenegotiations.    Their aim would be to achieve a settlement thatwas as far as possible self-financing.    The possible repercussionson British Leyland and the British Steel Corporation were beingkept very much in mind.The CabinetTook note.confidential
confidentialTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said thatthe Cabinet had previously agreed that the recommendations of theprevious TSRB report on the pay of Members of Parliament (MPs)should be implemented in three annual instalments in June 1979, 1980and 1981.    The TSRB1 s present report examined proposals forlinking MPs&apos; pay with other salaries or with general indices; thereport also dealt with a number of other issues left outstandingfrom their last report, the most important being secretarialallowances.On pay linkage, the TSRB had concluded that there was nosimilarity between the functions and responsibilities of MPs andany other professional groups, and no easily identifiablerelationship in terms of pay.    They had repeated their earlierview that the best solution to keeping the pay of MPs up to date layin regular independent reviews, but that, if some form ofautomatic updating was required, the least unsatisfactory methodwas by reference to the New Earnings Survey (NES). Afterconsulting the Executive of the 1922 Committee, he had concludedthat the best solution lay in agreeing to annual independent reviewsby the TSRB.    It would not be possible to give a formalcommitment, as the 1922 Committee wanted, that the recommendationsof future reviews would be automatically implemented, but theGovernment should be as forthcoming on this as it could.    He wasalso exploring the possibility of avoiding a full-scale annual debateon MPs&apos; pay or at any rate reducing as much as possible the scopefor controversy and embarrassment which such debates were aptto engender.    On this basis his proposals should be acceptable tothe 1922 Committee.As to secretarial allowances, the report proposed that the presentallowance should be replaced by two separate allowances withmaxima of  5, 500 for a full-time secretary and of  1, 250 forpart-time research assistance.    The TSRB considered that thereshould be better accountability for these allowances and thatpayments should be made direct to the employees concerned by theFee8 Office.   They had also suggested that there might beadvantage if MPs&apos; secretaries were employed by the House ofCommons rather than by individual Members.    He recommendedthat the Government should strongly urge MPs to arrange paymentto their staff through the Fees Office but should not oblige them todo so.    He did not favour the TSRB&apos;s suggestion that secretariesconfidential6.        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster (C(80) 10) about the thirteenth reportfrom the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB) on Parliamentary payand allowances.
confidentialshould be employees of the House; this would be likely to causedifficulties for some MPs and for other staff of the House, and toincrease costs.In discussion, the following points were made -a. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster&apos;sproposals for regular annual reviews of MPs&apos; pay, ratherthan formal linkages, should be accepted.    This year&apos;sincrease for MPs was likely to be high, since it wouldinclude the second instalment of last year&apos;s increase plusfurther updating; but it could be defended as an inevitablecatching up from the position inherited from the lastGovernment.b. The Government could not give an absolutecommitment to implement the recommendations of futureannual reviews, but a similar assurance could be used tothat which had been given in the case of other review bodygroups, to the effect that recommendations would beimplemented unless there were compelling reasons to thecontrary.c. The TSRB had proposed that all travel by MPs onParliamentary business in this country should be reimbursed,and not just travel between home, Westminster and an MP&apos;sconstituency.    This recommendation should be rejected, asit amounted to an open-ended commitment, was open to abuse,and would appear to put MPs on an unjustifiably favourablebasis.d. The recommendations for increasing secretarial andresearch allowances were likely to encourage criticismsthat these allowances were abused.    This would beparticularly likely if (as was suggested in discussion) thesecretarial and research assistance allowances wereamalgamated to provide greater flexibility.   A firmrequirement that allowances should be paid through the FeesOffice would help to remove the possibility of abuse, butwould be unpopular with Members.   It might, however, bepossible to require MPs who wished to claim secretarialand research assistance allowances to indicate on theirclaim the name of the person who was to receive the benefitof the allowance and possibly to indicate whether they wereemployed on a full or part-time basis.   It was of course opento the Inland Revenue to look carefully into individual cases,though in practice claims allowed by the Fees Office wereprobably not generally challenged by the Inland Revenue.9confidential
confidentiale.        There was a strong case for examining moregenerally the scope for greater accountability and costcontrol in the running of Parliament.    On the face of itsuch control was inadequate when compared with mostother parts of the public sector.   It was symptomatic thatParliamentary expenditure had increased in real terms byabout 10 per cent per annum over the past five years. Itwas not obvious, for example, why food and drink in thePalace of Westminster had to continue to be subsidised,now that salaries were on a more realistic basis; and someunnecessarily high expenditure appeared to have beenincurred in recent refurbishing and redecoration of thePalace of Westminster.    Staffing levels in some areasseemed unnecessarily high.    In addition the requests andrequirements of Parliament appeared to be imposing anincreasingly heavy burden on Government Departments.One estimate suggested that senior civil servants spentone-third of their time on preparing answers to ParliamentaryQuestions and dealing with correspondence from MPs. Thenew system of Departmental Select Committees was likelyto impose still greater burdens.    There was a strong casefor a wide-ranging enquiry to cover every aspect of thecost of Parliament.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said the Cabinetaccepted the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster&apos;s recommendationon MPs&apos; pay.    In particular they agreed that MPs&apos; pay should bethe subject of annual reviews by the TSRB.    The Governmentcould not commit itself to the implementation of such reviews inall circumstances, but the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancastercould indicate that the Government intended to implement suchrecommendations unless there were compelling reasons to thecontrary.    On allowances, the Cabinet accepted that twosecretarial and research assistance allowances should beintroduced at the levels proposed by the TSRB.    They did notfavour amalgamating the two allowances to allow switching betweenthem, but agreed that the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancastershould consider further, in consultation with the Fees Office, whetherthere was any scope for some measure of flexibility between the twoallowances which would not be unduly vulnerable to abuse. Theyfurther agreed that it would be preferable if MPs would normallyarrange for the payment of secretaries and research assistantsthrough the Fees Office; but the Government should not seek toinsist on this, because it would not be appropriate in every case.The Cabinet rejected the TSRB&apos;s proposals for changes in thesystem of travel allowances and agreed that the existingarrangements should remain in being.    They accepted the TSRB&apos;s10confidential
confidentialremaining recommendations, including those on support allowancefor Ministers in the House of Lords.    The Chancellor of the Duchyof Lancaster should discuss the proposals on secretarial andresearch assistance allowances further with the Executive of the1922 Committee, with the Fees Office, and perhaps with theParliamentary Labour Party.   In his discussions the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster should stress the need for accountabilityof expenditure and explore means of achieving this, for examplethrough an obligation on the part of MPs to name the recipients ofallowances and indicate the proportion of their time which they weregiving to the employment which the allowances were intended toremunerate.    He should then report back the results of thesediscussions.    The Cabinet would consider further how best toexamine the scope both for improving control over costs moregenerally in the Palace of Westminster (including the expenses ofrunning both Houses of Parliament) and the scope for reducing coststo central Government in answering Parliamentary Questions andcorrespondence and in dealing with Select Committees.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister.2. Agreed that there should be annual independentreviews of MPs&apos; pay and that an indication could oe giventhat the Government would hope to implement the findingsof such reviews unless there were compelling reasonsagainst doing so.3. Noted that the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterwould consider further the most appropriate Parliamentaryprocesses for giving effect to increases in MPs&apos; pay.4. Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterto discuss further with representatives of opinion in theHouse, and the House authorities, the methods of paymentof secretarial and research assistance allowances and theproblems of accountability and report back to the Cabinet.5. Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,in consultation with the Minister of State, Civil ServiceDepartment, and other Ministers as necessary, to preparea memorandum for the Cabinet on how best to examine thescope for reductions in and controls of the cost ofParliament, including the costs falling on GovernmentDepartments in meeting the demands made upon them byMembers of Parliament and Select Committees.11confidential
