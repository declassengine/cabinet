CONFIDENTIAL[mENTARY  1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.THE HOME SECRETARY said that the Opposition would be providingmost of the time for the debate on Immigration on Monday, 10 Marchwhich would last from 7 pm to 11. 30 pm.    They could thereforedetermine the form of the debate.   It was possible that they wouldtable a Motion referring to the Report from the Home Affairs SelectCommittee on the proposed new immigration rules and theEuropean Convention on Human Rights.   If so, the Attorney Generalmight have to speak during the debate: it would be preferable toavoid this, but there might be no choice in the matter.In discussion, reference was made to the vote on outstandingsupplementary estimates to be taken at 10 pm on Monday. Therewould be no opportunity for debate and the Division shouldinterrupt the Immigration Rules debate only briefly. BackbenchMembers might seek, however, by raising points of order, toregister a protest that the House was expected to pass thesupplementary estimates without debate.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatdepending on the form of the debate on the Immigration Rulesdetermined by the Opposition, it might be necessary for theAttorney General to speak.    The Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster should consider the precedents for the raising of pointsof order on the Motion approving supplementary estimates.The Cabinet -1.        Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster to examine the precedents forraising points of order about SupplementaryEstimates and the opportunities for limiting theinterruption of business.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIALTHE HOME SECRETARY said that the remaining stages of theChild Maintenance Orders (Annual Uprating and Exemption) Bill,sponsored by Mr Robert Taylor, would take place on Friday14 March.    The Bill was not acceptable to the Government and,following discussion at Legislation Committee the previous day, heand the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster had both seenMr Taylor in the hope that he might agree to withdraw the Bill.It seemed unlikely that he would do so.   It would therefore benecessary to try to talk out the report stage of the Bill, even thoughovert attempts by the Government to prolong proceedings on the Billwould be seen by supporters of the Abortion (Amendment) Bill,which was the next Bill down for debate, as an attempt to blockprogress on that Bill.    He was arranging for amendments to beprepared which Government supporters might table for the ReportStage of the Bill.In discussion it was pointed out that Mr Taylor believed that he hadmade amendments to the Bill which met the objections previouslyseen by the Government.    The principle of the automatic upratingof maintenance payments had support among Government backbenchers.On th 3 other hand, it was strongly argued that the provisions of theBill were unacceptable because they would create greater injusticein the operation of the divorce laws.   Automatic uprating ofmaintenance would worsen the position of the husband and secondwife as against that of former wives, and add to the criticism alreadymade of the present law.    The Bill would also call for increases instaff and add to tl e work of the courts.In discussion of the Parliamentary handling of the debate, it waspointed out that it might be difficult to find Government supporterswilling to prolong debate on Mr Taylor&apos;s Bill in view of the largenumbers of MPs interested in the progress of the Abortion(Amendment) Bill.    On the other hand, the opponents of theAbortion (Amendment) Bill might seek to prolong the debate. Itwas in any event unlikely that the Report Stage of the Abortion(Amendment) Bill could be completed in anything less than a fallday.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Child Maintenance Orders (Annual Upratingand Exemption) Bill should not be allowed to make progress if itcould be prevented.    No further pressure should be put onMr Taylor to withdraw the Bill, but the arguments of principleagainst its provisions should be deployed in the debate.    Every effortshould be made by way of the tabling and discussion of amendmentsto ensure that the Report Stage of the Bill was talked out. Ifnecessary, however, the Chief Whip should seek to ensure that itwas defeated at Third Reading.2
CONFIDENTIALThe Cabinet -2.        Invited the Chief Whip, in consultationwith the Home Secretary, to arrange that theChild Maintenance Orders (Annual Up rating andExemption) Bill should be prevented frommaking further progress.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said thatagreement had been reached through the usual channels for theCommittee Stage of the Employment Bill to be completed beforeEaster and for the Government&apos;s new clauses on immunities to bediscussed during an extended Report Stage.   It would be helpful ifthe publication of the Social Security (No 2) Bill could be deferreduntil after the Committee Stage of the Employment Bill had beencompleted; otherwise the timetable agreed with the Oppositionmight be put at risk.    Subject to that point, he hoped that thearrangements would enable the Bill to be sent to the House of Lordsin time for it to complete its passage there and receive Royal Assentby the beginning of July.The Cabinet -3.        Took note.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE saidthat he had been advised that the Government were likely to losethe clause in the Education (No 2) Bill which would enable localeducation authorities to make charges for school transport.    It wasopposed by Catholic Peers of all Parties, by Labour, Liberal andcross-bench Peers, and even by some Government supporters. Ifthe clause were lost in the House of Lords it would be very difficultto restore it in the House of Commons; and, even if that attemptwere successful, the House of Lords might well throw out the clauseagain, thus jeopardising the prospects of the Bill becoming lawbefore Easter.    The Government had estimated that the introductionof school transport charges might save  20 million in 1980-81, andincreased sums in future years.    The savings to be made by thoselocal authorities who had decided to charge were, in fact, likely toreach  20 million in the coming year.    The best chance of gettingthe school transport clause through the House of Lords would be tomake a further amendment limiting its operation to two children ina family.    There could be no guarantee that this would secure its3CONFIDENTIAL
confidentialpassage, but some Government supporters and cross-bencherswould accept the clause on that basis.    Such an amendment wouldbe popular in the House of Commons where similar amendmentshad been tabled at Report Stage, but not been reached under thetimetable Motion.    He sought the agreement of the Cabinet to puttingdown the amendment he had described.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that in the circumstances the Secretary of Stateshould seek to amend the school transport clause, limiting thecharging powers of local education authorities to two children in afamily.The Cabinet -4.        Invited the Secretary of State for Educationand Science to arrange for the necessary amendmentto be tabled to the Education (No Z) Bill beforediscussion of the school transport clause in Committeeof the House of Lords.confidentialTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that on4 March the House of Commons had debated the Motions he hadtabled following the Cabinet&apos;s decisions on the recommendations ofthe Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB) on Parliamentary Pay andAllowances.    There had been free votes on the Motions, and theoutcome had not been altogether satisfactory.   An amendmentsupporting some form of linkage of the pay of Members ofParliament (MPs) with that of outside groups had not been pressed,and an amendment that would have increased the allowance forsecretarial and research assistance to&quot; 11, 000, rather than 6,750 as proposed, had been defeated.    The House had, however,passed three amendments against his advice: first, there had beena large majority in favour of an additional allowance of  675 to MPsfor payment into an approved pension scheme for their secretaries;second, the House had voted to double the severance paymentsproposed by the TSRB for Members who lost their seats at a GeneralElection after serving for ten years or more and who were aged 50or over; third, the House had voted to implement the TSRBrecommendation that travel allowances should be available fortravel on Parliamentary business in any part of the United Kingdom.The increases proposed in the amended Motions would not take effectunless the Government indicated their support for them.    He hadindicated during the debate that the Government would accept thedecisions of the House in principle, while reserving their position on4
CONFIDENTIALtiming and on the detail of the proposals.    He thought arrangementscould be made to meet some of the misgivings that had beenexpressed about the lack of accountability for the allowances, andhe had it in mind, if the Cabinet agreed, to work out detailedproposals in consultation with the House authorities and to bringthem to the Cabinet before Easter.In discussion of the proposed allowance for pensions for secretaries,it was said that the Accountant of the House would be able to ensurethat the additional allowance of  675 was paid direct to an approvedpension fund.   It would be necessary to ensure that only onepension allowance was paid for each secretary even though somesecretaries worked for two or three MPs.    The severance payproposed by the TSRB might more properly be called a redundancypayment, since it was not paid to MPs who resigned or did not standfor re-election, but only to those who were defeated at an election.The increased amounts, although better than the State scheme, werenot especially generous when judged by the redundancy pay availableunder some private or public schemes; the cost to public fundswould not arise for four years and would be small.    The positionof thjse MPs whose seats disappeared because of a redistributionof constituencies or whose constituencies were affected by boundarychanges needed clarification.    Concern was expressed about thelack of accountability for claims for travel allowances.   It wouldbe necessary to consider arrangements whereby Members gaveadvance notice to the Accountant of journeys on Parliamentarybusiness outside their constituencies for which they intended toclaim the allowance, as well as having to give strict account oftheir journeys after the event.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet accepted that it would be inadvisable to seek to go againstthe decisions taken by a free vote of the House.   In working outdetailed proposals the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster shouldtake account of the points made in discussion, particularly asregards the position of secretaries working for more than one MPand the need to prevent abuse of the increased scope for claimingtravel allowances.    He should bring his proposals to the Cabinetin due course.The Cabinet -5.        Agreed to accept, in principle, theamended Motions passed by the House duringthe debate on the report of the Top SalariesReview Body on Parliamentary Pay andAllowances.5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL6.        Invited the Chancellor of the Duchyof Lancaster to bring forward detailedproposals for implementing the Motions,taking account of the points made in discussionand of the outcome of the discussions which heproposed to have with the House authorities.2.        THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the Rhodesian electionshad passed off quietly.   The result was unexpected, but Mr Mugabe&apos;sreaction to his victory seemed so far to have been responsible andmod-rate.    He would be forming a coalition government withMr Nkomo, and might include Mr David Smith or another whiterepresentative.   General Walls would be staying on to oversee theintegration of the three armies.    The Governor would be makingrecommendations about the timing of independence and of his owndeparture.   The two would be simultaneous, and should not be longdelayed.    But there was a case for avoiding precipitate action,which would not be welcome to Mr Mugabe and would damage themorale of the white community.    There should now be no problemover international recognition.   The reactions of the leaders of theFront Line States had varied considerably.    President Machel ofMozambique had behaved helpfully and would be congratulating thePrime Minister on her Government&apos;s achievement.    The Presidentof Botswana, Sir Seretse Khama, had also offered his congratulations.President Kaund 1 of Zambia and President Nyerere of Tanzaniahad preferred to give credit for the outcome to, respectively, theRussians and the Chinese.    The reaction of the South Africans hadso far been restrained.    But it seemed likely that the problem ofNamibia would now become more difficult to resolve.The Cabinet -1. Took note.2, Invited the Lord Privy Seal to preparemessages of congratulation which could be sent by the Prime Minister, on behalf of the Cabinet,to the Governor, the Commander of the monitoringforces, the Election Commission and the Britishpolice contingent.6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the United Nations Commissionhad not so far succeeded in securing the release of the United Stateshostages in Tehran, or even access to them.    It seemed likely thatthe President of Iran, Mr Bani Sadr, had been overruled in thematter by Ayatollah Khomeini.   If the Commission returned empty-handed, there would be strong domestic pressure on President Carterto take new measures, which could well make the situation even moredangerous.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the British proposal for theneutrality of Afghanistan had now been put to the Soviet Ambassadorin London and by the British Ambassador in Moscow to the SovietDeputy Foreign Minister.    Other Western governments weresupporting this on an individual basis, since it had not provedpossible to arrange a collective initiative by the member countriesof the European Community.    The Russians had not rejected theidea, though they were insisting upon guarantees of &quot;non-interference&quot;as a prior subject for discussion.   Whether they would agree to itwas likely to depend on how difficult their situation became, bothinternally in Afghanistan and internationally.The Cabinet -3.        Took note.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the British Olympic Associationhad on 4 March postponed for three weeks a decision on whether totake part in the Moscow Olympics.    The Association&apos;s Chairmanhad appeared before the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House ofCommons and in response to criticism there had indicated that theirdecision was likely to be influenced if a resolution on the subjectwere to be adopted by Parliament.    Meanwhile, the United StatesGovernment were anxious to press ahead with plans for alternativegames, which would be discussed at a meeting of like-mindedgovernments in Geneva on 12-13 March,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that,if there were alternative games, the rowing, equestrian and divingevents could probably be held in Britain. There might be costs ofup to S.j million involved in Britain&apos;s participation in such games.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said thatshe would give further consideration to the possibility of aParliamentary vote, and to the basis on which it might be held, inconsultation with the Home Secretary, the Lord Privy Seal, theSecretary of State for the Environment, the Chancellor of theDuchy of Lancaster and the Chief Whip.    In order to give politicalimpetus to the discussions at Geneva, the Government should berepresented at Ministerial level, as the Australian Governmentalso proposed to be.    Expenditure of up to  7 million could beauthorised to support alternative games and British participationtherein; but there could be no question of the Governmentcompensating those who might suffer financially as a result ofcancelling plans to attend the Moscow Olympics.The Cabinet -4. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.5. Invited the Lord Privy Seal, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for theEnvironment, to arrange for a Minister to attendthe proposed international meeting in Geneva.6. Agreed that, in the event of the Secretaryof State for the Environment being unable to findthe necessary money from within his existingdepartmental vote, up to S.f million might bemade available from the Contingency Reserveto support alternative games.8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL3.        THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that, at a meeting earlierin the week, the Irish Foreign Minister had shown a readiness tobe reasonably helpful over a solution to the problem of the Britishcontribution to the Community budget, although the Irish would notthemselves expect to be left financially worse off.    Officials hadmet the Commission staff in Brussels and provided informationwhich demonstrated that there was no shortage of programmes andprojects on which additional Community money could be spent inthe United Kingdom.    The Commission staff were reasonablyrelaxed about the question of additionality, but as little as possibleshould be oaid in public about the need for additional Communityfunds to be applied to reducing our public expenditure.   At theCouncil of Ministers (Agriculture) on 3-4 March no decisions hadbeen taken on agricultural prices for 1980-81 and the French hadbeen manoeuvred into a minority in refusing interim arrangementson sheepmeat.    From the point of view of negotiations on thebudget problem, it was satisfactory that France remained in aposition of illegality and the Commission were now likely to applyto the European Court for an interim injunction against them. Onthe possibilities of additional Community expenditure for theUnite! Kingdom steel industry, the Commission now acknowledgedthat the United Kingdom had applied for all the monies available toher.    Discussions were still continuing from which it might provepossible to secure a modest amount of further financial aid.The Cabinet -Took note.9CONFIDENTIAL4. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELANDsaid that the Conference on the future* government of NorthernIreland was now addressing the central issues of how a devolvedexecutive would actually function and what was to be the role ofthe minority community and its elected representatives. Eachof the parties was naturally emphasising the merits of its own caseand the weaknesses of others.    But some interesting similaritiesof approach had emerged on a number of detailed issues. Theparties were also increasingly aware of the need to evolvearrangements acceptable to each other and were less inclined to ,see the British Government as the main obstacle to progress,though memories of past failures might in the end prevent themfrom volunteering the necessary concessions.    The Governmentwould therefore almost certainly have to table their own proposalsin due course.    The Conference was likely to adjourn just beforeor after Easter, having been once through its full agenda.    He would
confidentialat that stage report to colleagues on the position and on the nextsteps, and woulo conduct bilateral discussions with each of theparties including the Official Unionists.    Thereafter he wouldaim to reconvene the Conference, if possible with the OfficialUnionists present, and if necessary put forward British proposals.The public would need to be kept informed and a debate inParliament would probably be needed.    Meanwhile, he had beeninterested to note the ideas which Mr Brian Mawhinney MP had putforward in a Press article and subsequently in a paper circulatedto the Conference.The Cabinet -Took note.6.        THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT saidthat the unions represented in the steel industry had now joinedforces, following a lead given by the Trades Union Congress (TUC).It was said that the purpose of this alliance was two-fold: tostrengthen the hands of the unions in negotiations with the BritishSteel Corporation (BSC), and to improve the effectiveness ofindustrial action; it was doubtful, however, whether it would haveany significant effect on the level of industrial action or on themovement of supplies.    Mr Sirs, the General Secretary of the Ironand Steel Trades Confederation, had expressed the hope that theBSC, which had always wished for more joint negotiation at national(as opposed to local) level, would press the unions, as part of anysettlement, to agree to more joint negotiation at national level infuture.    On pay itself, there was still a large gap between the twosides, and it would be optimistic to hope for an early conclusion tothe negotiations which were expected to be resumed shortly. Thepressures on the trade union side were, however, increasing, andthey would probably not wish to break negotiations off, even if an10CONFIDENTIAL5.        The Cabinet resumed their discussion upon the means to beadopted to ensure compliance with the cash limit on the CivilService vote.The Cabinet&apos;s discussion and conclusions are separately recorded.
CONFIDENTIALearly settlement was not concluded.    To achieve a settlement theBSC would probably have to improve a little on their present offer;it was reasonable to hope, however, that they would not need tomove too far, even though Mr Sirs was still talking about 20 per cent.THE HOME SECRETARY said that picketing had become for themost part very quiet, and the pickets were reported to be dismaland dispirited,    A tiresome dispute had arisen between Hadfieldsand the South Yorkshire Police, in which Hadfields were suing theSouth Yorkshire Police Authority for damage to property, while theSouth Yorkshire Police Authority were suing Hadfields for the costof policing outside Hadfields.    The action taken by the managingdirector of Hadfields was not welcome to his proprietors, andneither action seemed to have great prospects of success.    It wasto be hoped that the dispute would be settled without coming to court.The Cabinet -1.Took note.Rates       THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER drew the attention ofthe Cabinet to the fact that inflationary pressures across the worldwere bringing about a general rise in the level of interest rates.Even in the Federal Republic of Germany the equivalent of the primerate had risen to 9i per cent, and the corresponding rates in otherleading industrialised countries were 11 per cent in Japan, 14 per centin France, 17% per cent in the United States and 20 per cent in Italy.These international trends helped to put the rise in domestic interestrates into perspective.The Cabinet -Took note.11CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that there had beena meeting of the National Economic Development Council (NEDC)the previous day.   In a general discussion of the economic situationand prospect the atmosphere had been realistic and constructive,without any attempt to provoke confrontation.    The GeneralSecretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) had said that themeeting was very useful, and that the TUC hoped to continue todiscuss certain aspects of the matter.    The TUC were beginningto acknowledge the importance of pay bargaining. BothSir Raymond Pennock, for the Confederation of British Industry,and the Governor of the Bank of England (the latter attending NEDCfor the first time) had made effective contributions.The Cabinet -3.

secretMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCOPY NO    J gCABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCC(80) 9th Conclusions, Minute 5Thursday 6 March 1980 at 10. 30 amRCH     THE PRIME MINISTER recalled that at their discussion the previousweek upon a cash limit for the Civil Service vote the Cabinet hadagreed that, in so far as the provision in the vote so cash limitedwas not enough to finance the pay settlement resulting from thenegotiations which the Minister of State, Civil Service Department,had been authorised to undertake, the balance would have to befound by further reductions of manpower.    Ministers in charge ofDepartments had been invited to give immediate consideration to themeans of reducing the costs of manpower in their Departments byZ-2j per cent in 1980-81.    The preliminary soundings that had beentaken on the prospects for the pay negotiations now confirmed thatit would be essential to achieve an overall saving of manpower atthe upper end of that range.    She would be sending out a minuteasking that every Minister in charge of a Department should findat least Z\ per cent in 1980-81.    Exceptions would have to be verylimited indeed, and confined to prison officers and a few very smallDepartments which would be unable to accommodate a cut of asmuch as 2j per cent.    If there were to be any question of greaterflexibility, it would have to be flexibility both ways: if someMinisters wanted to find less than 2$ per cent, others would haveto be asked to find more, so that the overall average was as near2j per cent as possible.    The Minister of State, Civil ServiceDepartment, would be getting in touch with Ministers in charge ofDepartments to confirm the necessary reductions.In discussion the following points were made -a.        It would help in achieving the reductions proposedif there could be greater scope for premature retirement.It would be helpful if the Civil Service Department couldconsider a modification of the present very limitedpossibilities.1secret
secretb. The prospects for Staff Side acquiescence inmanpower reductions would be diminished if it becamenecessary to resort to compulsory redundancies.  It hadso far been possible to avoid compulsory redundancies,and in some Departments a policy decision had been takennot to resort to them.   A normal rate of wastage shouldmake that possible.c. It would be helpful for Ministers to be given guidanceon what should be said to Departmental Staff Sides about thenew round of manpower reductions.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that it should be an object of policy to avoidcompulsory redundancies if at all possible, and that improvementsin the arrangements for premature retirement were to be regardedas preferable.The Cabinet -1. Took note that the Prime Minister wouldbe issuing a minute on the need for manpowerreductions in the Civil Service averaging as near2-f per cent as possible in 1980-81.2. Took note that the Minister of State, CivilService Department, would be getting in touch withMinisters in charge of Departments to confirmthe necessary reductions.3. Agreed that only as a last resort shouldcompulsory redundancies be adopted as a meansof achieving manpower reductions in the CivilService.4. Invited the Minister of State, Civil ServiceDepartment, to consider, in consultation with otherMinisters as appropriate, the possibility of improvedterms for premature retirement from the Civil Service.5. Invited the Minister of State, Civil ServiceDepartment, to arrange for Ministers to be givensuitable guidance on what should be said toDepartmental Staff Sides about the new round ofmanpower reductions.Cabinet Officesecret
