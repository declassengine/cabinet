CONFIDENTIAL1. THE PRIME MINISTER welcomed the Lord President of theCouncil and on behalf of all his Cabinet colleagues extended warmcongratulations on his achievement as Governor of Rhodesia and goodwishes both to him and to his wife for the remaining weeks 01 hismission there.THE LORD PRESIDENT GF THE COUNCIL said that he had been mostgrateful for the unfailing support of his colleague s and for themagnificent performance of the British troops and police involved.There had been three major British objectives: to settle the Rhodesianproblem and disengage; to avoid damage to 3ritish interests elsewhere;and to prevent an extension of Soviet influence in the area.    The firsttwo hr d effectively been achieved.    There was a good chance that thethird objective could also be met, provided the Government were able toshow understanding and imagination in their approach to the geopoliticaland financial issues involved.    Mr Mugabe might be labelled a Marxist,but he was not behaving like one.    He saw that his country needed theprivate sector and needed the whites.    He Would be subjected topressures for change from other African States and from his ownsupporters; but the pace of Africanisation had been so slow hitherto thathe world have much initial scope for extending it without serious damageto other interests.    He did not want to fall under Soviet influence. Thecountry desperately needed reconstruction following the long civil war.The problem was a limited and short-term one. Approximately 550 million would be needed, over a period of about three years. Itwould be hard to persuade other countries to help unless Britain gave alead; but if Britain could contribute perhaps a sixth of the total therewould be a good prospect of holding later in the year a successful donors&apos;conference in Salisbury which would bring in the United States and Japanas well as the European Community.    The West should seize itsopportunity, both in Zimbabwe and in Mozambique, wherePresident Machel&apos;s outlook was similar to Mr Mugabe&apos;3. Privatecapital would have an important role to play and the City of Londonshould certainly be involved.    The role of the Export Credits GuaranteeDepartment, which could be crucial in this context, needed furtherexamination as the Secretary of State for Trade was now aware.Mr Mugabe wished to adhere to the Lome Convention and was in touchwith the European Commission.    He was also negotiating secretly withthe Jouth Africans for the continuation of the existing arrangements fortrade and financial assistance.The Cabinet -Took note.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of theDuchy of Lancaster and the Acting Leader of the House of Lords(Earl Ferrers) (C(80) 22) about the legislative programme for thecurrent Session, and a memorandum by the Lord Chancellor (C(80) 21)recommending the introduction of the Contempt of Court Bill.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that theGovernment were making reasonable progress with what the Cabinet hadalways recognised would be a heavy programme of legislation.    It hadbeen necessary to find time for two additional Bills: the Health Services(Invalid Direction) Bill and the forthcoming Social Security (No 2) Bill.The most serious problems in securing the passage of the wholeprogramme would arise in the House of Lords.    The preparation of anumber of Bills, including the Films Bill and the Contempt of Court Bill,for which time might have been found earlier, had been delayed. Hisview, and that of the business managers in both Houses, was that the onlyBills that could now be added to the programme were those financialmeasures which would not require lengthy debate in the Lords. TheCoal Industry Bill and the Port of London (Financial Assistance) Bill fellinto this category, but neither the Energy Conservation Bill nor theFilms 3ill did so in their present form.    He recognised the importanceof the Contempt of Court Bill; but it would gravely prejudice thepresentation of the Government&apos;s programme as a whole if this Bill, orany other, were now introduced in the knowledge that its chances ofbecoming law this Session were virtually non-existent.THE ACTING LEADER OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS confirmed thedifficulties facing that House.    If Parliament sat until 8 August, as atpresent envisaged, a further four weeks at least would be needed afterthe Summer Recess to complete the present programme.    There was noleeway for unexpected delays.    If further Bills requiring substantialdebate in the House of Lords were added to the programme, theGovernment would risk losing one of the major Bills already introduced.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that the Contempt of Court Bill had beenpromised in The Queen&apos;s Speech.    It was ready for introduction andwould implement the main recommendations of the Philllmore Report of1974.    It would bring the law of contempt into line with the obligations ofthe European Human Rights Convention as defined by the European Court;and it contained provisions dealing with the increasingly urgent problemof the secrecy of the deliberations of a jury.    The introduction of the Billwould be generally welcomed, and a Second Reading debate would helpidentify the relatively small number of provisions which might provecontroversial,    He recognised that the chances of the Bill becoming lawthis Session were not high, and he would be prepared to see the Bill takeits chances with others, once it had had a Second Reading.    Its intro-duction would, however, enable advantage to be taken of any unforeseendevelopments with other Bills affecting the programme.    Failure to2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALintroduce the Bill -would itself attract criticism of the allegedmismanagement of the legislative programme, and there would becriticism that a Conservative Government was not giving sufficientpriority to legislation relevant to the good government of the country.In discussion the following points were *nade -a. There was general recognition of the importance of theprovisions of the Contempt of Court Bill.    On the other hand, itwas likely to provoke substantial debate in both Houses, and didnot have to meet operational or financial deadlines as did otherBills in the programme.    It might be preferable, therefore, toindicate now that it would be introduced into the Lords at thebeginning of the next Session, when it could be given clearpriority.    The possibility of publishing a White Paper was notattractive:  a Bill was already drafted, and the previousAdministration had published a Green Paper - and had beencriticised for failing to introduce legislation.b. There was general agreement that Bills limited to essentialfinancial provisions could be added to the programme siivce theywould not require lengthy debate in the House of Lords. TheseBills included the Coal Industry Bill, the Port of London(Financial Assistance) Bill, which should be ready for intro-duction shortly, a Bill on the finances of the White FishAuthority and those provisions of the proposed EnergyConservation Bill that altered the statutory supply obligations ofthe British Gas Corporation.    Consideration should be given tocombining some or all of these provisions in a single Billrelating to the finances of nationalised industries. Otherprovisions relating to energy conservation, originally intendedfor this Session&apos;s Energy Conservation Bill, should be consideredfor inclusion in next Session&apos;s programme.c. The main purpose of the Films Bill was to reduce theGovernment commitment to the financing of the film industry; italso included amendments necessary to meet objections raised bythe European Commission to the present distribution of the Eadylevy.    The Bill would attract interest in both Houses but toconfine it to strictly financial provisions would not necessarilyshorten debate.    While a promise of legislation in the followingSession might suffice to meet the views of the EuropeanCommission, whooe agreement had been obtained only afterdifficult negotiations, the statutory authority for the Eady levywould expire in September unless renewed.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the main aim must be to secure the major Bills already introducedand the Social Security (No 2) Bill.    The Cabinet, While recognising theimportance of the Contempt of Court Bill, did not feel that it was nowpossible to include the measure in the programme for the presentSession.    The Lord Chancellor could indicate in the House of Lords thatthe Bill was ready and would be introduced next Session.    The Cabinetagreed that only Bills containing essential financial provisions should nowbe added to the programme.    Legislation Committee would need to lookagain at the Films Bill, taking account of the points made during theirdiscussion.The Cabinet -1. Agreed that the Contempt of Court Bill shouldnot be introduced in the current Session.2. Agreed, in principle, to the addition to theprogramme of one or more Bills containingprovisions relating to the financing of the coalindustry, the Port of London and the White FishAuthority and altering the statutory supplyobligations of the British Gas Corporation; andinvited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster toconsult the other Ministers concerned about the shapeof the necessary legislation.3. Invited Legislation Committee to reconsider theproposed Films Bill, taking account of the pointsmade in discussion.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that in thesecond part of their memorandum he and the Acting Leader of the Houseof Lords had suggested two possible orders of priority for obtainingRoyal Assent to major Bills.    While the business managers needed toretain flexibility in managing day-to-day business in both Houses, itwould be helpful if the Cabinet were to decide which Bills should receiveRoyal Assent before the Summer Recess and which could be left tocomplete their passage during the spillover period.    He and the ActingLeader of the House of Lords had consulted the Ministers responsible forthe Bills concerned and had formed the view that for a combination ofoperational, financial and political reasons it would be necessary to givepriority to the two Social Security Bills, the Transport Bill, theEmployment Bill and the Broadcasting Bill.    The constraints of the time-table were such that it would then be possible either to secure the HousingBill and the Tenants&apos; Rights (Scotland) Bill before the Summer Recess,leaving the Local Government, Planning and Land (No 2) Bill, theHealth Services Bill and the Civil Aviation Bill to be secured in the4CONFIDENTIAL
spillover or, alternatively, to bring forward the Local Government,Planning and Land (No 2) Bill in the place of the Housing Bill and theTenants&apos; Rights (Scotland) Bill.   The provisions in the Local Government,Planning and Land (No 2) Bill relating to the block grant were opposed bythe local authority associations and were likely to be particularlycontroversial in the House of Lords.    The Government had recentlybeen defeated in the Lords on the provisions relating to school transport,and the risk of a defeat on the provisions for a block grant could not beruled out.    That risk might be greater if the Local Government,Planning and Land (No 2) Bill were being debated in the Lords at aboutthe time of the Party Conference,    On the other hand, he recognised thestrength of the financial and political arguments for securing the passageof the Housing Bill, and the Tenants&apos; Rights (Scotland) Bill with which itshould be associated, before the Summer Recess.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that he hadno doubt that the Housing Bill should take priority over the LocalGovernment, Planning and Land (No 2) Bill.    If the latter did not becomelaw until October, steps would have to be taken to secure earlierstatutory backing for the additional borrowing requirements of the NewTown Corporations.    The block grant was central to the Government&apos;spolicy towards local authority finance, und Parliament should be left inno doubt that if the provisions relating to the block grant did not becomelaw it would be impracticable to revert to the existing system for thecalculation of the Rate Support Grant for 1981-82.    Were the relevantclauses to be deleted from the Bill in the House of Lords the Governmentwould have to insist on their being reinstated.In discussion attention was diawn to the need to secure the earlyenactment of the Health Services Bill, which would provide legislativebacking for the retention of pay beds and for the imposition of cash limitson health authorities.    It would also enable the General Practitioners&apos;Finance Corporation to resume making loans.    On the other hand, whilethe Broadcasting Bill would provide statutory backing for the award bythe Independent Broadcasting Authority of new Independent Televisioncontracts that had to be signed by 1 January 1981, it might be possible forinitial negotiations to be carried out before the Bill became law.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that it was essential for the Housing Bill and th&quot; Tenants&apos;Rights (Scotland) Bill, which gave council tenants the right to purchasetheir houses, to become law before the Summer Recess.    They acceptedthat the Local Government, Planning and Land (No 2) Bill and the CivilAviation Bill would not be able to become law until the autumn. Timeshould, however, be found to enable the Health Services Bill to receiveRoyal Assent before the Summer Recess, even if that meant deferringthe passage of the Broadcasting Bill until the autumn should that benecessary.5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe Cabinet4.       Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterand the Acting Leader of the House of Lords to planthe legislative programme for the rest of the Sessionon the basis that the following Bills needed to besecured before the Summer Recess:Social SecuritySocial Security (No 2)TransportEmploymentHousing )Tenants&apos; Rights (Scotland))Health Servicesf 3. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCEJ said that the House of Lords had voted by 216 votes to 112 to remove fromthe Education (No 2) Bill the clauses giving local education authoritiespowers to make charges for school tranr port.    There would have been amajority against the Government even if 45 Conservative Peers had notjoined cross-bench and Opposition Peers in the vote.    The House ofLords would almost certainly reach the same decision if asked toconsider the issue again;  and following the vote in the House of Lordsthere would be stronger opposition than before in the Commons to anyattempt to reinstate the clauses, which could therefore tail or at leastput at serious risk the chances of the Bill getting Royal Assent beforeEaster.    He proposed, therefore, that the Government should not seekto reverse the decision of the House of Lords; this should enable theremaining provisions of the Bill to become law by Easter. Localauthorities would need to be told of the Government&apos;s decision and itsimplications for their expenditure as soon as possible;  and there hadbeen pressure for an early Government statement in the Commons. Heproposed, if Cabinet agreed, to make a statement that afternoon. Hewould .&apos;ndicate that, for 1980-81, local authorities would have to reducetheir net expenditure by  20 million in other ways since they would notbe abxe to charge for school transport.    He expected, and would beready to say this in answering Supplementary Questions, that thepresumption was that authorities would look for savings elsewhere intheir education budgets; it would, however, be open to them to seekeconomies in other services if they so chose.    There would need to befurther discussion about the position in later years, where, as thePublic Expenditure White Paper to be published on 26 March would show,the Government had been planning on charges for school transport risingto  50 million.6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that no attempt should be made to reinstate in theEducation (No 2) Bill clauses giving local education authorities powersto charge for school transport.    The Secretary of State for Educationand Science should announce this decision in a statement in the House ofCommons that afternoon, making clear that, for 1980-81, localauthorities would have to find equivalent savings elsewhere in theirbudgets.The Cabinet -1. Invited the Secretary of State for Education andScience, in consultation with the Chancellor of theDuchy of Lancaster, to arrange to make a statementin the House of Commons that afternoon on the linesindicated in the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of theirdiscussion.2. Invited the Secretary of State for Education andScience, in consultation with the Chief Secretary,Tieasury, to agree upon what should be said when theWhite Paper on Public Expenditure was published on26 March.4. The Cabinet considered a minute by the Home Secretary to thePrime Minister dated 11 March 1980, recording the outcome of thediscussion in Home and Social Affairs Committee on fuel costs and poorconsumers.THE HOME SECRETARY said that Home and Social Affairs Committeehad considered the separate proposal&apos;s of the Chief Secretary, Treasury,and of the Secretaries of State for Social Services and for Energy forassistance to help the poor to meet their fuel bills.    There was a largegap between them.    The Chief Secretary&apos;s proposals would cost 35 million, and those of the Secretaries of State for Social Servicesand for Energy up to  100 million in a full year.    There had beenagreement on the proposal to increase Family Income Supplement, whichwent to ths working poor, by a further  1 a week, at a cost of some 4 million in a full year.    There was also agreement that there shouldbe a special uprating next winter of the extra heating additions (EHA) toSupplementary Benefit, but the new rates fell to be considered in thebroader context of the overall package.    Any scheme of assistance wouldhave wide political implications in the light of the proposed level of fuelprice increases;  it would need to be charged to the ContingencyReserve, on which there would be other large claims.7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that the ContingencyReserve was a small residual of the Government&apos;s public expenditureprogramme.    The Cabinet had already identified a number of claims,and there would be others (for instance, aid for Zimbabwe, which theLord President of the Council had urged in earlier discussion thatmorning.    He recognised, however, the need to give extra help to thepoor to meet higher fuel bills, and would be prepared to acceptproposals for  50 million a year over and above the carry-forward ofthe existing scheme.    This would provide a reasonable sum in relationto the yield of increased fuel costs attributable to domestic consumers.He was ready to see more generous rates of EHA; but he attachedimportance to selective assistance, rather than automatic entitlement.EHA should be awarded on the basis oi proven need rather than bygranting entitlement to whole new categories of people.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that theproposals put forward by the Chief Secretary, Treasury, would not besufficient for the Government to be able to argue convincingly that theywere taking steps to protect the poor from fuel price increases. Theaverage household spent some 6 per cent of its income on fuel; poorhouseholds spent 12 per cent or more.    If the Government did not comeforward with an acceptable package of support, there was a danger thatthey would not, in the event, secure the fuel price increases that theyhad agreed.    There was little between him and the Chief Secretary,Treasury, on the enhanced rates of EHA.    Presentationally it would bepreferable to round the new rates to the nearest 50p to avoid theappearance oi an exact calculation.    The main issue was whether thoseamong Supplementary Benefit recipients who were especially vulnerablethe elderly, and families with young children - should be entitled tospecial help.    These people would be disproportionately affected by thefuel price increases, which would not be fully reflected inSupplementary Benefit upratings.    Special help was available under thecurrent scheme to those over 75 and to families with children underfive, but the number of people helped was much less than under theprevious Administration&apos;s Electricity Discount Scheme.    He proposedthat the age limit for entitlement to EHA should be reduced to 70; andthat Supplementary Benefit households with children under 11 shouldautomatically qualify.    Any lesser package would put at risk theGovernment&apos;s wider objectives.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that he supported theproposals of the Secretary of State for Social Services.    The total sumwas important.    The previous Administration&apos;s scheme had cost 45 million in its final year; at today&apos;s prices a comparable schemewould cost  65 million.    That should be the minimum for any newscheme, if the Government were to provide effective social help for thepoor and avoid charges of meanness.    There would also be politicalbenefits in raising the rate of grants under the Homes Insulation Schemeto 90 per cent for pensioners at an annual cost of  4 million.    It wasabsurd to use taxpayers&apos; money to buy heat only to see it wasted.8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIn discussion it was argued that there was a strong case politically formaking generous provision for the poor to meet their fuel bills. Majorprice increases were on the way and the Government must not appear tobe callous or indifferent.    The profits of the gas industries would bevery great and would be difficult to explain.    It was essential to have acredible scheme in relation to the expected benefit of  1,800 million tothe Public Sector Borrowing Requirement over the next three years.There was rising concern in the House of Commons about the poor, asinstanced by the feeling that child benefits should be increased. TheGovernment would have to secure the passage of a number of difficultmeasures in the next few months, and it would be helpful, therefore, tohave a generous fuel costs package.    On the other hand, the pressure onthe Contingency Reserve would be vety great.    The Government hadfailed to secure charges for school transport, rising to  50 million ayear; additional aid to Zimbabwe had been canvassed; and bids for 100 million a year were being made for help to the poor with fuel costs.Any assistance had to be seen in the context of the Government&apos;s widerfiscal and expenditure policies.In detailed discussion the following points were made -a. It would be preferable to adopt the rates for EHA proposedby the Chief Secretary, Treasury.    These would save 9 million in a full year, without much loss to individualrecipients.b. There was strong support for giving special help to thoseover 70.    The tests for the award of EHA were stiff and therewere deserving people who could not meet them or who, frompride or ignorance, would not apply for them.c. The Government had previously accepted that SupplementaryBenefit households with children under five should be entitled toEHA.    There would be criticism if this provision were removedor diminished.    The case for assisting households with childrenbetween 5 &lt;nnck U y|as less strong.  It would be worthconsidering again whether the scales for 0-4 and 5-10 could notremain separate.d. An improvement in the terms of the Home sInsulation Schemefor pensioners would be attractive, provided the cost could befound out of existing programmes.    The scheme had in fact beenkept alive by the transfer of funds from the housing programme.Further provision from this source could not be expected.9CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALe.      A new initiative to improve home insulation and heating forpensioners would be welcome if it provided jobs for the youngand longer-term unemployed.    The Americans had achievedremarkable improvements in fuel consumption through a similarscheme.    No proposals had been costed, however, and it wouldbe necessary to consider whether existing job creation measurescould be diverted to this new field.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet had agreed that there should be a new scheme of assistance tohelp poor consumers with fuel costs, and agreed that the total costshould not exceed  75 million in a full year, including the continuingcost of the existing special scheme.    It was also agreed that the greaterpart of the cost should be accepted as a charge on the ContingencyReserve.    There was wide support for automatic assistance toSupplementary Benefit households with people over 70, and a strongfeeling that special arrangements should be made for SupplementaryBenefit households with children under the age of five.    It would beeconomical to go for the lower level of enhancement of the EHA proposedby the Chief Secretary, Treasury.    The Secretary of State for SocialServices should reconsider his package of proposals in the light of theCabinet&apos;s discussion, and agree fresh proposals with the ChiefSecretary, Treasury, and other Ministers principally concerned. Anyimprovement in the terms of the Homes Insulation Scheme forpensioners should be found within the total amounts agreed by the Cabinet(either within the total of  75 million to be charged to the ContingencyReserve or by savings on other programmes).    The prospects of a newinitiative to tackle inefficient home heating and the poor insulation ofpensioners&apos;homes, while at the same time providing worthwhile jobs forthe young and longer-term unemployed, should be examined by theMinieters concerned; any necessary financial provision would need to besought from Department of Employment programmes, including the jobcreation scheme, or from Department of the Environment programmes.The Cabinet -1.       Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services,in the light of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion, to agree with theChief Secretary, Treasury, and the other Ministersprincipally concerned revised proposals for helping poorconsumers with fuel costs, within a total sum of 75 million in a full year, including the continuing costof the existing special scheme.10CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL2.      Invited the Secretary of State for Energy, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for Employmentand the Secretary of State for the Environment, toexamine a new initiative for improving the insulationand heating of pensioners&apos; homes, and creating worth-while jobs for the young and longer-term unemployed.5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of State,Civil Service Department (C(80) 20), about options for dealing with aprojected shortfall in the number of Overseas DevelopmentAdministration (ODA) posts available for dispersal to East Kilbride,asd a memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign andCommonwealth Affairs (C(8C) 19) about the implications of any decisionto disperse the ODA&apos;s Directorate of Overseas Surveys.THE MINISTER OF STATE, CIVIL SERVICE DEPARTMENT, said thatthe reduced dispersal programme agreed by the Cabinet last July hadincluded at least 2, 000 posts for Scotland, to be made up of 1,400 fromthe Ministry of Defence to Glasgow and 650 from the ODA to EastKilbride.    There was great political pressure in Scotland for thiscommitment to be maintained, and it had been reiterated on a number ofoccasions since last July.    The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretaryhad minuted the Prime Minister on 22 February, saying that it was nolonger possible for the ODA to send more than between 400 and 450posts owing to cuts in numbers and organisational changes.    This gavethe Government three options: to reduce the total number of posts fordispersal to Scotland; to find posts in the ODA and/or the rest of theForeign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) to take up the shortfall;  or tomake good the shortfall with posts from other Departments.    The firstof these options seemed politically unacceptable; it was thereforenecessary to find a way of making good the shortfall.    The experienceof finding posts for Bootle showed that no Government Department wouldvolunteer to disperse.    He suspected that any Department which wasasked to find 200-250 posts for dispersal would have just as muchtrouble in doing so as the FCO/ODA.    He accordingly recommendedthat the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary should be asked to makegood the shortfall from the merged departments of the FCO/ODA.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the ODA units which were due todisperse to East Kilbride were the only ones which the Hardmanexercise had identified as suitable for dispersal.    The shortfall wasdue to a reduction in the numbers employed in those units since theoriginal decision to disperse had been taken.    It would not be appropriateto disperse the Directorate of Overseas Surveys.    The nature of theirwork required more than average space per head, so that if they wentto East Kilbride many fewer than 650 civil servants could be fitted into11CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthe building there.    In addition, many of their highly-trained staffwould find work with other employers rather than move to East Kilbride.He accepted that the commitment to move at least 2, 000 posts toScotland should be maintained.    The best way to make up the shortfallfrom the ODA would be to look right across the London-based part ofthe Civil Service, to identify on the bas&apos;s of the methodology adopted forthe Hardman review whichever unit it would be least difficult to move toEast Kilbride.In discussion the Cabinet agreed that the commitment to disperse atleast 2,000 Civil Service posts to Scotland should be maintained.    As tothe choice of Department, it was argued that nothing had happened sincelast July to make other Departments more suitable for dispersal nowthan they had been then.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Government&apos;s commitment to disperse at least2, 000 Civil Service posts to Scotland should be maintained. TheCabinet noted that the FCO would not be able to fulfil their part of thiscommitment from the ODA posts originally selected for dispersal, butlooked to the Lord Privy Seal to find posts for dispersal from elsewherein the FCO/ODA, to make good this shortfall.The Cabinet -1. Agreed that the Government&apos;s commitment todisperse at least 2,000 Civil Service posts to Scotlandshould be maintained.2. Invited the Lord Privy Seal to find sufficientposts for dispersal within the Foreign andCommonwealth Office/Overseas DevelopmentAdministration to maintain the existing commitmentto disperse 650 posts to East Kilbride.Cabinet Office19 March 198012CONFIDENTIAL
