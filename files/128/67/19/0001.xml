1LIAMENTARY&apos;AIRSconfidential1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.2.        THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that at a first reading the latestproposals for political settlement put forward from Kabul appearedto be deficient very much as previous indications from Soviet sourceshad been.    They were probably designed to have an effect on themeeting that day of the German National Olympic Committee and themeeting of the Islamic Conference at the weekend.   A particularlyunsatisfactory feature about this latest Soviet initiative was itsfailure to give any real undertaking about the withdrawal of Soviettroops from Afghanistan.   The proposals would no doubt bediscussed between the United States Secretary of State and the SovietForeign Minister at their forthcoming meeting in Vienna.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the Government&apos;s Bill authorisingeconomic sanctions against Iran had passed the House of Commonsand would be considered in the House of Lords that afternoon. Therewould be an informal meeting of the Foreign Ministers of theEuropean Community in Naples over the forthcoming weekend duringwhich they would discuss how far and how fast to move in applyingsanctions.    President Bani-Sadr appeared to be attempting to makeconciliatory gestures but he was clearly facing domestic politicalproblems.    He had not so far appointed a now Prime Minister.The Islamic Party seemed to have done well in the Iranian elections,but the significance of the outcome was not yet clear.confidentialTHE LOBD PRIVY SEAL said that the French National OlympicCommittee had now voted in favour of attendance at the MoscowOlympics.   It still looked as if the German National OlympicCommittee would accept their Government&apos;s advice not to go toMoscow, but it had been hoped that the French decision would b&lt;*delayed until after West Germany had announced that they would notbe going.    The position in other countries remained generallyunchanged.
CONFIDENTIALTHE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the action taken to expel LibyanGovernment officials from this country had gone better so far thanexpected.    No reprisals had yet been taken, but the danger ofreprisals was by no means past.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that an attempt by President Binaisato dismiss his Chief of Staff had failed and had led to a bloodlesscoup in which the President himself had been displaced.    He wasnow held incommunicado in his palace.    It seemed possible thatthe military regime which now had b .en established might lead tothe return of Dr Obote to power in Uganda.THE LORD PR7VY SEAL said that South Africa had now replied tothe United Nations Secretary General, Dr Waldheim in terms thatwere more favourable than it had been anticipated.    This replymight serve to placate the Front Line States for the time being.CONFIDENTIAL3. THE PRIME MINISTER said that during her visit to Belgradefor the funeral of President Tito she had had talks with bothSignor Cossiga and Chancellor Schmidt.    It was clear that theItalian Prime Minister was anxious to settle the outstanding issuesbefore the next European Council on 12 June.    Behind the scenesdiscussions were taking place both on the budget and on the relatedquestions of fisheries and sheepmeat.    On the budget, the problemwas still to agree upon an arrangement for a minimum period ofthree years.    The French having made tho link, the BritishGovernment would not agree to raise agricultural prices until thebudget question was solved.In a brief discussion it was suggested that, provided that a satisfactoryreduction in our net budgetary contribution was secured for 1980 itmight be less important to insist upon a three year arrangementsince, once an arrangement had been established, it would bedifficult for the Community not to continue with it.    An arrangementcovering three years might lead to the issue being reopened in the
CONFIDENTIALmiddle of 1982 in a politically charged atmosphere.    On the otherhand it was argued that, if the budget settlement was for too shorta period, there would be a risk of being exposed every year tofurther pressure from the French to agree to higher agriculturalprices.   A three-year arrangement would be a better stepping-stonetc wards a longer term solution.    The Community would probablyreach the limit of its present financial resources before the end of1982, and it was desirable to avoid a situation in which the UnitedKingdom was forced to agree to an increase in the ceiling in orderto secure continuation of the limitation on her net contribution.The pressure on the Community from the financial ceiling shouldhelp to bring about reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).One possible way of determining the net United Kingdom contributionwould be to link it with progress in reducing the proportion of thebudget spent on the CAP.    Two other formulae were currentlybeing discusced as a means of determining the level of our netcontribution, which would have somewhat the same effect; but theydid not remove the need to determine how long the arrangementshould last.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthat, although the French had sounded out other Member States onthe possibility of setting aside the Luxembourg Compromise inorder to adopt the agricultural price proposals by majority vote,they had met with a refusal from several countries and the matterhad not been pursued in the Council of Ministers (Agriculture) on6-7 May.    The proposals for a common organisation of the marketfor sheepmeat were highly unsatisfactory and we had been able tohave them referred back for further discussion by officials. Onfisheries, the Germans were taking a strong line, which appearedto emanate more from the Federal Chancellor than from the GermanMinistry of Agriculture.    The Italian Presidency had proposed ameeting of the Council of Ministers (Fisheries) before the end ofMay, but Commissioner Gundelach agreed with him that such ameeting would be very undesirable.    The Minister of State(Mr Buchanan-Smith) had visited Bonn for talks with his Germanopposite number, and discussions were continuing to see whetherit was possible to find a suitable form of words laying down guidelinesfor future work.   If such a text could be agreed, it would probably bepossible to avoid an early meeting of the Fisheries Council.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said the meeting of theCouncil of Ministers (Energy) on 13 May had passed ofi quietly andfurther work had been put in hand.    The United Kingdom had not hadto make any concessions.The Cabinet -Took note.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTIVE 4.        The Cabinet considered memoranda (C(80) 26 and 27) by theMME Secretary oC State for the Home Department about the legislativeprogramme fcr the 1980-81 Session of Parliament.THE HOME SECRETARY said that, in considering the proposals forBills which Ministers had put forward for next Session&apos;s programme,The Queen&apos;s Speeches and Future Legislation Committee had beenconcerned that the load of legislation on Parliament should belighter than in the present Session.    They envisaged a Session ofnormal length with reasonable recesses and the minimum spill-over inthe autumn of 1981.    They had therefore recommended that the mainprogramme should be limited to 26 Bills, together with five Billswhich were expected to be suitable for Second Reading Committee,This should allow room lor the inclusion of any contingent oremergency Bills that proved to be necessary.    The Committee hadalso agreed that 9 Scottish Bills should be brought forward toScottish Grand Committee as appropriate; and that five other Bills,not in the programme should be introduced if, but only if,Legislation Committee were satisfied that they were acceptable forSecond Reading Committee procedure.    The main emphasis of thesuggested programme was on Bills to assist the Government&apos;seconomic and financial policies, for example by allowing the saleof assets and the introduction of private capital into nationalisedindustries.    There was a social dimension to the programme whichincluded two Education Bills and two environmental Bills; and lawreform was reflected in three important measures (including aContempt of Court Bill), together with a major BO on Nationality.The Committee had identified eight Bills, including the legal reformBills, which it should be possible to introduce first in the House ofLords, thus helping to provide a better balance of work for the twoHouses during the next Session.    He was grateful to thosecolleagues who had agreed to shorten their proposed Bills, or todefer them to a later Session.   If the Cabinet approved what hebelieved to be a realistic programme, the Ministers concernedwould need to seek early policy approval where this had not yet beenobtained, and to see that instructions for their Bills were preparedas soon as possible, so that Parliamentary Counsel could have asubstantial number of Bills ready for introduction at the beginningof the new Session.In discussion, there was general agreement that a lightening of thepressures of legislation was desirable and would be widely welcomedby Government supporters.    Part of the trouble in the presentSession had been that Bills had come forward too late and had beentoo long.    It was essential to keep to the dates of readiness whichhad been forecast for the introduction of Bills next Session. Theintention to introduce as many Bills as possible in the House of Lordswas particularly welcome.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe following points were also made in discussion -a. The programme did not include a Bill giving effectto the Manifesto commitment relating to the shipbuildingindustry.    Government policy for the future of the industryand, in particular, the possible disposal of the specialistwarship builders, had not yet been settled.   It might bedesirable to add a short Shipbuilding Industry (Disposals) Billto the main programme.b. The proposed Health and Social Services(Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill would not now includeprovisions to extend the liability of motorists for meetingthe costs of hospital treatment after road accidents. Analternative scheme was to be examined which would requirecontributions to the costs imposed on the National HealthService to be made in respect of the victims of other accidentsas well as road accidents.    It would be desirable to findspace in this Bill for provisions to improve the regulation?nd disciplinary procedures of the dental profession, if thatcould be done without unduly lengthening it.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the recommendations of The Queen&apos;s Speeches andFuture Legislation Committee, ard agreed to proceed as proposedwith the Bills listed in the Annexes to the Home Secretary&apos;smemorandum.    They had noted that it might be desirable to add tothe programme a Shipbuilding Industry (Disposals) Bill, should theoutstanding policy questions be settled in time.    Provisions for thedisciplinary arrangements of the dental profession could beconsidered for Inclusion in the Health and Social Services(Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill only if that could be done withoutappreciably adding to its length and their inclusion did not delay itspreparation.    More generally, it was essential that early actionshould be taken to secure policy approval and to give instructions toCounsel for Bills in the programme, so that as many as possiblewere ready for introduction at the beginning of the new Session.Ministers should make this their personal responsibility and shouldinform the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster of any adversechanges in the timetable for the preparation of their Bills.The Cabinet -1.        Agreed that the Essential and Programme Billslisted in Annex A to C(80) 26 should be included in the1980-81 legislative programme.5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL2. Noted the list of Contingent Bills in Annex Band agreed that such of these Bills as proved necessaryshould be added to the programme.3. Agreed that the Scottish Bills listed in Annex Cshould be included in the programme.4. Agreed that the Bills listed in Annex D couldbe added to the programme if, at the appropriatetime, Legislation Committee thought them likely tobe acceptable for Second Reading Committee in theHouse of Commons.5. Invited all Ministers responsible for Billsin the 1980-81 programme to take early action tosecure policy approval and drafting authority, andto ensure that instructions to Counsel were givenas soon as possible thereafter.Cabinet Office15 May 19806CONFIDENTIAL
