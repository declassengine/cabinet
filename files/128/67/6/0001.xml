confidentialpjfNTARY    1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.ers&apos;     THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that itwas likely that, if proceedings on the Abortion (Amendment) Billwere restricted to the time allotted to Private Members&apos; Bills,even those parts of the Bill which commanded a wide measure ofagreement in the House were unlikely to reach the Statute Book.It was likely that he would come under pressure to make Governmenttime available.THE HOME SECRETARY suggested that the Cabinet should reaffirmthe consistent practice of Conservative Administrations not to makeGovernment time available for Private Members&apos; Bills. Otherwisethere would be continuing difficulties in resisting pressure toprovide time for individual Bills.   In bis own field he had in mindthe Hare Coursing (Abolition) Bill, which raised contentious issuesbetween the animal lobby and country Members.In discussion it was suggested that it would be better to defer anannouncement affecting the Government&apos;s attitude to the provisionof time for the Abortion (Amendment) Bill.    There would be publiccriticism of Parliament if no decision were reached on thosematters on which there was a wide measure of agreement. Thepossibility had been canvassed of suspending the rule to allow debateon the Bill to continue after 2. 30 pm on a Friday.    On the otherhand, it was pointed out that the promoters of the Bill had not beenwilling to drop the controversial provisions of the Bill in order tosecure the passage of generally agreed provisions.    Two or threeFridays remained for debating the Bill.    If action were taken tosuspend the rule for one Bill, there would be no defence to pleasfor similar action on other Private Members&apos; Bills.   Action toextend the debate on the Abortion (Amendment) Bill would certainlybring demands for similar treatment from the supporters of theRoad Traffic (Seat Belts) Bill.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that itwas the clear view of the Cabinet that Government time should notbe made available, nor should the rule be suspended, to facilitatethe progress of a Private Member&apos;s Bill.The Cabinet -1.        Agreed that no Government time should bemade available for any Private Member&apos;s Bill, norshould the Government move to suspend the rule,to facilitate the progress of such a Bill.confidential
confidentialTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that hebelieved that it might be possible to reach agreement with theOpposition that new clauses restricting trade union immunitiesshould be tabled for discussion at the Report Stage of theEmployment Bill and that it would not prove necessary for theCommittee Stage of the Bill to be prolonged.    He hoped that nothingwould be said in Ministerial speeches on the subject which wouldpreclude this possibility.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that,if such an arrangement could be made through the usual channels,it would facilitate the passage of the Bill, while meeting herundertaking that the House as a whole would be able to discussthe changes that the Government proposed to make in the Bill.The Cabinet -2.Took note.confidential
confidential2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatPresident Tito&apos;s death appeared imminent but seemed unlikely to beaccompanied by political trouble.    Arrangements were in hand forUnited Kingdom representation at the funeral.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theGovernor, Lord Soames, was doing a magnificent job.    But thesituation remained critical and had not been helped by developmentssuch as the arrest and temporary detention of Mr Garfield Todd or theattempted assassination of Mr Mugabe.    President Nye re re ofTanzania&apos;s unjustified criticisms of British policy might make itnecessary for the United Nations to be further involved.    The Governor&apos;snew powers might do something to curb electoral intimidation, which wasbeing practised both by Mr Mugabe&apos;s and by Bishop Muzorewa&apos;sfollowers.    Mr Mugabe clearly enjoyed considerable electoral support.Mr Nkomo was campaigning well, but his main strength lay with theminority Matabele tribe.    Bishop Muzorewa was proving lessimpressive, although his party was well organised and not short ofmoney.    The elections remained the essential goal of the Government&apos;spolicy, and it had been most helpful that the Home Secretary had beenable to agree to several hundred more British policemen being sent outto assist with electoral arrangements.    After the elections it would befor the Governor to decide whom te invite to form a Government. Hev/ould not necessarily have to choose the leader of the largest party, ifanother leader seemed more likely to command a parliamentarymajority.    The only constitutional limitation was that the holders of thewhite community&apos;s 20 seats could not form an alliance except with thelargest black African party or combination of such parties.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theUnited States guarantee of Pakistan had been reinforced followingDr Brzezinski&apos;s visit, although it remained less strong than thePakistanis wanted.    Pakistan seemed likely to seek Saudi Arabianmoney for arms purchases and United States money for economicdevelopment.    This would have political and presentational advantages,and might also be commercially helpful to the United Kingdom as apotential arms supplier.    Meanwhile it was to be hoped that the ForeignMinisters of the European Community would shortly endorse a British3confidential
confidentialproposal for Afghanistan to be neutralised by international treaty, onthe model of Austria.    The Russians might well not agree (althoughthey had withdrawn from Austria in 1955 in return for such a treaty);but the unreasonableness of their refusal would help to maintain inter-national hostility to their policyTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theInternational Olympic Committee&apos;s refusal to move the Games awayfrom Moscow was regrettable.    The United States Government hadmeanwhile held a meeting in Washington of certain Governmentsopposed to Moscow as the site (including the United Kingdom and theFederal Republic of Germany but not France), and a further meetingwas likely to be held later in February.    The British OlympicAssociation was to meet on 4 March, and the Government would need toformulate their policy before then.    The Secretary of the Cabinet had inhand the preparation of a paper for Ministerial consideration.In the course of a brief discussion general support was expressed forthe view that the Government should not do less in relation to theMoscow Olympics than they had done in relation to the British Lions&apos;rugby football tour of South Africa: ie British athletes should beadvised not to take part.    The Government would also need to considertheir policy on the financial issues involved in British participation inthe Moscow Games or in any rival games of an international characterwhich the Americans might decide to organise; and on the involvementof members of the Royal Family.The Cabinet -Took note.confidential4
onfidential3.        THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOODsaid that the Commission&apos;s proposals for agriculture prices for1980-81 were heavily biased against the United Kingdom.    It wasunacceptable that the country which bore the heaviest economicburden from the Common Agricultural Policy should be discriminatedagainst in this way.    He would therefore take a tough attitude in thepreliminary discussions at the meeting of the Council of Ministers(Agriculture) on 18 February on lines which he had explained in aletter dated 13 February to the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretaryand other members of the Defence and Oversea Policy CommitteeSub-Committee on European Questions.    On sheepmeat, the Frenchwere due to respond that day to the latest Commission approach.If, as was likely, the reply was unsatisfactory he would press theCommission to ask the European Court for interim measuresdesigned to bring speedy French compliance with the law.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER reported that at theCouncil of Ministers (Finance) on 11 February there had been afirst discursion of the latest Commission paper dealing with waysof increasing Community expenditure for the benefit of theUnited Kingdom.    He had welcomed the document as providing aframework within which a satisfactory settlement was possible.The only other intervention had been an unhelpful one by the FrenchMinister of Finance who had argued that the economic situation ofthe United Kingdom had improved through higher North Sea oilprices so that even what had been on offer at the Dublin EuropeanCouncil was no longer justified.In a brief discussion the following points were made -a. There was no progress on the budget issue. TheGermans were now saying that, because of Afghanistan,they would have new financial commitments eg to aid Turkeywhich would reduce their ability to help us.    Not much couldbe expected from the current round of consultations beingcarried out by the Italian Foreign Minister and ourAmbassador in Rome had been instructed to remind theItalian Prime Minister, Signer Cossiga, of his assuranceto the Prime Minister that he would personally work for asettlement.b. It was clear that the French and the Germans werecontinuing to work closely together.    At the recent FinanceCouncil they had previously agreed on a draft statement aboutagricultural expenditure designed to guide the Agricultureconfidential
confidentialCouncil.   Although the Chancellor of the Exchequer hadsucceeded in securing a reference to the need for a prudentprice policy and the deletion of an endorsement of theCommission&apos;s proposals, the resulting text was of verylittle value.c.        The heavy burden of the British net contribution tothe Community Budget came on top of stationing costs ofBritish troops in Germany and the disproportionate Britishcontribution to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)Budget, which was geared to relative gross national productin 1948.    The country could not support all three at presentlevels, and it might become necessary to consider givingour Community partners a clearer understanding of theconsequences of a failure to settle the budget issue.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Defence and Oversea Policy Committee would shortly need toconsider the next steps in budget negotiations.    There would thenbe an opportunity for further discussion in Cabinet.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that he hoped tohear that day that the Commission would be willing to imposequotas on imports of two of the three synthetic textile productsfor which the United Kingdom had sought safeguard action and tocommit themselves to similar action on the third product (carpets)if imports continued to rise.   Although this would not satisfy theindustry, it gave most of what he had asked for and he wouldpropose to announce his acceptance of such an arrangement in theHouse of Commons, if possible by way of an oral statement on18 February.   If as a result of pressure, notably from the Germans,the Commission were unwilling to go this far, the Defence andOversea Policy Committee&apos;s Sub-Committee on European Questionswould decide on further action next week.The Cabinet -Took note.6confidential
confidential4. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that themain steel pay talks were still deadlocked, although it was possiblethat the craftsmen and other smaller unions might agree terms that day.There seemed to be no prospect of an early solution.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the roomfor manoeuvre was very limited.    The Iron and Steel TradesConfederation had rejected arbitration.    There was nothing theGovernment could do at this stage.THE HOME SECRETARY said that mass picketing, in which acontingent of South Yorkshire miners led by Mr Arthur Scargill hadtaken part, had presented serious problems that morning at theHadfield plant at Sheffield; there were also problems on a smallerscale at Sheerness.    But the police had the situation well under controlso fai, and at Hadfields the morning shift had all got in to work.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that BritishShipbuilders had reached a settlement with their workforce which wouldcost on average about 11. 5 per cent annually, largely self-financed.This was a satisfactory outcome.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that aDelegate Conference of the General and Municipal Workers Union hadunexpectedly rejectdd the pay offer of 19. 2 per cent which had beenmade to the four unions in the industry.    The Conference hadinstructed its officers formally to call a strike on 25 February. Theleaders were reluctant to do this, sensing that public opinion would beagainst them, and were looking for a way through.    The position of the.other unions was not yet known.    Formal negotiations had not brokendown, and informal contacts were already taking place.    It might benecessary to implement the previously agreed contingency plans at shortnotice, though it would be untimely to do so before next week, in view ofthe possible effects of doing so *n the climate for negotiations.    If itbecame necessary to do so, he would seek the specific authority of thePrime Minister and the Home Secretary.THE HOME SECRETARY said that the Civil Contingencies Unit wasready to meet at any time at either Ministerial or official level.Because it would take seven days to recall troops, and two days fortraining, troops could not be in place on 25 February if a strike began7confidential
confidentialthat day, but they could be available on 27 February.    This wouldprobably be time enough:  the water authorities were unlikely to need tocall on the help of the troops during the first day or two of a strike. AState of Emergency would not be necessary for the deployment of troops,but might be required later in order to mobilise public opinion and toprotect the legal position of the water authorities.    The success of thecontingency plans would depend crucially on the willingness of thesupervisors to co-operate, and their attitude was not yet known.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the unionnegotiators had accepted an offer of 14. 2 per cent, subject to DelegateConferences.    The unions concerned were the same as those in thewater industry, and it was possible that a revised offer to the waterworkers would have repercussions for the gas industry.    This should beborne in mind in considering the timing of any fresh offer.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that British Leylandfaced a number of separate crises arising from its own cash flow andmarket share problems, the sacking of the union convener,Mr Derek Robinson, the effects of the steel strike, and its current paynegotiations.    The company had &quot;decided to introduce short-time *working for 20-30, 000 workers from 25 February to conserve cash.The Board would face crucial decisions on\2 March, when it would meetto consider whether it was obliged to modify or even to withdraw thepresent plan.THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT said that the London Upper Docks andthe conventional berths at Tilbury were completely stopped by a strike,which might last for three or four weeks.    There was no sign of thestrike spreading to other ports, and reasonable pay settlements hadalready been reached in some other ports, notably at Southampton.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that theLiverpool hospital dispute had now been settled     A separate problemhad arisen over the allowances paid to medical laboratory scientificofficers.    He had decided to bypass the union, the Association ofScientific, Technical and Managerial Staff, whose conduct had beendisgraceful, by putting the management&apos;s pay offer into immediatepayment without waiting for conclusion of a settlement.    He was nowawaiting the reaction on the ground; in many cases the payment mightlead to resumption of normal working but it was possible that some8confidential
confidentialstaff would walk out, and this could create a very serious situation insome hospitals.    There were no comparable difficulties in Scotland.The Cabinet -Took note.5.        The Cabinet considered a memorandum Jay the Chancellor of theDuchy of Lancaster, reporting on his consultations with the Houseauthorities and others about the decisions on Parliamentary pay andallowances provisionally reached by the Cabinet at its previous meeting.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that he hadmet the Executive of the 1922 Committee, who were satisfied that theirviews had been taken fully into acconnt on the main issue.    They hadurged him not to turn down definitely the recommendation of the TopSalaries Review Body (TSRB) on travel allowances.    The Oppositionhad taken a less helpful line, but could be expected to co-operate. Hehad also consulted Parliamentary Counsel, and through him the Houseauthorities, and he was now satisfied that there was (as things stood)no way in which an annual debate on Parliamentary pay could beavoided.    But he hoped that, as a result of the new review procedure towhich Cabinet had agreed, and if it was accepted that Parliamentarypay and allowances would as a matter of course be reviewed annually,those debates would eventually come to take place in a lower key than inthe past.    On the question of allowances, he had consulted theAccountant of the House of Commons.    There was some scope forflexibility as between secretarial and research assistance allowances,and it was proposed to exploit this.    On the question of accountability,he had been reassured to learn that the Fees Office had its owninformal ways of dealing with apparent discrepancies in claims. Heproposed, with the co-operation of officials from the Civil ServiceDepartment and Inland Revenue, and of the Fees Office, to introduce anew claims form which would help to avoid abuse.    Generally, heproposed to publish the Report of the TSRB and to make a statementabout the Government decisions that afternoon.In discussion a number of points were made -a. It was generally accepted that it was impossible to avoidan annual debate on the salaries and allowances of Members ofParliament (MPs).b. It was important that MPs should be seen to be accountablefor the various secretarial, research assistance, and travelallowances which they claimed.    There was some reason to9confidential
confidentialsuspect abuse of the system by certain MPs.    This gave rise toa grave risk of serious public scandal.    Ministers had aresponsibility to give a lead in tightening up the present system.The informal methods already used by the Fees Office were to bewelcomed, even if they were necessarily incomplete.    Any helpwhich could be given by the Inland Revenue would also be useful;but because many travel allowances were not taxable, this mustnecessarily be limited in scope.    The initiatives taken by theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster would be the appropriateresponse at this stage.    If a serious abuse were uncovered, itmight be necessary to consider prosecuting the MP concerned.c. The TSRB had recommended that MPs be encouraged tomake more use of payment through the Fees Office, rather thandirect payment of secretaries and research assistants. Sincethis was a specific recommendation, it could not be ignored, andthe Government should commend it to the House, while notseeking to make this method mandatory.d. Preliminary talks were in hand on a possible inquiry intothe costs of Parliament as agreed at Cabinet&apos;s last discussion.One way of reducing those costs would be to increase the sizeand limit the number of constituencies.    But there was nochance of doing this within the lifetime of the present Parliament,and the present was n*yt a suitable time to raise this subject fordiscussion.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that their decisions on MPs&apos; pay and allowances shouldbe announced in the House of Commons that day.    They noted theoutcome of the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster&apos;s discussions withthe House authorities and others.    They agreed that he should takesteps to tighten up the administration of MPs&apos; expense allowances in theway he suggested.    They would resume their discussion of a possibleinquiry into the costs of Parliament at a later stage.The Cabinet -1.

There will,se be no time for detailed discussion, but all the Agriculture Ministersexpected to give their first reactions, both in the Council and to the2 The wa I        will be important, both for the future CAP negotiations&quot;the budget negotiation with which in my view they will inevitablylinked.ir to set up the strongest possible negotiating position on the budgeti obviously got to take a very tough line on the CAP proposals.   But it jW to be a credible line; it must not be one which will embarrass usouch when we eventually settle; and it should not be overtly linked byth the budget negotiation, though the link will be made by others andi obvious enough.  d propose to state the principle that I am not prepared to agree tofils which would increase the financial or economic burden on the UKjch discriminate against the UK in any way.   I should then review each  main proposals against this criterion.   I should however take carep say specifically that I could not agree to any single proposal thatml meet the test:   the time will come when we reach a CAP settlement whichJus a net benefit overall (just as last year&apos;s did, to the tune of over1 but in which there are elements that impose a cost on us.basis of this principle, the Connussion&apos;s proposals measure up veryThey are heavily biased against our interests and would increaseit resource cost which the policy imposes on our economy.   The Commission(that they represent a total saving to Community funds of 823 million EUAs&apos;pari son with the draft 1980 budget presented last October.   But overJhis alleged saving is represented by the co-responsibility levies on milk.
&gt;h are not a reduction in cost but a new source of revenue.   The real savingnly about 370 million EUAs, and this net figure conceals an additional costresult of the price increases proposed.  My officials are preparing a  iled analysis of all the proposals for discussion with other Departments,the general picture is clear,he basis of the general principle I have suggested, my line on the mainosals would be as follows:-es Virtually all increases in common prices impose an additional cost on either through the budget or in trade.   I should say therefore that, whileHgnising the difficulty that a total freeze would produce in a time ofapid cost inflation, we start with an initial bias against any price increases.Particular we are totally opposed to price increases for the commoditiestructural surplus, milk and sugar.B Levies I should oppose the Commission&apos;s new proposal exempting the firstI&apos;OOOkg of milk production by producers in less favoured areas from the proposedWral co-responsibility levy of 1.5%, pointing out~that while this would exemptIX of Irish milk production, 30% of Italian and over 20% of French and German, would exempt only 4% of ours.   I would however support the principle of a discriminatory general levy, provided it were linked with an unchangedbtmon price.   I would oppose the revised proposal for a super-levy of 84% offee price on milk purchases by dairies above 99% of 1979 levels, on the groundslat it would freeze the existing pattern of production, discriminate against low-cost production, and enshrine and discriminate in favour of existingHi us production.Her subsidy  I would point out that the proposed abolition of the UK butterpsidy would deprive us of a net benefit of  75m.   It discriminates unacceptablygainst a method of surplus disposal which affords a benefit to the UK whileper methods of surplus disposal such as export restitution are left untouched.Hr Quotas I would oppose the Commission&apos;s proposals on sugar quotas sincehey still discriminate heavily against us (the new proposals give Us a small BHa of about 74,000 tonnes but would still cut our A quota from 1,040,000 toHOOO tonnes.  This year&apos;s UK production is 1,150,000 tonnes.  No otherHtry is being asked to take a comparable cut in current production levelsO,Hora will propose that the existing quotas should be extended for one year,He there is no time to negotiate new ones before planting takes place andHe the rise in the world price should in any case greatly cut the cost ofIfplus disposal in 1980/81.  At this stage I should argue against giving up theJpuggle for quota reduction on a fair basis.   In March however I think we shouldIgree to his proposal.   It is in my view realistic&apos;, and it would have the greatwantage for us of removing a booby-trap which otherwise lies in wait on 1 July.If next year&apos;s sugar regime, which begins then, had no quotas because none hadJin agreed, the full price guarantee^would apply to all sugar produced, at h greater cost to Community funds and to the UK}i f On beef, the Commission have proposed a new beef suckler cow subsidy, and expected, have made no proposal to continue the UK beef slaughter premium.He we have 27 per cent of all beef cows in the Community, and since theTsidy would be financed entirely by Community funds (instead of the 25 perTt contribution they make to the existing premiums) a beef cow subsidy shouldJprinciple be financially advantageous to us, as well as helping us with our ficulties over producers on marginal land.   But the Commission have greatlyTuced its potential benefit to us by restricting it to the first 15 cows onfolding which does not produce milk (which would mean that we received onlyper cent of the expenditure instead of 27 per cent).   I would oppose thisit as discriminating against us.
s The Commission have proposed for cereals a 2 per cent increase inention prices and a 3.75 per cent increase in target and thereforehold prices.  This differential is intended to discourage imports. Sf ularly of maize.   It would bear disproportionately on us by increasingBrice of maize imports and of hard wheat from North America which we needFour bread.  I would argue against both the price increases and theHimination against our interests, and would press for changes in theBis regime so as to discourage intervention buying of breadmaking wheat,  have discussed in OD(E).  On the related question of phasing out thesubsidies, on which I have corresponded with others interested, Iaccept no commitment to any reduction so long as the proposal to increaserice of maize, the raw material of our maize starch industry, is still on able.   fVJOn wine I shall argue that there are no grounds for any price increase, letones which range as high as nearly 4%, for a commodity where there is|ably an underlying structural surplus and not a jnere seasonal surplus, asoranission imply.would of course be a mainly negative line and I should doubtless be challengeday what I would myself propose for reducing the cost of the CAP.  At thise I would confine myself to saying that there must above all be a policyinn restraint over a course of years on prices for commodities in structurallus.  I would go on to recognise that this would not in the short termthe problem of rising cost and that other measures must be found to limitcost to Community funds.   I should point out that the Commission-&apos;s super-levyosal for milk has the effect of passing on to member countries themselvesthe shape of their producers) the cost of disposing of new surplus production;that I can see no reason in principle why the cost of disposing of existinglus production should not also be transferred in part, perhaps on aressive basis, from Community funds to member states through their nationalequers.  I would however decline at this stage to be drawn into the detailow this might be done.   I do not think we need be at all hesitant aboutling this fairly aggressive line.  The French have just come out with aage of counter-proposals on milk which carefully eliminates every measurech is of little or no benefit to them and retains every one from which theyfit.Iore negotiation begins in earnest in March I propose to circulate a paper0D(E) setting out my proposals for CAP reform, basically on these lines,the progressive transference of cost from Community to national funds. Mypose would be to formulate an intellectually respectable policy which would ually cut the cost to the Community budget and to us.   It would not of course  readily negotiable, but the retention of the VAT limit will in my view vitably push the Community in time towards some switch to national financing.Our task must be to ensure that such a switch benefits us to the maximumpossible extent, and this will require very careful attention to the details.This however need not be decided now.  At present we need only to decide the ne to take next week, and I should be grateful to know if you are contentwith what I have proposed. am sending copies of this letter to the Prime Minister, other members of OD(E)Id Sir Robert Armstrong.PETER WALKER
