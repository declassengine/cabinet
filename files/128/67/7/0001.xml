confidentialTHE HOME SECRETARY said that he had now laid a Statement ofChanges in Immigration Rules before Parliament*    The Oppositionwould table a prayer against the Statement.    The changes beingmade were almost identical with the proposals that had been thesubject of a full day&apos;s debate in the House.    A further prolongeddebate would not be helpful to the Government either at home orabroad.    It was possible that the Opposition would use a Supply Dayto secure a full day&apos;s debate; if they did not, he hoped mat anydebate could be held after 10.00 pm and be kept as short as possible.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that every effort should be made to keep to aminimum the amount of Government time made available for a debateon the Statement of Changes in the Immigration Rules.The Cabinet -2.      Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterand the Chief Whip to be guided by the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion.1confidentialTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that,following the discussion in Home and Social Affairs Committeeearlier in the month, in which considerable unease had beenexpressed about the 1981 Census, he had decided that the draftOrder in Council for the census should not be laid before Parliamentuntil the second half of March.   As a result it seemed very unlikelythat the Order in Council could be made at the meeting of the PrivyCouncil on 21 April as planned.    There were particular difficultiesabout finding time for the necessary debate on the draft Order inCouncil in the House of Lords.1.        The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.    The Prime Ministerand the Chancellof of the Exchequer would speak for the Governmentin the debate on the Opposition Motion of Censure on 28 February.Members from both sides of the House who were in Rhodesia toobserve the forthcoming elections would not be required to returnfor the debate.The Cabinet -1.      Took note.
CONFIDENTIALIn discussion it was agreed that priority had to be given in theHouse of Lords to debates on the Education (No. 2) Bill.    A verylarge number of amendments had been tabled to th^ Bill, some ofwhich might well be passed against Government advice thusrequiring further debates on the Bill in both Houses.    The measurehad to become law before Easter.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that, following the laying of the draft Order in Councilfor the census, time for the necessary Parliamentary debates shouldbe found as soon as practicable.    The passage of the Education(No. 2) Bill must, however, have priority.The Cabinet -3.      Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterthe Chief Whip and the Minister of State; Ministry ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food to be guided accordingly.CONFIDENTIALTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE expressed concern atthe practice of the new departmental Select Committees in summoningMinisters before them for lengthy questioning on matters of currentpolitical controversy, such as trade union immunities.    This wasnot how the work of the new Committees had been expected to develop,and the implications for both Ministers and Parliament were serious.In discussion it was suggested that the proceedings of SelectCommittees, which at times were broadcast and which were attractingconsiderable Press attention, were devaluing the importance ofdebates on the floor of the House.    Ministers and officials werespending an unreasonable amount of time in responding to therequests of Select Committees for detailed evidence.    The cost wasconsiderable.    The Committees were demanding access to officialpapers and, although the Cabinet had already agreed that paperscontaining advice to Ministers should not be disclosed, there was acontinuing need to secure consistency in responding to theCommittees&apos; requests.    On the other hand, the Government wascommitted by decisions taken in Opposition to support the establish-ment of the new Select Committees.    The increased burdens theywould impose had been foreseen.    The Committees were likely inthe long run to increase the effectiveness of Parliament, and theirwork would be complementary to that done on the floor of the House.Although it placed great demands on Ministers to have to answerquestions from members of a Committee for one and a half hours ormore, it also provided opportunities to explain Government policy.Several Ministers had already found discussion with SelectCommittees to be useful.2
CONFIDENTIALIn further discussion, it was pointed out that the Chancellor of theDuchy of Lancaster and the Chief Whip had had informal talks withthe Conservative chairmen and majority leaders of the Committees,The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster was also in regular touchwith Mr du Cann, the chairman of the Liaison Committee.Representations could be made through the Committee about mattersof concern to Ministers.   Problems arising frdm the broadcastingof Select Committee proceedings could be brought to the notice ofMr du  Cann and the chairman of the Select Committee on SoundBroadcasting.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said matMinisters should continue to bring to the notice of the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster matters to be raised with the LiaisonCommittee.    The Cabinet recognised the increased demands whichSelect Committees were placing on Ministers and their Departments.They would resume discussion of the cost imposed by the SelectCommittees when the Cabinet considered the wider question of thecost of Parliament, on a memorandum being prepared by theChancellor of the Duchy.    It would be important to deal consistentlywith problems arising from the work of the Select Committees,including unusual requests for access to official documents; theyshould accordingly be raised in the first instance with the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster and could, if collective discussion seemeddesirable, be referred for decision to the Home and Social AffairsCommittee.The Cabinet -4. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.5. Noted that the Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster, in consultation with the Minister of State,Civil Service Department, and other Ministers, waspreparing a memorandum about the cost of Parliament,including the costs falling on Government Departmentsin meeting the demands made upon them by SelectCommittees.6. Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for theHome and Social Affairs Committee to consider, asnecessary, problems arising from the work of SelectCommittees.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL2.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe situation in Rhodesia seemed if anything slightly better. Despitethe problems, arrangements for the elections were moving ahead.A difficult decision would shortly be necessary on whether, because ofintimidation by Mr Mugabe&apos;s supporters, the Governor should excludecertain areas from voting.    Such a decision would be bound to attractsome international criticism, which could, and might be intended to,throw doubt upon the validity of the result of the elections.    On balance,therefore, it would be better if this could be avoided.    The situationhad not been helped by certain ill-considered activities of the Rhodesiansecurity forces.    Internationally, the immediate future was likely to bedifficult.    President Nyerere of Tanzania remained hostile and hadsucceeded in alarming die Australian Government in particular. TheUnited States Government&apos;s attitude would be important; theirrepresentative at the United Nations was likely to be unhelpful, butmore understanding could be expected from the Secretary of State,Mr Vance, who would be briefly in London in the next 24 hours.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that thePolitical Co-operation meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Nine on19 February had welcomed his proposal for the neutrality of Afghanistan.No other ideas had been put forward on the post-Afghanistan situation;and the French had made difficulties over including a reference to theOlympic Games in the communique of the meeting.The Cabinet -Took note.3.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thata series of bilateral discussion on our Budget problem was now inprospect.    He himself would shortly be seeing the Foreign Ministersof the Federal Republic of Germany, Luxembourg, the Irish Republicand Belgium.    The Lord Privy Seal would be meeting Herr von Dohnanyi,State Secretary in the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs.    The PrirreMinister was hoping to visit Mr van Agt, the Dutch Prime Minister inThe Hague.    Arrangements had now been made for the next Anglo-German summit on 27-28 March: this would provide the opportunityfor discussions between the Prime Minister and Chancellor Schmidton the eve of the next European Council.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthat, at its meeting the previous day, the Commission had decidedto defer any decision on further legal action against the French. Thiswas contrary to assurances he had been given by CommissionerGundelach who now appeared to be trying to help the French byadvocating some temporary form of intervention buying.    It wasdisgraceful that after six months there had still been no effective actionagainst the French, whereas the Commission had acted with greatrapidity against the United Kingdom when the previous Government hadintroduced a pigmeat subsidy.    The Foreign and CommonwealthSecretary had recently written to the President of the Commission urginthe need for die Commission to seek an interim injunction from theEuropean Court.    Future tactics would require careful consideration.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said thatthere was little support within the Community for our efforts to stopfurther exports of butter to die Soviet Union.    The Commission had,through the Management Committee (where decisions were made bymajority voting) introduced a new system of tendering for such exportswhich would be limited to old stocks of intervention butter. Therewould be strong protests in this country if and when exports resumedunder this procedure.In a brief discussion reference was made to the contrast between theinability of the United Kingdom to stop butter exports to the SovietUnion by legal means and the continued flouting of Community law bythe French.The Cabinet -Took note.4.        THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND saidthat the Conference on the future government of Northern Ireland wascontinuing to meet regularly, except where conflicting meetings of theEuropean Parliament made this impossible*    Slow progress was beingmade in covering the agenda; it had been right to accept this, as theparties became accustomed to working together, but it might soon benecessary for him to apply pressure to speed up the Conference&apos;s work.It would be important to have been at least once through the entireagenda in time for a break for reflection over Easter.   Public pressurefor news of what was going on, behind the Conference&apos;s closed doors,would begin to build up before long.    Some way should also be found assoon as possible for involving the Official Unionist Party, who weremaintaining their refusal to take part in the Conference.The Cabinet -Took note.5CONFIDENTIAL
confidentialconfidentialTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that the rejectionof the strike call over the dismissal of Mr Derek Robinson wasencouraging; but the company had still to reach agreement on wagesand on working practices, and to consolidate the recent improvementin its market share.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that discussionswere continuing in Brussels about the availability of EuropeanCommunity Funds to help with the re-deployment of redundant steelworkers.    The steel unions had now submitted a fresh claim to theBritish Steel Corporation, which they maintained was largely self-financing.   Negotiations were continuing.In further discussion, it was pointed out that the steel dispute hadbecome linked with the threatened strike of South Wales miners thefollowing week.    First indications from the pit-head ballots, however,were that the call for strike action would not be widely supported. Ingeneral, the steel strike was still having little effect on industrialoutput, although there were signs of an emerging shortage of tinplatefor food canning, which the Department of Industry would investigate,THE HOME SECRETARY said mat the planned mass picket of thesteel works at Sheerness had passed off relatively quietly, thanks todetermined action by the Kent police.   He had agreed to a requestto meet representatives of the Chief Constables who, while under-standably stressing their complete independence of Governmentcontrol, had welcomed the opportunity of that meeting with him andwere co-operating between themselves.    The situation at Hadfield&apos;ssteel works in Sheffield remained unclear: the Management weredemanding assurances of complete protection which, as they must wellrealise, the police could not, in the circumstances of heavy picketing,absolutely guarantee.   It seemed likely that the works would remainclosed*5.        THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT saidthat, following the rejection by the General and Municipal Workers&apos;Union of the previous pay offer, and informal discussions betweenboth sides, formal negotiations were resuming that day.    There wasa reasonable chance that an enhanced pay offer of 21.4 per centwould be accepted by the unions, but there was still a possibility ofstrike action.THE HdtME SECRETARY said that the Civil Contingencies Unit wouldmeet hetjit day if necessary to review plans.    If it became necessaryto dell ia the/ services, their effectiveness would be criticallydependent on whether the supervisors were prepared to co-operate;
CONFIDENTIALTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that a DelegateConference of the General and Municipal Workers&apos; Union (the unionalso involved in the water dispute) had rejected the latest pay offer,and that further talks would take place the following week.THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT said that the Port of LondonAuthority (PLA) had slightly changed its pay offer.    The Transportand General Workers&apos; Union members had gone back to work pendingthe outcome of a ballot on this new offer; the National Associationof Stevedores and Pockworkers members might resume work nextday.    The financial position of the PLA had deteriorated as a resultof the strike, and the announcement of impending dock closureswould probably have to be brought forward, perhaps to within thenext two weeks.    In discussion it was suggested that it was importantto stress the connection between the strike and the intended closures.The dispute with the Medical Laboratory Scientific Officers continued.A pay settlement had been imposed both in England and Wales andScotland.The Cabinet -Took note.6.        THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said mat theClearing Banks would be announcing, over the next few weeks, veryhigh profits for 1979.    These profits were largely the result of thecurrent high level of interest rates.   About one-third of the profitswould be paid over in Corporation Tax, but the banks would be leftwith large surpluses.    Only a small part of these would be paid asdividends; the rest would remain to strengthen the banks&apos; resources,and thus ensure their capacity to provide further assistance toindustry in the next few difficult months.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, summirg up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet appreciated the political embarrassment of publicationof high bank profits at this stage.    It was for the b .nks themselvesto defend and explain these profits, but the Government could helpby emphasising the size of the tax take, the counter-cyclical natureof bank profits - high when industrial profits were low, and vice-versaand the need for a strong banking system.    The Chancellor of theExchequer, after consultation with the Paymaster General would(circulate to Ministers a background brief for use in speeches andinterviews.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion.Cabinet Office21 February 19808CONFIDENTIAL
