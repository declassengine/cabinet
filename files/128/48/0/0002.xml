OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy NOQ0CABINETCONFIDENTIAL annex cm(72) 7th Conclusions, Minute 3Thursday 17 February 1972 at 10. 30 a. m.ITHERNLANDParkersortTHE PRIME MINISTER said that the Ministers directly concerned had considered the Report of the Committee on InterrogationProcedures under the Chairmanship of Lord Parker.    The 3 PrivyCounsellors who had constituted the Committee had been unable toagree upon their conclusions.    Lord Parker and Mr.  Boyd Carpenterhad formed the view that the use of hooding and certain other methodsin connection with the interrogation of detainees in Northern ireland had been morally justified and would be morally justified in similar circumstances elsewhere but that in Great Britain at least they hadno legal justification.    They had refrained from expressing an opinionabout their legality in Northern Ireland since a case which mightraise this issue was currently before the Courts there.    The effectof the majority recommendation, therefore, was that the Government,before authorising these techniques on a future occasion, should ensure that there was adequate legal authority for them.Lord Gardiner, on the other hand, had taken the view not only that thetechniques were plainly unlawful but also that they could not in any circumstances be morally justified.    The Ministers concerned had reached the conclusion that the majority recommendation should beaccepted to the extent that it held the techniques to be morallyjustified but that it was unrealistic to suppose that legislation giving them legal authority could be passed through Parliament.    TheReport would be published in the course of the following week; and hewould make an appropriate statement about the Government&apos;s position at the same time.    Meanwhile, it was important that the report should be regarded as highly confidential.cial THE PRIME MINISTER also informed the Cabinet that judgment wasvers Acts     shortly to be given in the Northern Ireland Supreme Court in a case which raised the issue whether the Army could properly be authorisedto carry out functions under the Civil Authorities (Special Powers)Acts of the Northern Ireland Parliament.    The Ministers concerned1
were urgently considering the situation which would arise if the judgment were adverse to the Crown and the Army were limited,as a result, to such functions as they could normally discharge insupport of the civil power under common law.The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office17 February, 19722
