Thenee: senior officers of the Northern Ireland Civil Service and the Royal) 18th Ulster Constabulary (RUC) had assured him of the loyalty of theireions, respective Services in the difficult task of adjustment to the situation created by the Government&apos;s decision to take over the powers ofthe Northern Ireland Government.    In particular, there was no evidence that any members of the RUC had supported the appealof the Ulster Vanguard movement for a two day strike.    The strike had seriously affected the economic life of the Provinceeparticularly as a result of the need to impose reductions of powersupplies.    He believed, however, that it derived to a significantextent from the need to maintain the credibility of the threatened&quot;Protestant backlash&quot; and that, once the protest had been made, themood of the majority of Unionist supporters might be more reasonable.    He had assured the RUC that the policy of beginninga phased release of internees implied no criticism of their previousactions; but this would continue to be a sensitive subject.    In the predominantly Roman Catholic areas of the cities there was evident relaxation of tension and a more friendly mood towardsthe Army.   Nevertheless, the number of bombing and shootingincidents had so far shown little decrease;  and there had been aserious outbreak of violence in the predominantly Protestant town of Portadown,    A number of misconceptions had been fosteredamong the Protestant community.    He would be concerned to correct these and, in particular, to make it clear that the proposedAdvisory Commission would have no executive powers,    A numberof matters would require early decision, especially the questionwhether the Government should relax the total ban on marchesbefore the Easter weekend.    It was difficult in practice to do morethan contain marches and to try to prevent them from erupting intointer-sectarian violence; and, if the ban were maintained for the traditional Nationalist marches at Easter, we should have no choice
but to attempt to enforce it during the Orange marching season inthe sixmmer.    It was also desirable to consider at an early stagewhether the policy of cratering Border roads should be modified.Some degree of relaxation might lead to closer local co-operationbetween the RUC and the Gardai, which might in turn assist in preventing the smuggling of arms and explosives from theRepublic into Northern Ireland.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that themilitary units which had been brought to short notice as possiblereinforcements for the Northern Ireland garrison were stillstanding by; but it was to be hoped that the situation would soon be sufficiently clarified to permit a relaxation of the readiness ofat least some of these units.    The Army was currently taking care to avoid any actions which might be regarded as provocative inpredominantly Roman Catholic areas; but it would be necessaryto take early decisions about the intensity of future searchoperations to discover terrorists of the Irish Republic Army (IRA).In discussion it was pointed out that, although the initial reactions of the Prime Minister of the Irish Republic, Mr Lynch, to theGovernments decisions had been helpful, it might still be difficult for him overtly to adopt more severe measures against the IRA inthe Republic.    But any action which could be taken unobtrusivelyin Northern Ireland - for example a gradual relaxation of thecratering of Border roads - might prompt Mr Lynch to givecorrespondingly discreet directions to his own security forces to intensify their operations against the IRA.    Mr Lynch&apos;s attitudemight also be affected by the scope and timing of the first steps inthe phased release of internees;  and this was an additional reasonfor seeking to reach early decisions on this subject.In further discussion of the arrangements for the passage of theNorthern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Bill through Parliament,it was reported that the Opposition were likely to move an amendment providing that Orders in Council on matters which had previously been the legislative responsibility of the NorthernIreland Parliament should be subject to Affirmative, rather thanNegative, Resolution procedure in the United Kingdom Parliament.It might be considered reasonable to accept this amendment; butit would be necessary to ensure that the early appointment of a director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland, which would need to be validated by Order in Council, would not be prejudicedas a result.    The attitude of the Govemmenfs supporters to theBill was probably not as adverse as some Press comment had suggested; nevertheless, some Conservative as well as UlsterUnionist Members might well vote against the Bill on SecondReading,    The Ulster Unionist Members hoped that, so long asthe Northern Ireland Parliament stood prorogued, it would bepossible to limit to the essential minimum the Northern Ireland2
legislation laid before the United Kingdom Parliament by Orders inCouncil.   Nevertheless, a substantial volume of importantNorthern Ireland legislation, flowing from the reorganisation oflocal government in the Province, was in fact outstanding0    this legislation had reached various stages in the Northern Irelandlegislative process; and it would be important to consider howurgently the United Kingdom Parliament might need to deal withits different elements.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that hewould arrange with the Ministers immediately concerned for early decisions on the questions of the Army&apos;s operational policy inpredominantly Roman Catholic areas and the maintenance orrelaxation of the ban on marches.    Early consideration should alsobe given to policy as regards the cratering of Border roads and tothe scope and timing of the first releases of internees.    on political reforms in the longer term he would consider the best means of devising proposals for constitutional discussions andpreparing a strategy for the associated negotiations.    The lord president of the Council, after his next visit to Northern Ireland,should report whether he could put forward proposals for theestablishment and composition of the Advisory Commission.    Heshould also consider further, in consultation with the attorney general, whether, if the Affirmative Resolution procedure were adopted for Orders in Council concerning Northern Ireland, itwould nevertheless be possible to make the necessary arrangementsfor the immediate appointment of a Director of Public Prosecutionsfor Northern Ireland.    Thereafter he should complete hisexamination of the state of the Northern Ireland legislative programme and should take steps to secure such action as mightbe urgently required in this respect from the outgoing NorthernIreland Ministers.    He should also give further consideration tothe financial situation of the Northern Ireland Government andshould consider how far the need for increasing subventions fromthe United Kingdom could provide a means of pressure uponpolitical leaders in Northern Ireland to adopt a more reasonable and co-operative attitude.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theLord President of the Council to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office28 March 19723
