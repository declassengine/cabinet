CUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy NOCABINETERNNDusnee:) 20thtitans,confidential annex cm(72) 22nd Conclusions, Minute 3Thursday 20 April 1972 at 11. 00 am the SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND informed the Cabinet that, although the shooting by the Army of Joseph McCann,a prominent member of the &quot;official&quot; wing of the Irish republican army, together with the publication of the Report of the inquiry bythe Lord Chief Justice, Lord Widgery, into the events in Londonderryon 30 January 1972 had tended to exacerbate the political atmospherein Northern Ireland, there had nevertheless been some moderatelyencouraging developments within the Reman Catholic community.In particular, a women&apos;s meeting held in the Andersonstown district of Belfast in favour of a cessation of violence had been well attended;and there were signs of a less hostile attitude towards the Army evenin the Bogside and Creggan districts of Londonderry.    there remained no lack of opportunities for those who wished theGovernments poHcies ill to say that those policies had failed;but it was important that the Government should not be deflectedfrom their course by day-to-day political pressures.    He had therefore authorised, with the minimum of publicity, the releaseof a further 26 internees.Despite statements to the contrary by the Unionist Leader,Mr Faulkner, there were no areas in Belfast through whichthe security forces could not pass freely.    As soon as anybarricades were put up they were removed; and in some casesthe local residents had dismantled them in anticipation of action by the Army.    In Londonderry the situation differed little fromthat of past months, although hooliganism was showing signs of extending beyond the Bogside and Creggan areas.    Within those areas, however, there was no deterioration.    The continuingprotection by the Army of the Royal Ulster Constabulary postin Bligh&apos;s Lane was an unpalatable military commitment; butfor political reasons it could not be abandoned.    He hoped tobe able to announce within the next week that satisfactory arrange-ments had been worked out to enable him to lift the comprehensive
ban on marches, particularly since this would enable the NorthernIreland Labour Party to hold a march on 1 May, which he was confident would be reasonably conducted and would serve as an example to others.    It would be necessary, however, to give further consideration to the question whether, following the removalof the ban, he should authorise remission of the sentences of sixmonths&apos; imprisonment recently passed on the Westminster Membersof Parliament, Miss Bernadette Devlin and Mr Frank McM. nuss whowere at present on bail pending appeal.    Given that a number ofinfringements of the ban on marches by &quot;Loyalist&quot; organisationshad gone unpunished, it would be difficult, if he now lifted the ban,not to remit the sentences on the two Members of Parliament.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Secretary ofState for Northern Ireland.Cabinet Office20 April 1972
