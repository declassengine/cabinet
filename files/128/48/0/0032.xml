SECRET  ^ &amp;vuJ*- Tf^JHlS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCOPY NO 9CABINETCONFIDENTIAL ANNEXCM(71) 55th Conclusions, Minute 4Thursday 11 November 1971 at 11.30 amTHE PRIME MINISTER said that a ComraUioe of Inquiry had baenset up under the chairmanship of Sir Edmund Compton toinvestigate allegations, by those arrested on 9 August, under theNorthern Ireland Special Powers Act, of physical brutality.The Committee had now presented their Report, which had beenstudied by the Ministers principally concerned. Everyindividual who believed that he had grounds of complaint had had theopportunity of putting his case to the Committee;  but nearly allof those concerned had failed to take it.    The Committee hadreceived very full oral and documentary evidence from membersof the security forces; but in the majority of cases they had setagainst it no more than the unsubstantiated and uncorroboratedallegations which was all that they had before them. Nevertheless,they had found that there had been no physical brutality. Moreover,so far as the arrest of individuals was concerned, the number ofthe complaints of any substance was very small;  and it was clearthat the Army had conducted a difficult and dangerous operationwith commendable discipline and restraint.    Publicity had tendedto concentrate, however, on allegations about the treatment of amuch smaller number of men who had been interrogated in depthafter arrest.    Interrogation had been carried out by the RoyalUlster Constabulary (RUC) under the supervision of the Army; andthey had necessarily involved various measures which had had to betaken for the purposes of security and control.    Thus, menawaiting interrogation had been hooded and required to standagainst the wall;  and a continuous noise had been maintained inorder to prevent them from talking to one another or overhearingconversations.    In addition, their diet had been restricted to breadand water.    The Committee of Inquiry had concluded that thesemeasures involved physical ill-treatment.It was proposed that the Report should be published on Tuesday,16 November and that it should be prefaced by a statementindicating the Government&apos;s views.    This statement would emphasisethat in the circumstances in which internment had had to be instituted1NORTHERNIRELANDPreviousReference:CM(71) 49thConclusions,Minute 4SECRET
SECRETand the Irish Republican Army (IRA) were conducting a campaignof murder and intimidation it was vitally important to obtainintelligence with the maximum of speed.    In fact information ofgreat value had been obtained from the interrogations. Thepreface would also make it clear that the measures used inNorthern Ireland had been the same as those which had beenemployed elsewhere over a long period of time and were in accordwith procedures authorised for the interrogation of terrorists in1965 and revised in 1967 in the light of an inquiry into interroga-tions in Aden by Mr Roderick Bowen QC.    These proceduresstringently prohibited inhuman and degrading treatment.The publication of the Report would be liable to prompt a demandfor an immediate Parliamentary debate under Standing OrderNo. 9, which might conveniently take place on Wednesday,17 November.    The report brought out the difficulties inimplementing the rules in detail at a time when intensiveinterrogation was necessary;  and it was therefore proposed toindicate, simultaneously with its publication, tnat the Governmentintended, with the concurrence of the Opposition, to establish aCommittee of Privy Counsellors to examine and provideauthoritative advice on the procedures for the interrogation ofpersons suspected of involvement in a terrorist campaign,including their custody while subject to interrogation, and on theapplication of those procedures.    The chairman would be a PrivyCounsellor with judicial experience, supported by one PrivyCounsellor from the Government side and one from theOpposition.In an article on 17 October the Sunday Times had referred tofurther allegations of ill-treatment in the case of 3 persons whohad been arrested after 9 August, the operative date in the termsof reference of the Committee of Inquiry.    Sir Edmund Comptonhad agreed to examine the facts relating to these allegationswithout the support of his 2 colleagues on the Committee, whohad now discharged their functions;  and his further Report wouldbe published at the same time as that of the Committee of Inquiry.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, saidthat the Cabinet agreed that, although some of the acts inquestion might be open to challenge under the law of NorthernIreland, the nature of the background against which interrogationwas carried out justified the methods which had been used andthat it would be right vigorously to defend them against thecriticism which they would inevitably attract in some quarters.The allegations made in a recent report by Amnesty Internationalhad all been dealt with in the Compton Report;  and their grossexaggeration wou Id be manifest.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval of the Prime Minister&apos;sstatement and of his summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office11 November 1971 2SECRET
