He had opened thediscussion with Mr Faulkner on the lines which the Cabinet had agreed at their previous Meeting.    He had explained that an assessment of the military situation in Northern Ireland led tothe conclusion that the successes achieved by the security forces against the terrorist campaign could be effectively consolidatedonly if an improvement in the political situation could be secured by political means.    For this reason, and in order to rectify thepresent unsatisfactory position in which the United KingdomGovernment had to carry both the domestic and the internationalresponsibility for a security policy in Northern Ireland over whichthey had only limited control, the Government had decided thatcertain fresh measures were necessary.    First, a plebiscite shouldbe conducted as soon as possible on the continued status of NorthernIreland as part of the United Kingdom and should thereafter be repeated at intervals of 15 years.    Second, we should begin to release the least dangerous of the individuals interned under theSpecial Powers Acts, with the intention that this process shouldcontinue aa public order and security improved.    Third, theresponsibility for security policy, the administration of the criminal law and matters connected therewith should be transferred to theUnited Kingdom Government.    Fourth, a separate Secretary ofState for Northern Ireland should be appointed.    The purpose ofthese measures would be to seek to deprive the Irish republican army (IRA) of the support which it enjoyed among a substantialportion of the minority community in Northern Ireland; to persuaderepresentatives of all political elements in Northern Ireland to join in discussions on the future political structure of the Province;  andto remove the inhibitions which at present appeared to make itimpossible for the Prime Minister of the Irish Republic, Mr Lynch,to take firm action against the IRA south of the Border.
Mr Faulkner had not felt able to accept this initiative.    He seemedto feel that the needs of the situation would be adequately met bya simple continuation of the policy of seeking the defeat of the terrorists by military means, coupled with political measuresnot going beyond those outlined in the Northern Ireland Government&apos;sGreen Paper and in his own letters of 16 February and 1 March tothe Prime Minister.    He had agreed that a plebiscite on the Bordermight help to conciliate minority opinion;  but he had said that themajority would regard it as adding nothing to the safeguards alreadyinherent in the Ireland Act, 1949.    More fundamentally, however,he had indicated that he and his political supporters could not agreeto the transfer to the United Kingdom Government of the NorthernIreland Governments present responsibilities for law and order,on the grounds that a change cf this kind would imply that theUnited Kingdom Government no longer had confidence in theAdministration at Stormont, that the responsibilities which would remain with the Government of Northern Ireland would not besufficient to maintain its political credibility and that the reductionin its status would be claimed by the IRA as a victory for the forces which they represented.    He had made it clear that he would regard the transfer of responsibility for law and order to Westminster aseven less realistic and acceptable politically than the assumption bythe United Kingdom Government of complete responsibility for allfunctions of government in Northern Ireland.    He had offered, as apossible compromise, only the beginning of a phased elimination of internment by agreement between the 2 Governments;  theappointment of a United Kingdom Minister as Joint Chairman withthe Northern Ireland Minister of Home Affairs of the NorthernIreland Joint Security Committee, on the basic that each JointChairman would have a right of veto;  aad the replacement of theSpecial Powers Acts in Northern Ireland by fresh legislation whichwould be enacted at Stormont and would be designed ultimately toassimilate the emergency powers available to the Northern ireland government to those available in the rest of the United Kingdom.It had been agreed that each Prime Minister should consult further with his Cabinet colleagues.    So far, he had not told Mr Faulknerspecifically that, if the United Kingdom Cabinet found his counterproposals unacceptable, they would be prepared to go to the fulllength of legislating to prorogue the Stormont Parliament and totransfer all the powers of the Northern Ireland Government to a secretary of State for Northern Ireland.    But, in answer to ahypothetical question on this point, Mr Faulkner had said that he andhis colleagues would have to decide whether they should oppose theimposition of United Kingdom rule of the Province or should perhapsoffer themselves as candidates for membership of the UnitedKingdom Parliament.    He had also said, however, that he would do all he could to moderate the political temperature in NorthernIreland if the United Kingdom Government decided that they had no
choice but to assume the responsibility for direct government ofthe Province which was implicit in Section 75 of the Government ofIreland Act, 1920.    He had made it clear that in that event theGovernment at Westminster must be prepared to deal with industrial action by the majority community in Northern Ireland and, perhaps,with acts of violence against the minority.    As regards the longer term, Mr Faulkner had not seemed fully to realise thenature of the problem either of persuading the representatives ofthe minority to resume active participation in the political life ofthe Province or of re-establishing law and order in areas such asthe Bogside and Creggan districts of Londonderry.    This attitude on his part, coupled with the fact that his counter-proposals forimmediate action would merely increase the responsibility of theUnited Kingdom Government without giving them any significantlygreater control over public order and security in the Province,confronted the Cabinet with the need to take the final decision.They should first consider whether the counter-proposals were acceptable; but, if not, they must then decide what should be saidto Mr Faulkner when the two Prime Ministers resumed contactfollowing their respective Cabinet meetings.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatit was important to take account of the probable reactions of thePrime Minister of the Irish Republic, Mr Lynch, to the variouscourses under consideration.    Mr Lynch would almost certainlyregard as unacceptable changes which did no more than give theUnited Kingdom Government some degree of joint control oversecurity in the Six Counties.    He would welcome the transfer ofresponsibility for law and order   to the United KingdomGovernment.    But he would endorse above all the imposition of aperiod of United Kingdom rule.In discussion it was suggested that the reaction of extreme elements of both communities in Northern Ireland to such radical measures as the transfer to Westminster of responsibility for law and order or the imposition of United Kingdom rule had perhaps been under-estimated.    The Unionist reactions, in particular, might be soviolent as to provoke a state of virtually civil war, while the IRAmight be provoked into extending their campaign of terrorism toGreat Britain.    There could be no certainty that measures of thekind envisaged would succeed in persuading either community inNorthern Ireland to take part in fresh discussions directed towardscreating a new political structure in the Province.    It was truethat Unionist opinion might be prepared to participate in such discussions, particularly if certain Unionist leaders were preparedto accept the need, at least temporarily, for a fuller integration of Northern Ireland into the United Kingdom as an essential first step.    But, if this hope was disappointed or the minority community3
was not equally co-operative, the temporary imposition of UnitedKingdom rule might inevitably become permanent.    This was perhaps the more to be feared since the United Kingdom governments proposals could not be regarded as satisfying any of the 3 &quot;conditions&quot;stated by the IRA in the context of their recent &quot;truce&quot; - i. e. thewithdrawal of the Army from Northern Ireland, the abolition(presumably in perpetuity) of the system of regional parliamentary government in Northern Ireland and a general amaeety for persons convicted of acts of terrorism or interned or detained on suspicion of association with such acts.On the other hand there seemed to be no prospect of bringingviolence to an end and re-establishing public order in NorthernIreland unless the IRA could be deprived of its base in the minority community and Mr Lynch could be induced to institute sterner actionagainst its supporters within the Republic.    It was therefore necessary to adopt whatever measures seemed best calculated to achieve these purposes and to create a fresh climate in whichconstructive discussions about the long term political structure ofthe Province might be initiated.    The transfer of responsibility for law and order to Westminster was probably the minimum changerequired to this end;  the temporary suspension of Stormont might do even more to enlist the support of responsible Roman Catholicopinion in both parts of Ireland.Moreover, the limited scope of Mr Faulkner&apos;s counter-proposalssuggested that he now had little freedom of political manoeuvrein relation to his own supporters, who were still reluctant both to recognise the importance to British public opinion of a freshstart in Northern Ireland or to accept that, even after the withdrawalof responsibility for law and order, Northern Ireland would enjoy a substantially larger measure of regional self government than eitherScotland or Wales.    The joint control of security policy, on thebasis that the Northern Ireland Government would retain the rightof veto, would place the United Kingdom Government in an impossible position, while an arrangement which would give them little morethan a say in decisions on the release of individuals from internmentcould not be expected to have sufficient impact to precipitate the radical change in political attitudes which was now essential.    Therewere indications that opinion among the Governments supporters inParliament, including some of the Ulster Unionist Membersthemselves, was moving towards the view that the present situation could not continue indefinitely;  and it would be politically intolerablefor the Government to retreat so far from the requirements whichthe Prime Minister had indicated to Mr Faulkner that it would be clear that they had no greater freedom of political initiative thanthe Northern Ireland Government were prepared to allow them.    Inthe presentation of an eventual decision to suspend Stormont,however, it would be important that Mr Faulkner should be clearly
seen to have been offered the more limited proposal of the transferof law and order to Westminster and to have rejected it before themore drastic course was adopted.    It would also be essential toensure the continued loyalty of the Royal Ulster Constabulary andof the public servants in the Northern Ireland Departments whichwere to come under the control of the new Secretary of State.    Itmight therefore be necessary for senior officials to visit NorthernIreland immediately after the announcement of the new measures in order to explain the context of the Governments decisions andto remind all concerned of their allegiance to the Crown.In further discussion it was suggested that the suspension ofStormont might be made more acceptable to Conservative andUnionist opinion if it were accompanied by the proscription nf their  as an illegal organisation in Great Britain as well as inNorthern Ireland.    But, although this might be desirable on merits,the introduction of such a provision into the legislation for the suspension of Stormont would be liable to complicate and to delayits enactment, especially since it would probably be necessary, but would certainly be controversial to empower the Secretary of state to proscribe by Order any organisation which was concerned topromote the use of violence for political ends in relation to northern Ireland.    It was important, for several reasons, tosecure the passage of the main legislation as rapidly as possible.Even if Mr Faulkner agreed to remain in office until the Bill waspassed, it would be desirable to effect the transition to UnitedKingdom rule with the minimum of delay;  and, if he did not agreeto maintain an Administration during this interval or was prevented from doing so, it would be even more important to reduce to theminimum the period during which there would be no NorthernIreland Minister of Home Affairs capable of exercising the statutory powers in relation to internment and security.   Moreover, it couldbe very dangerous if, during the period of the Easter marches,there were any uncertainty about the attribution of responsibility for maintaining law and order in Northern Ireland.    It might thereforebe best at this stage to omit any reference to the proscription of their  from the prospective legislation but at the same time to let itbe known that the Government were examining means by which more positive action could be taken against the organisation in GreatBritain.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed unanimously that, if Mr Faulkner, after referenceto the Northern Ireland Cabinet, could not advance beyond the counter-proposals which he had put forward on the previous day,he should be informed that these were not regarded as adequateby the United Kingdom Government, who would accordingly feel obliged to proceed to implement their own intentions, including, inparticular, the transfer to Westminster of the responsibility for law5
and order.    If Mr Faulkner indicated that in that event he couldnot remain in office, he should be told that the United KingdomGovernment would then have no alternative but to legislate for theintroduction of direct United Kingdom rule in Northern Irelandand that this would entail the prorogation of the Northern ireland parliament and the assumption by a Secretary of State for NorthernIreland of the powers of the Northern Ireland Government.    Atthe same time it would be made clear that the temporary suspension of Stormont was designed to permit the widest possible consultations with the various bodies of political opinion in the Province in an effort to seek agreement on the form of longer term arrangements which would guarantee for all elements of the community an active,permanent and guaranteed role in the public affairs of the Province.The suspension of the Northern Ireland Parliament and theassumption by the Government of the United Kingdom of the powersof the Northern Ireland Government would also be accompanied bya declaration of our intention to hold at the earliest practicablemoment a plebiscite on the status of Northern Ireland as part of theUnited Kingdom and by measures constituting a first step towardsthe termination of internment on the lines which had been broadlyagreed between the two Governments.    Meanwhile, he would arrangefor the practical implications of these decisions, includingparticularly the timing of the legislation, the related publicannouncements and the necessary appointments, to be considered further by the Ministers directly concerned.    If Mr Faulkner,following his deliberations with his colleagues, put forward afresh set of counter-proposals, it might be necessary for theCabinet to meet again at short notice.    Otherwise, the action whichthe Cabinet had now approved would take its course.    There wasno doubt that it entailed great risks;  but even greater dangerswould attend any alternative policy.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office24 March 19726
