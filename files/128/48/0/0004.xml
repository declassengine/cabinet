personalTOP secret copy No.27CABINETCONFIDENTIAL annex cm(72) 11th Conclusions, Minute 4Thursday 2 March 1972 at 11. 00 amHERN THE PRIME MINISTER said that the situation in Northern Ireland,ND had been kept under close examination by the Ministers principally concerned.    The time had now come when the Cabinet must beginme to consider decisions of the utmost importance on the futureonce: administration of the Province,2) 9thusions THE HOME SECRETARY said that he believed that the pointhad been reached when a decisive political initiative by the UnitedKingdom Government was required.    The Roman Catholic minorityhad now become totally alienated; and it was clear that, despite thesuccesses of the Army, military action alone could not bring peace and stability to the Province.    The dangers involved in a politicalinitiative were great; but the dangers of allowing the presentsituation to continue unresolved were even greater.    The Protestantmajority needed a renewed assurance that Northern Ireland would remain part of the United Kingdom, while the Roman Catholicminority were entitled to claim the just share in government whichthe present political system denied them.    Political reform mustaccordingly be directed to satisfying both these aspirations; and itmight need to be supplemented by a progressive relaxation of internment.    It seemed clear that, in addition, the United KingdomGovernment would have to assume constitutional responsibility forthe maintenance of law and order.    But if a political reform of thiskind was to succeed, it would be necessary to make a break with thepast and to arrange for the United Kingdom Government to exercisedirect responsibility for the administration of Northern Ireland foran interim period.    He would circulate a memorandum to theCabinet, setting out in greater detail proposals on the lines whichhe had indicated, as the basis for an early discussion of the whole problem.The circulation of this paper has been^strictly limited^-- fjQ n .       ^It is issued for the personal use of .r^.^..Jl^A.......A*w/      /1 n/l/yT /?
THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that studies of possible arrangementsfor bringing to trial some of the individuals who were at presentinterned under the Special Powers Acts had been put in hand.    Ifthe main problem was the perversity or intimidation of juries, itwould be possible by legislation at Westminster to create specialcourts without juries.    If, however, the principal objective was toprovide an acceptable substitute for internment, it would benecessary to enact legislation which would enable prosecutionsto be conducted under an inquisitorial, rather than our traditionaladversarial, procedure.    Even so, it would not seem possiblewholly to protect the identity of witnesses cr to be confident thatjudicial proceedings of this kind would necessarily result in the conviction and subsequent imprisonment of all those whose activitiesconstituted a menace to stability.The Cabinet -Agreed to resume consideration of a politicalinitiative in Northern Ireland at a meeting earlyin the following week.Cabinet Office2 March 1972
