It was to be feared that serious disorders,with a risk of a further loss of life, might result from the marchesplanned to take place in and around Newry on Sunday 6 February.Contingents from Dundalk, which lay close across the Border, wereintending to take part.    The dispositions made by the security forcesinvolved in this case the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), whom ithad been impracticable to deploy in this way in Londonderry; theArmy would be kept in reserve to cover points which the RUC mightnot be able to hold,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthere might be advantage in ensuring that it was more widely known that, as the Lord Chancellor had already informed the House ofLords, it had been Lord Widgery5 s own proposal that he should conduct the Inquiry alone.    This might help to forestall any suggestion that the Government had appointed a single individualin order to avoid the possibility of a divergence of view such ashad arisen between Lord Parker and Mr John Boyd-.Carpenter MPon the one hand and Lord Gardiner on the other hand during their recent Inquiry into the procedures governing interrogation.Lord Widgery judged that his own Inquiry was simply into questionsof fact; that he would be able to form an opinion by questioning eye-witnesses without the need for expert or other assistance; and thathe could conclude the Inquiry more quickly if he conducted it aloneeThe Roman Catholic residents of Londonderry might not be preparedto co-operate with him.    But he would have power to summonwitnesses sub poena; and it could not be convincingly argued that the Lord Chief Justice of England lacked impartiality.    Asto the marches planned in and around Newry, it was desirable that every influence should be brought to bear to prevent their takingplace.    He had himself written to the Roman Catholic Archbishop1
of Westminster and to the Roman Catholic Primate of All Ireland;and HM Ambassador in Dublin was delivering a personal message to the Prime Minister of the Irish Republic, Mr Lynch, asking him in particular to dissuade citizens of the Republic from taking part.The Cabinet -1.     Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Northern Ireland Prime Minister,Mr Faulkner, had been invited to London to discuss the politicalsituation on the following day.    There were reports that Mr Lynchand the leaders of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties in the Republicmight also wish to come to London to meet British Ministers.    Ifsuch a request was made and could be deemed to be for the purposeof serious discussion rather than mere propaganda, it would be unwise to refuse.    It was desirable to lower the political tension in theRepublic, if possible, particularly in view of Mr lynch&apos;s precariousposition and the absence of any successor who could exert amoderating influence.    The situation was being kept under constant review by the Ministers principally concerned; in particular possibleforms of political initiative were being carefully appraised.In discussion there was general agreement on the importance of  -maintaining a broad base of support in Great Britain for theGovernments policy.    A growing section of public opinion wishedto see British troops withdrawn from Northern Ireland.    It wassometimes forgotten, however, that the Army was the Army ofthe United Kingdom and was not operating in a foreign or colonial territory.    Moreover, to threaten withdrawal might create anexpectation that the Governments resolution was weakening, while to carry it out could only result in extensive bloodshed in NorthernIreland, in which the Roman Catholic element of the population mightwell be the main sufferers.    Before the Army garrison could bereduced to a significantly lower level an acceptable state of law andorder would have to be restored and a satisfactory political settle -ment would need to be achieved.    Nevertheless, in order to retain a broad measure of public support for the maintenance of largemilitary forces in Northern Ireland, it was desirable that movement towards some political solution of the conflict should be seen to be in prospect.    It was also probable that there would be increasinginternational pressure in favour of a political initiative.
But, although any political initiative, in order to have any prospectof success, must command a broad measure of support from all political Parties in the United Kingdom Parliament, it mast alsobe acceptable to substantial numbers of both Protestants and roman catholics in Ireland.    Otherwise the bulk of the Protestantpopulation would be antagonised and possibly provoked to violentreaction, while the Roman Catholics would remain no lessalienated than at present.    The acceptance by Roman Catholicsof any political settlement, however, depended in large measureon its endorsement by the Government of the Republic.    The long-term solution might therefore have to involve some kind of constitutional association between the two parts of Ireland,while permitting the Six Counties of Northern Ireland to continueto form part of the United Kingdom.    Similarly, the Governmentof the Republic would not be able to mobilise public support againstthe Irish Republican Army (IRA) unless they could convincinglyendorse whatever solution was found in Northern Ireland.    the uncertainty of Mr lynch&apos;s political position might be relevant tothis pointj but the importance of action by the Government of theRepublic against the IRA was underlined by the military impossibility of completely sealing the Border,In order to promote a political settlement it might be necessary totake major political risks, which might involve a substantial modification of earlier policies and even the possibility ofconsiderable bloodshed.    Nevertheless, it might be possibleto reach an acceptable solution on the basis of ensuring the minority community an active, permanent and guaranteed role in government,while simultaneously giving assurances about the position ofNorthern Ireland in relation to the rest of the United Kingdom.If it was made clear that this latter question would be made thesubject of a plebiscite, albeit not for a number of years, this mightremove the emotive subject of the Border from the centre ofNorthern Ireland politics.    Nor was it necessarily impossibleto secure the continuance of the Parliamentary system of government established by the Government of Ireland Act 1920 within a generally acceptable political solution.    It had been found possible elsewhere,for example in the Lebanon, to devise an acceptable method of allocating governmental responsibilities between representativesof different religious groupings.Whatever the form of any political initiative, however, it would haveto take account of the problems created by internment.    Within thelimits imposed by the requirements of security it might be necessaryto devise a phased programme for the release of internees; and itmight be desirable to give further consideration to the possibility ofestablishing special courts empowered to try accused persons underrules of evidence, which would go some way to meet the difficultieswhich the IRA&apos;s campaign of intimidation placed in the way of the direct confrontation of witnesses.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that a major obstacle to any rational solution was likely to be the absenceof any incentive to the IRA to desist from violence at any point short of the establishment of a revolutionary all-Ireland Republic.    TheCabinet1 s discussion, however, had indicated several lines of thoughtwhich might profitably be explored further.    The immediate question was whether the tragic events of the previous weekend in Londonderryhad provided an opportunity for a political initiative or whether, onthe contrary, they had made such an initiative impracticable for thetime being.    When he had met Mr Lynch in Brussels at the signing of the Treaties of Accession to the European Economic CommunityMr Lynch had suggested, even though in rather indefinite terms, thatthe moment for a political initiative might arrive when the influence of the IRA in Belfast had been perceptibly weakened but the Protestantcommunity were still sufficiently apprehensive of violence to beprepared to offer a measure of compromise.    But, even if this had been Mr Lynch&apos;s view a few weeks earlier, it must probablybe assumed that it would no longer be so; and, even if this analysishad been correct at the time, it could hardly be regarded as valid inpresent circumstances.    The Ministers directly concerned with northern Ireland affairs would continue to keep the situation under close review and would report further to the Cabinet as necessary.The Cabinet -2,    Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office4 February 1972
