Nine persons had been killed and over 100 injured,some very severely.    This had aroused feelings of extremerevulsion throughout the world;  and within Northern Ireland notonly among the Protestant community, but in the Roman Catholiccommunity also.    The anger of the Protestant community had beensuch that, if he and the Secretary of State for Defence had not immediately authorised sterner measures by the security forces against the IRA, there would have been a very serious risk of direct action on the streets on a widespread scale.    The operations that had been undertaken had done much to calm Protestant opinion;nevertheless they had made no more than modest inroads upon the operational capability of the IRA, and had predictably caused somealienation of Roman Catholic opinion.    However, a substantial bodyof Roman Catholic opinion still appeared prepared to accept a needfor stern action against the terrorists.    He thought it unrealistic to hope to be able to rely on any lasting renewal of the &quot;ceasefire&quot;by the IRA;  and he believed that a continuation of military operations at no more than the present level would merely stimulate furtherfeelings of frustration within the Protestant community andirritation among the Roman Catholics.He therefore believed that the present climate of public opinion,while the events of Friday 21 July were still fresh, was opportune for the Government to take action, as was its duty, to show that itcould no longer tolerate the existence of barricaded areas to whichthe security forces had only limited access.    The Bogside andCreggan areas of Londonderry were of particular symbolicimportance in this connection; but, if militarily feasible,simultaneous action should also be directed against areas in Belfastsimilarly dominated by extremists, whether of the IRA or the UlsterDefence Association (UDA).     He thought it right to point out,1
however, that the success of the operation in promoting theGovernments ultimate objectives would depend greatly upon themanner of its conduct, and the reaction of the residents of the areas concerned.    If the population accepted that the operation was directed solely against terrorists, its successful execution could produce substantial political advantage a and help to open the way for political discussions.    If, on the other hand, as was possible, therewas widespread resistance to the operation, and heavy casualties were inflicted, the prospects for an eventual political solution wouldprobably have received a severe setback.    The Government wouldbe liable in those circumstances to lose the support of theOpposition in Parliament, of the Roman Catholic community inNorthern Ireland, and of a large body of opinion in the Republic ofIreland and throughout the world.    On balance, however, and in viewof the deterioration which he believed would follow a decision not totake stronger measures, he recommended that a military operation should be launched to reoccupy the barricaded areas, with a clearpolitical presentation designed to retain the goodwill of the roman catholic community in Northern Ireland and to restate theGovernments objective of a political solution offering a just and secure future for that community.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that he supported the recommendation of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.To carry out an operation on the lines envisaged would involve the reinforcement of the garrison in Northern Ireland by a further sevenmajor units, four of which would be drawn from the United Kingdomand three from the British Army of the Rhine.    The operation couldbe mounted in the early hours of Monday 31 July.    The only trackedvehicles employed would be four armoured bulldozers equipped todeal with mined barricades on the outskirts of the Bogside andCreggan areas.    The movement of units to Northern Ireland couldnot be concealed, but could be explained in general terms as part ofthe policy of stronger measures against the IRA which the Secretaryof State for Northern Ireland had declared earlier in the week.    he believed, however, that the justification for the operation now contemplated would be clearer if it were preceded by an appeal forthe removal of all barricades, and an offer of military assistancein removing them, coupled with an indication that if they were notremoved the security forces would have to take appropriate action.In discussion it was accepted that the success of the operation would depend greatly upon keeping casualties among the population to aminimum, and that there could be no assurance that the IRA wouldnot persuade or compel large crowds to take to the streets, thusgreatly increasing the risk of casualties.    It was suggested, however,that this, while underlining the desirability of rapid and simultaneousaction, did not detract from the need to take resolute action againstthe IRA in the very near future to prevent further deterioration of the2
security situation.    The question of a prior appeal or warning mustbe considered in the light of its possible effect upon casualties.    Itmight lead to widespread demonstrations involving women andchildren.    On the other hand it might encourage the more responsible elements to keep the streets clear.    If it was followedby evacuations, these would, while politically embarrassing, reducethe risk of casualties to persons other than terrorists.    It wouldalso be desirable to ensure that the forces involved were fully-instructed regarding the importance of maintaining the Army&apos;straditional standards of discipline and employing only the minimumforce necessary to achieve the objectives of the operation.    these principles must apply to the interrogation of suspects, of whomconsiderable numbers might be arrested and detained for periods of up to 48 hours;  intelligence gained from these interrogations,and from the reoccupation of the barricaded areas, should makepracticable a selective approach to searches for arms and to the arrest of individuals for the preferment of criminal charges or for more protracted detention.    There were strong political arguments against the renewal of internment in the form in which it had been introduced in August 1971,    It would be necessary to give furtherconsideration to means of ensuring that the more dangerousterrorists were kept off the streets.    It might be necessary tointroduce legislation after the Summer Recess to create courts ofa special character appropriate to the hearing of criminal charges in the situation existing in Northern Ireland; meanwhile it might benecessary to make a number of detention orders under the special powers Acts, and to justify them by a stated intention to introducethis legislation.THE PRIME  MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that, in the situation created by the bombing incidents of Friday 21 July, a military operation should be mounted to reoccupythose areas from which either the IRA or the UDA sought to exclude the normal operation of the security forces.    The area6 of greatest difficulty would probably be the Bogside and Creggan districts of londonderry, and the enclaves dominated by the IRA in Belfast;nevertheless it was important that the operation should be clearlyseen to be directed against extremists of either community.    Theoperation should be launched in the early hours of Monday 31 July;and the reinforcement of the garrison with seven major units and necessary supporting elements (including armoured bulldozers)should proceed.    The operation should consist of rapid andsimultaneous penetration into the several areas concerned, in orderto inflict maximum damage upon the capability of the IRA to wage itscampaign of terrorism while keeping to a minimum the risk of casulties to persons other than terrorists.    The paramount importance of avoiding innocent casualties underlined the importanceof maintaining the Army&apos;s traditional standards of discipline andrestraint in the exercise of force against the civil community.    The3
operation should be preceded by an appeal to the inhabitants of theareas concerned to remove their barricades, and an offer of military-assistance in doing so, failing which the Army would have to take appropriate action.    He would discuss further with the ministers most directly concerned the content and timing of such an appeal,together with other more detailed aspects of the operation itself,and of its presentation in the context of the Governments overallpolicy for Northern Ireland.    He would also give consideration tothe extent of advance notice that might be given to the Leader of theOpposition and to the Prime Minister of the Irish Republic.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office27 July 19724
