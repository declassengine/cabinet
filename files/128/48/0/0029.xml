The trade unions and the Northern IrelandLabour Party had responded to his offer to discuss with the minoritycommunities additional means of ensuring them an active,permanent and guaranteed role in the life and public affairs of theProvince; and the Government of Northern Ireland were alsoprepared to put forward very reasonable proposals for this purpose.But the Social Democratic and Labour Party had maintained theirrefusal to participate in these discussions until internment wasbrought to an end.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that the securitysituation was equally discouraging.    It was too early to say thatinternment had failed.    But it was known that recruitment to theIrish Republican Army (IRA) in the Republic of Ireland was rising;and the task of the troops in Northern Ireland was becomingincreasingly difficult.    There was now one areain Londonderry  which they could not enter; and it might benecessary shortly to consider further action to bring this state ofaffairs to an end, even though further substantial reinforcementsmight be required for this purpose.    The morale of the Armyremained high; but it was open to question how far public opinionIn this country would tolerate the indefinite continuance of theprovocation and violence to which the troops were exposed.THE PRIME MINISTER said that It was satisfactory that In theevent It had proved possible to arrange a tripartite meeting betweenhimself, the Prime Minister of the Irish Republic, and the PrimeMinister of Northern Ireland at the beginning of the following week.In initially refusing the invitation to this meeting Mr Lynch, thePrime Minister of the Irish Republic, had clearly miscalculatedthe strength of his position.    In subsequently agreeing to be presenthe had Implicitly withdrawn not only his earlier stipulation that heTOP SfcCP.fcT
TOP SECRETwould not attend any meeting of this kind while Internment lastedbut also his refusal to concede to Mr Faulkner the status of PrimeMinister of Northern Ireland.    Moreover, it was clear that hecould no longer maintain his claim to speak for the Opposition inthe Six Counties, who had refused to acknowledge him in thiscapacity.    It might therefore be possible to Induce him, during themeeting, to give his support in some degree to the Home SecretaryTsdiscussions with the minority communities; and It was equallyImportant that the Government of Northern Ireland, for their part,should be willing to consider any reasonable proposal which wasconsistent with the maintenance of the constitutional status of theProvince.In discussion the following main points were made -a. If the tripartite meeting failed to achieve anyImprovement In the situation and law and order subsequentlycame under even graver threat, we might rapidly be drivento Impose direct rule on the Province.    This would be liableto be opposed as bitterly by the Protestant as by theRoman Catholic faction; but It would represent a courseof action which would be forced on us unless we wereprepared to accept an extreme Protestant Government Inplace of the present Administration.b. Some speculation appeared to be current about thepossibility of an alliance between the extreme Protestantand the extreme Roman Catholic factions.    This might notbe wholly unrealistic; but, if so, It must emerge as anarrangement made by Irishmen themselves, not as anartificial creation Imposed on them by the Government ofthe United Kingdom.c. It was possible to believe that the only solution ofthe problem which would ultimately prove to be realisticwould lie in a physical separation of the Protestant andRoman Catholic factions or in some transfer of populationfrom the Province to the Irish Republic.    But anarrangement of this kind would prove Impracticable In acity such as Belfast, where the two communities wereclosely Intermingled; and It would encounter the mostbitter opposition.d. For the purpose of the Home Secretary&apos;s discussionsIt was Important to distinguish between the constitutionalstatus of Northern Ireland as an integral part of the UnitedKingdom and the constitutional arrangements within theProvince In the sense of the form and scope of ItsParliamentary and administrative organs.    Provided thatthe constitutional status of the Province was not called In2TOP SECRET
TOP SECRETquestion, there was no aspect of the constitutionalarrangements which could not properly be brought underreview during the exchanges which the Home Secretary wasconducting.    But, if proportional representation wasventilated in this context, we should remember that itsmost probable result would be to aggravate, rather thanto reconcile, extremist tendencies.e.        The proposal by the Opposition at Westminster forthe appointment of a Joint Parliamentary Commission tosupervise certain aspects of Government business inNorthern Ireland should also be approached with caution.It appeared not to have been elaborated in any detail; andIt was open to the critical objection that it would tend toconfuse responsibility in areas where it was important thatthe allocation of functions should be precisely defined.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet would need to give further thought to the situation after hisforthcoming meeting with the Prime Ministers of the Irish Republicand of Northern Ireland.Cabinet Office22 September 19713TOP SECRET
