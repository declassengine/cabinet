SECRETSIS^DCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCOPY NOCABINETCONFIDENTIAL ANNEXCM(71) 45th Conclusions, Minute 3Thursday 2 September 1971 at 11.45 amt*?*thernIslandeviousReference-J;M(7l)44thr nclu8ionSttol&amp;ute 2The Cabinet discussed the situation in Northern Ireland.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Prime Minister of the IrishRepublic, Mr. Lynch, had accepted his invitation to discussionsat Chequers on 6 and 7 September.    A meeting with Mr. Lynchhad originally been envisaged in late October; but the deteriorationin the situation and the recent public statements by Mr. Lynchsuggested that it should be brought forward.    At the meeting withMr. Lynch he intended to emphasise both the reforms which hadtaken place in Northern Ireland in the past few years and theUnited Kingdom Government&apos;s determination that minority rightsshould be safeguarded.    He would then ask Mr. Lynch to use hisinfluence to persuade the Northern Ireland ParliamentaryOpposition to desist from tactics of civil disobedience in favour ofthe more constructive part that could be played by a constitutionalOpposition.    He would also seek to impress on Mr. Lynch that theIrish Republican Army were as dangerous to the Republic as toNorthern Ireland and would urge him to curb its activities in theRepublic.    More generally, it would be necessary to makeMr. Lynch aware of the growing public feeling in Great Britain thatthe Republic could not be permitted to connive in the subversion ofNorthern Ireland while continuing to enjoy all the advantages of itsspecial relationship with the United Kingdom.    So far as the politicalsituation in Northern Ireland itself was concerned, there was a clearneed at this juncture for the United Kingdom Government to promoteconstructive discussion between the two communities with a view tofinding means of giving the minority an active and prominent role inthe life of the Province; and the Home Secretary had been consideringhow that object might best be achieved.    Meanwhile an inquiry hadbeen set up under the chairmanship of Sir Edmund Compton toinvestigate allegations of brutality against persons in the custody ofthe security forces prior to their subsequent release, the preferringof a criminal charge against them or their being lodged in a placespecified in a detention order.1SECRET
SECRETIn discussion the following points were made -a. The continuance of Mr. Lynch in power in the Republicserved our interests.    But his political position was notstrong;  and he would find difficulty in taking effectiveaction as a result of the forthcoming meeting unless hecould represent that the Republic had derived someadvantage from it.    Little could be offered in thisconnection, save possibly an understanding that therewould be regular contact with him in the future.b. The feeling of alienation among the minority community inNorthern Ireland was likely to grow.    But it was notrealistic to suppose that active participation in the life ofthe Province could, in the foreseeable future, reach thepoint of participation in a coalition Government. Thedivergence of basic political beliefs deprived a coalitionbetween Unionist and Nationalist interests of any effectivemeaning.c. It was important that security measures, including anyfurther arrests with a view to detention or internment,should be seen to be impartially directed against all whoconstituted a danger to law and order, regardless of thecommunity to which they belonged.    There had been criticismthat the inquiry into allegations of brutality was not to allowlegal representation to complainants or the confrontation ofwitnesses.    While the protection of the lives of members ofthe security forces in the face of possible reprisal was theparamount need, the possibility of allowing legal representa-tion in exceptional cases, where it would serve the interestsof a thorough and just investigation, deserved reconsideration.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theGovernment&apos;s fundamental purpose must continue to be to secure asituation in which the objective of participation by the roir.or.ily in thelife of the Community could be pursued by reasonable andconstructive discussion, both in Northern Ireland and between theGovernments of the United Kingdom and the Republic, rather thanby violence.   Meanwhile, the Home Secretary should consider thepoint made in discussion relating to the legal representation ofcomplainants to Sir Edmund Compton&apos;s inquiry.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion.Cabinet Office, SW13 September 19712SECRET
