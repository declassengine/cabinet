&gt;SECRETTHE PRIME MINISTER said that accompanied by his colleagues directlyconcerned, he had seen representatives of the Trades Union Congress (TUC)and had pressed them to accept the relativities report which could then providea basis for settling the miners&apos; dispute.     The TUC representatives had neitheraccepted nor rejected the relativities report, but had continued to repeat thatthe miners were a special case which should be settled without waiting fordetailed consideration of the relativities report.    It had been pointed out tothem that a settlement on this basis would not cover the eventuality that otherunions might decide to follow the miners&apos; lead and use industrial power topress their wage demands:   and Sir Sydney Green had not denied it when it hadbeen suggested that if the miners&apos; claim was settled in isolation from therelativities report the railway unions would press for similar treatment lateron.     Following a brief adjournment, the TUC representatives had beeninformed that the Government saw no point in continuing these discussions andwould instead have no alternative but to seek to discuss the relativities reportdirect with the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM).     The TUC had not likedthis and had said once again that if only the Government would indicatewillingness to put additional money into the offer they would use their goodoffices with the NUM.     They had added that if the Secretary of State forEmployment asked to see the NUM Executive he would be rebuffed:   and ithad then become clear that,  contrary to what had been said earlier, the TUCand the NUM were in very close touch and that the former&apos;s presence at10 Downing Street was solely to explore the Government&apos;s willingness to putfurther cash on the table now.    Indeed the question of backdating therelativities report to 1st March had not been mentioned.     The Meeting hadended on the basis that both sides would continue to study the relativities reportbut when Mr. Murray saw the Press subsequently he appeared to haverejected the relativities report outright.     The Secretary of State for Employmenthad subsequently invited the NUM Executive to a meeting but they had declinedto come and had decided upon a national strike starting from the following Sunday.He had then seen representatives of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI).The latter were, in principle, prepared to accept the relativities report butpreferred to offer backdating to 1st March than take quick decisions on themachinery and criteria.     They had then said that their membership wasextremely worried at the thought of going into a strike which the NUM mightwin.    Industry was already suffering severely and the cost of a settlement ata later stage might be even higher.     They therefore wished both to state publiclythat they had reported these views to the Government and also to embark ondirect talks with the TUC about the basis for a settlement.    After furtherdiscussion the CBI had agreed to make no such damaging public statement, butit was clear that they intended to have bilateral discussions with the TUC.They had been warned of the dangers and of the risk of being strung along fromone concession to another.     They had also been told that recent events had shownthat the TUC were not in fact trying to persuade the NUM to fall in with ageneral policy to contain inflation, but were in fact supporting them in theirstruggle with the Government.     The fact remained however that the CBI werefrightened men.-1-
SECRETIn discussion there was general agreement that only three courses were nowopen to the Government.     They could attempt to sit the strike out until thewill of the NUM cracked.    With average weather and no serious picketing andincreased savings of electricity through the introduction of rota cuts, fuelstocks would last until the end of April on a 3-day week or until the end of Mayon a 2-day week.    But the risk to sterling and to the economy generally wouldbe very great.    Even on a 3-day week, the deficit on current account in thefirst quarter of the year was likely to be  1, 900 million compared with a figureof  1, 500 million for the whole of the previous year.     The odds were thereforethat, irrespective of fuel endurance, other factors in the economy, would belikely to force the Government to settle within the time for which the NUMcould sustain the strike.     The second course was to negotiate the best possiblesettlement forthwith, recognising that this might mean conceding the miners&apos;claim in full.     This would destroy the Government&apos;s credibility and would openthe way for the railway unions to exert similar industrial power in a few weeks&apos;time.     The third course was to seek a Dissolution of Parliament.    It wasarguable that success in a General Election would of itself change nothing butin practice it would create a new situation.     The electorate as a whole wouldhave expressed their view on the need for a firm and fair incomes policy andthe unions would be dealing with a Government which had both a clear mandateand five years to run instead of a Government in their last year of office.In further discussion all the Ministers present, while recognising that the finaldecision was one which could only be taken by the Prime Minister personallyin the light of the developing situation, indicated that they favoured the courseof a General Election.    If the Conservative Party were then returned therewould be a better chance of dealing effectively with the situation, and if theylost they would have done so in circumstances which would preserve both theirhonour and Party unity.    If however the Prime Minister decided to seek aDissolution very careful consideration would need to be given to the contentsof the manifesto.    It might have to ask for a relatively free hand to deal withthe problems facing the nation:  but it would also need to show how theGovernment would get the miners back to work if they won and to do this in away which would neither imply that an Election was unnecessary nor carry therisk of the Government subsequently being in breach of their Election pledge.This suggested the need to build on the relativities report and to establishmachinery which could begin working during the Election campaign.    It wouldalso be necessary to strike the right balance in the manifesto between the needon the one hand for firm Government in the fact of industrial power and on theother for compassion towards the less fortunate members of society.    It wouldalso be wise to paint an honest picture of the likely future course of the economy.Urgent decisions would also be needed on such questions as whether to make apublic appeal to the NUM to call off the strike during the course of an Electionand how to deal with the possible breakdown of the benefits system if thestrike continued and unemployment became very widespread.-2-
SECRETTHE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion,  said that the situationwas one which had to be faced with resolution and unity.    He was gratefulfor the support of his colleagues and in reaching his decision he would ofcourse pay heed to the views which had been expressed.    The fact that themeeting had taken place, and still more the nature of their discussion, shouldbe treated as entirely confidential and should not be discussed with Ministersoutside the Cabinet.    In the meantime he would arrange for urgent work tocontinue on bringing the Conservative Party&apos;s Election Manifesto up to date.Cabinet Office27 February 1974-3-
