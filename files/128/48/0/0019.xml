Such responses were bound to carry the risk ofdamaging relations with the Roman Catholic community resultingfor example in the unnecessary departure of several hundredpersons from the Lenadoon estate in Belfast;  on the other handsome major exchanges of shooting elsewhere in the city, in whichthe IRA were believed to have sustained some 50 casualties, ofwhich about half were probably fatal, had aroused no similarreaction.    He proposed to include details of casualties suffered bythe IRA in his statement in the House of Commons that afternoon,with the aim of refuting criticism alleging too passive an attitude on the part of the security forces.    To the extent that the IRAchose or were compelled to restrict their activities, however, the opportunities for selective response by the security forces werecorrespondingly limited.    The incidence of explosions in Belfasthad been reduced by the severe restrictions placed upon vehiculartraffic in the city centre; and new measures were being similarlyintroduced in Londonderry.He continued to attach importance to the maintenance ofbipartisan support in Parliament for the Governments policy.    Hewould be receiving later that day a report from the Leader of theOpposition, Mr. Harold Wilson, upon his conversations theprevious day with leaders of the &quot;Provisional&quot; wing.    Mr. wilson had already told him that he had expressed support for theGovernment1 s policy and made clear to the IRA his view that their political demands were unrealistic:  and it was to be hoped that1
the IRA leaders had got this impression firmly.    Nevertheless,if the IRA were to proclaim a conditional &quot;ceasefire&quot; on terms which, though in fact unacceptable to any British government,could be represented as warranting serious consideration if notacceptance, the Government could be embarrassed by a consequentpolarisation of opinion, as between not only the two communities in Northern Ireland but also possibly between the two main partiesat Westminster.     It might become increasingly difficult tomaintain a consensus of moderate opinion in support of theGovernments policy, but he saw no alternative policy as offeringany prospect of securing the Governments long-term objective of a stable political future for Northern Ireland.    In the meantimehe hoped that some representatives of moderate and non-political opinion in the Province would put forward constructive suggestions in response to his invitation.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet had taken note of the statement by the Secretary ofState for Northern Ireland and fully endorsed the policy that hewas pursuing.    It would remain important to maintain theconfidence of the Governments supporters in Parliament, while taking account of their anxieties.    Subject to consultation with theSecretary of State on the security situation, other Ministers who might have occasion to pay official visits to Northern Ireland on matters unconnected with the emergency should be encouraged todo so.    The Secretary of State should raise, for discussion by theMinisters most directly concerned, a number of questions relatingto the proposed plebiscite on the future relationship of NorthernIreland with the United Kingdom.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office20 July 19722
