TOP SECRETCABINETCopy No.........9....HERNIDusonce:) 24th3ionss2CONFIDENTIAL annex cm(72) 26th Conclusions, Minute 5Thursday 18 May 1972 at 11. 00 am the SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND informed the Cabinet that there had been a renewed outbreak of violence inthe Province during the previous weekend, culminating in a bombexplosion in Belfast on 13 May, which had been followed by a prolonged confrontation between the security forces and the local inhabitants.    There was little doubt that responsibility for the explosion should be attributed to the Irish Republican Army (IRA).But initial suspicion had fastened on Protestant extremists;  and this had aggravated the violence of the reaction.    The continuingintransigence of the Ulster Vanguard, the extreme Protestantforce led by Mr Craig, was providing the IRA with fresh grounds for provoking the Protestant faction to acts of violence which provided them with an excuse for no less violent retaliation;  and inter--communal tension was liable to remain high at least until theVanguard parade scheduled for 3 June.    The risk that theProtestants would take to arms in any organised and comprehensivefashion might be exaggerated;  and the picture of Protestant &quot;no go&quot;areas had perhaps been overdrawn.    Nevertheless, it would benecessary to keep a close watch on the rising tide of Protestantfeeling and to continue to make it clear to all concerned, includingthe Ulster Unionist Members of the Parliament at Westminster,that the British Government would not tolerate a revival of violence and lawlessness in Northern Ireland,The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Secretaryof State for Northern Ireland.Cabinet Office18 May 1972The circulation of this paper has been strictlv Umited. .
