cabinet confidential annex cm(72) 31st Conclusions, Minute 4Thursday 22 June 1972 at 10.30 amM THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said thathe had reason to believe that a statement would be issued that afternoon by the &quot;Irish Republican Publicity Bureau&quot; on behalf ofthe &quot;Irish Republican leadership&quot;.    This statement would be to theeffect that the Irish Republican Army (IRA) were prepared with suspend offensive operations with effect from midnight on Monday,s, 26 June;  and it would probably indicate that, while the &quot;irish republican leadership&quot; would welcome this cessation of violence,they would expect a reciprocal response from the Armed Forces ofthe Crown, that they believed that the cessation of violence wouldprovide scope for the development of political discussions and thatthey had developed a &quot;peace plan&quot; which they would be prepared toput forward.He believed that, if the statement took this form, the distinctionbetween the &quot;Irish Republican leadership&quot; and the IRA might be significant as indicating the possible emergence of politicalpersonalities closely linked with the IRA but sufficiently separate from them to have a possible role in future political discussions.It would also be significant if the statement included no stipulationsabout the release of individuals interned under the Special PowersActs.    A cessation of violence on this basis would clearlyrepresent a very favourable development.    But a number of problems would arise about the practical observance of a &quot;ceasefire&quot;e.g, the policy to be adopted thereafter as regards the arrest of individuals who had long been wanted by the security forces.Moreover, there might be a violent reaction by the Protestantextremists of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA); or internalfighting might break out within the IRA between its &quot;Official&quot; and&quot;Provisional&quot; wings.    if the &quot;Provisional&quot; wing was now genuinelydisposed towards a&apos;fceasefire&quot;, this was no doubt due in part to thesuccess of the Governments policy of isolating the IRA from muchof their previous support within the Roman Catholic community.But a genuine fear of the growing strength of the UDA had probably1The circulation of this paper has been strictly Hmited. . &apos; j- \It is issued for the personal use of ...S&amp; .... tf4$4L^***wl (JkutMr)TOP SECRET riCopy No...................
been a significant contributory factor.    If the statement was issued,as he expected, at 2, 00 pm, he would make a statement in theHouse of Commons at 3. 30 pm to the effect that, if violence indeedceased, the Armed Forces of the Crown would obviously reciprocate.If he was asked whether he was now prepared to enter into directdiscussions with the &quot;Irish Republican leadership&quot; he would confinehimself to emphasising that the immediate issue was whetherviolence was to cease within the next few days and that it was important that nothing should be said or done which might prejudicethis hope.    He would give the Opposition brief advance notice ofhis statement; but it was important that there should be no suggestion that the Government had had prior knowledge of the intentions of the &quot;Irish Republican leadership&quot;.    Thereafter, hewould need to discuss further with the Ministers most directly concerned the wider implications of a &quot;ceasefire&quot; for our policy asregards search and arrest,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that,if a statement was made by the &quot;Irish Republican leadership&quot; onthe lines forecast by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland,and if a cessation of violence did in fact take effect from midnight on Monday, 26 June, this could be welcomed as an important first step towards the attainment of a political settlement.    The cabinet would wish to congratulate the Secretary of State upon the advancewhich, he had made towards the restoration of peace in NorthernIreland and the achievement of a political solution of its problems.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office22 June 19722
