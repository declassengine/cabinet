SECRET o*V V w* w. rwv(tat)THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy NO 0CABINETCONFIDENTIAL annex cm(72) 23rd Conclusions, Minute 3Thursday 27 April 1972 at 11. 00 am the SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND informed the Cabinet that, although the situation in the Province was stillconfused, the movement of opinion in favour of a search for a peaceful solution was stronger than might appear from press reports.    This movement must be encouraged; and he was convincedthat it would now be very unwise to deviate from the course which theGovernment had adopted.    There had admittedly been a recent increase in military casualties, which might be due in part to the reaction of the &quot;official&quot; wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA)to the shooting of Joseph McCann and in part to the desire of the&quot;provisional&quot; wing of the IRA to frustrate policies of reconciliation.Nevertheless, a more repressive operational policy would be liableto provoke a major outburst of renewed violence, which would have serious effects upon opinion throughout the world.    Although thelevel of patrolling by the Army had been reduced in recent weeks,there had been no modification in the instructions to the troops toact with the utmost vigour against gunmen, considerable numbersof whom had been hit in recent exchanges.    In addition., nineprominent members of the IRA had been arrested in Belfastwithin the last ten days.He proposed to discuss shortly with the Ministers most directly concerned a number of aspects of Government policy relating to northern Ireland.    Meanwhile, however, he sought the agreementof the Cabinet to a relaxation of the present total ban on marches.The ban could not be enforced in its entirety; and its applicationwas therefore exposed to charges of selectivity and bias.   It would remain possible to require individual marches to be rerouted or evenprohibited altogether if agreement could not be reached with theirorganisers; but the removal of the total ban would be seen as a realistic decision and would be widely welcomed, particularly ifthe decision were announced that evening in good time to permit a march planned for 1 May by the Northern Ireland Labour Party.1
A number of consequential points would arise for deci$ion.    he proposed that no further prosecutions should be brought in respectof alleged breaches of the ban, with retrospective effect to25 December 1971 and that sentences of imprisonment already-passed should be remitted.    These would include the sentencespassed upon the Westminster Members of Parliament,Miss Bernadette Devlin, Mr Frank McManus and Mr Gerard Fitt,It would also be for decision whether, if fines imposed but not yetpaid were remitted, fines already paid should be reimbursed,THE ATTORNEY GENERAL said that he supported the proposal that no further prosecutions should be brought in respect of allegedbreaches of the ban on marches, the more so since it was important that the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in NorthernIreland should be freed to give their attention to their properfunction of dealing with criminal cases.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, saidthat the Cabinet agreed that the comprehensive ban on marchesin Northern Ireland should be lifted; that no further prosecutionsshould be brought in respect of alleged breaches of the ban; thatsentences of imprisonment and fines already imposed should be remitted;  that fines already paid should be reimbursed;  and thatthe Secretary of State for Northern Ireland should issue a statement that evening announcing the lifting of the ban and the amnesty inrespect of breaches of the ban with effect from 25 December 1971.It did not appear practicable, however, to consider any form ofcompensation for persons who might already have served all or part of prison sentences.    He would discuss further with theMinisters most directly concerned the development of theGovernments policy in relation to Northern Ireland, includingits implications for the level of military activity to be pursuedagainst a background of military casualties which had recentlybeen heavy.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for Northern Ireland to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office27 April 1972
