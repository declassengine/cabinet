Nevertheless, there were still extremists in boththe Protestant and the Roman Catholic factions who were anxiousto maintain the campaign of violence.    On the previous day he hadreceived representative leaders of the Ulster Defence Association(UDA), who had said that they could no longer accept the exclusion of the Roman Catholic enclaves in Londonderry from the normalenforcement of law and order.    He had gone some way towards meeting their point of view by assuring them that a plebiscite on thestatus of Northern Ireland in relation to the United Kingdom wouldbe held before the local government elections planned for theautumn and by informing them that wherever possible, andparticularly as regards individuals who received salaries or other payments from public funds, he proposed to demand repayment ofarrears of rent oi rates which had been withheld as part of the campaign of civil disobedience.    He had also promised to take all practicable steps to deal with the problem of the Roman Catholicenclaves; but he had been necessarily inhibited by considerations of security from revealing that officials of his Department would shortly enter the Bogside and Creggan districts of Londonderry inorder to discuss with the leaders of those communities the firststeps towards a removal of the barricades and a restoration of normal conditions of life.At the end of the interview the UDA leaders had undertaken to reachno decision that evening; but within an hour they had announced thatthey intended to erect barricades of their own, all over NorthernIreland, during the coming weekend.    We must still hope, despite this announcement, that the leaders of the Bogside and Creggancommunities would agree to dismantle some of their barricades,since much of the incentive for the UDA&apos;s proposed action should
then be removed.    But if the inhabitants of the Bog side andCreggan were no longer willing to consider any reduction in theirbarricades, the UDA would certainly erect barricades on a large scale.    On the other hand their threats to cut off essential services to the Bogside and Creggan areas were unrealistic.In conjunction with the military authorities he would continue to watch the situation closely and to plan the deployment and operations of the security forces in the light of developments.    The Protestantmarches, which were about to begin and would culminate in the orange parades on 12 July, were serious potential sources of inter communal violence;  and, if the Protestants behavedprovocatively, the leaders of the IRA might not be able to restraintheir more extreme followers from breaking the &quot;ceasefire&quot;.For the present the security forces were not carrying out operations of search and arrest within Roman Catholic areas.    But they weredeployed in considerable strength along inter sectarian, boundaries;and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) were now patrolling in greater strength.    It would be preferable not to release any furtherindividuals from internment until it was clear whether the&quot;ceasefire&quot; had endured at least beyond 12 July.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that he agreed with this estimate of the potential dangers in the period up to12 July.    But, if that period passed relatively peacefully, it mightbe wise to consider some reduction in the strength of the Army inNorthern Ireland.    It would also be necessary to examine thepossibility of deploying Royal Military Police personnel within theBogside and Creggan areas as an interim measure until patrollingby the RUC became acceptable.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that the Secretary of State for Northern ireland should continue to maintain a close watch upon the situation andshould act in accordance with the general policy which he had indicated.    The implications of that policy would be considered further by the Ministers directly concerned.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister1 summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office29 June 19722
