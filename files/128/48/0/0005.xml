Over 50 years,under an artificially constructed constitution, the Unionist Parly-had enjoyed political domination at Stormont to the exclusion of the minority community.    As an inevitable result the estrangement ofthe two communities was greater than ever;  and the social andeconomic structure of the Province was rapidly deteriorating.    Itwas becoming increasingly evident that,, however successful theArmy might be in disrupting the Irish Republican Army (IRA), itwould never be possible by military means alone to preventindividual atrocities or completely to root out urban guerilla warfareso long as a substantial element of the population remained alienatedfrom the forces of law and order.    The only hope for the future ofNorthern Ireland lay in the creation of a united community in theProvince, which could be tolerated, if not supported, by themajority of the people of the Republic.    But any initiative which contained features attractive to both parties to the dispute was liable, for that very reason, to be heavily criticised from both sides.In particular, no solution could expect to command generalagreement unless it reduced the dominance of the Unionist faction;and this could easily be represented as penalising the Protestantcommunity, which professed a strong loyalty to the Crown andhad behaved with commendable restraint in recent months.    So longas it remained the wish of the majority community/in NorthernIreland to remain part of the United Kingdom, this wish must be respected;  but only on the understanding that the standards ofpolitical tolerance observed elsewhere in the United Kingdom were accepted by Northern Ireland as well and that the overridingauthority of the United Kingdom Government and Parliament were1
accepted in Ulster as in all other parts of the United Kingdom.    Forthis purpose he proposed that responsibility for law and order should be transferred from Stormont to Westminster;  that a plebiscite should be held on the question of the Border at an earlydate but should not thereafter be repeated for some 15 or 20 years;and that consultations should be initiated in order to seek ways ofmaking provision for the proper participation of the minority community as of right not only in the Parliament but also in theGovernment of the Six Counties,    If Mr Faulkner held to his recentpublic statements, these proposals would probably be unacceptable to him and he would be unlikely to keep his Administration in beinguntil a reformed constitution took effect.    In any event it must be doubtful whether it would be possible to move to a new structure ofgovernment in Northern Ireland without a clean break with the pastor to establish constructive consultations with all political elements in Northern Ireland so long as Mr Faulkner remained Prime Minister.He had therefore concluded that the least dangerous course wouldbe to proceed initially to a temporary period of direct United Kingdomrule, which might be of something approaching two years&apos; duration.The Unionist Party attached great importance to the NorthernIreland Parliament as a guarantee of the integrity of the Borderunder the Ireland Act, 1949.    He therefore proposed that duringthe interregnum of direct rule it should not be dissolved but shouldbe temporarily suspended by prorogation, which would permit its being reconvened should the result of the plebiscite make itnecessary to seek its consent to the detachment of Northern Irelandfrom the United Kingdom.    Its legislative functions would be discharged by Order in Council at Westminster;   and the executive powers of the Northern Ireland Government would be transferredto a Secretary of State, who would be advised by a Northern IrelandCommission.    In addition, we should seek to modify the presentsystem of internment by releasing some of the least dangerousinternees and by making it clear that we looked forward to the total,end of internment when security considerations and the state ofpublic order made this possible.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE agreed thatterrorism could not be extirpated by military measures alone.    in belfast the Army had almost completely disrupted the battle ord^rof the &quot;Provisional&quot; wing of the IRA;  and the numbers of shootingincidents and explosions would probably soon reach as low a level as it was possible to achieve.    But it was not possible to prevent a continuation of spasmodic outrages, some of which were liableto be major in scale and highly destructive of life and property.Moreover, the Army&apos;s success in Belfast had led to an intensification of IRA activity in Border areas, where terroristscould find a ready refuge within the Republic; while in Londonderry,by deliberate policy, no military operations of any size had been undertaken, with the result that the Bogside and Creggan districts2
had become areas where the authority of the Government hadvirtually ceased to be enforceable.    There could thus be no purely military solution.    But a political initiative might have some effect upon the intensity of the terrorist campaign;   and, if it couldcontain elements capable of winning a measure cf support amongmoderate Catholics, the IRA might forfeit much of the benevolentneutrality which they enjoyed at the hands of individuals whosympathised with their political aims even while abhorring theirmethods.In discussion it was suggested that a comprehensive initiative ofthe kind proposed by the Home Secretary would entail serious risksboth in Northern Ireland and at Westminster.    In Northern Irelandit might merely alienate the Protestant community without gainingany support from the Catholics;  while at Westminster it mighterode support for the Government both among the Ulster UnionistMembers and more widely among tne Conservative Party as a whole.It had long been the avowed strategy of the IRA, first, to renderNorthern Ireland ungovernable, then to compel the BritishGovernment to resort to direct rule of Northern Ireland and,finally, to achieve the severance of Northern Ireland from theUnited Kingdom and its absorption within a single United Ireland.The majority of Protestants in Northern Ireland would be liable tosee the proposed initiative as marking an advance from the first tothe second of these stages and as bringing the final stage evennearer.    Moreover, a sense of direct confrontation with the BritishGovernment might inspire the IRA to intensify their campaign of terrorism and possibly to extend it to Great Britain on a wider scale than the recent bomb outrage at Aldershot.    There must also be some doubt whether the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the NorthernIreland Civil Service and even, perhaps, the Judiciary would beprepared to co-operate with an imposed system of United Kingdomrule.    Nor would a plebiscite on the Border necessarily count for much as a counter weight.    Its result was so easily predictable thatit could not be significant as a concession to Protestant feeling.On the other hand the declaration of a single plebiscite for thewhole of the Province might well provoke demands for localplebiscites in specific areas;  but the Border communities were sointermingled that the problem of adjustment was insoluble, as hvAbeen shown in 1925.Other elements of the proposed initiative were equally open to criticism,    &quot;Community Government&quot;, with statutory allocation ofCabinet portfolios according to the representation of Parties in theNorthern Ireland House of Commons, could not be reconciled withthe democratic concept of responsibility to a Parliamentarymajority.    In those countries where Ministerial offices had beendistributed by statute or by convention among opposing political parties there had at least been general agreement upon the broad3
objective of preserving the integrity of the State,    In NorthernIreland this basic prerequisite was lacking.    Bvt if for this reason&quot;Community Government&quot; proved unworkable in practice, we might find ourselves committed in perpetuity to the system of directUnited Kingdom rule which we had envisaged as only a temporary expedient;   and in earlier discussions Ministers had frequentlyagreed that direct rule represented a policy of last resort.Moreover, a modification of the internment policy would notnecessarily lead to any significant reduction in the level of violence;it was the excessive level of violence prior to 9 August, 1971, whichhad compelled the Government to acquiesce in the introduction of internment.These objections would not only be liable to be strongly urged by theGovernment&apos;s supporters in the Parliament at Westminster;  theywould also be voiced by a considerable body of anti-Irish opinion inthe country as a whole, which would find it very difficult tounderstand why the Government appeared to be conceding some ofthe objectives of the IRA when it might seem more appropriate to declare the IRA illegal in Great Britain and to deprive citizens ofthe Republic of some of the privileges which they enjoyed in theUnited Kingdom.    Reactions of this kind could seriously jeopardise the Government&apos;s political position as a whole, not least as regards their prospect of retaining adequate Parliamentary support for thelegislation necessary to confirm our accession to the EuropeanCommunitie s.It was also questionable whether the proposed initiative would in factsecure the support from the Republic which was a necessary element in any ultimate solution.    Most citizens of Lhe Republic looked to the objective of a United Ireland;  and it must be doubtful whether theycould be brought to support any system of Government of a separateProvince of Northern Ireland.    Nor was it clear how the impositionof United Kingdom rule could assist the Prime Minister of the irish republic, Mr Lynch, in taking stronger action against the IRA withinthe Republic.On the other hand, while Government supporters in the House ofCommons might see difficulty in endorsing the suggested initiative,public opinion in Great Britain generally was demanding that somemove should be made.    Recent examples of terrorism had created a sense of revulsion in the Catholic community, which made thepresent a particularly propitious time at which to act.    The objectmust be to satisfy some at least of the legitimate aspirations ofeach community.    The majority of Roman Catholics probably hadno real desire for Northern Ireland to be absorbed immediately intothe Republic.    They were content to remain in the United Kingdom;many of them, indeed, had served in the Armed Forces of the Crown.4
But they regarded, the Army in Northern Ireland as being merely thetool of the Northern Ireland Government and saw no future for thepeace and prosperity of the Province if Stormont were perpetuatedin its present form.    The only hope of loosening the grip of the IRAon the minority community was to adopt an initiative on the lines proposed by the Home Secretary.    Any other course would simplyenable the IRA to gain even firmer control.In further discussion it was suggested that it might not be necessaryto give immediate effect to all the proposals in order to achieve the stability required for political discussions leading to reforms inthe constitution.    It might be wiser to appoint a Secretary of state with specific responsibility for Northern Ireland and to invite himinitially to concentrate on the main points of disaffection.    Thus,there were strong arguments in favour of a referendum on the border, which would reassure the Unionists about the constitutionalintegrity of Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom.    Therewas also a good case for transferring responsibility for law andorder to Westminster and combining this change with a substantial modification of the internment policy,    These measures were regarded by Mr Lynch as a fundamental necessity and were felt bya considerable body of opinion     Great Britain to be highly desirable.It was inherently unsatisfactory that, although the Army wasconstitutionally under the control of the United KingdomGovernment. Ministers at Westminster had no responsibility for law and order in the Province which the Army played the principalpart in maintaining.    Moreover, they had publicly to defend thepolicy of internment while having neither the power to influence the detention orders which were made in particular instances norproper access to the information upon whic^i these decisions weremade.    There must be room for some doubt whether all the interneeswere active and dangerous terrorists;  and a policy of graduallyreleasing the less dangerous on suitable conditions should bepur sued.On the other hand Mr Faulkner had said both publicly and privatelythat he could not continue to lead a Government which surrenderedthe responsibility for law and order.    When he was confronted withthe alternative he might not adhere to this position.    If he did,however, it would probably be unrealistic to hope that an acceptablealternative Government could be formed at Stormont.    No Unionistpolitician could hope to lead an Administration from a more moderateposition than that held by Mr Faulkner;  and, although Dr Paisleyhad in recent months seemed to adopt a more reasonable posture(and had, indeed, stated that he would support government bycommission), he did not command the majority in Parliament whichwas necessary to enable the Governor to invite him to form an administration.    The most probable consequence of Mr Faulkner1 resignation on the issue of law and order, therefore, would be adisintegration of the political structure in the Province, which wouldmake it necessary for us to impoje United Kingdom rule, whether we wished to or not.5
Other points made in discussion were as follows -a. Although public opinion in Great Britain might be increasingly disturbed by the high price which we werepaying in order to try to maintain order in Northern Ireland,it would be liable to be even more offended by any suggestionthat we should disclaim all further responsibility for theProvince, withdraw the troops and let the Six Countiescollapse in the violence and bloodshed of a civil war.b. Although there might be advantage in a plebisciteon the vexed issue of the Northern Ireland Border, it mightbe invoked as a precedent by nationalist groups in other partsof the United Kingdom.c. Although there were some analogies between thesituation in Northern Irelanu and the communal disputes in cyprus following independence, it would not be politic to invite the United Nations to maintain order in the Province,If Mr Lynch chose to call upon the United Nations to patrolthe Republican side of the Border, that was another matter;and it might be a helpful step.    But it was in fact unlikelythat Mr Lynch would resort to action of this kind.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were not yet ready to reach a decision about the course tobe adopted in the current situation.    Misgivings had been expressed about the Home Secretary&apos;s proposals taken as a whole, particularly as regards the institution of direct United Kingdom rule and theultimate possibility of &quot;Community Govern..aent&quot; as the basis of a constitution for Northern Ireland.    On the other hand there wassupport for the view that we should assume responsibility for lawand order;  that we should then embark on a policy of gradualrelease of internees;  and that we should institute a plebiscite onthe constitutional status of Northern Ireland as an integral part ofthe United Kingdom.    The Cabinet must resume their discussion atan early date, since timing was of the essence of any initiative and time was not on our side.    Meanwhile, it was essential that strictsecrecy should be maintained about the Home Secretary&apos;s proposals and the Cabinet&apos;s deliberations.The Cabinet -Agreed to resume their discussion at an early date.Cabinet office March 19726
