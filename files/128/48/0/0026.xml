SECRET^DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCOPY NOCABINETCONFIDENTIAL ANNEXCM(71) 44th Conclusions, Minute 2Monday 16 August 1971 at 6. 00 pmNorthernIreland^ceviousReference*.kuljX) 43rdConclusions,Wute 3The Cabinet discussed current developments in Northern Ireland.THE PRIME MINISTER recalled that, when the Cabinet lastdiscussed the situation on 3 August, it had been agreed thathe and the Home Secretary, the Foreign and CommonwealthSecretary and the Secretary of State for Defence should beauthorised to take whatever action might be required at shortnotice to deal with developments during the Recess.    On theafternoon of 5 August the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland,Mr Faulkner, had visited London and had discussed developmentswith him, the Home Secretary, the Foreign and CommonwealthSecretary and the Secretary of State for Defence, and hadrepresented that the situation demanded immediate use ofthe Northern Ireland Government&apos;s powers of internment.After full consideration of the implications, they had agreedto this course, on the footing that the arrests should be accompaniedby an announcement of a prohibition of all marches for a period.Effect had been given to these decisions on Monday 9 August, andthe march of the Apprentice Boys had not taken place in Londonderryon 12 August.    The arrests had achieved a large measure of success,and about half the leaders of the Irish Republican Army had beenapprehended.    He and the Ministers immediately concerned believedthat it was now necessary to take some political initiative, and thatthe use of the power of internment should properly be regarded as ameans by which violence could be speedily ended to enable furtherpolitical advance to be achieved.    It had accordingly been proposedto Mr Faulkner that once order had been restored, he andrepresentatives of both sides of the Northern Ireland Parliamentshould meet under the chairmanship of the Home Secretary to seewhether it was possible, within the framework of the democraticsystem in Northern Ireland, to devise further means of givingrepresentatives of the minority, as well as the majority, an activeand prominent role in the processes of government andadministration.    It was to be made clear that the Border1SECRET
SECRETand the constitutional position of Northern Ireland as part of theUnited Kingdom were not in issue,    Mr Faulkner&apos;s immediatereaction was that, in the current political situation, he couldnot accept this proposition, but he had indicated a desire tofind some means by which the Opposition at Stormont couldtake up the active role of opposition which they had so dramaticallyabandoned some weeks ago.    He had accordingly invited Mr Faulknerto have discussions with him and the Home Secretary at Chequers onThursday 19 August.    The Prime Minister of the Irish Republic,Mr Lynch, had on Thursday 12 August made a statement in Dublinattacking the Northern Ireland Government and advocating itsreplacement by a body on which the minority community wouldhave equal representation with the majority,    Mr Faulkner&apos;spublic reaction to this statement had been sharpj he and hiscolleagues, however, had thought it better that the United KingdomGovernment should not engage in a public debate with the Governmentof the Irish Republic, which could only exacerbate the situation.Meanwhile, the Leader of the Opposition at Westminster,Mr Harold Wilson, had approached him that morning overthe recall of Parliament.    He had suggested without, as heput it, making a formal request, that Parliament should berecalled in a fortnight&apos;s time.    He thought that, rather thanimmediately rejecting any request for the recall of Parliament,the wiser course would be to leave open the possibility of a recallafter his discussions with Mr Faulkner.    He accordingly proposedto reply to Mr Wilson that, in the present state of feeling, immediaterecall was not desirable, and that it was not possible to foreseedevelopments over the next fortnight; but that he would keep thepossibility of recall closely in mind.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;sstatement.Cabinet Office SW117 August 1971SECRET
