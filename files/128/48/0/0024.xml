The Prime Minister ofNorthern Ireland? Major Chichester -Clark, had telephoned on thefollowing day tc say that he intended to resign forthwith, indicatingthat in a public statement he would feel obliged to relate hisresignation to the unwillingness of the United Kingdom Governmentto respond to his requests for additional measures to deal with thesecurity problem in Ulster^    He had told Major Chichester -Clarkin reply that the United Kingdom Government would be bound publiclyto refute any statement of this kind, since it would not only befactually untrue but would also jeopardise the successful formationof a new Administration,,    Major Chichester-Clark had subsequentlyagreed to defer his resignation for a short time;  and the MinisterialCommittee on Northern Ireland had arranged for the Secretary ofState for Defence and the Chief of the General Staff to visit Storrnonton 20 March in order not to undertake any new initiative but to makesure that there was no misunderstanding on the part cf the NorthernIreland Government about the means by which the Army wasimplementing Her Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s policy in relationto the maintenance of law and order and the suppression ofterrorism,    Aftet the Secretary of State had returnedMajor Chichester-Clark had indicated in a further telephonemessage that he was still resolved to announce his resignationon the evening of 20 March;  but the public statement which hecontemplated bore little relation to the earlier version and avoidedany recrimination against the United Kingdom Government. Weourselves had issued a short statement simultaneously, regrettingMajor Chichester-Clark&apos;s decision and reaffirming our determinationto continue to pursue the policies which, a? he himself admitted in hisown statement, offered the best hope of rescuing Northern Irelandfrom its present difficulties.SECRET
SECRETIn these circumstances it would be appropriate that he should makea statement in the House of Commons that afternoon, acknowledgingMajor Chichester-Clark&apos;s services and indicating the Government&apos;sfirm resolve that the Army should continue to carry out its twofoldtask of maintaining order and preventing communal strife and oferadicating terrorism with the least possible damage to the progressthat had been achieved and the welfare of innocent people*    He wouldalso make it clear that the United Kingdom Government had both theultimate authority and the ultimate responsibility for NorthernIreland and that we would support any Government at Stormo?*twhich continued to implement the social and economic policiesof which we approved,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that it appearedfrom his discussions on 20 March with Major Chichester-Clark andthe other members of the Cabinet at Stormont that they still hopedfor our agreement that the Army should establish military postswithin the areas subject to the influence of the Irish RepublicanArmy (IRA), as they had suggested at an earlier stage,,    In replyhe had made it very clear to them that such tactics were, from amilitary point of view, wholly unsound and unacceptable. NorthernIreland Ministers, however, were still representing that the Armywas not taking sufficiently vigorous action to combat terrorism,although they had been compelled to accept the force of his argumentsand had had no constructive suggestions of their own to offer0THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that thePrime Minister of the Irish Republic had made a helpful statement,condemning acts of violence.    We had made several suggestions tohim about the action which might be taken in the Republic in order toassist in the suppression of IRA terrorism in Northern Ireland.In discussion the Cabinet tendered their congratulations to theSecretary of State for Defence on the skill with which he had dealtwith a very difficult situaticn&quot;    They agreed that there would needto be an early debate in the House of Commons on Northern Irelandand that it would be preferable that it should take place before,rather than after, any new Northern Ireland Administration hadbeen long established in office.     The earliest suitable day appearedto be Thursday 25 March.The Cabinet -1. Took note of the statements by the PrimeMinister and the Secretary of State for Defence.2. Invited the Lord President of the Councilto discuss through the usual channels the possibilityof arranging a debate on Northern Ireland in theHouse of Commons on 25 March.Cabinet Office SW122 March 1971SECRET
