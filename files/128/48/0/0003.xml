TOP secret copy No...............J..3CABINETRTHERNLANDeviousference:(72) 7thseclusions,ute confidential annex cm(72) 9th conclusions tuesday 22 February 1972 at 11. 00 am the PRIME MINISTER said that the Attorney General had had further discussions with the legal authorities in NorthernIreland regarding the appeal by the Member of the NorthernIreland Parliament, Mr John Hume, of which the Cabinet had beeninformed at their meeting on 17 February.    Judgment in the case was expected to be delivered at 10 o&apos;clock am on Wednesday23 February;  it was likely to be adverse to the Crown.    Inparticular the judgment might declare that the Northern ireland parliament was precluded by the Government of Ireland Act, 1920,from conferring any powers upon members of Her Majesty&apos;for;es.    Since 1969, the Army had relied heavily upon powers conferred upon them by the Civil Authorities (Special Powers)Acts (Northern Ireland) 1922-43 (&quot;The Special Powers Acts&quot;).The effect of the pending judgment might therefore be to invalidateall actions taken by the Army by virtue of those powers.    It wasnot certain how widely the judgment would be drawn;  but it seemed that it could not affect the Army&apos;s powers in so far as they werederived from sources other than the Northern Ireland Parliament,for example the common law.In the event of an adverse judgment, tvro courses of action would be*open to the Government.    The first would be to appeal to the Houseof Lords.    But this would inevitably take time;  the House ofLords might, in the event, confirm the judgment upholdingMr Hume&apos;s appeal;  and, meanwhile, the Army wouldbe inhibitedfrom exercising powers conferred upon them by the Special PowersActs and would be exposed to litigation in respect of their pastactions based on those powers.    The second course was to introduce &apos;declaratory legislation, interpreting the Government of Ireland Act,1920, in such a way as to make it clear that it did not exclude fromthe competence of the Northern Ireland Parliament all legislative provision relating to members of Her Majesty&apos;s forces and that,in particular, it did not preclude the conferment of powers inrelation to the maintenance of public order in Northern Ireland.    Inconsultation with those Ministers most directly concerned, he had concluded that this was the better course; and a short draft Hill,
(the text of which was circulated to the Cabinet during their discussion) had accordingly been prepared.    But, although theBill was in form no more than a technical restatement of thelegal position as it had always been thought to be, its introductionwould be liable to expose the whole complex of Northern Irelandissues to further debate in Parliament.    The Leader of theOpposition, whom he had consulted in confidence, had indicated a willingness to co-operate in revalidating actions authorised in good faith under both the previous and the present Administrations;but he had pointed out that the introduction of the Bill would offerscope for debating the disputed policies which the Army&apos;operations in Northern Ireland could be held to be supporting.There were precedents for passing legislation through all stages in a single day in circumstances of emergency.    It might therefore be possible either to enact the proposed Bill onWednesday, 23 February, or to publish it on that day and to pass it through all stages on Thursday 24 February.   Ifc wao for co&amp;*ii&amp;ere.taosawhether the draft Bill should be amended to place a limitation of timeupon the grant of special powers to the Forces.    This, however,might alter the character of the Bill by importing an issue of policyinto legislation which was confined essentially to a question of interpretation;  and a substantive amendment of the Government ofIreland Act, 1920, could not be easily reconciled with a short bill which was designed merely to clarify the construction which parliament intended should be put upon that statute.    It would bedesirable that, in addition to his further consultations with the leader of the Opposition, he should send a message to the PrimeMinister of the Irish Republic, Mr Lynch, informing him that theaction which the Government proposed to take was essentiallytechnical and should certainly not be construed as in any sense an adverse response to the helpful tone of Mr Lynch&apos;s recent address to the annual conference of the Fianna Fail Party.    The NorthernIreland Prime Minister, Mr Faulkner, should also be kept informed of the Governmenfs intentions.THE ATTORNEY GENERAL informed the Cabinet that Mr Humehad appealed against a conviction for failing to disperse whenordered to do so by a member of the Forces in accordance withRegulation 38 made under the Special Powers Acts.    Although a judgment in the English courts in September, 1971, had notquestioned the validity of the exercise by the Forces of powers conferred by tl ese Acts, Mr Hume&apos;s appeal contended that such powers had not been validly conferred.    If his appeal was upheld,the Army would therefore be exposed to writs of habeas corpusand to accusations of wrongful arrest, unlawful entering of premises and, probably, assault.    Moreover, individuals would be entirely within their legal rights in refusing to obey orders givenby members of the Forces under powers conferred by the special powers Acts.    The draft Bill before the Cabinet was designed,
both in its form and in its long title, merely to declare that parliament intended the relevant provisions of the Government ofIreland Act, 1920, to be interpreted in the sense which had alwaysbeen assumed hitherto.    It did not propose any amendment of the1920 Act.    Any such amendment, for example, in the form of a limitation in time of the powers declared to have been conferred bythe Act, would be a matter of policy and would require a Bill of adifferent kind.    Other judgments which had been given, or werepending, in cases concerning the alleged abuse by members of theForces of powers conferred by the Special Powers Acts wereseparate from the present case, which was concerned solely-with the legal poegepesion of those powers bv the Forces.In discussion it was pointed out that most of the Regulationsconferring special powers upon the Forces were of many years1standing and that the previous Administration had stated in public that the Forces relied heavily upon these powers for operationalpurposes in Northern Ireland.    Nevertheless, a judgment that thepowers had not been validly conferred by the Northern ireland parliament might reinforce the widely held feeling that the presentdivision of powers between Westminster and Stormont was unsatisfactory and that the United Kingdom Government and parliament should assume the whole of the responsibility formatters of law and order in No northern Ireland.    It might be thought desirable to reassert the principle of close control by the UnitedKingdom Government over the actions of the Army and the powersentrusted to them; but a positive reassertion of this principlemight necessitate specific enactments at Westminster in termsidentical with considerable portions of the Northern Ireland special powers legislation.   Moreover, if legislation was introduced at westminster with a wider scope than a simple interpretation of the1920 Act, it might be taken as constituting the whole of thepolitical measures which much recent speculation had suggestedthat the Government were contemplating.    Even a simple inter-pretative Bill, however, would inevitably give rise to a demand tobe informed whether, and if so when, a major political initiativewas contemplated.    This question could not be answered untilMinisters had given further consideration to the decisions whichthey might wish to take and the substantive legislation which these might entail.    Nevertheless, it could be stated that the possibilityof more widely ranging legislation was not excluded but that itwould have to be considered in a wider political context.Meanwhile, the Army would be placed in a very difficult position ifthe powers previously thought to have been conferred on them by theSpecial Powers Acts were not speedily revalidated.    It was truethat legislation in the form proposed would give retrospectivevalidity to their actions prior to the enactment of the Bill.    But inthe interval between publication of the legal judgment and royal assent to the legislation individuals would be fully justified in law
in resisting any action taken by a member of the Forces under powers conferred by the Special Powers Acts.    It was therefore important to complete the legislative process as rapidly as possible;  and,meanwhile, the security forces would have to rely upon powersderiving from common law and upon the powers conferred by theSpecial Powers Acts upon the civil authority.    A brief interim period might be acceptable; but any significantly longer period would be very undesirable, not least in the opportunity which itwould provide to the Irish Republican Army to rebuild its strengthand its resources.As regards the timing of the legislation, introduction of the Bill onWednesday, 23 February, might be criticised as not allowingParliament sufficient time for proper consideration of the issues.On the other hand postponement until Thursday, 24 February, wouldprovide more scope for controversy about the measure to develop.It would in any event be necessary to study the terms of the judgment with care in order to confirm that the proposed Bill wascorrectly drawn.    The best course might be to make statements in both Houses at 3. 30 pm on Wednesday, 23 February, informingParliament of the legal judgment and indicating the Government&apos;intention to introduce legislation at the earliest possible moment.A procedural Resolution might then permit the interruption ofbusiness later the same day for the Bill to be introduced and passed through all its stages in the House of Commons, with a view topassing the House of Lords and receiving the Royal Assent as early as possible on Thursday, 24 February.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that, if the court in Northern Ireland deHvered a judgment adverse to the Crown, corrective action should be takenin the form of legislation rather than an appeal to the House of Lords.The Lord President of the Council, the Lord Privy Seal, and theParliamentary Secretary, Treasury, should consider, in consulta-tion with officers of both Houses of Parliament, the feasibility ofarrangements whereby statements would be made at 3. 30 pm orWednesday, 23 February, the Bill would be presented on the same day and passed through all its stages in the House of Commonsfrom 7. 00 pm onwards, all stages being thereafter taken in theHouse of Lords and the Royal Assent being given on Thursday,24 February.    Should this not be feasible, the aim should be to pass the legislation through all stages in both Houses, and to obtain theRoyal Assent, on Thursday, 24 February;  this latter course might in any event have to be accepted if there was a strong feeling in theHouse of Commons that a debate on Wednesday, 23 February,would afford insufficient time for prior consideration of the issues.He would himself consult further with the Leader of the Oppositionas appropriate.    He would also arrange for Mr Faulkner to beinformed of the Governments intentions and for a message to be sent4
to Mr Lynch indicating that the proposed legislation was no morethan a technical restatement of the law as it had always beenconsidered to be and was in no sense intended to discount the helpfultone of Mr Lynch&apos;s recent public statements.    Although the draftBill was purely technical, however, the Parliamentary debate was likely to raise wider political questions which would require to bedealt with discreetly.    Meanwhile, during the period between an adverse judgment and the grant of Royal Assent to the proposed bill the Forces should refrain from exercising the powers confessedupon them by the Special Powers Acts;  it would be necessary to rely on the powers which they possessed under common law and on those conferred by the Special Powers Acts upon the civil authority.Finally, the proposed publication of the Parker Report onWednesday, 23 February, should bD postponed.    The issues raisedby that report, in so far as they related not to the possession ofcertain powers by the Forces but to the manner in which the forces had used those powers, were wholly distinct from the question whichthe Cabinet had been discussing;  and it would be important to avoid any possibility of confusion.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office22 February 19725
