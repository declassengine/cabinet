SECRETf     D CUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTJvioU3I, -e ce:&gt;)48thute 2COPY NOCABINETCONFIDENTIAL ANNEXCM(71) 49th Conclusions, Minute 4Tuesday 12 October 1971 at 1L 00 amTHE PRIME MINISTER said that he had held a farther meeting withthe Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, Mr Faulkner, on 7 October,at which the Home Secretary, the Foreign and CommonwealthSecretary, the Lord President of the Council and the Secretaryof State for Defence were present.    As the statement issued atthe end of that meeting had indicated, agreement had been reachedon further military measures to deal with terrorism, including thedespatch of three additional battalions to Northern Ireland. Theirobjectives, in order of priority, would be to intensify securityoperations in Belfast, making full use of the intelligence whichhad been received as a result of internment; more effectivelyto control the Border v/ith the Irish Republic; and to deal withthe unsatisfactory situation in certain parts of Londonderry.The Border operation would entail cratering some 80 unapprovedroads with the object of making them impassable to wheeled traffic.The Prime Minister of the Irish Republic, Mr Lynch, whom we hadinformed of this intention, had reacted very critically, maintainingthat it would exacerbate the situation, which, in his view, could onlybe improved by measures to promote a political solution.    We werein fact maintaining pressure on Mr Faulkner to take some politicalaction, by including one or two representatives of the minority inhis Cabinet.    We had also agreed that the Northern IrelandGovernment should publish their proposed Green Paper on possibleParliamentary reforms with a view to giving the minority a strongerrole in public administration.In the course of a brief discussion it was suggested that we neededto move with circumspection in the matter of political concessionsto the minority in Northern Ireland if they involved measures which,although not sufficiently far-reaching to influence the minorityleaders, were nevertheless unacceptable to Mr Faulkner&apos;s supportersand might therefore result in his own overthrow.    The decisions ofthe Advisory Committee who were hearing appeals against internment1SECRET
SECRETwould be of critical importance both in determining the attitude ofthe Northern Ireland minority and in helping to ensure that theOpposition at Westminster continued in general to lend their supportto the Government&apos;s policies in Northern Ireland,    We should there-fore seek to ensure that the Advisory Committee&apos;s recommendationswere regarded by the Northern Ireland Government as having ajudicial stamp and were only rejected for the most compellingreasons.    There was no doubt, however, that the great majorityof internees were potentially dangerous and that their release wouldhave adverse effects on the morale of both the Northern IrelandGovernment and the security forces.The Cabinet -Took note of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement.Cabinet Office12 October 19712SECRET
