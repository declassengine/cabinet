NO CIRCULATION RECORDTOP SECRETCM(73)_^2n,dConclusionsThursday 27th September,  1973 at 12 NoonTHE PRIME MINISTER said that his colleagues would have noted theextremely unfortunate impression created by a speech by Lord Rothschildto the Letcombe Laboratory of the Agricultural Research Council on24th September.     There were two aspects to this.     The first was thatLord Rothschild was a Permanent Secretary and was thus bound by thenormal rules under which civil servants were required to clear speechesdealing with official matters or drawing upon their official experience.This obligation had not been observed but Lord Rothschild had undertakento observe it in future.     The second was the apparent contradiction inthe speech with the line which Ministers had been taking about the growthof the economy.    This was at least part due to the lack of cohesion inLord Rothschild&apos;s speech and his failure to relate the actions whichMinisters have taken to induce growth to the situation which would haveresulted in the absence of them.     It would be best now to allow thematter to drop and for this reason Ministers might prefer to avoidspeeches on this theme in advance of the Party Conference.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office27 September 1973
