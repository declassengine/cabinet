Major Chichester-Clark had been concerned toemphasise that he could maintain his position only if there were aneffective public demonstration that the Army were intensifying theirmeasures against terrorism; and he had asked in particular that afurther 5 major units should be sent to the Province.    The MinisterialCommittee on Northern Ireland had considered these representationsand- in addition to commissioning an immediate study of the additionalmilitary action which might be taken, had authorised the despatch of2 major units, together with an armoured reconnaissance squadron -not so much because these reinforcements were essentiaLfrom astrictly military point of view as because they might help to ensurethe political survival of the Northern Ireland Administration, wnichit was in our interest to sustain.    The necessary public announce-ment would be made that afternoon, initially In London and shortlythereafter in the House of Commons at Stormont.    It seemed clearfrom the guidance which the Northern Ireland Government hadevidently given to the Press and from such episodes as the publiccriticism of the Army by the Northern Ireland Minister of State,Home Affairs, that the authorities in Ulster had deliberately soughtmeans of bringing pressure to bear on us to meet their request; andwe should need to have thi3 in mind in our future dealings with them.Earlier in the week there had been speculation whetherMajor Chichester-ClarkTs Administration could survive for morethan a few days.    If the Unionist Central Council, which was to meeton 29 March, or Major Chichester-Clark^ own constituencyAssociation demonstrated that they had lost confidence in him, hewould probably resign wichout putting his support in the NorthernIreland House of Commons to the test.    It was possible, inMajor Chichester-ClarkTs view, that the Northern Ireland Ministerof Development, Mr Faulkner, might be able to form a successorTOP SECRET
TOP SECRETAdministration; but, if he invited members of the extreme rightwing to join it, he would not be able to count on the support of all themembers of the present Administration-    If Mr Faulkner failed,the outcome might be a General Election^ which would almostcertainly place power unmistakably in the hands of the extremeright wing.    The Cabinet might therefore be faced with the need totake very serious decisions In the near future; and contingencyplans were being prepared accordingly.    If the situation becamecritical during his forthcoming visit to Bonn, he would be preparedto return to .London forthwith.The Cabinet -Took note of the Prime MinIsterTs statement.Cabinet Office SW118 March 1S71TOP SECRET
