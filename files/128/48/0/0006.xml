Opinions had varied, however, on whether weshould go further.    Two main problems arose.    First, would an initiative limited to the measures which he had indicated besufficient to persuade all sections of political opinion in NorthernIreland to co-operate in discussions directed towards a futurepolitical structure which would guarantee to the minority, as of right, an active and permanent role in the government of theProvince; or to persuade the Prime Minister of the Irish Republic,Mr Lynch, to take the more effective measures against the irish republican Army (IRA) without which it was questionable how farany political initiative in Northern Ireland could succeed in bringingterrorism to an end?    Second, what would be the consequences of a refusal on the part of the Northern Ireland Prime Minister,Mr Faulkner, to carry on his Administration if responsibility for lawand order was transferred to Westminster?   It was difficult to envisage either that an alternative Prime Minister could emergecapable of commanding a majority in the Northern ireland parliament or that a General Election could be held in NorthernIreland in present circumstances.    The consequence of a decisionto transfer law and order might therefore, whether we wished it ornot, be the imposition, at least for a time, of direct Uctffted Kingdomrule.    Against this background it was now necessary to consider boththe manner in which the Government1 s thinking should be presented toMr Faulkner and the means by which Mr Lynch might be brought totake stronger action against the IRA within the Republic.1
In discussion it was suggested that the transfer of responsibility for law and order to Westminster might do little in itself to ensure theirmore effective enforcement within the Province.    Moreover, if adecision to transfer this responsibility led to the imposition of directUnited Kingdom rule, this would be liable to be regarded as a concession of one of the major policy aims of the IRA.    This in turnmight encourage the terrorists to intensify their campaign and,perhaps, to extend it to Great Britain;  and it might, in addition,deprive the Government not only of such confidence as they enjoyedamong the Protestant majority in Northern Ireland, but also of thesupport of a number of those upon whose votes they relied in theUnited Kingdom Parliament for the implementation of their Europeanpolicy.    It could be argued that the successful enactment of thelegislation confirming our accession to the European Communitieswas a matter of even more fundamental importance than the solutionof the problems of Northern Ireland.    It might be wiser, therefore,to think in terms of an initial step going no further than the transfer to Westminster of responsibility for all aspects of the internmentpolicy, leaving other questions on law and order with the StormontGovernment.On the other hand, it would be intolerable to permit the situation inNorthern Ireland to deteriorate further without some new and radicalaction on the part of the Government.    The Government1 s policy for northern Ireland required both that the IRA should be deprived of the considerable measure of benevolent neutrality, if not support, which its members enjoyed among large sections of the minority community and that political discussions should be set in train directed towards a more just and balanced political structure for the Province.    Itwas doubtful whether either of these aims could be achieved withoutthe suspension, at any rate for a time, of the Parliamentary systemestablished by the Government of Ireland Act, 1920.    In terms ofpublic relations there would be considerable advantage in presentingany suspension  of the Stormont Parliament as a temporary measure; and the more quickly discussions could be pressed forward and the necessary period of suspension could be brought toan end, the less would be the danger that direct rule might becomepermanent for want of any realistic alternative.    The suspension ofStormont might be less unacceptable to the Governments supporters,however, if it appeared as a necessary consequence of a refusal byMr Faulkner to maintain his Administration following a decision bythe United Kingdom Government to transfer responsibility for law andorder to Westminster.    In this connection it was doubtful whether itwas realistic to think in terms of transferring only the responsibilityfor internment policy; in practice internment could not be isolatedfrom other aspects of law and order.    The United Kingdom government representative in Belfast had expressed the view that Mr Faulknerwould probably refuse to remain in office if law and order were transferred to Westminster, although opinions varied as to the extentto which, after resigning, he might try to mount a campaign of2
outright opposition to the United Kingdom Government.    The outcomemight depend to a considerable extent on the attitude adopted by theNorthern Ireland Civil Service and the Royal Ulster Constabulary(RUC);  and there were grounds for believing that they would maintain their loyalty to the Crown, although the position of the Special Branchof the RUC might require special consideration.    Nevertheless, itwould remain true that an initiative on the lines under discussion would be liable to appear more attractive to the minority than to themajority.    It was for consideration, therefore, whether the assurance of continued union with the rest of the United Kingdom which wasimplicit in the proposal for a Border referendum should be supplemented by the proscription of the IRA as an illegal organisation in Great Britain and by a substantial further programme of economic assistance to Northern Ireland.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that thenext step should be a discussion with Mr Faulkner, designed toestablish his intentions and to test, so far as possible, his probablereaction to an initiative of the kind which thp Cabinet had been considering.    It would be necessary to accept the risk that thesubstance of this discussion might become known and thatMr Faulkner might seek to mount a campaign of opposition to theUnited Kingdom Government with the aid of his Northern IrelandCabinet colleagues.   He would consider further the form and timing ofsuch a meeting, taking into account the various considerations whichhad emerged during the Cabinet1 s discussioru    Meanwhile the HomeSecretary was examining the possibility of proscribing the IRA as anillegal organisation in Great Britain;  and the possibility of a further substantial programme of economic aid for Northern Ireland shouldalso be borne in mind.    It might be necessary to ask the Cabinet to resume their consideration of all these matters at short notice in thelight of the discussion with Mr Faulkner.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister1 summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office9 March 19723 -
