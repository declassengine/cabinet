cabinet confidential annex cm(72) 30th Conclusions, Minute 4Thursday 15 June 1972 at 10. 30 ampTHERNBLANDTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said thatthe fear of imminent civil war might now at last be impelling the protestant and Roman Catholic extremists in Northern Ireland toconsider more realistically the possible consequences of their actions.    The Protestant comiriunity had been sorely tried bythe campaign of terrorism on the part of the Irish republican army (IRA); but the leaders of the Protestant extremist body,the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), had now postponed theirpotentially provocative plan to erect permanent barricades on a widespread scale during the following weekend.    Equally, the most recent approach by the &quot;Provisional&quot; wing of the IRA, althoughcouched in an unacceptable form, perhaps reflected a consciousnessof declining support within the Roman Catholic community;  and the invitation, which he had accepted, to discuss the situation withMr John Hume and Mr Paddy Devlin of the Social Democratic andLabour Party (SDLP) could only be welcomed as an indication thatthe elected representatives of a substantial body of Roman Catholicopinion might be coming to realise that the only hope of a peacefulfuture for the Province lay in the policies of reconciliation which theGovernment were now trying to pursue.In his discussions with the leaders of the UDA he had pointed out thatProtestant violence could only be to the advantage of the IRA, since it enabled them to represent themselves as the protectors of the roman Catholic population.    He had also emphasised that NorthernIreland would not cease to be part of the United Kingdom unless anduntil the majority of its people so wished; that the vigorous pursuit of terrorists remained an essential part of the Governments policy;and that the problem of the Bogside and Creggan areas of londonderry would be dealt with, although not by a military operation of a kind which would inevitably result in heavy civilian casualties.    They appeared to accept that a direct military assaultupon these areas would not be appropriate;  and they had given him
an undertaking that the UDA would erect no barricades over thefollowing weekend.    It was to be hoped that their control over their followers would be adequate to ensure this.    So far, however, therewas no evidence that either the former Northern Ireland PrimeMinister, Mr Faulkner, or the leader of the Ulster Vanguard,Mr Craig, had exercised any effective moderating influence uponthe activities of the UDA;  and there were indications thatMr Faulkner was not prepared to do so on the pretext thatthe violence of Protestant extremists had been provoked bythe policies which the United Kingdom Government had pursuedafter the introduction of direct rule.His discussions with leaders of the UDA had been immediatelyfollowed by an invitation, cast in the form of an ultimatum, fromthe &quot;Provisional&quot; wing of the IRA to enter into discussion of their&quot;terms&quot;.    If he had given any indication of readiness to &quot;negotiate&quot;with the IRA, or even if he had deferred rejecting their ultimatum,there would have been a violent Protestant reaction,    A number of responsible individuals in Northern Ireland, including the Governor,had regretted that he had rebuffed this approach, on the ground thatthe Government should not appear to be adopting a rigid and negative attitude towards any developments which might offer a prospect,however remote, of progress towards peace.    On the other handall the Roman Catholic members of the Advisory Commission had supported his view that to respond to the invitation from the IRAwould have undermined the position of the more moderate roman catholic representatives who were seeking a cessation of violence.He therefore particularly appreciated the proposal for discussions with Mr Hume and Mr Devlin, whom he would be meeting that afternoon.    He proposed to take this opportunity to make it clearthat he had no intention of going behind the backs of the elected representatives of the minority community in order to enter intodirect negotiations with the IRA.    At the same time, however, hewould ask them whether they could exercise their influence in sucha way that the maximum advantage could be taken of the evidentdesire of large sections of the Roman Catholic community for anend to violence.In sum, these recent developments offered an opportunity for political advance which the Government could not afford to miss;the question was how to seize it.    If the opportunity was not taken,there might be no alternative to a military operation designed, if notto occupy, at least to seal off the Bog side and Creggan areas by force.In discussion it was suggested that, while it had been inevitable thata virtual ultimatum from the IRA should be rejected, it might bedifficult to achieve any political solution of the problems of londonderry without some dealings with the leaders of the
t,Provisionaln wing.    In many countries (including Ireland in 1921)it had proved necessary to negotiate with terrorist leaders; and suitable channels might be found - whether through the SDLP, the roman Catholic Church or released internees - through which their  could be persuaded that an end to violence could be followed bya relaxation of military activity, an end to internment and therestoration of normal life throughout the Province, includingthe Roman Catholic enclaves.    To this end it might be important to avoid any public statement which could be interpreted as a threator a commitment to the arrest of IRA leaders when the Bogside andCreggan areas were opened up.In further discussion it was pointed out that, although a principalobject of the Governments policies had been to detach moderateRoman Catholics from supporting the IRA, no effective pressure to secure an end to violence had in fact been exerted as yet by themore moderate elements.    In renewing his appeal to the moderateleaders, therefore, the Secretary of State might point out that, ifthey could not exercise any influence to this end, the government might have no choice but to adopt measures such as the sealing off of the Bogside and Creggan areas, which could only revive thealienation of the Roman Catholic community.    Although any directdiscussions with the IRA would probably remain out of the question,the Secretary of State might be able to convey his message to them not only through selected intermediaries but also by means of public statements directed specifically tov/ards them as well as to a wideraudience,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that it was essential that nothing should be done which mightundermine the position of the elected representatives of the predominantly Roman Catholic areas of Northern Ireland,The Secretary of State should do everything possible to persuaderesponsible Roman Catholic leaders to initiate a process ofdiscussion by which the growing influences for moderation mightbe effectively brought to bear upon the more extreme factions.His discussions with Mr John Hume and Mr Paddy Devlin wouldprovide an opportunity for this; for example, they might be asked if they could promote a gradual withdrawal of the barrierssurrounding the Bogside and Creggan areas of Londonderryin order that the much needed work of reconstruction withinthose areas might begin.    The Secretary of State should alsoseek to convey to the IRA leaders, by indirect means, that a cessation of bombing and shooting would do more than anything else to bring about a situation in which a settlement acceptable to all might be achieved.    At this stage we should be particularlycareful not to lay down conditions upon which we might subsequentlyfind it impolitic to insist; and we should seek to avoid any
declarations of policy which might hamper our freedom of manoeuvrein the very complex negotiations which would be necessary if we wereto arrive at a solution ensuring the Roman Catholic community thesocial and economic opportunities to which they were entitled,together with a fair share in the political life of the Province,while reassuring the Protestant faction that there would be noquestion of any change, without their consent, in the status ofNorthern Ireland within the United Kingdom.The Cabinet -1, Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister*s summing up of this part of their discussion and invited the Secretary of Statefor Northern Ireland to be guided accordingly.In the light of the preceding discussion the Cabinet consideredtwo memoranda by the Secretary of State for Northern Irelandproposing the immediate announcement of decisions to enter uponpreparatory discussions with a view to a Round Table Conferenceon the future form of government in Northern Ireland (CP(7Z) 59)and the introduction of Proportional Representation (PR) for thelocal government elections in Northern Ireland which were at presentenvisaged for 18 October 1972 (CP(72) 60).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that,despite the more hopeful tendencies to which he had referredearlier, further action was urgently needed to maintain the momentum of the Governments political initiative.    The twomeasures which he now proposed could help to promote a climateof opinion in which political activity rather than violence was accepted as the only means of achieving lasting progress.    It would benecessary, however, to maintain a careful balance between thesetwo proposals.    The reintroduction of the system of PR, which had operated in Northern Ireland between 1921 and 1929, would beregarded by the Unionist Party as designed to reduce their dominancein Northern Ireland politics.    It was particularly important,therefore, that the suggestion of a Round Table Conference shouldbe put forward in a manner which would reassure the Unionists thatthere was no intention of altering the status of Northern Irelandwithin the United Kingdom unless a majority of its inhabitants sowished.    For this reason he proposed to emphasise that the typeof conference which he had in mind was a meeting at whichrepresentatives of the people of Northern Ireland themselvescould search for common ground and could report their conclusions to the United Kingdom Government;  and he would be equallyconcerned to make it clear that at this stage the Governmentwere not imposing a Round Table Conference but were merelyproposing that discussions should be opened in order to ascertain
whether a conference could be brought into being.    He would indicate at the same time that, if there should emerge clear evidence of a widespread desire for an early plebiscite on thestatus of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom, theGovernment would arrange such a plebiscite without delay.The precise terms of reference, composition, and methodof operation of the conference would be matters to be exploredin the preliminary discussions with the parties concerned.    Itmight not be easy to secure agreement upon the choice of a chairman.    The former Northern Ireland Prime Minister,Mr Faulkner, had suggested that the Secretary of State himselfmight represent the only generally acceptableappointment to this post.    His own view was that, sincethe conference should be primarily a meeting of representativesof the people of Northern Ireland, the Governor might be an appropriate Chairman; but the Governors participation might,however wrongly, be regarded as entailing an undue involvementof the Crown in political discussions.As regards the local government elections, it was necessary, ifthe planned date of 1 April 1973 for the introduction of the reformedstructure of local government was to be kept, to take an early decision on the question whether the present system of simple majority voting was to be retained or whether the single transferable vote system of PR was to be reintroduced.    There were cogentarguments for reintroducing PR for the forthcoming elections,without prejudice to any longer-term constitutional arrangementsfor the Province.    If the simple majority vote was retained, very few councillors would be returned who were not supporters of oneof the two extremist Parties, Ulster Vanguard or Sinn Fein.    there introduction of PR might not wholly prevent such a polarisation;but if PR was still withheld, the blame for the polarisation wouldbe placed upon the Government by those moderate elements inNorthern Ireland whom it was most desirable to encourage.Moreover, the Opposition at Westminster strongly favoured the reintroduction of PR in Northern Ireland;  and, if the Governmentrejected this course, the Opposition would probably seek to obstruct the substantial programme of legislation necessary to carry throughthe reforms of the local government structure to which theGovernment were committed.    Mr Faulkner had indicated that there would be strong objection to PR within the unionist party.    But there were signs that Unionist opinion would in fact be divided; and it was doubtful whether PR would be an emotiveissue for the extremists of the UDA,    Some of the government&apos;s supporters at Westminster might have misgivings about PR; andit would be desirable to emphasise that the proposal involved no more than the reintroduction, on an experimental basis, of thesystem which had prevailed in Northern Ireland between 1921 and1929 and that it constituted no precedent for elections in GreatBritain,
As a result of the introduction of PP. the elections in question wouldhave to be postponed until November or December 1972;  but the new arrangements for local government could still be introduced on1 April 1973.    The need to define the multi-member constituencieswhich were inherent in a PR system would require very promptParliamentary action.In discussion it was suggested that, while the proposed parliamentary statement should be confined to suggesting preparatory discussionsfor a Round Table Conference, the desirability of such a conference should be clearly indicated.    If the preliminary exchanges failed to result in agreement on arrangements for a conference, this would bedue solely to the intransigence of the participants and would not reflect upon the Governments policies.    It was also important that the statement should be so worded as to reassure Unionistopinion in Northern Ireland that the status of the Province withinthe United Kingdom would remain unchanged unless and until amajority of its citizens chose otherwise.    The question whetherthe conference could discuss this aspect of the status of NorthernIreland, however, must inevitably depend to some extent on the outcome of the preliminary exchanges.In discussion of the reintroduction of PR for the local government elections there was general agreement on the importance of satisfying all sections of the electorate that the system wasfair in its operation.    The single transferable vote system had been adopted successfully in a number of countries andhad, indeed, operated in Northern Ireland between 1921 and1929.    Although it might in general be regarded as inferiorto the system of a simple majority vote and less conductive to the maintenance of stable government, the political arguments for its adoption in the special case of Northern Ireland were very strong;   and the circumstances were so exceptional that it shouldnot be difficult to resist pressure to extend PR to local government elections in Great Britain,    In terms of Parliamentary time,however, it was very desirable that the necessary Orders inCouncil should, if possible, not be brought forward for debatebefore the middle of July at the earliest.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet agreed that the Secretary of State for NorthernIreland should make a statement in Parliament that afternoon aboutthe Governments decisions to initiate preparatory discussions witha view to a Round Table Conference on the future form ofgovernment in Northern Ireland and to reintroduce the single transferable vote system of PR for the forthcoming local government elections in Northern Ireland.    The statement on the conference should clearly indicate the Governments desire that representatives
of the people of Northern Ireland should meet to seek a commonapproach to a solution of their problems.    The timing, terms ofreference, membership, chairmanship and method of operation ofthe conference would be matters to be explored in greater detail inthe preliminary discussions.    It should be made clear that theGovernment would arrange for an early plebiscite on the status of Northern Ireland in relation to the rest of the United Kingdomif there was a clear consensus of opinion in the Province that thiswould be desirable; but It would be necessary to give renewedassurances that there would be no change in the status of the six counties unless the majority of the inhabitants so chose.    It wouldalso be desirable to emphasise that the adoption of PR represented a reintroduction, on an experimental basis and for the forthcominglocal elections in Northern Ireland only, of the system which had operated there between 1921 and 1929.    While the elections couldnot be postponed beyond November or December and the work ofdefining new multi-member constituencies should therefore be putin hand without delay, the Secretary of State should consider howfar he could defer the introduction of the necessary legislation byOrder in Council under the procedures laid down in the NorthernIreland (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1972.    The Secretary of state should also ensure that the Opposition and the Government of theIrish Republic were given appropriate prior notification of thedecisions to be announced that afternoon.The Cabinet -2. Took note, with approval, of the prime minister s summing up of their discussion and invited the Secretary of State for NorthernIreland to be guided accordingly in preparing a statement to be made in Parliament that afternoon.Cabinet Office16 June 1972
