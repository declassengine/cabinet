IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy NO10CABINETplTHERNLAND)viouserence:(72) 45th[elusions,ute 6CONFIDENTIAL annex cm(72) 46th Conclusions, Minute 4Wednesday 25 October 1972 at 11. 30 am the SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said thatthe recent deterioration in the security situation in Northern Irelandcompelled him to advise the Cabinet to reverse their earlier decision and to announce that the local government elections wouldnot take place on 6 December, as had been earlier envisaged.Intimidation of Roman Catholics by Protestant extremists had recently increased to an alarming extent;  and many roman catholic candidates would be too frightened to stand at the elections.Indeed, virtually none of the political Parties now wished theelections to take place on 6 December,    In these circumstances it would be prudent to announce, preferably on the following day,that the elections would be postponed for 6 months, until May 1973,with the result that the new local authorities would be constituted in the following October.    The announcement of this change shouldlay emphasis on the widespread desire among the political parties in Northern Ireland for a postponement of the elections and on thefact that it would enable the proposed plebiscite on the Border to beheld first.    On this basis the plebiscite might best be held inJanuary.    Our troops would need to be reinforced for both theelections and the plebiscite.There were grounds for considerable concern about the effect onProtestant extremist opinion of recent public statements byMr Craig, the leader of the Vanguard Movement including his recent inflammatory speech in London to the Monday Club.    urgent consideration was being given to further steps to counter the activity of the Tartan gangs and other extremist groups whoseviolent behaviour received additional encouragement from suchutterances.    The intimidation of magistrates and the prejudiceof juries were also assuming serious proportions.    Bail wasbeing granted against police advice;  and verdicts were being returned against the balance of the evidence.1
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that,although there were obvious dangers in allowing ourselves to be deterred by threats of violence from giving effect to our decisionsof policy, it seemed clear that the elections would have to be postponed.    Since he had privately informed the Prime Ministerof the Irish Republic of our earlier intentions during the recentSummit Meeting in Paris, he would now arrange for him to be warned of this change in our plans.It was obviously objectionable that individuals who were clearlyguilty of public incitement to violence should escape the legalconsequences of their speeches;  and although we must have regardto the political implications in Northern Ireland of bringingcriminal charges against political leaders who could commandsignificant popular support, especially if there was a risk thatsuch prosecutions might fail, we must nevertheless showcontinuing determination to maintain law and order.^   In this contextthe Cabinet were glad to be informed by the Attorney General that he&apos; was already examining Mr Craig&apos;s recent speech to the Monday Club.As regards the intimidation of magistrates, the Secretary of State for northern Ireland should consider the possibility of statutorily debarringbail in certain types of cases.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion^Cabinet Office26 October 19722
