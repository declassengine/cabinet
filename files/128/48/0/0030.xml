SECRET     &lt;LU $uJ^T&gt;^tfH^&amp;5)T IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCOPY NOESTHER*POLANDr^l) 4Tth3ckBnPWS IS A COPY THE ORIGINAL ISR SECTION 5.1 OF THEECORDS ACT 1958CONFIDENTIAL ANNEXCM(71) 48th Conclusions^&quot; Minute 2Wednesday 29 September 1971 at 11.45 amTHE PRIME MINISTER said that his discussions with Mr Lynch, thePrime Minister of the Irish Republic, and Mr Faulkner, the PrimeMinister of Northern Ireland, at Chequers on 27 and 28 Septemberhad been frank and friendly in tone.    Neither of the visiting PrimeMinisters had sought unreasonably to limit the scope of theexchanges, which had ranged over the internal affairs of bothcountries and had included many subjects not mentioned in theagreed statement published on 28 September.    Mr Lynch nowhad a better understanding of the reasons which made it impossiblefor us to make some dramatic concession on internment for the sakeof satisfying the Northern Ireland Social Democratic and Labour Party(SDLP) and thus inducing them to participate in the Home Secretary&apos;sdiscussions on the future of the Province.    It seemed likely that hewould nevertheless be prepared privately to press the SDLP to departfrom their present uncompromising refusal to take part in thosediscussions.    Mr Lynch had frankly revealed his difficulties asregards any intensification of security measures on the Border, [particularly the inadequacy and, in some instances, the unreliability&quot;of the Forces available to the Government of the Republic forimposing more effective control] But, despite the fact that thematter was not mentioned in the agreed statement, there was somehope that firmer action might now be taken against the various formsof Irish Republican Army (IRA) activity inside the Republic.Equally, although there was no reference in the public statementto closer economic co-operation between Northern Ireland and theRepublic, there was reason to expect that, as a result of theChequers discussions, Mr Lynch would seek to give moreencouragement to exchanges of this kind, at least betweenthe officials concerned.    He was unlikely, however, to departfrom his reservation that co-operation at Ministerial level wasnot possible as long as the minority in Northern Ireland playedno effective part in the Government at Stormont,SECRET
SECRETMr Faulkner bad outlined the probable content of the NorthernIreland Government&apos;s draft Green Paper on further constitutionalreform, which included a discussion of proposals for the enlargementof the Northern Ireland House of Commons and Senate and for theintroduction of proportional representation.    Our own strategy wasto make some limited disclosure of these possibilities as a means ofinducing the SDLP to take part in the Home Secretary&apos;s discussions;and we believed that to publish them in detail before SDJLPparticipation had been assured would be to dissipate part oftheir value.In all the Chequers discussions had had some success in disabusingboth the Irish leaders of some of the suspicions which theyentertained; and they had helped to focus Mr lynch&apos;s mindon the danger that, if the SDLP abdicated from its leadershipof the minority group, this responsibility was likely to be assumedby the IRA.    It would be desirable, in the aftermath of the recentParliamentary debate and of the Chequers discussions, for theCabinet to review our policy on Northern Ireland in the near future.In the course of a brief discussion the following main points weremade -a. The recent IRA attempts to use anti-tank rockets asa terrorist weapon were a disquieting development. Heavycasualties could result once the terrorists discovered how touse these weapons effectively.b. There would be obvious political advantages if furtherIRA suspects could be charged with offences rather thaninterned.    It was for consideration whether the need forrecourse to internment might be reduced by creating, bymeans of legislation at Stormont or at Westminster, specialcourts operating under a procedure which reduced the dangersof intimidation of witnesses and of juries.c. A Parliamentary delegation would be visiting theinternment camp at Long Kesh during the following week.It was important that this visit should pass off without anyuntoward incident.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;sstatement.Cabinet Office29 September 19712SECRET
