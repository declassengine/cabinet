SECRETi? DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT8COPY NOCABINETNORTHERNIRELANDPreviousReference:CM(7V) 45thConclusions,Minute 3CONFIDENTIAL ANNEXCM(71) 46th Conclusions, Minute 3Thursday 9 September 1971 at 11. 45 am3. The Cabinet discussed developments in the situation inNorthern Ireland.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, in the light of the recent decisionof the Opposition in Northern Ireland to withdraw from theParliament at Stormont, he had thought it necessary to discuss theproblem of Northern Ireland with the Prime Minister of theIrish Republic, Mr Lynch.    This meeting had taken place atChequers on 6 and 7 September; and, in deference to a requestby Mr Lynch, no other Ministers had taken part on either side.As regards the security situation in Northern Ireland Mr Lynch hadclaimed that he was doing all that he could to restrict the activitiesof the Irish Republican Army (IRA) but that he was not prepared tointern members of the IRA in the South unless they became an overtthreat to the Republic itself and that he could not deploy anyadditional units of the Regular Army of the Republic for militarypatrolling of the Border.    He had told Mr Lynch that, so far aswe were concerned, the British Army were taking special measuresto avoid the accidental crossing of the Border by military patrols,such as had recently occurred near Crossmaglen.As regards political action Mr Lynch had had no solution to propose,apart from his earlier suggestion that the Parliament at Stormontshould be replaced by a Commission in which the minority groupswould share authority equally with the majority.    He had thereforeoutlined to Mr Lynch our own proposal, which had already beenagreed with the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, Mr Faulkner,that the Home Secretary should preside over a meeting of theNorthern Ireland Government, representatives of both sides of theNorthern Ireland Parliament and other representatives of themajority and minority communities in the hope of devising meansby which the minority, as well as the majority, could enjoy an active,SECRET
SECRETpermanent and guaranteed role In the life and public affairs of theProvince.    He had assured Mr Lynch that no suggestions consistentwith the existing constitutional status of Northern Ireland would beexcluded from these discussions; and he had invited him to use hisinfluence to persuade members of the minority groups to attend theconference.    Mr Lynch, however, had declined to lend any supportto this proposal, except on the footing that he would himself bepresent or be represented at the conference or that it would bepreceded by quadripartite discussions, to be attended on the one handby the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and by Mr Faulkner(whom he could not recognise as more than the leader of onepolitical Party), and, on the other hand, by himself, as PrimeMinister of the Republic, and the minority leader in Northern Ireland.Mr Lynch had sought to justify this attitude by maintaining that,since both the settlement of 1920 and the Border were invalid, hewas the legitimate spokesman of the Irish people as a whole andcould not accept that he should be excluded from discussion of theaffairs of any part of Ireland.    In reply he had told Mr Lynch thatany cuch proposal was not constitutionally acceptable; but he hadoffered, Instead, a meeting between himself, Mr Lynch andMr Faulkner.    This, too, Mr Lynch had declined to accept on theground that he could not recognise Mr Faulkner as being, like theUnited Kingdom Prime Minister and himself, the head of a sovereign,independent State or as possessing any authority to speak for thepeople of Northern Ireland.    It had, therefore, been left that theUnited Kingdom Government would announce their initiative for theconvening of the proposed conference under the Home Secretary^chairmanship and that he himself would keep Mr Lynch informed ofdevelopments by means of separate but parallel discussions, as wasconstitutionally correct.    He had emphasised to Mr Lynch that, Inmaking this offer, he was showing greater consideration for thepoint of view of the Government of the Republic than had beenconceded In this context by any previous British Government.After their meeting Mr Lynch had made a public statementdisparaging the United Kingdom Government&apos;s Initiative; and theSocial Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) in Northern Irelandhad announced that they would not participate in the proposedconference In present circumstances.    Mr Lynch had evidentlymisunderstood his proposal for a tripartite meeting; but he hadsubsequently indicated that he would consider the possibility. Itwould probably be desirable, therefore, to take steps to promotesuch a meeting in the near future.THE HOME SECRETARY said that, while the SDLP had initiallyrejected the proposal for discussions under his chairmanship, therewas some evidence that they might not maintain their Intransigentattitude, even though they were likely to continue to insist that therelease of those who had recently been detained as a preliminary tointernment was an essential condition of their co-operation.    He had2SECRET
SECRETbeen in touch with Mr Gerard Fitt, MP, the Leader of the SDLP,who appeared personally to be better disposed towards theconference than his colleagues in his Party.    The Northern IrelandLabour Party and the Northern Ireland Committee of the IrishCongress of Trades Unions had also expressed support for theinitiative.    The right course, therefore, was to carry thearrangements for the conference forward, even if all those whomwe should wish to contribute were not initially prepared toparticipate.    It was clearly necessary that the United KingdomGovernment should be seen to be prepared to consider anysuggestions which might be made for a solution of the problem ofminority participation in public affairs In Northern Ireland.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that he should invite Mr Lynch to a meeting, tobe attended also by Mr Faulkner, at as early a date as practicable.Meanwhile the Home Secretary would press forward witharrangements for the proposed conference under his chairmanship.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime MinisterTssumming up of their discussion.Cabinet Office SW19 September 19713SECRET
