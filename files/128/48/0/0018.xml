cabinet confidential annex cm(72) 36th Conclusions, Minute 3Thursday 13 July 1972 at 10. 30 am the SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND informed the Cabinet that the Orange marches on 12 July had passed quietly,mainly as the result of a very large deployment of military and police personnel.    Nevertheless, individual shooting incidents and explosions continued.    In general the situation, following theannouncement on 9 July by the &quot;Provisional&quot; wing of the irish republican Army (IRA) that they were terminating their &quot;ceasefire&quot;,remained uncertain.    Certain of the &quot;Provisional&quot; leaders wereattempting to fix upon the British Government and Army the principalresponsibility for the breakdown of the &quot;ceasefire&quot;; but he was not without hope that the more moderate leaders might prevail and thatthe &quot;truce&quot; might be resumed.    While violence continued, however,it would not be right to take any step which might be publiclyconstrued as a negotiation with terrorists.    It was also desirable to refrain from any action which might alienate Roman Catholicopinion or jeopardise the prospects of a renewed cessation of violence.    Nevertheless, the security forces could not remaincompletely passive in the face of terrorism;  and he was prepared,in consultation with the Secretary of State for Defence, to authorise a firm military response, on a selective basis, to flagrantprovocation such as the continued bombardment of observation posts.It remained to be seen whether this would suffice to convinceProtestant opinion, and in particular the Ulster Defence Association(UDA), of the Governments determination to put an end toterrorism by the IRA.    A considerable body of Protestant opinion,which favoured more drastic military measures designed to root outthe IRA completely, had little enthusiasm for a &quot;ceasefire&quot;;  and theUDA might seek to destroy any further &quot;truce&quot; which might besecured.    But it must be doubtful whether sterner military measures would succeed in completely eradicating the IRA, even if the cost interms of civilian casualties and alienation of the two communitieswere thought acceptable;  and the reaction of moderate roman catholic opinion would be the sharper to the extent that the UDAembarked upon violent action in ostensible support of the security forces.1!

In discussion it was suggested that the two communities in NorthernIreland might prove to be permanently and irretrievablyirreconcilable.    If the breakdown of the &quot;ceasefire&quot; provedirrevocable, we might therefore have to face a state of armedrebellion in Ulster, backed by at least the acquiescence of aconsiderable section of the population.    We might then have to choose between launching military operations on a very formidablescale indeed and embarking on a fundamental reconsideration of our responsibilities towards Northern Ireland.    One hypotheticalsolution, which might on examination prove to be within the scopeof the pledges which successive British Governments had given tothe majority of the people of Northern Ireland, might be theestablishment of an independent State within the Commonwealth.On the other hand the implications of a change in the nature of our responsibilities towards the Six Counties or of a decision to launchmore intensive military operations were so serious as to underlinethe desirability of continuing to seek a reduction of tension as a prelude to a political solution which would permit the two communities to live together within the United Kingdom,    A wide range of possible solutions, including such extreme measures asa redistribution of populations, might require to be examined forthis purpose.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that we should continue to pursue a policy of politicaland military restraint, tempered by a firm military response toflagrant provocation, in the hope of securing a renewed cessation of violence and an opportunity for the resumption of politicaldiscussions.    If the breakdown of the &quot;ceasefire&quot; should prove tobe irrevocable, however, the Cabinet might need to consider thepossible courses of action open to us on the basis of an alternativeconcept of policy.    In consultation with the Ministers most directly concerned, he had set in train an examination of the practical implications of a number of contingencies in this context.Meanwhile, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland shouldcontinue to keep the Cabinet informed of the course of developments.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for Northern Ireland and theSecretary of State for Defence to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office14 July 19722
