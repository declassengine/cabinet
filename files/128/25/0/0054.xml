^Irliament.Business in house ofCommons.1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in thethe House of Commons in the following week.It was intended to continue with the Committee stage of theTransport Bill on 15th and 17th December and to conclude it on18th December. A debate on Kenya would take place on16th December. In the present temper of the House it would bedifficult to find time for a debate on the Order introducing theD Scheme for furniture without accepting an all-night sitting on16th-17th December or deferring the Adjournment until 10 p.m.on 19th December, or until 20th December.After discussion the Cabinet agreed that, if the Opposition would undertake not to obstruct other Government business during theweek, the debate on the D Scheme for furniture might be deferred until after the Christmas recess. If, however, no such undertakingcould be secured, the Opposition should be offered the choice of a debate on furniture on 19th December and the Christmas adjourn-ment on 20th December, or a debate on the D Scheme for furnitureuntil 4 p.m., 19th December, followed by the debate on the Adjourn-ment until 10 p.m.The Cabinet agreed that the Colonial Secretary and the Ministerof Housing should be the Government spokesmen in the debate onKenya on 16th December.United Statesand CanadianLoans.(previous reference :C.C. (51) .15thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (52) 433) recommending that pay-ments should be made to the United States and Canada for the fullservice of their loans on 31st December, 1952.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that a request for the waiver might well prejudice the approach which we should be makingto the new United States Administration, following the Common-wealth Economic Conference, on the scheme for a return to a multi-lateral trade and payments system. In any event we could not satisfy the third condition for claiming the waiver of interest, namely, that,if payments due to the United States and Canada were reduced,releases or payments from sterling balances accumulated by otherGovernments should be reduced in the same proportion. He there-fore proposed that the interest on both loans should be paid in full,but that we should at the same time give notice informally of our intention to ask at a later date for a revision of the Loan Agreement.He would circulate his detailed proposals to the Cabinet and would include in them a suggestion that, if any new arrangements were made,they should be retrospective so that the payment now being made would be refunded. The formal approach to the United States shouldbe made at the same time as our approach on the general economicsituation.The Cabinet agreed that the waiver should not be claimed, butthey felt that it would be a mistake to make any public announcementat the time of repayment to the effect that we regarded ourselves as fully entitled to the waiver but had been prevented from claiming it by an unreasonable condition in the Agreement. Our position wouldbe much stronger in wider negotiations with the United States if thepayments were made without public excuse or comment.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the payments due to the United States and, Canada for the full service of the loans on 31st December,1952, should be made.(2) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would give notice informally of our intention to ask at a later date forthe revision of the Agreement; and would circulate to theCabinet in due course his proposals for a formal approach to the new United States Administration on this matter.
Armed Forces.Revision of widows&apos;pensions scheme forthe Forces.Officers&apos;Retired Pay.(previous reference:CC. (52) 98thConclusions,Minute 2.)3.   The Cabinet had before them two memoranda by tli^Minister of Defence (C. (52) 437 and 438) on Officers&apos; Retired pay and the revision of the Widows&apos; Pensions Scheme for the Forces.The Minister of Defence said that the Chancellor of theExchequer had now agreed that the widows&apos; pensions scheme for theForces should be revised on the lines suggested in C. (52) 410. Hehad, however, asked for a firm assurance that any request for retro-spection in respect of retired pay for officers and other ranks who had left the Services before 1st September, 1950, should continue to be resisted. Although he was anxious to give the Chancellor of theExchequer this assurance, the Cabinet should be aware that considerable pressure had developed in both Houses of Parliament for improvements in retired pay of officers in this category. There would shortly be a debate on this question in the House of Commons, andthe Cabinet would wish to consider the line which the government spokesman should take on that occasion.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that any concession on thiswould lead to strong pressure for similar concessions to otherpensioners. He was most anxious therefore that the language of theGovernment spokesman in this debate should not give the impression that the Government were likely to give way. He would, however,be very willing to consider with the Minister of Defence and the three service Ministers whether anything could be done to improve theposition of these retired officers without making it necessary to grantsimilar concessions to other classes.The Prime Minister said that the announcement of the revisionof the widows&apos; pensions*scheme for the Forces would make a favour-able impression. As regards officers&apos; retired pay, the line might betaken in the debate on the Adjournment that the question raised the gravest issues for all classes of the community and was too compli-cated to allow any easy or immediate solution. The matter was,however, being considered by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, theMinister of Defence and the Service Ministers.The Cabinet (1) Approved the revision of the widows&apos; pensions scheme forthe Forces on the lines suggested in the paper by theMinister of Defence (C. (52) 410) and confirmed in thepaper now before the Cabinet (C. (52) 438); and authorised the Minister of Defence to arrange for this decision to be announced in Parliament the following week.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence to agree with the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Service Ministers the terms ofthe reply to be made on behalf of the Government to theforthcoming debate in the House of Commons on theretired pay of officers whose service had ended before 1st September, 1950.(3) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would discuss with the Minister of Defence and the service ministers the possibility of making some improvement inthe retired pay of these officers.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,12th December, 1952.
