Trieste. 1.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Foreign(Previous Secretary (C. (52) 147) reporting the progress of the discussions which reference: British and American officials had been holding with the Italians aboutC.C. (52) 33rd a possible modification of the administrative arrangements in ZoneConclusions, A of Trieste. Annexed to this was the draft of a Memorandum of minute 5.) Understanding between the three Governments and a draft of a public announcement.The Foreign Secretary said that he was satisfied that this memo -randum represented the best arrangement that could be secured atthe present time. On reflection he felt that paragraph 8 of the draftover-emphasised the importance of the Italian Political Adviser, andhe proposed that it should be amended to read as follows: &quot; an italian Political Adviser to the Zone Commander will be appointedby the Italian Government to represent it in all matters affecting italy in regard to the Zone. The Italian Political Adviser wil have a statussimilar to that of the United Kingdom and United States PoliticalAdvisers.&quot;The Cabinet Approved the draft Memorandum of Understanding and thedraft communique annexed to C. (52) 147, subject to theamendment proposed by the Foreign Secretary; and took note that the Foreign Secretary would authorise the conclu-sion and announcement of an agreement in these terms.Korea. 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that the previous Government(Previous        had reached an understanding with the United States government reference:      that, if a substantial air attack on United Nations forces in KoreaC.C. (52) 47th   were launched from airfields in China, the United Nations Comman-Conclusions,     der might be authorised to launch retaliatory air attacks against thoseMinute 4.)       airfields.   The United Kingdom Government were to be consulted,if time allowed, before this authority was given; but they would beexpected to reply with the least possible delay. The Foreign Secretarytherefore suggested that the Cabinet might authorise the PrimeMinister to decide, in consultation with the Minister of Defence and himself, what reply should be returned to any American request forour support in authorising such retaliatory bombing.The Cabinet- Agreed that, if time did not permit of reference to theCabinet, the Prime Minister should decide on their behalf,after consultation with the Foreign Secretary and theMinister of Defence, what reply should be returned to anyrequest from the United States Government for the con-currence of the United Kingdom Government in a proposalto authorise the United Nations Commander in Korea to launch a retaliatory air attack against airfields in China whichhad been used as bases for any substantial air attack uponUnited Nations Forces in Korea.East-West 3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign trade. Secretary and the President of the Board of Trade (C. (52) 138)Exports of reporting the results of a comprehensive review, which had been made,Rubber to in consultation with the other Ministers concerned, of the export ofRussia and the rubber to the Soviet bloc, China and North Korea.Soviet The President of the Board of Trade said that detailed reeom-Satellites. mendations based on this review were set out in paragraph 24 of C.(Previous (52) 138.   The most important of these was that the issue of licencesReference: for exports of rubber to Russia should be restricted in the second halfC.C.(52)3lst of 1952 to 34,000 tons, of which not more than 20,000 tons would conclusions, be licensed in the third quarter; while licences for the Satellites for the minute 2.) year 1952 should be reduced to 25,000 tons.   The effect would be that
exports to Russia would be limited to 80,000 tons in 1952, thougllthe Russians would be allowed to import the additional 18,000 tons which had been licensed but not shipped in .195.1. There had been an informal exchange of views of this matter between American andBritish officials, and it seemed likely that the United States Govern-ment would acquiesce in the proposals now before the Cabinet,though there could be no certainty that there would not be some criticism in Congress and in the American Press. On the other hand,all the United Kingdom Ministers concerned were satisfied that weshould be unlikely to obtain our essential imports from Russia unless we allowed them to buy rubber to the extent proposed. The president said that he would consult with the Foreign Secretary on the best method of conveying to the United States Government the decisions which the Cabinet reached.The Colonial Secretary asked that a final decision to reducerubber exports to the Soviet Satellites, as proposed in C. (52) 138,should be deferred for the time being, or at least that precautionsshould be taken to ensure that if taken now it should not be made known. It would be likely to depress rubber prices still further, with serious effects on the economic and political situation in Malaya.The Commonwealth Secretary said that he hoped that theinterests of Ceylon as a rubber producer would be borne in mind. Hewould like to discuss with the President of the Board of Trade thequestions raised in paragraphs 7 and 18 of C. (52) 138.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that in any discussions with Soviet representativesnothing should be said at the present stage regarding theproposal that rubber exports to the Satellites should be restricted in 1952 to a total of 25,000 tons.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1) above, approved the proposals made in C. (52) 138 relating to the control of exports of rubber to the Soviet bloc, China and North Korea.4. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.On 14th May there would be a debate on Foreign Affairs, and on15th May a debate on Food and Agriculture.The Commonwealth Secretary said that a motion on transport policy had already been tabled for discussion in the House of lords on 14th May, and the proposals in the Government^ White paper would inevitably be discussed in that debate. The Cabinet werecontent that the White Paper should be discussed in the Lords before it had been debated in the Commons.5. The Cabinet was informed that on 16th May there wouldbe a debate in the House of Commons on a Private Member&apos;s motionproposing the early introduction of equal pay for men and women inthe public service. They agreed that the Government spokesman inthis debate should in the main follow the line which had been taken on this subject in the Conservative Party&apos;s election manifesto. TheChancellor of the Exchequer said, however, that he was examininga possible concession which had been suggested to him by a GOvern-ment supporter; and he would report on this to the Cabinet in thefollowing week if he found that it was worthy of their consideration.
6. In continuation of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on the previous day, The Prime Minister made certain provisional suggestions for atime-table under which the Transport Bill might be passed in thecurrent session. These involved a summer recess lasting from about7th August to 13th October; autumn sittings extending to 18thDecember; Commons&apos; consideration of Lords&apos; amendments to theBill at the end of January and beginning of February 1953; pro-rogation on 5th February; and the opening of a new session on10th February. Additional time might be provided for discussionof the Bill in the House of Lords if the Lords reassembled after christmas a week or so earlier than the House of Commons, whichmight meet on 17th January.The Lord Privy Seal said that he would be glad to consider these suggestions in the light of the Cabinefs conclusion of 7th May, andhe would in particular consider whether the House of commons would be able to complete essential business before Easter, 1953, ifthe new session opened as late as 10th February.7. The Prime Minister asked the Minister of Agriculturewhether, in view of the public disquiet which it had caused and theheavy loss of valuable animals, the slaughter policy for controllingfoot and mouth disease should continue unchanged.The Minister of Agriculture said that some public misunder-standing and apprehension had been created by the need for tem-porary control of cattle movements over areas very much wider thanthose in which there had been actual outbreaks of the disease. But hewas satisfied of the need both for this control and for the slaughterpolicy. Compared with many continental countries we were in a very favourable position. Since last November there had been only 257outbreaks of the disease in this country, against 155,000 in western germany in 1951 and 20,000 in France in the first quarter of 1952. Inspite of some increase in the occurrence of the disease in the UnitedKingdom in recent months, its incidence remained relatively rare; and since mid-November only about 2.000 tons of meat had been lost through it. If the slaughter policy were abandoned and the incidence of the disease increased substantially in consequence, the resulting lossof milk and meat might be far greater than that arising from&apos; pre-preventive slaughter. He proposed to explain the policy on these lines tothe House of Commons later in the day.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that further consideration might have to be given to the demand, which was. widely made inScotland, for power to close the border against cattle movements when there were outbreaks of the disease in England. Although he recog-nised that expert opinion was opposed to such a separate control,Scotland was an important breeder of cattle for export and theconfidence of her customers might be enhanced by this additionalmeasure.The Cabinet-Endorsed the present policy of the Minister of agriculture for the control of foot-and-mouth disease; and invited himto explain the case for that policy in a parliamentary statement.8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Labour (C. (52) 146) seeking authority to discuss with the TradesUnion Congress certain problems relating to supplementary pensions.The Minister of Labour said that the Ministers concerned could not longer withhold approval of certain schemes of occupational pensions which had been prepared for salaried staffs in the gas

9. The Prime Minister said that the Secretary of the transport and General Workers&apos; Union had represented to him that some further concession should be made in order to terminate the wagedispute in the Malta dockyards. He understood that the colonial secretary, the Minister of Labour and the First Lord of the admiralty were all agreed that the proper course was to give immediate effectto the offer already made and to offer no further concession at thepresent stage.The Minister of Labour said that he was satisfied that this was thewisest course, and he had advised the Prime Minister to reply accord-ingly to the Secretary of the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union.This did not exclude the possibility of reviewing the situation later on if the workers could not be induced to accept the present offer.The &quot;Cabinet Took note that no further concession would be offered atpresent in the wage dispute in the Malta dockyards, and thatthe Prime Minister would reply accordingly to the letter which he had received from the Secretary of the transport and General Workers&apos; Union.10. The Cabinet discussed the decision of the amalgamated engineering Union to put forward a claim for a wage increase of  2 aweek for all men in the shipbuilding and engineering industries.In discussion it was pointed out that this claim was being putforward against the advice of the Executive of the Union, and it wasto be hoped that it would not succeed. Steps were being taken toencourage the employers&apos; representatives to resist it. The Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Minister of Labour were also proposing totake an early opportunity of impressing upon representatives of bothsides of industry the need for continuing restraint of wage increasesgenerally. It would be impracticable to prevent claims for wage increases from being put forward, and for some categories of workersindustry and on the railways. Unless, however, it was properly pre^sented, approval of these schemes might stimulate demands for furtheroccupational pensions, especially for industrial workers, both in the nationalised industries and elsewhere. The previous Government,because of the risk of widespread extension of pension schemes insupplementation of national old age pensions, had proposed anindependent enquiry into the question of supplementary pensionsgenerally. This proposal had incurred the hostility of the TradesUnion Congress. But there seemed to be good prospects of obtainingtheir co-operation in a wider enquiry (which would include the lesserone) into the long-term social and economic aspects of the develop-ment of schemes to provide for the aged, with particular reference to schemes, both public and private, for retirement and old-age pensions.The Minister therefore wished to inform&apos;the Trades Union Congress,before the Ministers concerned approved the railway and gas industryschemes to which he had referred, that those schemes were solelydesigned to remove anomalies and to bring the position of the staffsconcerned into line with that of staffs of the other nationalised industries/ When he did so he would like, in reply to enquiries aboutthe attitude of the present Government towards the previous Govern-menfs proposals for an enquiry into supplementary pensions, to soundthem on the possibility of the wider enquiry which he had in mind.The Cabinet-Authorised the Minister of Labour to consult the TradesUnion Congress on the lines proposed in C. (52) 146.
industrial disputes.The NewspaperIndustry.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 50thConclusions,Minute 7.)increases could be justified; but everything possible should be done toprevent Trade Unions from putting forward extravagant claims suchas that which was now to be made by the engineers.The Cabinet Took note of the position.11. The Minister of Labour said that he had consulted bothD. C. Thomson &amp; Co., Ltd. and the trade unions on the possibilityoi his appointing a Court of Enquiry into the dispute which he had reported to the Cabinet on the previous day. Neither party wishedto see such a Court appointed, mainly because there were no very good prospects that the firm would accept its findings. He mightnevertneless decide to make such an appointment, especially if the firm attempted (as he believed they might) to embark on litigation.For the time being he was concentrating his efforts on preventing the dispute from spreading and was in touch with both employersand unions. The main risk arose in relation to the Press Association,whose men might strike if the Association continued to supply newsto D. C. Thomson &amp; Co., Ltd.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour.Aviation Spirit. 12. The Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, fuel and Power said that a world shortage of aviation spirit was likely todevelop as a result of a strike in oil refineries in the United States.The United States Government had decided to reduce all civil con-sumption of aviation spirit by 30 per cent., and they looked to us totake corresponding action. An embargo had been placed on exportsof aviation spirit from the United States; and, unless we wereprepared to take the risk of making serious inroads into our stocks,some reduction of our current consumption was inevitable. If there-fore we introduced at once restrictions corresponding to those whichwere being imposed in the United States, we should lose nothing inpractice and should gain in prestige by emphasising in this way theextent of Anglo-American co-operation in the control of world oil supplies. The loss of traffic by British airlines would be no greaterthan that of the American airlines; and, although they might bothlose some traffic to other lines which maintained their full services during this period, this would be offset by the advantage of continuingAnglo-American co-operation. It was therefore proposed that theMinister of Fuel and Power should at once make an Order restrictingcivil consumption of aviation spirit in the four weeks beginning onMonday, 12th May, to a figure not exceeding 65 per cent, of theamount consumed in the month of April.The Prime Minister said that this situation should not be allowedto result in any encroachment on Service stocks of aviation spirit.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Fuel and Power to make animmediate Order requiring civil consumers of aviation spiritto restrict their consumption in the four weeks beginning onMonday, 12th May, to an amount not exceeding 65 per cent,of their consumption in April 1952.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1.8th May, 1952.
