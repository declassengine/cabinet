Iron and steel bill.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 53rdConclusions,Minute 5.)1. The Minister of Supply said that, in view of the unauthorisedreports which had appeared in the press he would like to announce,in reply to an arranged Question, that the Government intended to publish in the near future a White Paper describing their proposalsfor restoring the iron and steel industry to private ownership.The Prime Minister said that he would wish to see a draft ofthe White Paper before such an announcement was made, and he asked the Minister of Supply to send him the latest draft.Durham CountyCouncil.Conditions ofEmployment.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 55thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Minister of Labour said that the majority of the Durhamteachers had given notice of their intention to resign as a protest against the attempt of the County Council to compel them to joina trades union or a professional association; and the County council had now formally brought the matter to his notice under the industrial disputes Order. With the concurrence of the Minister of Educationhe proposed in the first instance to invite the Council to define more precisely the matters in dispute between them and the teachers. this might lead them to describe their differences in terms which made itclear that they did not constitute a dispute within the meaning ofthe Order. Alternatively, it might open the way for discussions inwhich the Council could retreat from the position which they hadtaken up.The Cabinet took note with approval of the course which theMinister of Labour was proposing to follow.Meetings of 3.   The Prime Minister said that he had tp answer that afternoonCommonwealth a Question by Dr. Reginald Bennett, M-P-* asking whether a generalMinisters. Commonwealth Conference should not be held at the time of the coronation in 1953. As his colleagues would know, he had alreadyproposed to other Commonwealth Prime Ministers that they should hold an informal meeting at that time; but he had not yet receivedreplies from all of them. For the present, therefore, he proposed tosay merely that these matters were being attentively considered.The President of the Board of Trade said that he had also to answer that afternoon a Question by Mr. Thomas Brown, M.P.,suggesting an early Commonwealth meeting on questions of economic policy. The Cabinet agreed that the reply to this Question mighthold out the hope that such a meeting would be held as soon aspracticable, and that in the meantime Commonwealth governments would continue to keep in close consultation on all economic mattersof common concern.Employment.Textile andClothingIndustries.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 38thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Presi-dent of the Board of Trade (C. (52) 182) reporting (i) that, owingmainly to falling prices, the additional defence orders which wereto be placed with the object pf relieving unemployment in the textileareas would now cpst only about  16-5 million, compared with the 20 to  25 million promised; and (ii) that the share for NorthernIreland was unlikely to exceed  1 - 9 million. The President therefore proposed that additional orders should be placed to the value of some 6 - 5 million, of which  1-5 million would be for hosiery and  5 million for cotton and woollen goods not covered by the  4,700 millionrearmament programme; &quot;and that union cloth should be substitutedfor cotton in appropriate specifications with the object of increasingNorthern Irelahd&apos;s total share of the orders to  3-4 million.
The following aspects of the problem were covered in the cabinet&apos;s discussion:  (a) Total Scale of Orders to be placed the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in his view orderstotalling  20 million at present prices, which would be equivalentto between  25 and  27 million at the prices ruling in April, would suffice to implement the Governments undertaking. He thought thatthe figure of  20 million could most suitably be made up by adding to the programme  l-  millions&apos; worth of hosiery and  2 millions&apos;worth of cotton and woollen goods.As against this it was pointed out that the Government under-taking had mentioned  25 million as the upper limit, and that if theorders were restricted to the lower limit of  20 million the programmemight well be criticised as inadequate, particularly by those Govern-ment supporters who had urged the more drastic remedy of abolishing the purchase tax on textiles.(b) Northern IrelandUnemployment in Northern Ireland had reached serious levels,and special measures should be taken to alleviate it. While unemploy-ment in Great Britain as a whole was 2-2 per cent, and in the textileareas about 4-8 per cent., the corresponding figures for NorthernIreland were 10 per cent, and 22-8 per cent.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, even so, he couldnot regard it as businesslike to spend an additional  300,000 on unioncloth, for purposes for which cotton would suffice, and thereby involvethe Ministry of Health in a supplementary estimate.The Minister of Supply suggested that additional orders forcanvas goods might offer an alternative means of helping NorthernIreland without incurring avoidable extra expenditure. This wouldnot give immediate relief, since it was in the linen industry that unemployment was most severe, but it should be possible to includeat least some orders for canvas in the Northern Ireland share.(c) ScotlandConcessions to Northern Ireland inevitably stimulated pressure by Scottish interests for a share in the orders. It was true that theunemployment figure for Scotland (3-3 per cent.) was little worse than the figure for Great Britain as a whole, but some linen firms in Scotland were threatening to close.down or to introduce short-time working.It was agreed that it should be possible to place some orders, forexample, for canvas, in Scotland.(d) Coronation UniformThe Secretary of State for War mentioned a proposal to issueblue No. 1 dress to Army formations taking part in the Coronationcelebrations at a cost of about  600,000. These uniforms, whichwould comprise both wool and cotton, would later be re-issued more widely to units of the Regular Army for ceremonial and walking-outdress. &apos;It was agreed that, subject to more detailed examination as partof the current review of the general scale of expenditure on the coronation, this proposal might be.found suitable to form part ofthe proposal additional programme of textile orders.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thepreponderant view in the Cabinet clearly favoured the general approach to this problem outlined in C. (52) 182, though there mightbe room for adjustment of the details. The Chancellor of theExchequer said that he regretted that the Cabinet should think it
149CC. 58 (52)necessary to go beyond an expenditure of  20 million and to authorisethe purchase of the more expensive union cloth in substitution forcotton.The Cabinet-(1) Approved in principle the proposals put forward in C. (52)182.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in consultationwith other Ministers concerned, to consider the detailedquestions of allocation involved, including the nature ofthe orders to be placed in Northern Ireland; the amountof hosiery orders to be placed; and the proportions ofwoollen and cotton goods to be ordered.In the course of the discussion The Prime Minister said that,apart from special measures to meet the situation in the textile industries, the Government should make plans well ahead againstthe possibility of more widespread unemployment as a result of a trade recession. Early consideration should be given to the measureswhich might be taken to avert such unemployment, including suchpublic works projects as the reclamation of marginal land, highwaydevelopment and the construction of a Severn barrage. This problem should be examined by a small Committee of Ministers, who should put constructive proposals before the Cabinet.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that a certain measure of short-term unemployment was an inevitable accomplishment of thetransfer of workers to the armament and export industries, and carewould have to be taken to ensure that any public works projects,some of which would in any case involve the use of materials badly needed for rearmament and export purposes, did not delay these movements of labour.The Cabinet  -(3) Invited the Prime Minister to appoint a small ministerial committee, under the Chairmanship of the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster, to formulate and submit tothe Cabinet plans for checking any tendency towardswidespread unemployment.5. The Chancellor of the Exchequer made a brief report to theCabinet on the meeting of the Council of the Organisation for european Economic Co-operation which he had attended during thepreceding week.The Foreign Secretary had been unanimously elected Chairmanof the Council; and this would be a valuable help in enabling theUnited Kingdom to regain their position of economic leadership inEurope.The Council had devised, with some difficulty, a satisfactorymeans of dealing with the excessive credits which Belgium hadaccumulated under the European Payments Union. The Belgianshad undertaken to accept military equipment from us, in lieu of goldpayments, to the value of $25 or $30 million, spread over two years.Further analysis had now been made of the reasons for the continuing adverse trade balance between the sterling area and europe. Although importers had to some extent evaded the restric-tions on food imports into the United Kingdom, by switching fromone type of food-stuff to another, it was clear that the main reasonfor the continuing adverse balance was the failure of other sterling area countries to impose adequate restrictions on imports from europe. Further representations would have to be made to thosecountries.
In the last few weeks there had been no further drain on thevgeneral reserves of the sterling area,The Cabinet Took note of this statement.Road and rail transport.Passenger Fares.(previous reference:C.G. (52) 47thConclusions,Minute 7.). 6. The Minister of Transport said that in pursuance of the cabinet&apos;s decision of 29th April he had discussed with the british transport Commission means of avoiding disproportionate increases in the fares for special classes of passenger both inside and outsidethe London area. He circulated to the Cabinet a schedule showingthe proposals which had been put to the Commission for abating the increases originally proposed. The total cost of these concessionswas estimated at  1,902,000. The Commission had now acceptedall these proposals save those relating to season tickets arid shiftworkers&apos; fares. For season tickets, both inside and outside London,the Minister had proposed an increase proportionate to that of ordinary fares; the Commission had opposed this, on grounds bothof principle and of administrative convenience, and had suggestedinstead a percentage increase not exceeding 25 per cent. The Corn-mission also wished to withdraw entirely the special concessions toshift workers, which the Minister had asked them to retain.The Minister of Transport said that he proposed to press theCommission to withdraw their opposition on these two points and toaccept his proposals in full. He would like to have the support of theCabinet in bringing this further pressure to bear on the Commission.He hoped that he might be able to secure their agreement withoutissuing formal directions to them indeed, it was doubtful whether hehad power to give them directions on such particular points as these.The Cabinet Expressed their gratification at the large measure of agree-ment which had already been reached in the discussions withthe British Transport Commission; and invited the Ministerof Transport to press the Commission to withdraw their opposition on the two points outstanding and to accept infull the proposals which he had made to them.british broadcasting corporation.Renewal ofthe Charter.(previous reference erencp:C-C (52) 57thConclusions,Minute 2.)7. The Postmaster-General said that, when the existing charter of the British Broadcasting Corporation expired on 30th June, a new board of Governors would have to be appointed. As so little timenow remained before the Charter expired he had, with the PrimeMinister^ authority, asked the existing members of the Board whetherthey would be willing to carry on for not more than two months untilthe arrangements for the appointment of the new Board had beencompleted. They had all indicated that, if asked, they would be readyto do this. It was, however, desirable that the new Board should beappointed befpre Parliament adjourned for the summer, recess; andhe was proposing to submit his recommendations to the PrimeMinister within the next few days.It would be left to the new Board to appoint a Director-general in place of Sir William Haley, who had been appointed editor ofThe Times; but there was no special urgency about this since sir william Haley would not be taking up his new appointment until october.The Cabinet-CD Agreed  that  the Postmaster-General should invite themembers of the existing Board of Governors of the british broadcasting Corporation to remain in office for not morethan two months after the expiration of the existing
Charter until a new Board could be appointed; and agreedthat his intention to make this arrangement should be announced in the forthcoming debate\in the House ofCommons on the White Paper on Broadcasting.The Home Secretary recalled that at their meeting on 29tb may the Cabinet had agreed that the proposal in paragraph 18 of the white paper on Broadcasting (viz., that Governors of the Corporation should in future be appointed and removable by a Committee presided overby the Speaker of the House of Commons) should be withdrawn if itwere strongly opposed in the course of the forthcoming debate in the commons: In that event was it intended that the Assistant Post-master-general  should state, in replying to the debate, that theGovernment would not proceed with that particular proposal? or should he say merely that the Government would reconsider it in thelight of the criticisms expressed in the debate?In discussion it was pointed out that this proposal had formed part of the agreement reached with those Government supporters whofavoured the principle of sponsored programmes; and that, if theGovernment withdrew that proposal at the conclusion of the debate,some of those Members might be unwilling to vote in favour of theWhite Paper. From this point of view it would be preferable that theGovernment spokesmen should state merely that this proposal wouldbe reconsidered. On the Other hand, it was likely that the opposition would table a forrhai amendment including specific reference to thisparticular proposal; and the amendment might be so drawn that theGovernment could not avoid asking their supporters to vote against it.It would be difficult for the Government thereafter to withdraw aproposal which had, by implication, been approved by a majority ofthe House of Commons.The Cabinet agreed that their tactics for handling this situation could hot be finally determined until the terms of the Oppositionamendment were known.The Cabinet-(2) Invited the Prime Minister to consult with the ministers principally concerned, later in the day when the terms ofthe Opposition amendment Were known, on the line to betaken by the Government spokesman in the forthcoming debate in the House of Commons oh the proposal in para-gf aph 18 of the White Paper on Broadcasting.8. The Foreign Secretary said that the agreements relating to thecontractual settlement with the German Federal Republic would bepublished that afternoon. The Cabinet agreed that, in the statement which he would be making in the House of Commons that afternoon, sthe Foreign Secretary should indicate that Parliament would have anopportunity of discussing these agreements during the next few weeks,before ratification, and that a two-day debate would be held for thatpurpose in the Commons. It was proposed that this debate should beheld on 30th June and 1st July, but the dates had yet to be discussedthrough the usual channels.The Foreign Secretary said that, in consequence of the settle-ment, some minor legislation would be required in order to conferimmunity on members of certain judicial bodies in Western Germany.He would prefer that these provisions should not form the subject of aseparate Bill, and he was exploring the possibility of embodying themin the Enemy Property Bill which was being promoted by the Boardof Trade.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statements.Germany.ContractualSettlement.(previous reference:C.C.

The Commonwealth Secretary made a brief report on the protectorate. recent disturbances in the Bamangwato Reserve, in the course of whichChieftainship three African policemen had been killed. The ringleaders in theseof the disturbances had now been arrested and removed to the south of the bamangwato Reserve; and proceedings would be taken against them in due course.Tribe. He proposed to make a factual statement about this in the House of(Previous        Lords that afternoon. In this he would make it clear that only a veryReference-      small minority of the tribe had taken part in these disturbances, thatCC (52) 54th   *aw aru* order must be preserved and that those guilty of incitementConclusions     to disorder and violence would be suitably punished.  He intendedMinute 7)       t0 reJect&apos; any proposal for a formal enquiry into these events:   thefacts had already been clearly established, and the holding of an enquiry would serve no purpose but to provide a further opportunityfor Seretse and his followers to air their grievances.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Commonwealth Secretary.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,10th June, 1952.9. The Foreign Secretary said that the United States authorities^were proposing that twenty of their largest strategic bombers should come to this country from Spain on 18th June on a three-day train-ing mission, primarily for the purpose of testing the facilities whichwould be available to them in war at airfields in East Anglia. Hehad thought it right to mention this proposal to the Cabinet, sincethe arrival of this comparatively large force would attract public attention and provoke speculation about the use which would bemade of these base facilities in war.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that it might also beintended that these bombers should undertake test flights overWestern Europe from this country. There was some risk that this mission might give rise to alarm in this country and might be regardedas provocative by a potential enemy. If it were in fact necessary forbombers of this type to be flown to this country to test the facilities available at the airfields in East Anglia, it should suffice for one ortwo aircraft to come here for that purpose: it seemed quite unneces-sary to send as many as twenty aircraft simultaneously.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Air, to consider what representationscould be made to the United States Government with a viewto persuading them to cancel this projected flight by UnitedStates.strategic bombers to the United Kingdom, or at least to reduce the numbers which were to take part in it.
