parliament the Queen&apos;s 1.   The Cabinet had before them a Note by the Chancellor of the speech on the Exchequer (C. (52) 339) covering a draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech on prorogation of  the Prorogation of Parliament.In discussion of the draft various amendments were suggested and adopted.The Cabinet Approved the draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Proro-gation of Parliament annexed to C. (52) 339, subject to the amendments agreed upon in their discussion.The Queen&apos;sSpeech on theOpening ofParliament.(previous reference:C.C. (52) S7thConclusions,Minute 6.)(previous reference:C.C. (52) 87thConclusions,Minute 2.)(previous reference:C.C. (52) 84thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Cabinet had before them a Note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C. (52) 340) covering a draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech onthe Opening of Parliament.In discussion of the draft various amendments were suggested and adopted.The following points were also made:  Electricity in Scotland (Paragraph 21)The Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and power said that, although the Ministers concerned agreed in principle on the need for changing the existing arrangements for the supply ofelectricity in Scotland, much detailed discussion would be required before a Bill could be presented in Parliament. In these circum-stances it might be prudent to make paragraph 21 of the draft Speechrather more guarded.The Cabinet agreed that this paragraph should be reworded asfollows:  &quot; The question of the supply of electricity in Scotland isbeing attentively examined with a view to legislation.&quot;Preservation of Historic Buildings (Paragraph 25)It was agreed that no specific reference should be made in the speech to the proposal of the Minister of Works, approved by theCabinet at their meeting on 21st October, to promote legislationenabling grants to be made towards the preservation of historicbuildings.Judges&apos; SalariesIt was agreed that no specific reference should be made in the speech to prospective legislation to implement the Cabinefs decisionon 21st October to improve the remuneration of the Judges.Leasehold reform the Home Secretary suggested that it would be of advantage ifthe Government gave some indication of their intentions in regardto leasehold property. The Secretary of State for Scotland endorsedthis suggestion.The Cabinet agreed that the following paragraph should beadded to the draft Speech:  &quot; My Ministers will propose a short extension of the existingtemporary Acts abovit leasehold property in England and wales and in Scotland and will seek an opportunity of making knowntheir permanent policy.&quot;
(previous reference:CC. (52) 49thConclusions,Minute 5.)House of Lords reform the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that he had beenasked by the Commonwealth Secretary to suggest that the Speechmight include some reference to possible reform of the House ofLords, since otherwise the Government might feel precluded from taking any initiative on this question during the forthcoming session.After discussion the Cabinet decided that the prospects of findingany basis of agreement with the Opposition on this question were soslender that it would be unwise to arouse expectations by referring to it in The Queen&apos;s Speech. This need not, however, preclude theGovernment from taking whatever steps might prove practicable asthe session proceeded.The Cabinet Approved the draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Openingof Parliament in the form annexed to C. (52) 340, subject,tothe amendments agreed upon in their discussion.Road and rail transport.Draft transport bill.(previous reference:CC (52) 84thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Secretaryof State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Power (C. (52) 346and 352) summarising the results of the discussions which had takenplace in the Transport Policy Committee since the Cabinet had last considered whether the Transport Bill should include provisions for alevy on road transport to compensate the railways for future losses of net revenue due to future transfers of traffic from rail to road.These showed that opinion in the Committee was divided. Themajority favoured the compromise plan evolved during the cabinets discussion on 7th October, by which the second part of the levy wouldnot be brought into operation unless the financial situation of therailways justified it and affirmative resolutions approving its intro-duction had been passed by both Houses of Parliament. Othermembers of the Committee favoured a wholly new scheme under whichthe proposals to force the sale of the assets of the Road haulage executive would be abandoned, the 25-mile limit on &quot; C &quot; licenceswould at once be removed, the British Transport Commission wouldbe given discretion to operate their road haulage undertaking in competition with private hauliers, and both parts of the levy on road transport would be abandoned. The Cabinet also had before them amemorandum by the Minister of Transport (C. (52) 355) setting outthe main arguments for and against this alternative policy, which he favoured.The Minister of Transport explained the advantages which he saw in adopting his alternative scheme. He attached very greatimportance to the plan for allowing the railways a greater degree of freedom in varying their charges, and he feared that industry would withdraw their support for this unless the second part of the proposedlevy on road transport were abandoned altogether. The levy hadin any event very few supporters, and it seemed most unlikely thatthe House of Commons could be persuaded to accept it. The imme-diate removal of the 25-mile limit on &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B &quot; licences wouldredeem the pledge given by the Conservative Party during the election and would be warmly welcomed by Government supporters. TheRoad Haulage Executive would be free to sell its assets, if it so desired; but the Government would escape the hazards of conductinga forced sale in a difficult market. He had been increasinglyimpressed by the difficulties of ensuring a successful auction of these assets, and by the risks which the Government would run in attempting this auction with such poor prospects of success. under his scheme the Government would be able to escape this danger, toabandon those parts of the original plan which were most unpopular with their supporters, to fulfil their election pledges and to give both43319-1b 2
private enterprise and the nationalised undertaking an opportunityto run these services at a profit. Finally, the Socialist Party would find it more difficult either to criticise this scheme or, if they were returned to office, to reverse it.-In discussion the main argument advanced in favour of the new scheme was the risk that, under the original plan, the Governmentwould find it difficult to sell any large proportion of the assets of theRoad Haulage Executive. Many potential purchasers would be deterred by the second part of the proposed levy, even if its operationwere at first suspended, and by the stated intention of the LabourParty to bring these undertakings back into public ownership, without compensation, if they were returned to office. There was a real risk that the Road Haulage Executive would find itself with a largenumber of lorries on its hands, and left to operate at a loss the lessprofitable part of its undertaking. The Government were not com-mitted by their election pledges to sell the whole of this undertaking,but merely to give the private road-hauliers who had been expropriating-appropriated an opportunity to come back into the business. The alterna-tive scheme would enable them to do so; and it would also satisfy the Road Haulage Association by removing at once the 25-mile limit which was now imposed on their members. The nationalised under-taking would be given an opportunity to prove its capacity to provide an efficient service, by road and rail, and its charges would be kept within reasonable bounds by the competition of private road haulage.Against this alternative scheme, the following arguments were put forward. Since the Road Haulage Executive would not be obligedto sell all its assets, the Government would not be regarded as havingredeemed their pledge to assist the long-distance hauliers who hadbeen expropriated to come back into the business. At the same time,by lifting at once the 25-mile limit on &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B &quot; licences, theywould be giving a disproportionate advantage to the short-distancehauliers. The scheme would undermine the licensing systemestablished by the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933, which had been introduced by a Conservative Government. It offered no solution ofthe problem of regulating competition between road and rail trans-port. Indeed, it foreshadowed unregulated competition, not only between road and rail, but also between the private road hauliers andthe nationalised service. The Government would in effect be admit-ting that they had no road/rail policy to offer, and that they wereprepared to leave this problem to solve itself by the free play ofeconomic forces. It was only too likely that this would result in increasing financial losses by the railways which would have to beborne in the end either by the Exchequer or by the industries whoseproducts could not be carried by road. When they had introduced the Transport Bill in the summer, the Government had indicated that they would be ready to modify it in the light of constructivecomment; but the alternative plan now put forward by the Ministerof Transport involved much more than a re-shaping of the originalBill. It was a violent reversal of policy and, as such, might shakepublic confidence in the Government. So drastic a change of policy could not be undertaken lightly; and, if they were to give properthought to the new proposals, Ministers would need more time to-consider them than was available under the present time-table.Hitherto it had been assumed that notice of presentation of the bill would be given at the outset of the new session, so as to exclude dis-cussion during the Debate on the Address; and that, as the Bill hadbeen published before the summer recess, the second reading couldbe taken after a short interval with the aim of completing the remain-ing stages in the House of Commons by February. This plan couldnot be followed if it were now decided to present quite a differentBill. It might then be necessary to allow the Bill to be discussedduring the Debate on the Address: a longer interval Would certainly have to be left before second reading: and the remaining stages inthe Commons would be more prolonged.
The following further points were also raised in the course ofthe discussion:  (a) The National Coal Board were concerned at the possibility that, if the railways were given greater freedom to vary their charges,this might result in increased charges for the carriage of coal. TheNational Coal Board were, however, in a position to apply powerfulpressure to the British Transport Commission, who were dependenton them for coal, which they obtained at specially favourable rates.The National Coal Board and the nationalised railways should haveno difficulty in arriving at an agreement on coal prices and railwayfreights which would be to their mutual advantage.(b) It was expected that the Road Haulage Executive would notbe able to sell the whole of its assets irt &quot; operable units &quot; and wouldbe left with a residue of lorries which would have to be sold as such.Some of these might, with advantage to the Exchequer, be taken over by the Services.The discussion showed that the preponderant view in the cabinet was against adopting the alternative scheme outlined by the Ministerof Transport in C (52) 355.The Cabinet (1) Agreed to proceed with the Road and Rail Transport Bill inthe form in which it had been published before the summer recess subject to (i) modification of the provisions for thesecond part of the proposed levy on road transport asindicated in Conclusion (2) below, (ii) the addition of pro-visions for ensuring greater flexibility in railway charges,subject to suitable safeguards, and (iii) such other amend-ments as might be recommended by the Transport PolicyCommittee.(2) Reserved for final decision at a meeting in the following week the question whether the second part of the proposed levy on road transport should be abandoned altogether, orwhether the Bill should provide that this part of the levy&quot;should be brought into operation only if the financial situation of the railways justified it and affirmative resolutions approving its introduction had been passed by both Houses of Parliament.(3) Invited the Transport Policy Committee to review in detail the proposed provisions for conceding greater flexibility in railway charges and to report on this to the Cabinetin the following week.(4) Invited the Transport Policy Committee to consider what further inducements could be provided to assist in the saleof the assets of the Road Haulage Executive.(5) Agreed that final decisions on all outstanding points in con-nection with the Road and Rail Transport Bill should betaken at their meeting on 30th October.4. The Foreign Secretary said that when he was in Paris earlier in the week he had found that the French and German governments were seriously at variance over the Saar. Their conversations hadbeen suspended, and there seemed every prospect that the SaarGovernment would proceed with their present plans, for the holding of elections, which were unacceptable to the German Federal Govern-ment. This would have made it much more difficult to find a lastingsolution of the Saar problem, and would gravely have damaged
Franco-German relations.  He had found a formula which would be acceptable to the German Chancellor and had urged it upon the^pFrench Foreign Minister, who had undertaken to commend it to his*^Government.   There was reason to hope that agreement would bereached on this basis.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Wages.EngineeringandShipbuildingIndustries.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 87thConclusions,Minute 9.)5. The Minister of Labour said that an agreement was now insight in the wages dispute in the shipbuilding industry. In theengineering industry negotiations between the two sides were continuing.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,22nd October, 1952.
