1. The Cabinet held a preliminary discussion about the arrange-ments for handling Government business in the opening weeks of thenew session.The Lord Privy Seal asked that Ministers in charge of Depart-ments should be in frequent attendance in the House of commons during the Debate on the Address, as it was not possible to predictwhat subjects might be raised. The Chief Whip undertook to draft a communication which might be sent to Ministers on this point.The Cabinet agreed that in the coming session, as in the present session, twenty Fridays should be allotted for Private Members&apos;business.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secre-tary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Power(C. (52) 368) covering a revised draft of the Transport Bill.. The Cabinefs discussion turned mainly on the proposed levy on road haulage, the proposals for greater flexibility in railway charges,and the removal of the 25-mile limit on the holders of A and Blicences.The Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and power recalled that on 22nd October the Cabinet had deferred adecision on the question whether the second part of the proposed levy on road transport, designed to compensate the railways for futurelosses of net revenue out of all future changes of traffic from rail to road, should be abandoned altogether or whether the Bill should pro-vide that this part of the levy should be brought into operation only if the financial situation of the railways justified it and affirmative resolutions approving its introduction had been passed by bothHouses of Parliament. The draft Bill now before the Cabinet pro-vided for the latter course, partly because the balance of opinion inthe Transport Policy Committee was inclined to favour it and partly to facilitate final settlement of the terms of the Bill in the light of the cabinet&apos;s decision. He was himself in favour of retaining the suspension-sory levy because he believed that, although the proposed relaxation of the restrictions on railway charges might enable them to hold theirown with road transport for a time, the railways would in the longrun be bound to suffer severely from revived competition from freeroad haulage. The Bill provided that the second part of the levyshould not come into effect before 31st December, 1956.The Minister of Transport said that he recognised that theretention of the second part of the levy on a suspensory basis couldbe justified on the ground that the Government had stated publicly that it was an essential part of the Bill, but when that statement hadbeen made the Bill had made no provision for greater flexibility in railway charges. On general grounds, he remained in favour of abandoning the second part of the levy, since this would reduce theopposition to the Bill as a whole and would also make it easier tosecure the support of industry for the proposals on railway charges.The Home Secretary said that he hoped the Cabinet would notdecide to abandon the second part of the levy without most carefullyweighing the arguments against doing so. There was general agree-ment upon the main objective of the Bill, namely, to terminate theSocialist experiment for the integration of road and rail transport,which had failed. It was in his view essential, however, that theGovernment&apos;s alternative solution should contain some provision for ensuring that in the long run the transport system of the country wasself-supporting. This was the purpose of the second part of the levy. To eliminate it would be to ignore both the weight of informedopinion on the subject and the lessons of experience in every other country. It also seemed to him not unlikely that to drop the levy at43319-4 B 2&quot;\rliament.i?usiness in theHouse ofCommons.Road and rail transport.Draft transport bill.(previous reference :CC. (52) 88thConclusions,Minute 3.)Transport Levy.
this stage would expose the Government to as much criticism as thwould incur by retaining it.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would still likethe second part of the levy to operate immediately but he had beenprepared to see it made suspensory in the interests of a general agree-ment. Its abandonment would expose the Exchequer to ultimatefinancial responsibility for the railways and would also make it harderto defend even the first part of the levy.In discussion there was considerable support for the view that to,propose a suspensory levy would give the worst of both worlds. Onthe one hand opinion in Parliament and the country would not beappeased; it would not be easier to reach a satisfactory agreementwith industry over greater flexibility in railway charges; and a rapidsale of the Road Haulage Executive^ lorries would not be facilitated.On the other hand there would be no receipts from the second partof the levy to offset losses by the railways owing to diversion of traffic form rail to road until 1957 at the earliest, and even then would be unlikely to amount to more than about  4 millions a year. It seemedvery likely, therefore, that it would not prove possible to defend asuspensory levy in Parliament successfully and it might, therefore,have to be abandoned eventually in any case but without gaining theadvantages which should be obtained from abandoning it at thisstage. The real alternatives before the Cabinet appeared, therefore,to be to abandon the second part of the levy altogether or to recon-sider making it immediately operative.The Commonwealth Secretary said that it seemed to him essentialto keep prominently in mind the principal object of the Bill, whichwas to denationalise road transport. As he saw it, the levy was likelyseriously to impede this process without necessarily ensuring that thetransport system as a whole would be self-supporting in the long run.The Prime Minister said that the balance of opinion in theCabinet seemed to be in favour of abandoning the second part of the levy altogether.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that no provision should be made in the draft Billfor the second part of the proposed Transport Levy.The Minister of Transport said that clauses 20-25 of the draftBill were designed to give greater flexibility in railway charges. they represented a broad measure of agreement between the transport commission and representatives of industry. The British chambers of Commerce might seek to have some amendments tabled in Parlia-ment to meet their point of view, but the elimination from the bill of the second part of the levy should help to bring about a satisfactoryfinal settlement in this matter.The Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and power said that the National Coal Board were generally satisfied with. the clauses as they stood.The Cabinet-(2) Approved clauses 20-25 of the draft Bill.The 25-mile The Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel andLimit. Power said that the Transport Policy Committee were unanimous in recommending that 31st December, 1954, should be fixed as the date on which the 25-mile limit should be lifted.The Cabinet were informed that, allowing for the fact that theBill would not become law until Easter 1953, there was little risk thatRailwayCharges.
Sale of Lorries. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Power (C. (52) 370)reporting that, with the object of facilitating the purchase of road transport units or vehicles from the British Transport Commission, itwas proposed that the Road Haulage Association should sponsor anew hire-purchase organisation which would employ the UnitedDominions Trust and possibly other established finance houses as itsagents. The Treasury would be prepared to inform the Banks thatthere was no objection to their making funds available to such an organisation solely to facilitate specific transactions arising from theTransport Bill.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the way was now clearfor the proposed new organisation to approach the Bank of Englandabout the provision of funds.The President of the Board of Trade said that he would be glad to be kept in touch with development in this matter since, if the hire-purchase terms granted to purchasers of Road Haulage Executivevehicles were more favourable than those stipulated in the hire purchase Restrictions Orders, there was a risk of charges of discrimination -nation against purchasers of road vehicles other than those sold bythe Commission.The Cabinet (5) Took note of C. (52) 370, and invited the Minister of Trans-port to submit a further report to them after consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Presidentof the Board of Trade, on the financial arrangements forfacilitating the purchase of the assets of the Road haulage executive.Transport 3.   The Minister of Transport said that the wages increaseCharges. recently awarded to railwaymen would add  4 million in the current(Previous year, and  18 million in a full year, to the costs of the British TransportReference: Commission. To compensate for this, the Commission had appliedCC. (52) 77th for authority to make immediate increases in freight charges.   TheConclusions, Minister said that he had no alternative but to refer this applicationMinute 7.) to the Transport Tribunal, and this he proposed to do.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of Transport.4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary and the President of the Board of Trade (C. (52) 365)recommending the abolition of the existing restrictions on the exportof antibiotic, antimalarial and sulphonamide drugs from the UnitedKingdom to Hong Kong and China.The Foreign Secretary said that the other countries of western europe were not imposing restrictions on the export of these drugsto the Far East and, as a result, the pharmaceutical industries in thosecountries were securing a substantial advantage over our own. There43319-4 b 3East/west trade.(previous reference:CC.

had recently been a marked increase in the volume of imports of these )drugs into Hong Kong, largely for re-export to,China: it had increased from a monthly average of  151,000 in the first half of 1952 to 450,000 in July and August. This situation could hardly be allowedto continue. There were three possible remedies. First, the othercountries of Western Europe might be asked to apply restrictionssimilar to our own. This had been tried, without success. Secondly,the Hong Kong Government might be asked to prevent the re-exportof these drugs to China. After consultation with the Colonial Officehe was satisfied that it would not be practicable to stop all trade inthese drugs between Hong Kong and the mainland. He therefore recommended the third course of removing the existing restrictions on exports from the United Kingdom so that our pharmaceutical industry could recover its share of this trade. Before this was done he pro-posed to inform the United States Government and, if they preferred to press the other countries of Western Europe to impose restrictionssimilar to our own, to defer the removal of our restrictions for a strictly limited period until the results of that pressure were known.The Cabinet Agreed in principle that the existing restrictions on the exportof antibiotic, antimalarial and sulphonamide drugs from theUnited Kingdom to China and Hong Kong should not bemaintained unless corresponding restrictions were imposed on the export of those drugs from other countries in western europe; and authorised the.Foreign Secretary to communi-cate their decision to the United States Government in theterms proposed in paragraph 8 of C. (52) 365.Food- 5.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofFood (C. (52) 361) proposing certain changes in the level of foodrations and seeking the Cabinefs views on the question whetherspecial bonuses of rationed foods should be given at ChristmasRation Changes. The Minister of Food said that, from 30th November, he pro-posed to increase the weekly butter ration by loz. and to make acorresponding reduction of loz. in the margarine ration. He also proposed that the weekly meat ration should be reduced from 2s. toIs. 9d. This was a seasonal reduction customary at this time of theyear. On 25th January he proposed to increase the weekly ration ofcheese from 1 oz. to 1^ oz.The Cabinet (1) Approved the changes which the Minister of Food proposedto make in the weekly ration of butter, margarine, meat and cheese, as stated in C. (52) 361.Christmas Food The Minister of Food said that, as a larger proportion of theBonuses. people&apos;s food was now unrationed, there was less scope than therehad been for the issue of special food bonuses at Christmas. Theonly practical possibilities were: (i) to make a bonus issue of anadditional 1 lb. of sugar per person, at a cost of about  1 million in dollars; and (ii) to postpone for one month the proposed reductionof the margarine ration, at a cost of about  \ million in non-sterlingcurrency.In a short discussion the view was expressed that the government ought, if possible, to make some additional food available at Christ-mas. On the other hand, the Chancellor of the Exchequer expressed concern at the current rate of expenditure on food imports, whichwas already running above the estimated rate, and said that he would
63CC. 91 (52)like to have an opportunity for further discussion with the Ministerof Food before final decisions were taken.The Cabinet (2) Agreed to postpone their decision on the question of Christ-mas food bonuses until the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Minister of Food had been able to discuss together the possibilities mentioned in C. (52) 361.(3) Invited the Minister of Food to defer for the time being any announcement of the ration changes authorised by Con-clusion (1) above, so that these and any Christmas foodbonuses could be announced simultaneously.Enforcement ofFood Controls.(previous reference:CC. (52) 67thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Food (C. (52) 360) reporting the progress made in reducingthe number of enforcement officers employed by his Department.This showed that, as the result of the abandonment of some minorcontrols, the enforcement staff would shortly be reduced by 5 percent. Further reductions would become possible if, as was hoped,more significant changes could soon be made in the rationing system.The Cabinet Took note of this progress report on the enforcement of foodcontrols.Egypt.defence negotiations.(previous reference:CC. (52) 54thConclusions,Minute 2.)7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (52) 369) on the question of resuming defence negotia-tions with the Egyptian Government.The Foreign Secretary said that, since this problem was last considered by the Cabinet, there had been several significant changesin the situation. Turkey had come into the Middle East as a firmAlly, and some progress was being made towards the establishment ofthe Middle East Defence Organisation. The new regime in Egyptoffered a better prospect of a satisfactory agreement than we had had for some time past. Financial and strategic considerations suggestedthat British military strength in the Middle East might be less, inpeace and in war, than had previously been assumed. In the light ofthese new facts the Minister of Defence and the Chiefs of Staff werereviewing afresh the whole of our defence policy in the Middle East;and it should be our aim to defer the resumption of formal defence negotiations with the Egyptian Government until that review hadbeen completed. He proposed to instruct H.M. Ambassador in cairo accordingly. It might, however, prove impossible to avoid any discussion with the Egyptians on defence questions; and he there-fore proposed to authorise the Ambassador to be guided in anyinterim discussions by the principles set out in paragraph 8 of his memorandum. These were, briefly, (i) that we should not for thepresent withdraw any troops from the Canal Zone though at a later stage, if we were satisfied that defence discussions were making real progress and that operation Rodeo (for the protection of British livesin Cairo and Alexandria) would no longer be required, we would start withdrawing troops which had been sent in earlier in the yearto reinforce the normal garrison; (ii) that we should seek to maintain our base though, as part of a general agreement, we would be readyto entrust its custody to the Egyptians; (iii) that we should be preparedto set up an Anglo-Egyptian Air Defence organisation; (iv) that egypt should undertake to give us and our Allies in the Middle east defence Organisation full military facilities in time of war or imminent
threat of war; and (v) that any new defence agreement would beregarded as superseding the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the Chiefs ofStaff fully agreed that we should seek to defer the resumption ofdefence negotiations with Egypt until we had completed our reviewof defence policy in the Middle East. Meanwhile, however, the Chiefsof Staff were inclined to favour action which might strengthen the newEgyptian Government which, they believed, was more likely to takea realistic view of defence problems than its predecessors had been.They favoured a limited supply of arms, including jet aircraft, to egypt. They were also prepared to begin the withdrawal of theBritish reinforcements which had been sent to the Middle East at thetime of the disorders in Egypt at the beginning of the year. They nowthought it most unlikely that need would arise to carry out operationRodeo: moreover, while the present Egyptian Government remained in office, it was doubtful whether we should be able to undertake thatoperation with the troops at our disposal.The Minister of Defence endorsed these views, and recommendedthat an early start be made in withdrawing some of the troops whichhad been sent to reinforce the British garrison in the Middle East.Should we not make a start, for example, by withdrawing the16th Parachute Brigade from Cyprus? The Foreign Secretary saidthat he would like to know what H.M. Ambassador in Cairo thoughtabout this before any final decision was taken.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that we should seek to defer the resumption ofdefence negotiations with the Egyptian Government untilthe review of defence policy in the Middle East had beencompleted, and invited the Foreign Secretary to informH.M. Ambassador at Cairo accordingly.(2) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to instruct H.M. Ambassadors-dor at Cairo that, if in the meantime he found it necessary .to engage in any discussion with the Egyptians on defence questions, he should be guided by the principles set out inparagraph 8 of C. (52) 369.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consult further with theMinister of Defence regarding the proposed withdrawal ofthe .16th Parachute Brigade from Cyprus after H.M.Ambassador at Cairo had been given an opportunity tosay what effect this movement might have on the egyptian government.In connection with the discussion recorded above, reference wasmade to the proposal to move the British Headquarters organisation in the Middle East from the Canal Zone to Cyprus. The Minister ofDefence and the Secretary of State for War said that a great deal ofconstructional work would have to be carried out before this movecould be begun, and it was most desirable that authority should begiven to put this in hand without further delay. The cost of com-completing the whole transfer would be very large; but this would bespread over a number of years and it was only the preliminary workfor which authority was now being sought.The Prime Minister asked whether it was feasible to sanction anypart of this plan until more was known about the future strength ofour garrison in the Middle East. Large issues of policy were stillundetermined. He himself still hoped that it might be possible to persuade the United States to take some share of the responsibilityfor safeguarding the Suez Canal as an international waterway, so thatwe could hand over our responsibilities in Egypt to an international organisation in which the United States and ourselves would both playsome part. It was surely too early to take final decisions about the size of the military organisation to be established at Cyprus.  He also
wished to have some further information about the disposal of the stores and equipment now in the British base at Tel el Kebir.In further discussion it was suggested that some work could beput in hand in Cyprus without prejudice to the larger issues of defence policy in the Middle East, which could not be finally settled for somemonths to come.The Cabinet (4) Invited the Minister of Defence and the Chancellor of theExchequer to consider to what extent authority could nowbe given for the commencement of constructional workfor a military Headquarters establishment in Cyprus,without prejudicing the decisions yet to be taken on thelarger issues of defence policy in the Middle East, and tosubmit proposals for consideration by the Cabinet.(5) Took note that the Secretary of State for War would submit to the Prime Minister a note on the disposal of the stores and equipment now in the British base at Tel el Kebir.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,29th October, 1952.
