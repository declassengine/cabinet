Dean of 1.   The Cabinet were informed that on 15th July.Lord AmmonCanterbury. was to ask in the House of Lords whether any legal action could betaken against the Dean of Canterbury in respect of his recent state-ments reflecting on the conduct of British troops in Korea. A motion on the same subject had also been tabled in the House of Commons.The Cabinet were informed that the Archbishop of Canterburyhad confirmed that no such action could be taken by the Church.Section 4 of the Church Dignitaries (Retirement) Measure, 1949, con-templated proceedings for unbecoming conduct, but it included a specific proviso that such proceedings should not be based on socialor political opinions or activities. A motion tabled in the Houseof Commons contemplated that an Address should be presented toHer Majesty by both Houses of Parliament praying that the Dean&apos;appointment be revoked. The Cabinet were informed that no prece-dent could be found for the use of such a procedure for terminatingan appointment held at pleasure.In discussion there was general agreement that, it would be inexpedient to invoke special procedures or legislation for the purposeof removing the Dean of Canterbury from his office in the Church.Such action would have the effect of giving even wider publicity tothe Dean&apos;s activities and would attribute to them a greater degreeof importance than they deserved. In the forthcoming debate in theHouse of Lords the Government spokesman should therefore confinehimself to expressing the Governments strong disapprobationof the Dean&apos;s activities. It was unlikely that the motion tabled in theHouse of Commons would be debated.Parliament. 2.   The Lord Privy Seal said that he had not yet been able to business in the conclude his discussion with Opposition leaders in the House of house of Commons on the revised Parliamentary time-table which the CabinetCommons. had approved on 8th July. The Opposition leaders were anxious that the debate on the ratification of the settlements with germany should not be held before the summer recess, and they were anxiousto put their views to the Foreign Secretary. Until this point hadbeen settled they would be unwilling to express their views on theproposed time-table. Meanwhile it would be necessary to announce,in the Statement on Business later in the day, that the second reading of the Transport&quot; Bill would be deferred until the opening of a new session in the autumn and that the Government hoped that Par-liament could be adjourned for the summer recess at the end ofJuly or early in August.admiralty and WarDepartmentProperty in bermuda.3. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the colonial secretary (C. (52) 210) and the Secretary of State for War (C. (52) 211)regarding the disposal of Admiralty and War Office property in bermuda.The Colonial Secretary said that the Bermuda Government had offered to pay  650,000 for this property. The two Service Depart-ments were asking  1,850,000 for it. The dockyard was a doubtfulcommercial proposition, and the value of the military barracks wasconsiderably affected by the obligation (which Bermuda would beglad to accept) to maintain the property as barracks against thepossibility of the return of a British garrison. The Bermuda Govern-ment were making a voluntary contribution of about  40,000 perannum to United Kingdom defence costs, and there was some risk that they would cease to make this contribution if we insisted ondriving a hard bargain over this property. The leasing of a base tothe United States and the closing of the dockyard and withdrawalof the garrison had already aroused misgivings about the extent ofour interest in the colony, and these would be increased if we now
insisted on what seemed to the Bermudans to be an excessive price for this property. He therefore recommended that we should acceptthe offer of the Bermuda Government. The alternative was to allow a Service agency to dispose of the property piecemeal, and it was open to question whether that course, would bring us any greaterfinancial advantage.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Bermuda was prosperous: it had no public debt, no incometax, reserves equivalent to six months&apos; revenue, and a surplus of$14 million in the balance of payments. On the other hand, itseconomy was largely based on the tourist traffic, which was precarious.(b) The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that the Ber-muda Government might be asked to pay  1,250,000 for theproperty  500,000 at once and the rest by instalments over six years.He was not convinced that, if we insisted on this price, the Bermuda -Government would necessarily cancel their voluntary annual con-tribution of  40,000. The Colonial Secretary pointed out that, ifthey did, almost the same financial result would have been obtained by accepting their offer of  650,000.(c) The possible advantages of piecemeal disposal by a Serviceagency should be further examined. Account should be taken ofthe maintenance liabilities which the War Office and Admiralty wouldthen have to accept until the property was disposed of.The Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for War and the First Lordof the Admiralty to submit to the Cabinet, after consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer, detailed proposals forthe piecemeal disposal of Admiralty and War Departmentproperty in Bermuda.Enforcement of       4.   The Minister of Food said that he had made a thoroughFood Controls, examination of the arrangements for the enforcement of rationing(Previous        and other food controls (C. (52) 215).  He had given directions that reference:      his enforcement officers should not waste time and effort on technicalC.C. (52) 53rd   offences of minor significance, but should concentrate their attentionConclusions,     upon the important abuses which represented a real threat to the minute 10.)      rationing system.   The most important of these were the forgeryof ration documents, over-charging, illicit slaughter of livestock andfalse returns by catering establishments.  The present staff engagedupon this work numbered 665 officers in all, and he did not think this number excessive.   None of these officers had power to entera private dwelling.The Prime Minister said that it should remain the objective ofthe Minister of Food to reduce progressively the number of hisenforcement officers; and he hoped that the Lord President and theMinister of Food would continue to examine methods of achieving this objective and put further proposals to the Cabinet in a month&apos;s time.The Cabinet-Took note of the memorandum by the Minister of Food(C (52) 215).Food Prices. 5.   The Minister of Food said that he had circulated a memo-(Previous randum (C. (52) 222) drawing the attention of his colleagues to the reference: fact that there was to be a minor increase in the price of sweet biscuitsC.C. (52) 61st and increases in the price of main crop potatoes.   The effect on theConclusions, cost-of-living index would be very small and he did not expect that minute 8.) these price increases would attract any comment.
Sugar.SupplementaryRation forJam-making.6. The Minister of Food said that in the course of the present week he must decide whether a supplementary ration of 1 lb. of sugar per person should be given for jam-making. There was likelyto be a very large crop of plums and there was great pressure in fruit-growing districts for the issue of this supplementary ration. Thetotal sugar involved would be 25,000 or 26,000 tons at a cost ofapproximately  1  million. This sugar could be taken from commercial stocks and replaced, if possible, from the home crop ofbeet sugar, which was expected to be good.In discussion it was suggested that an alternative method of finding the necessary sugar would be to reduce the sweet ration by4 ounces for three months. The Cabinet considered, however, thatthis action should not be taken until it was seen whether it wouldbe possible to replace from the home crop later in the year the sugarwithdrawn from commercial stocks for jam-making. If there was still a serious deficiency, it might then be possible to consider areduction in the sweet ration and to defend it on the ground that ithad been made necessary by the issue of additional sugar for jam-making.The Cabinet-(1) Approved in principle the issue of a supplementary sugar ration for jam-making.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerof Food to settle the method of making this supplementaryration available and the manner of presenting the decisionto Parliament and the public.Industrial 7.   The Minister of Labour said that he had received the reportDisputes. of the Court of Enquiry which had considered the dispute betweenThe Newspaper certain trade unions and D. C. Thomson and Co., Ltd.

(52) 222) and of the statement by the President of theBoard of Trade.
8. The Cabinet were informed that the Coronation JointCommittee had been considering what facilities should be given fortelevising the Coronation ceremonies. They were disposed to agreethat the departure of the procession at the west end of westminster abbey might be televised, but to withhold any facilities for televisingthe actual ceremony within the Abbey. It was thought, however,that there might be a wide demand for television of the ceremony,and that political pressure in favour of this might be brought to bear upon the Government.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in general agreement that the proceedings within the Abbey should not be televised. Acinematograph film would be taken, as in 1937; and the interests of television viewers might be met if arrangements could be made forthis film to be shown on the television programme later in the day.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed in principle that no facilities should be given fortelevising the Coronation Service within westminster abbey.(2) Invited the Paymaster-General and the Minister of Works toconsider whether any alternative arrangements could bemade to meet the interests of television viewers.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,10th July, 1952.the coronation.(previous reference:CC.
