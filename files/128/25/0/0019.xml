The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the White Paperembodying the Governments proposals for the future of the iron andsteel industry.The Prime Minister said that, after the Cabinefs meeting on theprevious day, he and the Commonwealth Secretary had seen Sir EllisHunter, the Chairman of the Iron and Steel Federation, who had saidthat, since he had learned of the revised Parliamentary timetable, hehad changed his mind about the need for early publication of theWhite Paper on the future of the iron and steel industry. If the bill was to be introduced at the outset of a new session in the autumn, heno longer thought it essential that the White Paper should be pub-lished before the summer recess: he would be content with a firmdeclaration of the Governments intention to proceed with the Bill.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the doubts which he had expressed in the Cabinets earlier discussion related solely to the timing of this legislation. He saw no reason why the Governmentshould not reaffirm their intention to denationalise the steel industry;and he would not mind how firm that declaration was if it avoideda promise that legislation for that purpose would be introduced inthe near future. Other Ministers pointed out, however, that theviews of the Iron and Steel Federation would not be met unless thestatement indicated that legislation would be introduced before theend of the year. The Prime Minister said that, this being so, thepublication of the White Paper might be a less provocative step thana statement of the Governments intention in terms which would meet the views of the Federation. Account must also be taken of thefact that the leaders of the Labour Opposition had already beenmade aware, through the usual channels, that the Government had intended to publish a White Paper before the summer recess. this intention was also widely known in interested circles outside Parlia-ment. If the White Paper were now withheld, and it were merelystated that the Government intended to introduce the Bill in theautumn, awkward questions would be asked about the reasons forthis change of plan. He himself was therefore disposed to favour theoriginal proposal to publish the White Paper, but to avoid debatingit, before Parliament adjourned. Thereafter the Government could,explore the possibility of reaching some basis of agreement whichwould command a wide measure of support from the industry andfrom moderate opinion throughout the country. There was in his- view no prospect of securing a compromise acceptable to the labour opposition in the House of Commons.After further discussion the Cabinet agreed that a decisionbetween the alternatives of publishing the White Paper or stating theGovernments intention to proceed with this legislation could not betaken until they had before them a draft of the proposed statement.This should be prepared for consideration at their meeting on22nd July, at which the Foreign Secretary hoped to be present. Mean-while the Minister of Supply should also revise the draft White Paperso as to lay greater emphasis on the proposals for the future super-vision of the industry and less on the proposals for returning it to private ownership.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary, the Minister of Housing andLocal Government and the Minister of Supply to prepare a draft of a public statement reaffirming the governments intention to proceed with the Iron and Steel Bill, and tosubmit this to the Prime Minister after preliminary con-sultation with the Commonwealth Secretary and the lord privy Seal.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for thedraft statement to be circulated to the Cabinet forconsideration at their meeting on 22nd July.. (3) Invited the Minister of Supply to circulate to the Cabinet forconsideration at the same meeting the revised draft of theWhite Paper on the future of the iron and steel industry.42618-2 B 2
Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed that the Leader of the OppositionBusiness in the had now discussed with the Foreign Secretary his wish that the debateHouse of on the ratification of the settlement with Germany should be deferredCommons. until after the summer recess. He had explained that, if the debatewere taken before the recess, the Labour Opposition would vote infavour of deferring ratification until the autumn. The more reason-able members of the Labour Party, who were in favour of ratification,were arguing that they would be in a better position to bring theirinfiuence to bear on Socialists in other European Parliaments, witha view to persuading them to support the settlements, if a debate on united Kingdom ratification were deferred.Despite these arguments the Foreign Secretary still thought it. preferable that the debate should be held before the recess. Mr. Attleehad been unable to give any assurance that more Labour votes wouldbe cast in support of ratification in the autumn. Meanwhile ourdelay in ratifying the settlements would have an unsettling effect inEurope, which the Soviet Government would be quick to exploit.The Cabinet agreed that in these circumstances the debate onthe ratification of the German settlements should be held before the summer recess. They then discussed how time could best be found for the debate. Two days were needed, and it had originally been contemplated that the Government would make these available. Butit had now become necessary to find time for the discussion of a motion proposing a compulsory timetable for the remaining stages of the Licensed Premises in New Towns Bill, which otherwise couldnot be passed into law before the end of the session. Thus, if two days had to be found for the debate on Germany, the alternativeswere to find an extra day by adjourning on Saturday, 2nd August,instead of Friday, 1st August, or to persuade the Opposition to useone of their remaining Supply Days for this purpose.The Cabinet agreed that two days would be needed for the debate on Germany and that, if the Opposition were unwilling to provideone of these by allowing a Supply Day to be used for the purpose,the adjournment of the House should be deferred until Saturday,2nd August.Admission of 3:   The Home Secretary said that 900 Quakers from all over theForeigners to world were expected to attend a conference which the Society ofUnited Friends were holding at Oxford from 28th July to 6th August.  FiveKingdom. Quakers wished to come to this conference from Eastern Germany;Professor and among these were included Professor Emil Fuchs, the father ofEmil Fuchs. Klaus Fuchs, who was now serving a sentence of penal servitude forbetraying our atomic secrets to the Russians, and his housekeeper,Miss Annemarie Hager. The Foreign Office considered that, in viewof the notoriety of Klaus Fuchs, there would be unfavourable com-ment if Emil Fuchs were allowed to visit this country, and particularly if he were given facilities to see his son in prison while he was here;and that this might prejudice our dealings with the Americans on atomic energy questions. On the other hand, the Security service had no adverse information about Professor Fuchs or Miss Hager,and did not consider that there would be any security risk in allowingthem to visit this country. The Home Secretary felt that it wouldbe contrary to British traditions if a respectable old Professor, against whom no individual objection could be raised, were refused leave toland in this country for the purpose of attending a conference organ-ised by the Society of Friends, merely because he was the father of anotorious spy. He therefore recommended that visas should begranted to enable Professor Fuchs and Miss Hager to attend this conference.In the Cabinet&apos;s discussion varying views were expressed. Thebalance of opinion was in favour of allowing Professor Fuchs to cometo this country for the conference, if it were firmly established thatthere was nothing against him personally, but to decline him facilities
31CC. 69 (52)to visit his son in prison. The suggestion was, however, made in thediscussion that Professor Fuchs had moved into the Soviet zone of Germany after his son&apos;s conviction; and, if that were so, it was asuspicious circumstance which should be taken into account.The Cabinet-Invited the Home Secretary to make further enquiries intothe personal reliability of Professor Emil Fuchs, withparticular reference to the suggestion that he had moved into the Soviet Zone of Germany after his son&apos;s conviction,and to report the result of these enquiries to the PrimeMinister.import programme.(previous reference:CC. (52) 29thConclusions,Minute 6.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (52) 237) summarising the reductions in import programmes and the immediate increases in exports already accepted by the Ministers concerned as a contribution towards the closing of the estimated gap of  175 million in the balance of payments in the second half of 1952; and suggesting additional measures whichmight be taken. The memorandum also asked the Cabinet to approvea new procedure for calculating the import programmes after the endof 1952.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the agreed contri-butions now amounted to  97 million, leaving an unfilled gap of 78 million. Further savings could be made by running down wheatstocks to a level of ten weeks&apos; consumption in 1953, and by reducingstocks of coarse grains, which were now 250,000 tons above thelevel reached at the end of 1951. The estimated saving on wheat and flour would amount to  9-2 million, and he thought it should bepossible to obtain a saving of as much as  10-5 million on coarse grains. The Minister of Food would suggest some further savings onthe food import programme. He was anxious not to place too muchreliance on obtaining a waiver of interest on the United States and canadian loans and, in any case, as slight variations in the terms oftrade might increase the drain on our gold and dollar reserves beyondhis estimate, he thought that as much as possible of the estimatedgap should be closed by cuts in imports and in increased exports.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) There was general agreement that the risk of running downwheat stocks to the level of ten weeks&apos; consumption by mid-1953should be accepted; but The Commonwealth Secretary stressed the desirability of imposing the cut as far as possible on American,rather than Canadian, wheat.(b) It was argued that it would be improvident to make the largereduction in stocks of coarse grains recommended by the Chancellorof the Exchequer. This might prejudice the expansion of our live-stock production, which in the long run would reduce our dependence on imported food. It would also postpone the prospect of dispensingwith the system of rationing animal feeding-stuffs, which was not satisfactory and could not be effectively enforced. In discussionthere was support for the view that savings from this source shouldnot exceed  3 million.(c) The Minister of Food said that  1 million worth of butterwhich he had expected to obtain in the last six months of 1952 wouldnot, after all, be obtainable. There were, moreover, certain items inthe import programme which had been estimated before quotas hadbeen established, and the quotas were now found to be less than hadbeen estimated. Furthermore, negotiations with the Argentine were still in progress and he would not be able to spend the  8 - 5 million on meat Which he had expected to have to pay in the last six monthsof 1952. This was the limit of the savings he could offer; they were
estimated to amount to  12-8 million. He was unwilling that thefood consumption of the people should be further reduced. In par-ticular, he could not accept suggestions for reductions in importsof eggs and bacon, ridr did he think it reasonable to forego the verysmall import of 35,000 tons of rice.The Prime Minister said that, in addition to the savings of 97 million shown in paragraph 2 of the memorandum before theCabinet, the Chancellor of the Exchequer might now count on further savings from the reduction of wheat stocks and from the further measures mentioned by the Minister of Food in the Cabinefs discus-sion. The question of coarse grains should be further discussed between the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister of Food andthe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries. The method by which theimport cuts should be made public would need to be carefully con-sidered. In certain instances announcements had already been madeto the trades concerned, but the Chancellor of the Exchequer should consider in what form information might be given in Parliamentwithout injuring confidence.The Prime Minister suggested that the Cabinet should accept thenew procedure for calculating import programmes which the Chan-cellor of the Exchequer proposed in paragraphs 8 and 9 of C. (52) 237.This procedure would give greater flexibility, would keep our forwardcommitments down, and would make our import system more respon-sive to the needs of the balance of payments situation. The figureof  800 miiliOn fOf nOn-sterling imports for the first half of 1953should be accepted as a target, and Departments should make sub-missions on this basis in due course.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the total savings of  97 million shown in C. (52) 237and invited the Ministers concerned to put them intoeffect forthwith.(2) Agreed that stocks of wheat and flour should be reduced toa ievel of ten weeks&apos; consumption, by mid-1953.(3) Approved the further savings of  12-8 million on butter,Argentine meat and miscellaneous food-stuffs mentioned by the Minister of Food in the course of the discussion.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister of food and the Minister of Agriculture to discuss what further savings could be obtained by reducing stocks of coarse grains, and to report to the Cabinet at a later meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,15th July, 1952.
