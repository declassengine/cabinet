leat Supplies.Negotiationswith Argentina.(previous reference:CC. (52) 57thConclusions,Minute 4.)1. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C. (52) 300) covering a report by the Overseas Negotia-tions Committee on the latest position in the negotiations with argentina for the purchase of meat. The Committee recommended the Treasury dissenting that our negotiators should&apos; now beauthorised to offer as part of a generally satisfactory agreement a renewal of Article 12 of the 1951 Protocol under which credit wasmade available to Argentina with such modifications of the article in our favour as it might be possible to negotiate.The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Food, said that thedecline in Argentina&apos;s earnings from the export of such commodities as maize and wheat provided solid evidence for the Ambassadorsview that some concession by Her Majesty&apos;s Government in thematter of credit was a sine qua non of any Agreement. The Argen-tinians, who were naturally prone to leave problems to solvethemselves, also believed that they were in a position to hold outlonger than we. It was hoped that from successful negotiations weshould obtain some 200,000 tons of meat at not more than  160 a ton.This would enable the ration to be maintained at 25. Od. until december or January (depending on the actual figures finally agreed)and then kept at Is. 9d. until home-killed supplies again became available in mid-1953. Without Argentine supplies, however, the ration would have to be reduced to Is. 9d. on 1st November, to Is. 6d.in December and by the end of the year to Is. 4d., at which figure-itwould have to remain until mid-1953. In terms of the prices rulinga year ago, a is. 4d. ration would represent one of lid., which wouldcompare with the lOd. ration to which the consumer had been reduced on the occasion of the previous Governments failure to reach agree-ment with the Argentine. If the Minister of Food was to maintainthe ration at the levels which he hoped for, agreement must be reached with the Argentine by mid-October at the latest in order that ship-ments might begin to flow by mid-November. This made it desirablethat the Ambassador should receive fresh instructions within thenext few days.The Minister of State said that the Foreign Office was in entire agreement with the views expressed by Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador,Buenos Aires. The Argentine desire for credit appeared to be genuineand the granting of credit should improve our bargaining position inrespect of other matters to be covered by any Agreement.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, whilst he recognised the force of the arguments for facilitating an early agreement with argentina, the granting of credit was highly undesirable in principlesince it would constitute a direct drain on our balance of payments.It was true that the Argentinians had not exercised their rights underArticle 12 (/) of the 1951 Protocol but they seemed more likely to doso in their present circumstances and there might be irresistiblepressure from other countries, for example Uruguay, for similar facilities. If the Cabinet accepted the Ambassadors analysis of thesituation and felt that the grant of some measure of credit to Argen-tina was unavoidable, he would not resist but he was most anxious that Article 12 of the 1951 Protocol should be modified so that anycredit granted to Argentina should take the form least harmful to our balance of payments. Thus, he did not see why the credit should onthis occasion exceed  10 million or why the duration of the creditneed be longer than, six months.In discussion the view was expressed that it was anomalous thata country should insist on receiving credit facilities as part of anagreement providing for purchases from that country to the value ofsome  30 million. Could not more meat be obtained in return forthe additional sterling Which the Argentine appeared to need?
Tariff Policy.(previous reference:CC. (52) 48thConclusions,Minute 1.)Japan and theG.A.T.T.2. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (C. (52) 301) and the Minister of State(C. (52) 302) about the attitude to be adopted by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment at the forthcoming session of the signatories of theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.) towards Japan&apos;application to enter into tariff negotiations with a view to her eventualaccession to the Agreement.The President of the Board of Trade said that there was no room for disagreement about the disadvantages of admitting Japan tothe G.A.T.T. The entry of a low-cost producer into a trading com-munity working on &quot; most-favoured-nation &quot; principles would almost certainly lead to a general raising of tariffs. Japan&apos;s entry intoG.A.T.T. would, moreover, create special difficulties for Common-wealth countries in view of the &quot; no new preference &quot; rule of theG.A.T.T., which would have the effect of requiring a commonwealth country which found it necessary to raise its tariffs against japan and, therefore, against foreign countries generally to raise itspreferential tariffs against other Commonwealth countries corre-correspondingly.On the question of tactics, he hoped there would be generalagreement that our first aim should be to secure a deferment of thewhole issue if that were possible. The forthcoming Commonwealth(It was the general view of the Cabinet, however, that the grant&quot;of some measure of credit to Argentina was essential to the conclusionof an agreement and that in view of the vital importance of safe-guarding the meat ration Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador should beempowered at the earliest possible date to discuss with the Argen-palestinian negotiators what form credit facilities should take. Both theamount of any credit and its duration appeared to be matters for negotiation and it was important that the fullest advantage should betaken of any concession which might be made in the matter of credit to obtain the most favourable possible terms in respect of any othermatters to be covered by the Agreement, for example, the acceptance by the Argentine of larger quantities of our less essential exports.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would arrange for officials of the Departments concerned to examine as a matter of urgency what instructions should be sent to Her Majesty&apos;s Ambas-ambassador, Buenos Aires, on the subject of credit facilities for Argentina.If this examination should raise any issue which required considera-tion by Ministers he would lay the matter before some of hiscolleagues on the following day.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that some measure of credit should be offered to the Argentine as part of a generally satisfactory agreement providing for our requirements of meat.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for officials of the Departments concerned to examine as amatter of urgency the form which such credit facilitiesmight take, having regard to our balance of payments position, in order that early instructions might be sent toHer Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Buenos Aires.(3) Invited the Minister of State to inform Her Majesty&apos;s Ambas-ambassador, Buenos Aires, forthwith of the action being taken and of the date by which he might expect to receiveinstructions on the subject of credit.
Economic Conference made the present a particularly inopportunetime to face this issue. He therefore favoured an early approach to the United States Government explaining our special difficulties;expressing our agreement in principle that Japan should in due course be admitted to an international trading organisation suitably con-stituted; and inviting their co-operation in securing a postponement of the issue at least until the eighth session of G.A.T.T. It was,however, necessary to consider what course we should follow if suchan approach were unsuccessful and the United States Governmentinsisted on sponsoring a resolution at the forthcoming session wel-coming the application of Japan to enter into tariff negotiations.There appeared to him to be some inconsistency in the course ofaction recommended by the Minister of State in C. (52) 302. More-over, he felt the gravest doubt about the wisdom of our voting infavour of any such resolution. An affirmative vote by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment would undoubtedly be interpreted in this country aswelcoming Japan into G.A.T.T. and might well precipitate agitation against Japan and against the G.A.TT. generally, particularly inLancashire where feeling was running very high. He himself saw no alternative to the United Kingdom delegation abstaining from voting on any resolution favourable to Japan which might be moved at theforthcoming session.The Minister of State said that abstention in such circumstances had been shown by past experience to offer the worst of both worlds.There appeared to be no question but that any resolution favourable to Japan would secure the necessary majority and in these circum-stances the United Kingdom would surely be better advised to avoidrevealing its suspicions of Japan, thereby strengthening the hands ofthose elements in the present Japanese Government which were welldisposed towards this country.In discussion there was general support for the view that thelogical sequel to an expression of Her Majesty&apos;s Government^ viewsat the forthcoming session of G.A.T.T. on the lines envisaged by both the President of the Board of Trade and the Minister of state would be abstention from voting on any resolution favourable to japan&apos;s accession to the Agreement. The view was also expressed that an affirmative vote by Her Majesty&apos;s Government upon anysuch resolution would give the Opposition a handle for embarrassingHer Majesty&apos;s Government at home which they would not be slow to use.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Prime minister had informed him that he was opposed to our taking any actionwhich might be interpreted as favouring the accession of Japan toG.A.T.T. It would be helpful if the issue could be discussed with commonwealth officials who would be available in London earlyin the following week with a view to its being brought before theCabinet again on 25th September. In the meanwhile there appearedto be no reason for delaying an approach to the United StatesGovernment on the lines suggested by the President of the Board ofTrade.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of State to arrange for the immediateapproach to be made to the United States Governmenton the lines proposed by the President of the Board ofTrade.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to arrange forthis question to be discussed early in the following week with officials of other Commonwealth Governments.(3) Took note that the matter would be brought before theCabinet again on 25th September.
Hong Kong.constitutional reform.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 54thConclusions,Minute 6.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the colonial secretary (C. (52) 298) reporting that he did not now intend to proceed,until conditions were more settled, with proposals for further constitutional reform in Hong Kong approved by the Cabinet on20th May.The Colonial Secretary said that, while the situation in HongKong had not deteriorated, it had certainly not improved and opinionwithin the Colony seemed likely to acquiesce in further defermentof constitutional reform. It was, however, proposed to make one small change forthwith, namely the addition of two more elected members to the Urban Council, on which there was already an unofficial majority.The Cabinet Agreed that the Colonial Secretary should proceed on thelines proposed.Wages.TheEngineeringandShipbuildingIndustries.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 75thConclusions,Minute 8.)4. The Minister of Labour said that the failure of the claim for a wage increase of  2 a week in the engineering and shipbuilding industries had eased the task of those responsible elements in theTrade Union movement which were working for a measure of wage restraint and had made possible the discussion on its merits of any reasonable claim for a wage increase in those industries. Separatediscussions were continuing between the Ministry and representativesof the engineering and shipbuilding employers respectively. It was hoped that the former would that day agree to meet union repre-sentatives and that the outcome of such a meeting might be agreementeither on a moderate wage increase or on reference of the matter to arbitration. The shipbuilding employers might well prove to be rather more forthcoming and their attitude might influence theengineering employers in the same direction. Generally, the prospects of a settlement did not appear to be entirety discouraging.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.industrial disputes.Park RoyalVehicles.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 77thConclusions,Minute 8.)5. The Minister of Labour said that the dispute at Park RoyalVehicles, where there had been a strike over the discharge ofredundant employees, involved the important issue of &quot; work ormaintenance &quot; on which the Communists were concentrating atten-tion. A Committee of Investigation had commended the employers&apos;proposal to mark their disapproval of use of the strike weapon byre-engaging strikers forty-eight hours after employees who had not.withdrawn their labour. One such strike had succeeded while thelate Government was in office and another successful strike ofthis kind might have serious consequences. He was therefore doing what he could to encourage the employers to maintain a firm attitude in this case.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement.
&quot;Equal Pay. 6.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, after consultation(Previous with the Minister of Labour, he had adopted a generally negativeReference: attitude in a discussion which he had had on the previous day with aC.C. (52) 52nd deputation from the Staff Side of the National Whitley Council on conclusions, the subject of equal pay in the public services. He had felt it politic,Minute 3.)       however, to leave the door ajar to the extent of agreeing to provide in due course comments upon a scheme for the gradual introductionof equal pay.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement.East-west trade.Exports of rubber to soviet Satellites.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 51stConclusions,Minute 3.)7. The Colonial Secretary recalled that at their meeting on 8th May the Cabinet had agreed that in any discussions with soviet representatives nothing should be said regarding a proposal thatrubber exports to the satellites should be restricted in 1952 to a totalof 25,000 tons. That proposal had been based on the assumptionthat the total amount of rubber which the satellites could safely beallowed to import from all sources during 1952 was 35,000 tons.It had now been generally agreed that this figure could reasonably be increased to 50,000 tons. In these circumstances it was proposedthat exports of rubber to the Soviet satellites from British-controlledsources in the fourth quarter of the current year should be at therate of 30,000 tons a year.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.The Cabinet. 8.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Prime Minister(Previous        expected to return to London from the South of France on reference:      25th September and to hold a meeting of the Cabinet on the after -C.C. (52) 29th   noon of that day.   He would himself be leaving for the South of conclusions,     France on 20th September, would see the Prime Minister on minute l.) &apos;     21 st September and would thereafter be remaining abroad for abouta week. The Lord Privy Seal was shortly leaving for Denmark andthe Prime Minister had invited the Commonwealth Secretary to pre-side over any meeting of the Cabinet which might have to be held between 20th and 25th September.  A public announcement wouldbe made later that day.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement,Cabinet Office, S.W.1,18th September, 1952.
