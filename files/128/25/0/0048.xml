siArmed Forces.Widows&apos;Pensions.(previous reference :C.C. (52) 77thConclusions,Minute 6.)2. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Defence (C. (52) 410) and the Chancellor of the Exchequer(C. (52) 413) on proposals for revising and extending the existing scheme of pensions for the widows and children of members of the armed Forces.The Minister of Defence said that he had been approached inJuly by a deputation representing all Parties, which had urged upon him the need for improving the pensions of officers who had retiredbefore 1st September, 1950, and the pensions for officers&apos; widows and dependants, and for abolishing certain conditions of the award ofpensions, especially the imposition of a means test. In view of current financial difficulties he had &quot;decided not to propose any improvement in the pensions of retired officers. He did, however,feel strongly that steps should be taken to improve the lot of officers&apos;widows, for the rate of their pensions had been fixed as long ago as1914 and many of them were living in very straitened circumstances.He also thought it would be in accord with modern conditions toextend the pensions scheme to cover the widows of other ranks belowWarrant Officer Class I, provided that they had served a minimum of 22 years. His proposals would involve an additional cost of 160,000 in the first year, rising ultimately after a considerable lapse of time to  1 million per annum.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that these proposals wereinconsistent with the principles which had governed all pensions schemes since the introduction of National Insurance. All other classes of the community made contributions towards their widows&apos;pensions. While he admitted that many existing widows were in need of additional assistance, he still hoped that the basis of any new scheme for the Services might be contributory.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The announcement of an extension of the non-contributory pensions scheme for the Services would increase the difficulties of reaching agreement on pensions schemes for teachers and for thepolice. It was argued, on the other hand, that the Armed forces could be distinguished from any of these civilian services. most members of the Forces undertook only short engagements and nonecould assume that he would be retained in the Forces until the ageof 60 or later. A very large number of the members of theForces found themselves obliged to retire from the age of 40onwards.(b) Attempts had been made to work out a satisfactory con-tributory pensions scheme. Owing to the varying terms of engagement, it would be necessary to provide high rates of contribu-tion and to stipulate that contributions should continue to be paideven after retirement or discharge. A scheme on these lines wouldbe unpopular with the Services, would hamper recruitment and makeit difficult to persuade men to accept long-service engagements. Thecost to the Exchequer would be almost the same as the proposals forthe extension of the existing scheme.(c) The proposals put forward by the Minister of Defence were very modest. They had been based on the figure which the treasury had suggested as a possible Exchequer contribution to a contributoryElectoral 1.   The Prime Minister said that he had agreed to receive aReform. deputation, headed by Mr. Clement Davies, Leader of the liberal party in the House of Commons, on the question of electoral reform.He hoped that one or two of his Cabinet colleagues would accompanyhim when he received this deputation.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Minister^ statement.
3V]mscheme.  Anything less would: be unlikely to satisfy opinion in the &quot;lee&quot;House of Commons, especially as the request made by the all-Partydeputation to the Minister of Defence for an increase in officers&apos;pensions had been rejected.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thescheme proposed by the Minister of Defence was not a new one,but an extension and revision of one which had been in operationover a long period of years. There was, moreover, a clear distinctionto be drawn between the various civilian services and the armed forces. These two factors should make it easier to defend thecontinuance of a non-contributory scheme for the Services. TheChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Defence should consider the matter further in the light of the views expressed in thediscussion. Meanwhile, the Minister of Defence could promise, inreply to the questions which would be put to him in Parliament, thatan announcement would be made before Christmas.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerof Defence to review the proposals in C. (52) 410 and 413in- the light of the views expressed in their discussion, andto report to the Cabinet at an early date so that a firmannouncement could be made to Parliament before christmas.Meat Supplies.- 3. The Cabinet had before them a Note by the Chancellor of negotiations the Exchequer (C. (52) 400) covering a report by a committee of with Argentina, officials on the course of the current trade negotiations with Argentina.(Previous This suggested that three courses were now open to the united reference: Kingdom Government: (i) to seek a rapid settlement by concedingC.C.(52)95th all the main points on which the Argentines were insisting; (ii) to conclusions, refuse any further concessions, thereby risking a breakdown of the minute 5.)       negotiations; or (iii) to continue the discussions in the hope that areasonable settlement might be secured by conceding as little aspossible to the Argentine demands.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that we should takeadvantage of the fact, which the Minister of Food- had reported at the- Cabinefs earlier discussion on 11th November, that owing toimproved prospects of meat supplies from Australia and Uruguaythe weekly ration of carcase meat could be maintained at Is. Sd.until March 1953&apos;, even without any shipments from the Argentine.If it were announced at once that the ration could be held at this level for some time we could- make it dear in the negotiations thatwe were not dependent upon Argentine meat for some time to come,and we might hope thereby to force the Argentine Government toadopt a more reasonable attitude. This, would enable us to steer acourse somewhere between the second and third- of the alternativessuggested by the official committee. Thus, although we could afford to make some credit available to: Argentina,- we should continue to insist that this should not be used for the re-purchase of dollars.In discussion the following points were raised:  (a) The Commonwealth Secretary said that Australia and NewZealand would prefer that we should take a tougher line with theArgentine. They were concerned that we should pay so much more for Argentine meat than for theirs. Moreover, it was* likely that weshould shortly have to decline an Australian- request for a credit. he therefore welcomed the suggestion made by the Chancellor of theExchequer.(t)&apos; The&apos;Minister of Food said that, while he agreed in principle with the Chancellors- suggestion&apos;,, he doubted whether a settlement
4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord privy seal (C. (52) 409) suggesting that, in the debate on the renewal ofemergency powers which would be held in the House of commons on 20th November, the Government should indicate their readiness to agree to an enquiry into the means of improving Parliamentscontrol over delegated legislation.The Lord Privy Seal said that there were indications that in this debate the Opposition would press for such an enquiry and there wasa considerable body of opinion among Government supporters whichwould favour it. If the Cabinet accepted his view that the demandfor an enquiry should not be resisted, there were three further points to be considered, viz., (i) whether the enquiry should be limited to questions of procedure or should cover, as the DonoughmoreCommittee had done, the principles on which Parliament shoulddelegate the power to legislate; (ii) whether it should cover bot**delegated legislation.jfjf could be reached unless we were prepared to buy some canned cornedmeat from the Argentine. He could not afford to buy this within his existing quota under the approved import programme. He askedwhether he could not be authorised to buy some of it, say, 10,000 tons,on the understanding that it would not be placed on the market for current consumption but would be added to the stock, now very low,which was held against emergencies. The Chancellor o] theExchequer undertook to consider whether a limited purchase of canned corned meat could be authorised, for stockpiling, as an addition to the approved level of expenditure on food imports.(c) If we accepted the latest Argentine offer on the import of less essential commodities from the United Kingdom, there was little prospect that any significant quantity of these goods would in fact be exported to Argentina. If, however, we were able to afford to buysome canned corned meat, we might be able to make a more satis-factory arrangement for an exchange of less essential goods.(d) Discussion should continue on the question of remittancesand the settlement of claims in respect of public utilities; but theCabinet accepted the view of Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at buenos aires that we were unlikely to obtain full satisfaction on these points.(e) If a credit were granted to Argentina, it could not without legislation be carried on any Departmental Vote other than that ofthe Foreign Office. The Cabinet saw difficulty in finding Parlia-mentary time for legislation on this subject; but they were informedthat the Foreign Secretary was reluctant to carry this expenditure onthe Foreign Office Vote, since this might suggest that the credit wasbeing extended to Argentina on political grounds.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Food to announce that the weeklyration of carcase meat would be reduced to Is. Sd. from30th November, and held at that figure for some months.(2) Agreed that negotiations for a trade agreement with argentina should be continued, with the aim of reaching a settlement involving as few as possible of the con-cessions demanded by the Argentines; and that thedecision recorded in Conclusion (1) above should be usedto induce a more reasonable attitude on the part of theArgentine Government.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to settle, in con--sultation with the Minister of Food and the parliamentary under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the precise terms of the instructions to be sent to Her Majesty&apos;ambassador at Buenos Aires.(4). Deferred, until after the Foreign Secretary&apos;s return, a decisionon the question whether any credit extended to Argentinashould be borne on the Foreign Office Vote.
transport charges.Increase in freight Rates.(previous reference:CC. (52) 91stConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Transport (C. (52) 411) seeking the approval of the Cabinet to hisauthorising a 5 per cent, increase in railway freight, dock and canalcharges from 1st December, 1952.The Minister of Transport said that the costs of the british transport Commission had been increased, mainly on account of wage increases, by sums amounting in a full year to  32-3 millions.The Commission had applied for authority to increase by 5 per cent,their railway freight, dock and canal charges. The Transport Tribunalhad advised that the. increased costs could only be met in full byan increase of 1\ per cent, in railway freight, dock and canal charges,coupled with a similar and simultaneous increase in the Commission^road haulage rates. In giving this advice, the Tribunal had been influenced by their desire to retain full discretion to deal with the applications which the Commission would certainly make for increases in passenger fares early in 1953. He proposed to authorisean increase of 5 per cent, as requested by the Commission and to announce this at once in Parliament. He would emphasise that the increases were largely due to new wage rates and that they had no connection with the Transport Bill now before the House ofCommons.The Cabinet endorsed the Ministers proposal and agreed thatthe decision should be announced before the debate on the transport bill was concluded.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that he hoped theMinister would say that the increase in freights would be limited to5s. a ton. A corresponding limit on freights had been announcedwhen a 10 per cent, increase was authorised at the end of .195.1. TheMinister of Transport said that he would have to refer this to theTransport Commission and the Transport Tribunal but, if such a limitwas in fact to be imposed, he would announce this in his statement.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Transport to announce in theHouse of Commons that day that railway freight, dock and canal charges would be increased by 5 per cent, from 1st December, 1952.Houses of Parliament; and (iii) whether it should cover all delegate^legislation or be confined to. subordinate legislation made under emergency powers.Discussion showed that there was no general disposition in theCabinet to resist a demand for an enquiry into the question ofParliamentary control over delegated legislation. It was the general view of Ministers that this enquiry should cover both Houses ofParliament; that it should be restricted to the procedures by which parliament could best exercise control over delegated legislation; butthat it should extend to all delegated legislation and not merely to subordinate legislation made under emergency powers. The precisescope and method of enquiry could be settled after consultation withthe Opposition.The Cabinet Authorised the Home Secretary to state, in the forthcoming debate on delegated legislation in the House of Commons,that the Government were willing that an enquiry should beheld into the procedures for exercising Parliamentary controlover delegated legislation and that they were ready to discuss with the Opposition the precise form and scope of this enquiry.
