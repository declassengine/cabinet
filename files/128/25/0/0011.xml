Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in the the House of Commons in the following week.House of jt wag agree(j tjjat fae Assistant Postmaster-General should speakommons. fQT ^ Government in the debate on 23rd June on the Licence and agreement for the British Broadcasting Corporation. The HomeSecretary would hold himself in readiness to intervene in the debate,if required.Korea. 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that he had been considering,(Previous        in the light of reports from the Minister of Defence and the minister reference:      of State on their mission to Korea, what arrangements could be madeC.C. (52) 60th   to ensure that we were kept more closely and continuously informedConclusions,     on military and political developments in Korea.   Some dissatis-minute .)       faction was being expressed in Parliament about the existing arrangements.   He did not think it would be advisable to press atthis stage for British representation on the delegation conducting thearmistice negotiations: this would be taken to imply a lack of con-fidence between ourselves and the Americans.   He also saw difficultyin securing for ourselves a larger political role in Korea, though hewould discuss with the United States Secretary of State the possibilityof our appointing a more senior diplomatic representative with theSouth Korean Government.   A more promising possibility was the integration of British officers in the Headquarters of the united nations Command.   The Minister of Defence had reported that theUnited Nations Commander, General Mark Clark, had himselfsuggested the appointment of a British Deputy Chief of Staff for operations in Korea; and, if the United States Government could make a statement welcoming the introduction of some British officers,this would be helpful in allaying public anxiety in this country.   If. the Cabinet approved, the Minister of Defence might be asked todiscuss this suggestion with the United States military authorities in washington, with a view to stimulating an initiative on their part.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the Chiefs ofStaff had been quite satisfied with the military direction of operations in Korea from the time of the appointment of General Ridgway,and also with the handling of the military side of the armisticenegotiations. They did not favour the establishment of an integratedAllied Headquarters: the introduction into the Headquarters of anumber of comparatively junior British officers would have no effecton military policy. They were, however, ready to fall in with thesuggestion that a British Deputy Chief of Staff should be appointed.This officer would fit into the existing organisation and would not require a British staff.The Prime Minister said that the United Nations had entrustedthe conduct of the Korean campaign to the United States; and weshould be well-advised to avoid a position in which we shared theresponsibility without the means of making our influence effective.The difficulties that had arisen in Korea were political rather than military and our influence could be exerted most effectively by theForeign Secretary in his dealings with the United States Government.In further discussion there was general agreement with the limitedproposal for the appointment of a British Deputy Chief of Staff. TheCabinet considered that this should be a United Kingdom officer,rather than an Australian or Canadian.The Cabinet-CD Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform the Minister ofDefence that they would welcome the appointment of aBritish Deputy Chief of Staff for operations in Korea, andto ask him to discuss this proposal with the canadian government and subsequently with the United states military authorities.42454-2 B 2
(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to instruct Her Majesty&apos;ambassador in Washington to inform the Prime Ministerof Australia of this proposal during the course of his visit to Washington.The Coronation. 3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Com-(Previous commonwealth Secretary (C. (52) 197) recommending, on behalf of his reference: Committee, that Departments should be authorised to make prepara-C.C. (52) 43rd tions for the celebration of the Coronation on broadly the same scaleConclusions, as in 1937 at an estimated gross cost of  1-J million and inviting the minute 6.) Cabinet to decide whether additional expenditure of about  ^ million should be incurred on Army uniforms and Service Reviews.The following were the main matters covered in discussion:  (a) Army No. 1 DressThe Secretary of State for War said that the cost of his proposals had now been reduced to some  205,000, of which a proportion atleast might rank as part of the cost of the additional textile orders to relieve unemployment approved by the Cabinet on 10th June.The Prime Minister said that it was important to avoid any com-commitment to extend the issue of blue No. 1 dress throughout the Army.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the issue of blue No.. 1 dress to all Army troopstaking part in the Coronation parade at an estimated costof  205,000.(b) Service ReviewsThe Commonvsealth Secretary said that his Committee had feltthat, if any major feature of the 1937 Coronation celebrations had tobe omitted in 1953, this should be the Service Reviews, which mighttogether cost some  250,000. The Hyde Park Review of ex-service-men, on the other hand, would be likely to give satisfaction out of all proportion to its estimated cost of  4,000.There was general agreement that the cost of holding ServiceReviews could not be justified.  In view of the traditional associationof Naval Reviews with a Coronation, arrangements might, however,,   be made for some of Her Majesty&apos;s ships in home ports to be illumin-ated and to be &quot; at home &quot;to the public at the time of the Coronation.The Cabinet (2) Agreed that Coronation Reviews of the Fighting services should not be held in 1953.(c) Disposal of SeatsThe Minister of Works said that there was further evidence of amounting demand for seats for overseas visitors and the chances ofshowing a profit on the erection of stands by his Ministry were conse-quently improving.The Cabinet (3) Approved the plans for disposal of seats outlined in para-graph 14 of C. (52) 197, including the sale of blocks of seats to agencies at a profit.(d) Decorations, &amp;c.The Minister of Works said that the development of television and colour photography enhanced the importance of effective decorated-tions on the processional route. He therefore proposed on this occasion to spend only a very small proportion of the total sumallowed for decorations on buildings off the route, including provincialbuildings.
173CC. 61 (52)There was general agreement that it would be mistaken to restrictunduly expenditure on decoration of the processional route, flood-lighting and fireworks.The Cabinet--(4) Agreed that the Minister of Works should have discretion to spend up to  150,000 on these items.(e) Film rights the Commonwealth Secretary said that his Committee had con-sidered whether special steps should be taken to secure for theExchequer a proportion of the profits likely to be derived by thosereceiving facilities for filming the main Coronation events.There was general agreement that this would be inappropriate inrespect of the Abbey ceremony and that, so far as the procession was concerned, the practical objections were likely to be overwhelming.(/) MedalsThe Commonwealth Secretary said that, while the Royal Mintwould as usual strike a special Coronation medal as a decoration, itwas not proposed on this occasion to put any Coronation medals onsale to the public. At current prices the demand for such medalsseemed likely to be even smaller than in 1937.General agreement was expressed with this proposal but it wassuggested that the possibility of issuing a five-shilling piece, as for the festival of Britain, should be explored.The Cabinet (5) Agreed that in 1953 no Coronation medals should be put onsale to the public, but invited the Chancellor of theExchequer to consider the possibility of making a specialissue of five-shilling pieces.(g) Visit by The Queen to scotland the Secretary of State for Scotland said that a small additionalcharge might be incurred on account of a visit by Her Majesty to scotland as part of the Coronation celebrations.It was explained that the provision for contingencies in theEstimate of the Ministry of Works took account of this item.(h) Presentation to School-children the Lord President suggested that the possibility should beconsidered of making some small presentation to school-children to mark the Coronation. He believed that such a presentation had beenmade at at least one Coronation before 1937.The Cabinet (6) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to arrange for thepossibility of a Coronation presentation to school-children to be examined.(i) Expenditure by Local authorities the Minister of Housing and Local Government said that,following the 1937 precedent, he intended to issue a circular to localauthorities in accordance with the Local Government Act, 1933,authorising them to incur reasonable expenditure on Coronationcelebrations.(j) Committee arrangements the Commonwealth Secretary said that it had been suggested to him that it might be desirable to merge the small Committee over which he had presided with the Coronation Committee of the Privy
Council. He was inclined to think, however, that there might be a continuing need for a small Committee composed of Ministers only,to which points requiring Ministerial guidance, particularly thoseinvolving questions of expenditure, might be referred.The Cabinet (7) Invited the Prime Minister to consider whether a ministerial committee on Coronation Preparations would continue tobe needed and, if so, what form it should take.In conclusion, the Prime Minister said that the Cabinet wereindebted to the Commonwealth Secretary and his colleagues on theCommittee for the guidance contained in the memorandum beforethem, with which they were in general agreement.The Cabinet-(8) Approved the recommendations made in sub-para-graphs 1 (a) and (b) of paragraph 17 of C. (52) 197.4. In the debate on the White Paper on Broadcasting held inthe House of Commons on 11th June, the Labour Party had pressedtheir opposition to the proposal that Governors of the british broadcasting Corporation should in future be appointed andremovable by a committee under the chairmanship of the speaker of the House of Commons. The Government would have been in serious political embarrassment if they had appeared to withdraw thisproposal in deference to Opposition criticism; and the Oppositionamendment had been defeated. As, however, the proposed appoint-ment of the committee had thus become a matter of political controversy, the Speaker and the two Judges (whose membership ofthe committee was intended to guarantee its impartiality) had nowindicated that they would not feel able to accept appointment to it.The Leader of the Opposition had also declined to act.The Prime Minister said that in these circumstances the Govern-ment had no choice but to drop this proposal and to advise her majesty that the existing system by which Governors were appointedby the Crown on the sole recommendation of the Prime Minister ofthe day should be continued. He proposed to make a statement tothat effect in the House of Commons that afternoon.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Prime Minister to advise the Queen that theexisting method of appointment and removal of governors of the British Broadcasting Corporation shouldbe continued.(2) Took note, with approval, of the terms of the announcement on this matter which the Prime Minister was proposing tomake in the House of Commons that afternoon.(3) Invited the Postmaster-General to arrange for the relevant provisions of the Corporation^ new Charter to be adjustedaccordingly.british broadcasting corporation.Renewal ofthe Charter.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 58thConclusions,Minute 7.)government offices.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 10thConclusions,Minute 7.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Works (C. (52) 184) reporting progress in his efforts tosecure further economy in the use of office space by GovernmentDepartments.The Minister of Works said that substantial progress had beenmade, and that since his memorandum was prepared the War Officeand the Ministry of Food had undertaken to surrender between them
over 100,000 square feet. As a result of these measures he hadalready been able to surrender a number of requisitioned buildings.Further plans for the concentration of Government staffs were underdiscussion with Departments; and he hoped that these would resultin more derequisitioning both in London and in provincial towns.These achievements would receive publicity in the monthly statements which he now issued on the progress of derequisitioning.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of C. (52) 184 and of the supple-mentary statement made by the Minister of Works.Official Cars. 6.   The Minister of Works made a brief report on the progress(Previous        of his plans for securing economy in the use of official cars.   AllReference:      official cars, save those used by the Foreign Office and the Post OfficeCC. (51) 19th   for the transport of documents, had now been brought together in a conclusions,     single pool; and cars which had previously been distributed over tenMinute 5.)       garages were to be concentrated in two.   Forty-one Service driverspreviously employed on this work had returned, with their vehicles,to military duties; and seventy-five civilian vehicles had been dis-pensed with.   Despite these economies there were no indications that departments were dissatisfied with the service now provided for them.The Prime Minister suggested that he might make someannouncement on this subject in the near future in answer to a parliamentary Question.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of Works.Building. 7.   xhe Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisterLicensing of Works (C. (52) 199) proposing an alteration in the limits belowLimits. which building operations may be carried out without licence.The Minister of Works said that, in order to increase productivity in the building industry, he was anxious to relax the limits nowimpqged on maintenance work. He was satisfied that this couldbe done without reducing the resources available for new building.He would himself have wished to make a substantial advance towardsthe point at which all detailed control over private maintenance work could be abandoned; but his colleagues on the Economic PolicyCommittee and the Building Committee with whom he had discussed the matter were doubtful about the expediency of going so far. in deference to their views he now proposed that for the twelve month sending 30th June, 1953, no change should be made in the limit of 500 which could be spent, without licence, on building work on industrial and agricultural buildings, but that the corresponding figure for houses and other buildings should be raised from  100 to  200.The Minister of Housing and Local Government supported thisproposal.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Works to increase from  100 to 200 the limit of expenditure which might be incurred,without licence, during the year ending 30th June, 1953, on building work on houses and other &quot; non-designated&quot;buildings.
Food Prices.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 57thConclusions,Minute 3.)Milk.other food-stuffs.8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Food (C. (52) 188) proposing that the price of milk should beincreased by Id. a quart from 1st July. This was a seasonal increase,and had been foreshadowed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer inhis Budget statement as one of the measures necessary to reduce therate of food subsidies to  250 million a year.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Food to increase milk prices byId. a quart from 1st July, 1952.The Cabinet also discussed the timing of the other increases in food prices which they had approved on 29th May. It was thegeneral view of the Cabinet that these further price increases shouldbe introduced simultaneously in the autumn, when the increasedfamily allowances and the other remaining Budget concessions came into operation.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Minister of Food to arrange, in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, for the remainingincreases in food prices, set out in Appendix to C. (52)178, to be introduced simultaneously at the time whenincreased family allowances came into operation in theautumn.9. The Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, fuel and Power said that, in the light of the Cabinefs discussion on27th May, he had kept continuously under review the possibility ofincreasing the amount of coal which could be made available forexport. He had come to the conclusion that a further quantity of1 million tons could now be made available for this purpose duringthe current year.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.Atomic Energy. 10. The Paymaster-General said that some years previously,when we were negotiating with the Belgians a contract for the supplyof uranium, we had promised to help them to construct an experi-mental pile. The Belgians now wished to build this pile, and had asked for the services of a British expert to take charge of the work.It was gratifying that they should have asked for a British, ratherthan an American, expert; and it was desirable that the Belgians&apos;work on atomic energy should be developed in association with ourselves. It was important to retain their goodwill in respect ofthe uranium contract, which would fall due for renewal in 1956.These considerations seemed to outweigh the slight security risks which were involved in complying with this request.The Foreign Secretary endorsed this view. He suggested thatthe United States authorities should be told in advance what we proposed to do, though their consent need not be sought.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Paymaster-General to make available to theBelgian Government a suitable expert to superintend theconstruction in Belgium of an experimental pile.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for the UnitedStates authorities to be informed in advance that this assistance was to be given to the Belgian Government.Coal Exports.(previous reference:C.C.
