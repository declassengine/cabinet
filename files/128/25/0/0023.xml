Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The debate on the economic situation would be held on 29thand 30th July. The Chancellor of the Exchequer would open the debate, and the Prime Minister would speak first on the second day.Unless the Opposition objected, the debate should be held on aGovernment motion.The debate on the ratification of the German settlements wouldtake place on 31st July and 1st August.It was hoped that Parliament would be adjourned for the summer recess on 1st August. It would reassemble on 14th October. Thedate provisionally fixed for the reopening of the new session inNovember need not be announced at this stage.Parliament. 2.   The Cabinefs  attention was drawn to  a motion bySalaries of       Miss Irene Ward, M.P., deprecating the suggestion that a committeeMembers.       should be appointed to examine the salaries and allowances ofMembers of Parliament.The Prime Minister said that the Leader of the Opposition had suggested to him that a proposal to increase Members&apos; salaries wouldbe favourably received in many quarters of the House. He himselfconsidered, however, that the moment was not opportune forproposing any review of Members&apos; salaries; and he had&quot; ascertained that his view was shared by a substantial body of government supporters. He had therefore told the Leader of the Opposition thatthe Government were not prepared to take this matter up at thepresent time.The Commonwealth Secretary said that similar representations were being made to him on behalf of Members of the House of Lords.There was no question of payment of a salary; but it was arguable that, in addition to receiving their railway fares, Peers should beallowed to treat some of the other costs incidental to their attendance at the House of Lords as expenses for purposes of taxation. ThePrime Minister said that this was a matter which might be taken upeither in connection with proposals for the reform of the House ofLords or at the time of any future review of salaries of Members ofthe House of Commons.The Cabinet agreed that no time should be found for thediscussion of Miss Ward&apos;s motion in the House of Commons. they also agreed that the Commonwealth Secretary should take note of the representations made to him on behalf of Peers, but should hold outno hope that any early action would be taken in response to them.Counsellors of 3.   The Cabinet were informed that a Bill has now been pre-State. pared to amend the Regency Act, 1937, so as to include Queen(Previous Elizabeth, The Queen Mother, among the persons qualified for reference: appointment as Counsellors of State.   The Cabinet agreed that in C.C. (52) 35th view of the congestion of the Parliamentary time-table this Bill should conclusions, not be introduced in the current session.Minute 4.)4. The Cabinet noted with approval that the Minister of Foodproposed to announce that evening an increase in the weekly meat ration from Is. 9d. to.2s.Meat Ration.(previous reference:CC. (52) 52ndConclusions,Minute 6.)
Egypt. 5.   The Minister of State said that Her Majesty&apos;s Charg^l(Previous        d&apos;Affaires in Cairo had received a message from a member of the reference:      former Egyptian Government suggesting that the coup d&apos;Etat byC.C. (52) 72nd   General Naguib was the result of a movement inspired by Corn-Conclusions,     munists and the Moslem Brethren and aimed at the introduction of minute!.)       a revolutionary anti-capitalist regime.   This suggestion, thoughpossibly exaggerated, had enough substance to justify the alerting ofBritish forces in the area.   It was the Foreign Secretary&apos;s view thatHer Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, now on leave, should return to egypt and that the British&apos; forces earmarked for action in Cairo and alexandria in the event of British lives being endangered should bebrought to twenty-four hours&apos; notice.   He thought that if this was done, the Egyptian Government should be informed that the soleobject of any British troop movements was to ensure that British livescould be protected if they became endangered.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) If these forces were brought to twenty-four hours&apos; notice,men as well as stores would be embarked in the ships. If the noticewere put at forty-eight hours, the ships could be loaded with thenecessary stores and equipment, and the men could be quicklyembarked if an emergency developed.   The ships required for- operations at Alexandria were at present dispersed, some of thembeing on a visit to Istanbul. If they were to be brought to forty-eight hours&apos; notice this visit would have to be cancelled, and this could notbe done without publicity. It was the view of the Cabinet that thepresent movement of ships should not be. altered, but that theCommander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, should be asked to do what hecould to reduce the period of notice for the operation as far belowninety-six hours as possible.(b) It was too early to tell whether General Naguib himselfcontrolled the situation or whether he was the tool of unreliablepolitical figures. If a threat of Communist dictatorship developedit might be necessary to take action for the protection of British lives;and we might then secure the assent and approval of the free worldfor intervention designed to preserve a democratic regime. In themeantime, however, so long as there was no danger to British lives,any move by British forces would be regarded as an &quot;intervention inEgypfs domestic affairs.(c) It was questionable whether any formal announcement of our intentions should be made at this stage to the present Egyptian Gov-ernment. It might be preferable to give an informal assurance toGeneral Naguib through military channels that we had no intentionof intervening unless British lives were endangered.Later in the meeting the Cabinet were informed that the foreign secretary endorsed the suggestion that movements of Her Majesty&apos;s ships should not be interrupted at this stage. He agreed that british forces in the Canal Zone should be brought to forty-eight hours&apos;notice. He would consider further, in the light of events, whether any information of our intentions should be given to the egyptian authorities, and, if so, by what channels.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Defence to arrange that the british forces in the Canal Zone earmarked for operations in cairo should be brought to forty-eight hours&apos; notice.(2) Agreed that for the present the movements of units of theMediterranean fleet should not be interrupted but that,short of this, all practicable steps should be taken toensure that they would be ready to take part in operations in Alexandria at the shortest possible notice.(3) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would consider further whether any information should be given to the Egyptiansabout the purpose of these preparations.
IIlp Charges forOverseasTelegrams.(previous reference:CC. (52) 71stConclusions,Minute 5.)import programme.(previous reference:CC (52) 69thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Postmaster-General said that he had discussed with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of State the proposed increase in the rate of charges for telegrams to the United Statesand Canada. A refusal to allow this increase, which was in fact lessthat half of what the American companies had asked for, would be resented as discrimination against these companies, which had been required over a long period to operate at a considerable loss. It was true that their receipt of additional revenue would mean that theywould no longer be obliged to import dollars to make good their losses on their operations in this country, but this could not be repre-sented as a direct loss of dollars to the United Kingdom. The UnitedKingdom could not be self-sufficient in overseas telegraphic servicesand, if a satisfactory service was to be provided, there must be close co-operation with other countries. For these reasons he and theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of State had agreed torecommend that the increase in the North American rates should beallowed, and that he should arrange for the general increase in charges for overseas telegrams to be announced, before Parliament rose forthe summer recess, in reply to a Question in the House of Commons.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposed rate of increase for telegrams to theUnited States and Canada.(2) Authorised the Postmaster-General to arrange for theincrease in charges for overseas telegrams to be announced in the House of Commons, before the summer recess, on a date to be agreed in consultation with the Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster.7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C. (52) 251) summarising the final outcome of his efforts to close the estimated gap of  175 million in the balance ofpayments during the second half of 1952.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the total estimatedsavings, by reduced imports and increased exports, now amounted to 123 million. These included a reduction of  4 million on importsof coarse grains; and he hoped that, if the home harvest was good, hewould be able to make a further cut of  1 million before the end ofthe year. The import cuts involved no reduction in the consumptionlevels of rationed food. In his speech in the forthcoming debate onthe economic situation he would not specify the import cuts in detail,nor would he disclose present stock levels, although the general stock position was in fact better than in July 1951. He wished to stress inthe debate the increase in coal exports, and he understood that theSecretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Power,no longer raised objection to this. He hoped to show that, as aresult of the great efforts made, the sterling area should be in balanceby the end of 1952. He would, however, emphasise that this was no more than the beginning of a long and arduous operation to buildup our reserves and increase our exports. He hoped that the remain-ing gap between  175 million and  123 million would be filled bywaiver of the interest&apos;on the United States and Canadian loans, butthe decision on that point would not be taken before the end of theThe Cabinet (1) Approved the total savings of  123 million shown in thememorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(C. (52) 251) and invited the Ministers concerned to put them into effect forthwith.year.
investment in 8.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of1953. the Exchequer (C. (52) 249) recommending further adjustments in the investment programme for 1953.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the demands of theDepartments for building in 1953 totalled  110 million of new building in excess of the programme for 1952. This wouldinvolve an unwarrantable diversion of resources from exports.He considered that the limit for new building work in 1953should not exceed  900 million, but he was prepared to takethe risk of allowing a figure of  933 million, which mightbe achieved if all Departments would accept a 5 per cent,reduction on the allocations hitherto proposed. This would mean a lower housing programme, but he thought it would be difficult tojustify the cuts proposed in defence works and other programmes if no cut were made in housing. If no money limits were imposed onthe building programmes, it was certain that building resources wouldbe diverted to inessential purposes and probable that much work would be started which, for lack of materials, could not be finished.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that the foundations for the houses to be built in 1953 were already laid andthat unless contracts were cancelled and materials withheld, 260,000houses would be built in that year. If expenditure on housing in 1953were limited to  395 million, the resources now employed on theprogramme would not be transferred to other building work: the sole result would be that productivity would decrease and the momentum of the programme would be lost. The political effectswould also be serious: the public, as well as the building industry,would be greatly discouraged. He was therefore unwilling to agreeto any reduction in the housing target for 1953. The programme for1954, to which he was not yet committed, could be reviewed inNovember. It should be possible to include in that a much larger number of houses of new designs which would secure great economies in imported materials, and it was his aim to build in 1954 as many as300,000 houses with no more timber than was being used for 230,000houses in 1952.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that,whatever decisions were reached he hoped that the investment pro-gramme would not be made public. The publication of these limits on the various sectors of the building programme could not fail tocramp the expansion of productivity in the building industry. Therewas general agreement with the view that the programme should notbe made public.(b) The Prime Minister said that in his view it would be unwise to curtail the housing programme in the critical year 1953. If the momentum was lost in that year, it would be more difficult to achieve the economies planned for 1954 by the use of novel designs.(c) It was suggested in paragraph 9 of C. (52) 249 that the housing programme should in future be brought within the starting-datecontrol operated by Regional Building Committees. The Minister of housing and Local Government said that this procedure was inappropriate-priate for single houses, but he was ready to agree that it should beapplied to large housing schemes. He was also willing to co-operate in special interdepartmental discussion of the building problems of(2) Took note that, when the yield of the home harvest was ^known, further consideration would be given to thepossibility of making a further cut in imports of coarse grains before the end of the year.
61CC. 73 (52)particular areas, such as Coventry, where it appeared that building resources were being drawn into housing work at the expense of productive industry or other projects of national importance.(d) The President of the Board of Trade said that the impositionof a further cut on new building for manufacturing industry was notconsistent with the efforts which were being made to expand exports.He hoped that manufacturing industry might be allowed a total of 100 million, which was less than his original demand.The Prime Minister said that he thought it would be wrong toaccept any reduction in the housing programme for 1953. the target of 260,000 houses should be retained, but within that targetevery effort should be made to reduce the use of building labour and imported materials. The reductions proposed in C. (52) 249 for otherbuilding programmes might be accepted as a general guide, subjectto a margin not exceeding  10 million which would give the Chan-cellor of the Exchequer some discretion in judging additional demands for work of particular importance, e.g., the manufacturing industry devoted to the export trade.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the limitations imposed by the investment pro-gramme should not operate to prevent the HousingMinisters from reaching their target of completing260,000 houses in 1953.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1), approved in principle the reduc-tions in the investment programme proposed by theChancellor of the Exchequer in C. (52) 249, as a generalguide to the distribution of building resources in 1953.(3) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to discuss withthe President of the Board of Trade and other ministers concerned the possibility of increasing the limits proposedin C. (52) 249 by an amount not exceeding  10 million for projects likely to assist in redressing the adverse balance of payments.Trade 9.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Presi-Agreement with dent of the Board of Trade (C. (52) 256) on the course of the recentCzechoslovakia, negotiations in Prague with a view to establishing quotas for the nextImport of        twelve months under the trade agreement with Czechoslovakia.Textiles.The President of the Board of Trade said that, in view of thecurrent unemployment in Lancashire, there was some public anxiety about the continued import of textiles from Czechoslovakia. Hisrepresentatives had, however, been successful in persuading the Czechsto agree that their exports of textiles and clothing to this country inthe coming year should be reduced to  200,000, or even  150,000, ascompared with the current years quota of  300,000, provided thatcompensating increases were given in the quotas for other less essential commodities: He was satisfied that, if we attempted to cutoff altogether the import of textiles from Czechoslovakia, we shouldseriously jeopardise the prospects of concluding an agreement whichin other respects was greatly to our advantage.The Minister of State asked that care should be taken to ensurethat the compensating increases in other import quotas were such that they could be defended against criticism by other european countries. The President of the Board of Trade said that he had thispoint in mind.
\ S Q\k\The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (52) 256 regarding the rate of import of textiles and clothing from Czechoslovakia in thecoming year, and took note that the President of the Boardof Trade would explain the position in a statement to bemade in the House of Commons in the following week.The Fishing 10.

This problem had been discussed by the Home Affairs Com-mittee. There was general agreement that some financial incentiveshould be provided, but there were differences of view about themethod of doing so. The Treasury were unable to agree that loansshould be provided at a reduced rate of interest, since this would be inconsistent with the Government^ credit policy. Other ministers were, however, opposed to the alternative that the Government shouldtake shares in the companies owning these boats, since this wouldinvolve direct Government participation in private industry. -The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in the circumstances he was ready to give further consideration to the possibility of devisingsome special system of Exchequer grants.The Cabinet-Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer wouldreview this question and submit further proposals for the cabinet&apos;s consideration at a meeting in the following week.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,24th July, 1952.
