1. The Cabinet took note of Parliamentary comment on theaction taken by the Minister of Labour in referring back certain proposals submitted by Wages Councils for wage increases for workers in the distributive trades. This question was likely to bediscussed again in the House of Commons before the summer recess,either on a Supply Day or in the course of the forthcoming debate onthe economic situation.The Minister of Labour said that, if after reconsideration theWages Councils recommended any wage increases, there was no power under the existing law to make the awards retrospective to thedate on which the original proposals had been referred back. He was considering whether anything could be done to meet that difficulty;but amending legislation was hardly practicable and it would not be easy to persuade employers in these industries voluntarily to makethe retrospective payments. The Minister undertook to keep theCabinet informed of futher developments.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Supply (C. (52) 246) covering a revised draft of the white paper on the iron and steel industry.The Commonwealth Secretary recalled that the Cabinefs dis-cussion on 15th July had proceeded on the basis that the alternativesopen to the Government were either to publish the White Paper orto make before the recess a firm declaration of their intention toproceed with the Iron and Steel Bill in the autumn. A draft of sucha declaration had been prepared, in accordance with the cabinets decision; but, on considering it, he had come to the conclusion thata statement on those lines would accord less well with the views whichhe had urged in the Cabinefs discussion than the publication of theWhite Paper itself. He was also attracted by the suggestion, madeby the Minister of Supply, that after the issue of the White Papera statement should be made on the general lines indicated in para-graph 3 of C. (52) 246 indicating the Government&apos;s readiness toconsider any constructive amendments to their scheme which wouldprovide a basis for an agreed settlement. It would be convenient,he thought, if such a statement were made in the course of the debate on the economic situation which was to be held in the House ofCommons during the following week. On this basis he was readyto agree that the White Paper should be published before the recess,in the terms of the revised draft annexed to C. (52) 246.Discussion showed there was general support in the Cabinet forthe early publication of the White Paper.The Lord Privy Seal said that care should be taken to avoid any commitment about the date by which the Bill might be passed into law, as there were already signs that the Parliamentary time-table inthe following session was likely to become seriously congested.The Cabinet - (1) Authorised the Lord Privy Seal to announce, in his statement on Business on 24th July, that the White Paper on thefuture of the iron and steel industry would be presented in the following week.(2) Authorised the Minister of Supply to arrange for the presen-tation of the White Paper, in the terms of the draft annexed to C. (52) 246, and to settle the date of presen-tation in consultation with the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange that in thecourse of the forthcoming debate in the House ofCommons on the economic situation a statement wouldbe made, on the general lines suggested in paragraph 3 ofC. (52) 246, indicating the Government&apos;s readiness to seek an agreed settlement of this question.42627 b 2&apos; Wages.(previous reference:CC.

Parliament.Debates onGermanSettlements.3. The Cabinet agreed that the debate on the ratification of^the settlements with Germany should be taken in the House ofCommons on 31st July and 1st August. On one or other of thesetwo days a corresponding debate would be held in the House ofLords. The Cabinet approved the terms of a motion to be tabledfor this purpose, on the Governments behalf, in both Houses.This debate would conclude the business to be transacted by theHouse of Commons before the recess; and it might therefore bepossible to arrange, through the usual channels, that the House should meet at 11 a.m. on 1st August and proceed, after 4 p.m., to the debate on the Adjournment. In that event it would not be necessary forthe House to meet on Saturday, 2nd August. The Lord Privy Sealand The Chief Whip undertook to explore this suggestion with theLeaders of the Opposition Parties.4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the LordChancellor and the Home Secretary (C. (52) 231) proposing that theregulations to be made under section 42 of the Justices of the PeaceAct, 1949, should provide for compensation for the part-time clerks toJustices who would be displaced by the reorganisation to be carriedout under that Act.The Home Secretary said that this proposal had been contestedby the Ministers responsible for the administration of other post-warActs under which part-time officials had been denied compensationfor loss of office on reorganisation of the service concerned. In those cases, however, the displacement of the part-time officials had beenincidental to the reorganisation of the service. Here the dis-placement of the part-time clerks was one of the primaryfeatures of the proposed reorganisation of the magistrates&apos;, courts.The Act had been passed on the assumption that compensation wouldbe available; and, if it were not, the part-time clerks would not bedisplaced and the reorganisation would be largely frustrated.The Lord Chancellor supported this view. The administrationof justice by magistrates&apos; courts could be greatly improved if theproportion of full-time clerks were increased; and there was a strong case in equity for compensating the part-time clerks displaced by thisreorganisation. In the House of Lords, certainly, the Governmentwould be charged with breach of faith if they attempted to bringthe reorganisation into effect without providing compensation for those displaced by it.In discussion it was suggested that, in view of the Governmentsplea for restraint in the presentation of wages claims, this was not anopportune moment at which to go forward with this compensation scheme. The reorganisation was not due to come into operation until 1st April 1953; and consideration of the compensation plan could be deferred until the autumn.The Cabinet Deferred consideration of the proposal in C. (52) 231 untilsoon after Parliament re-assembled in the autumn.Magistrates&apos;Courts.Compensationfor Part-timeClerks.Charges forOverseasTelegrams.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePostmaster-General (C. (52) 242) recommending an increase ofroughly one-third in overseas telegraphic rates.The Postmaster-General said that these rates had not been raisedsince 1929. The increase now proposed was needed to enable cable and Wireless, Ltd., to pay its way. Rates to all countries save North
America would be raised by about one-third; but the CommonwealthPress rate would remain at its present level of Id. a word. special arrangements were to be made about the rate to North America. Thebulk of this traffic was handled by American cable companies, whohad been operating at a loss for many years and* were pressing foran increase. He proposed that the increase should be from Sd. a word to Is. a word. This would still compare favourably with the reverse rate of Is. A\d. a word from North America to this country.Most of the benefit of this increase would go to the American com-panies, and he estimated that their additional revenue would be 380,000 a year, which might be reduced by  65,000 a year by virtueof new accounting arrangements which were now being negotiated.In discussion the following points were made:  id) The increased rates would occasion some public discontentand further criticism of the extravagance of nationalised undertakings.On the other hand, there had been no increase in rates since 1929and, if Cable and Wireless, Ltd., were not allowed to cover theircosts, the deficiency would have to be met by a Treasury subsidy.(b) The Minister of State asked why the proposed increase inthe rates to Scandinavia was so much larger than that proposed inthe rates to other European countries. The Postmaster-Generalexplained that the Scandinavian services were operated by a separatecompany, on which Scandinavian interests were fully represented,and that this company was pressing for this larger increase.(c) While there was some case for increasing rates to othercountries in order to raise additional revenue in sterling, would it notbe difficult to justify the increased charges to North America, if thatmeant that increased profits would be passed back in dollars to the parent companies in North America?The Cabinet -(1) Approved in principle the proposed increases in charges for overseas telegrams proposed in C. (52) 242 (with theexception of the rates to the United States and Canada)and the retention of the Commonwealth Press rate of id. per word.(2) Invited the Postmaster-General and the Chancellor of theExchequer to reconsider the proposed increase in the ratefor telegrams to the United States and Canada, and toreport the results of their discussions to the Cabinet.6. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Prime Minister(C. (52) 250) covering a draft statement prepared by the Minister ofDefence on the proposed appointment of a Deputy Chief of staff to the United Nations Commander in Korea. A revised draft state-ment, prepared by the Foreign Secretary, was circulated at themeeting.The Prime Minister said that the appointment of a Common-wealth officer as Deputy Chief of Staff to the United Nations Com-mander in Korea would be held to give us more responsibility forthe conduct of the operations without any increase in our power to influence it. The Foreign Secretary thought, however, that it wouldbe a mistake to abandon the proposal, which had first been put for-ward by the United Nations Commander himself.The Cabinet examined the two draft statements before them andthe following points were made:  (a) It was unnecessary to repeat in the statement the text ofthe instructions which were to be given to the officer appointed asDeputy Chief of Staff..(b) The statement should make it clear that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment accepted no more responsibility for the conduct of theKorea.Appointment ofa deputy chief of Staff.(previous reference:CC. (52) 64thConclusions,Minute 1.)
operations than they had at present as a member of the United!Nations, who had entrusted to the United States Government theconduct of the Korean operations on their behalf. It should alsobe made clear that the channel for consultation about Korea would continue to be between our representatives in Washington and theUnited States Government and military authorities there.(c) The statement, revised on the lines agreed in discussion,should be made in the House of Lords by the Minister of Defence,and in the House of Commons by the Parliamentary Secretary to theMinistry of Defence, as part of the statement which was to be madeon 28th July on the military situation in Korea.The Cabinet (1) Approved the appointment of a United Kingdom officer asDeputy Chief of Staff at the Headquarters of the united nations Commander in Korea.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence to arrange for statements tobe made in both Houses of Parliament as agreed in thediscussion.The Minister of State said that the previous Government had decided that these assets should be paid over to.benevolent institu-tions for distribution to all prisoners of war, civilian internees andtheir dependants who were resident in the United Kingdom and couldprove need and hardship. This decision was both unpopular and difficult to administer, and the Foreign Secretary now thought it wouldbe more satisfactory to distribute the money on a per capita basis tothose prisoners of war and civilian internees who had been in thehands of the Japanese. There were about 38,000 of these, and therewere, in addition, 10,000 dependants of persons who had died incaptivity. On a per capita basis these people would receive about 20 each. This proposal was supported by the Service Ministers andwould be welcomed by the Far Eastern Prisoners of War association and the British Legion.In discussion the following arguments were advanced against theproposal:  (a) The President of the Board of Trade and the parliamentary under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had publicly endorsed the proposals made by the previous Government.(b) The voluntary organisations had been led to expect that theywould receive these Japanese assets for distribution.(c) The merchant seamen concerned were in favour of thealternative method of distribution according to need, through theKing George&apos;s Fund for Sailors.(d) Individual claims by United Kingdom nationals for loss of assets and property in Japan had not been met, and these claims would doubtless be revived if a direct distribution of Japanese assets1were now made to former prisoners of war and civilian internees.(e) The Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposal would be difficult to administer.The Prime Minister said that discussion had revealed disad-vantages in the scheme now proposed, and the matter should beconsidered again after the Foreign Secretary&apos;s return.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their discussion of the disposal of japanese assets in the United Kingdom (C. (52)&quot; 229) at a later meeting.Japanese assets in UnitedKingdom.7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (52) 229) on the disposal of Japanese assets in the UnitedKingdom for the benefit of former prisoners of war.
47CC. 71 (52)^larshaH 8.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ForeignScholarships. Secretary (C. (52) 244) proposing that a number of scholarships for american students at British Universities should be established tocommemorate the European Recovery Programme (known as the marshall Plan). This proposed that there should be a maximum of twelve scholarships a year at a cost in sterling of  20,000 in thethird year and each succeeding year. Each scholar would receive 600 a year and, if he were married, an additional  200. Thescholarships would be open to women and to married students. Thecost of administration in the United States was estimated at$10,000-$15,000.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Rhodes Scholarships at Oxford University had yieldedexcellent results in the development of understanding and co-opera-tion between the United Kingdom and the United States. these results Were largely due to the fact that Rhodes Scholars took a fullshare in the corporate life of the Oxford Colleges. It was doubtfulwhether the same results would be achieved by scholarships open to women and to married students.(6) Was it desirable that the basic value of a Marshall Scholar-ship should be  100 a year more than that of Rhodes Scholarships.(c) The estimated cost of administration in the United Statesseemed unduly high. Would it not be possible to arrange forthe Rhodes trustees to undertake the work of selection and administration?The Cabinet-(1) Approved in principle the proposal to establish MarshallScholarships to be held by American students at universities in the United Kingdom in commemorationof the European Recovery Programme.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider the suggestions made in the discussion, as noted in paragraphs (a) to (c)above, and to report further to the Cabinet.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,22nd July, 1952.
