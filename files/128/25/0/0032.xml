$Korea.ArmisticeTalks.(previous reference:CC. (52) 60thConclusions,Minute 4.)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theForeign Secretary (C. (52) 313) on the stage reached in the KoreanArmistice talks.The Foreign Secretary said that the latest proposals of the united nations Command, which were based in part upon suggestions madeby us, seemed unlikely to be accepted by the Communists atPanmunjom. In that event we should have to consider whether to urge upon the United States and Commonwealth Governments thedesirability of putting forward an earlier proposal of our own whichthe United States Government had not adopted. This was, broadly,that both sides should carry out all the articles of the armisticeagreement already agreed between them and that the disposal ofprisoners whose status remained in dispute after the cease-fire shouldbe the subject of later negotiations. He would be grateful if hiscolleagues would keep this proposal in mind, as he might have to seek their authority to press it upon the United States government at a later stage.The Cabinet-Took note of C. (52) 313 and of the Foreign Secretary^statement.2)1Trieste. 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that he was anxious to seize the(Previous        opportunity provided by his recent talks with Signor De Gasperi and reference:      with Marsnal Tito to try to bring about a permanent settlement in C.C (52) 5lst    Trieste.  He had become convinced that there was no real prospectConclusions,     of devising a settlement acceptable to both sides on the basis of minute 1.)       exchanges of territory or of populations between the Zones, and thatthe best course was to seek to persuade both Governments to accepta permanent division of the area on the basis of the existing Zoneboundaries. An approach to the two Governments must now be madejointly with the United States Government.   He had considered whether we should seek to impose this solution upon the two Govern-ments or should merely commend it to them.   The United StatesGovernment were unlikely to agree to the former course in view ofits probable effect on the Italian voters in the forthcoming presidential election, and the imminence of elections in Italy strengthened the argument for confining ourselves to recommending this settlement to the two Governments.The Cabinet-Approved the policy outlined by the Foreign Secretary, and invited him to proceed accordingly in conjunction with theUnited States Government.Yugoslavia.(previous reference:CC. (52) 53rdConclusions,Minute 9.)3. The Foreign Secretary reported to the Cabinet on had discussions with Marshal Tito and the impressions he had formedduring his recent visit to Yugoslavia. He had returned convinced of the steady evolution from Communism which was taking placethere and of the genuine desire of the Yugoslav Government toco-operate with the Western Powers. Marshal Tito had taken up withunexpected alacrity the suggestion that he might visit this countryin the New Year. The timing and nature of such a visit would need further thought.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.
Persia.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 81stConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Cabinet were informed that the Prime Minister, had sent a personal message to President Truman (No. 4087 to washington) accompanying the draft of a joint reply to dr. Musaddiq&apos;s message (No. 4088 to Washington).The Foreign Secretary said that the President was absent from washington on an election tour, and the State Departments firstresponse to this message had been discouraging. He had thoughtit advisable to send at once a strongly-worded reply combatingthe State Departments attitude.The Prime Minister said that we must do all in our power tomaintain a joint Anglo-American pressure on the Persian Govern-ment, though in the last resort we had no means of preventing theUnited States Government from financing Dr. Musaddiq in the hopeof preventing Persia from going Communist.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.Oil.FederalGrand JuryProceedingsin the U.S.A.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 78thConclusions,Minute 5.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theForeign Secretary (subsequently circulated as C. (52) ,315) to whichwas annexed a draft of a letter to be addressed to two UnitedKingdom oil companies which were being required to disclosedocuments to the Federal Grand Jury which was considering in washington whether the international structure of the oil industryinvolved a breach of the anti-trust laws of the United States. this letter made it clear that, in the opinion of Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, it would be contrary to the national interest that the british companies should in these proceedings disclose any documents,papers or other information relating to the conduct of their businessoutside the United States, the disclosure of which might prejudice the economic, strategic or political interests of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment or of the Western Powers.The Foreign Secretary said that the Dutch Government wouldissue similar instructions to the Shell Company.The Cabinet Approved the draft letter annexed to the Foreign Secretary&apos;smemorandum.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,1st October, 1952.4. The Foreign Secretary said that the Austrians, in common with the other smaller peoples west of the Iron Curtain, were inbetter heart. The Austrian Government would be ready to signalmost any Treaty which would secure the withdrawal of theRussian armies. The Russians for their part now wished to resume negotiations on the basis of the earlier long draft of the treaty which was acceptable to us but not to the United States Government.Russian military dispositions in Austria, however, did not encourage the hope that they would be prepared to withdraw their forces forsome time to come.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.
