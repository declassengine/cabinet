Iron and steel bill.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 50thConclusions,Minute 6.)5. The Minister of Supply pointed out that, as the legislative programme approved by the Cabinet for the current session (Minute above) made no provision for the Iron and Steel Bill, that Bill was not likely to become law before July 1953, and the new Iron and steel board created by it might not be effectively established until thebeginning of 1954. In these circumstances he would have to try toset up on an advisory and voluntary basis machinery similar to thatwhich would be provided by the Bill. He thought it would also bedesirable to begin preliminary negotiations for the sale, as soon as theBill became law, of those parts of the industry for which large in-vestors were known to be holding capital available; otherwise therewas a risk that this capital might be used for other purposes. All thisshould be done against a background of public knowledge of theGovernment^ intentions in relation to the industry; and he therefore thought it necessary either to publish the Bill and give it a SecondReading in the House of Commons; or to embody its substance in a white Paper which could be debated in Parliament and might befollowed by publication of the Bill itself. Of these alternatives hepreferred the second.The Cabinet shared this preference. They considered, however,that it would be inexpedient to publish the text of the Bill so far inadvance of the date on which Parliamentary proceedings upon itwould begin. It would be preferable to publish a detailed white paper containing the substance of the Bill, but to withhold the actualtext of the Bill until the session in which it was to be passed. Thiswould have the further advantage that the Government would havean opportunity to alter the terms of the Bill, if they so desired, in thelight of public comments on the White Paper.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Supply to embody the proposals con-tained in the draft Iron and Steel Bill in a White Paper to be presented to Parliament and debated before the summer recess.Jordan. 6.   The Foreign Secretary said that King Talal of Jordanappeared to have had a further breakdown in health and it might benecessary for him to renounce his Throne in favour of his young son.The Regent of Iraq might seize this opportunity for further inter-vention in the affairs of Jordan.In discussion the Cabinet were reminded that King Talal&apos;syounger brother was a man of strong character and well disposed towards this country; and it seemed likely that he would prove an effective Regent.Council ofEurope.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 30thConclusions,Minute 3.)ProposedEurope-commonwealth conference.7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (52) 155) regarding a recommendation by the Consul-tative Assembly of the Council of Europe that a conference of Euro-pean and Commonwealth countries should be convened to discuss thepossibility of a closer economic association between Western europe and the sterling area.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were fully agreed on thedesirability of discouraging this project for a conference on methodsof promoting closer economic co-operation between Europe and theCommonwealth. There were, however, some differences of view onthe detailed reasons for rejecting this project, which were set out in
Annex B of C. (52) 155; on the extent to which other commonwealth countries should be encouraged to maintain general liaison with theCouncil of Europe; and on the tactics to be followed in dealing withthis particular recommendation of the Consultative Assembly.Some Ministers, whilst accepting the Foreign Secretary&apos;s con-clusion, were unwilling to endorse all the arguments in support of it which were set out in Annex B of C. (52) 155. They felt, in particular,that some of the statements in paragraph 3 of that Annex about thecommercial interests of the United Kingdom were open to argument;and they thought it would be premature to take any final position on those points while the general question of commercial policy, withparticular reference to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,was under consideration by Ministers.The Commonwealth Secretary said that he was impressed by thearguments set out in this Annex. In his view any attempt to create an economic association between Western Europe and the sterling commonwealth would be likely to prejudice Commonwealth unity.Indeed, he thought it would be dangerous to suggest that, because ofour position in Europe, the other Commonwealth countries shouldcultivate a close association of any kind with the Council of Europe.He feared that the effect of our pressing such a suggestion upon them would be to increase the likelihood that some of them might turntowards the United States.The Prime Minister said that, while he would certainly deprecateany project for economic association between Europe and the sterling commonwealth, he saw no reason to discourage other Common-wealth Governments from showing interest in the work of the Councilof Europe. Political leaders in many Commonwealth countries had welcomed this movement towards European unity, as a valuablefactor in preserving world peace; and, as those countries had twicebeen involved in a world war originating in Europe, they would be ill-advised to disinterest themselves wholly from European affairs.On the tactics to be followed if this recommendation was discussed at the forthcoming meeting of the Committee of ministers of the Council of Europe, it was suggested that it would be inexpedient to ask the Consultative Assembly for a more explicit statement of the type of association which they had in mind. After discussion it was generally agreed that it would be unwise to refer the matter back forfurther consideration by the Assembly, since it was unlikely that any detailed proposals which the Assembly might formulate would be anymore acceptable to us. The Commonwealth Secretary said that hewould prefer that the Committee of Ministers should be invited to reject this recommendation outright. The preponderant view in theCabinet was, however, that it would be wiser for the foreign secretary, if the matter came up for discussion at all, to point out itsdifficulties and to suggest that its further discussion should be adjourned.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that, if this proposal for closer economic association between Western Europe and the sterling Commonwealthcame up for discussion at the forthcoming meeting ofthe Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe,the Foreign Secretary should not suggest that it. shouldbe referred back for further consideration by the Consulta-tive Assembly but, after pointing out its difficulties, should seek to secure that its further discussion should be adjourned for as long as possible.(2) Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to inform other commonwealth Governments of the line which theForeign Secretary was proposing to take on this question at the forthcoming meeting of the Committee of Ministers.
The Cabinet considered the reply which the Prime Minister wa^j!proposing to give to a Parliamentary Question by Mr. Geoffrey deFreitas, M.P., asking whether it was still the Governments policy to enable the House of Commons to debate the proceedings of theCouncil of Europe.The Foreign Secretary said that he hoped the Prime minister would not accept any definite commitment to find parliamentary time for a debate on the proceedings of the Council of Europe.While he agreed that Parliament ought to be able to review thoseproceedings, he would himself prefer that they should normally bediscussed in the context of a general foreign affairs debate.The Prime Minister said that, in deference to the foreign secretary&apos;s views, he would refrain from accepting any definitecommitment at the present stage. But the Conservative Party, when in Opposition, had undertaken at Strasbourg that the House ofCommons would review the CounciFs proceedings, and they had been willing to use Supply Days for that purpose. He did not think itwould be consistent, when in Office, to decline as a matter of principle to find Government time for such a debate.The Cabinet (3) Took note that the Prime Minister would state, in reply tothis Question, that it was still the policy of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to do everything possible to enable the affairs of the Council of Europe to be debated in the House ofCommons.8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (52) 162) regarding the attitude which the UnitedKingdom Government should adopt in further negotiations on theGerman financial contribution to defence.The Foreign Secretary said that it had been our aim, in the dis-cussions with the United States and French Governments, to ensurethat the cost of our forces in Germany should be covered for as longas possible out of the total finanical provision which the germans had agreed to make for defence purposes. We had hoped to cover the whole of our expenditure in this way up to 30th June, 1953, butin the course of negotiation we had proposed that the division ofthe German total contribution should be fixed only until 31st March,1953. By this means we had hoped to ensure that for that period at any rate we should recover the whole of our current expenditureon the forces in Germany from the German contribution. TheUnited States and French Governments were, however, proposing that all three Governments should secure economies of perhaps15 per cent, in the cost of their forces in Germany, but should seek to recover the full cost after this abatement up to the original dateof 30th June, 1953. The Foreign Secretary thought it might benecessary in negotiation to agree to some arrangement of this kind;and indeed it might be found that the United Kingdom exchequer would benefit by it. But he did.not think that the United kingdom should accept a cut of more than 10 per cent.The Secretary of State for War said that it was very doubtfulwhether we could make further economies of this order in our expenditure. Our record in reducing military expenditure inGermany, in spite of an increase in the size of our forces stationedthere, was very much better than that of the Americans or the French;and, if a uniform percentage cut had now to be applied to all three,we should suffer on this account more severely than the other two.Since October 1951 our estimate of expenditure had fallen from anannual rate of  164 million to one of  131 million. While there might be some scope for further economies, it did not follow that
if we abated our demand on the Germans by 10 per cent, we shouldbe, able to achieve a reduction in actual expenditure of that amount.The Cabinet Authorised the Foreign Secretary to pursue negotiations on the German financial contribution to defence on the lines proposed in C. (52) 162; and in particular to accept, ifnecessary, a reduction of 10 per cent, in the charge to bemade to the German Government on account of the costof British forces in their territory.9. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (52) 145) reporting the result of the negotiations withthe United States and French Governments regarding the scale of theeconomic assistance to be given to Yugoslavia in 1952-53.The Foreign Secretary said that under the agreement which hadbeen reached the United Kingdom would not be required to contribute,in new money, more than the  4J million which was the limit set by the Cabinet in their previous discussion on 1st April. It was proposed that the decision of the three Governments should be com-municated to the Yugoslavs in an aide-memoire which, among othermatters, would include critical comments on their investment programme. This would be unpalatable to the Yugoslav Govern-ment; and, as they had recently taken some offence at the Anglo-American discussions with the Italians about Trieste, he wassuggesting that the communication about economic aid might be deferred for a few weeks.The Cabinet (1) Approved the report annexed to C. (52) 145 on the scale ofeconomic assistance to Yugoslavia in 1952-53, and theterms of the aide-memoire which was to be presented to the Yugoslav Government.(2) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to seek parliamentary sanction in due course for the contribution &quot;of  4J million to be made by the United Kingdom to Yugoslavia underthis plan.Emergency 10.   The Prime Minister drew attention to recent ParliamentaryPowers. discussion of the emergency powers exercised by GovernmentDepartments. The aim of the present Government should be toreduce the extent and use of such powers as rapidly as possible.The Home Secretary said that, with the collaboration of theCabinet Committee established on 7th December, 1951, he was con-sidering how best to reduce the volume of emergency powersgenerally. He would report on this matter to the Cabinet as soonas possible.Yugoslavia.Economic Aid.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 35thConclusions,Minute 6.)Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,15th May, 1952.
