Iron andSteelIndustry.(previous reference:CC. (52) 66thConclusions,Minute 2.)The Cabinet reviewed their decision of 8th July regarding the presentation of the White Paper embodying the Governments pro-posals for the future of the iron and steel industry.The Prime Minister said that at their meeting on 8th July theCabinet had agreed that the White Paper embodying the Govern-ment&apos;s proposals for the future of the iron and steel industry shouldbe published before the summer recess, and that the Iron and steel bill should be introduced at the outset of the new session in theautumn with a view to its being passed into law early in the summer of 1953. Subsequently it had been represented to him that some ministers were doubtful about the wisdom of the course thenapproved by the Cabinet, and he had called this special meeting inorder that all members of the Cabinet might have a further oppor-tunity of expressing their views.A full discussion followed, from which it appeared that opinionwithin the Cabinet was divided on this question.The following arguments were put forward by Ministers whodoubted the wisdom of proceeding at once with the Iron and steel bill: -(a) The Cabinet had been warned that there was a serious riskof an economic crisis as a result of an increased drain on the gold and dollar reserves of the sterling area; and grave statements to this effect were to be made in the debate on the economic situation whichwould be held before Parliament adjourned for the summer recess.The Government should therefore do everything in their power tocreate a spirit of national unity to meet that situation. They should at least avoid action which would deepen the rift between the political parties; and there could be no doubt that the introduction of theIron and Steel Bill would arouse bitter political controversy.(b) The Government had declared their intention to give first priority to measures necessary to redress the adverse balance ofpayments, and they were aiming at a 20 per cent, increase in exports.These objectives could not be attained without the full co-operationof organised labour. In particular, the Government needed assist-ance from the trade unions during the coming months in the exerciseof restraint in wage claims and the avoidance of industrial disputes.There were some signs of a more understanding attitude on the partof the trade unions; the efforts to this end which had been madeby the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Labour were beginning to bear fruit. Good relations with the unions had notbeen made easier by the introduction of the Transport Bill; but this difficulty might be surmounted if the Government were able to make some concessions on that Bill to meet the reasonable demands of organised labour. Relations with the unions might, however, becomeseriously strained if the Government had now to go forward with asecond measure involving serious controversy between the Parties.(c) There was no certainty that the policy of returning the steelindustry to private ownership could be carried through successfully.Many of the large companies which had owned steel undertakingsbefore nationalisation were either reluctant or unable to buy backtheir assets. The only outside investors who now had large sums attheir disposal were the insurance companies, the investment trustsand the administrators of pension funds; and there was as yet no assurance that any of these would take up large blocks of shares in steel companies after denationalisation. It would be a serious blow to the Governments credit if, after facing the political controversyinvolved in passing the Bill, they were unable to sell any substantial part of the nationalised industry.(d) The Labour Party had declared that, if the industry were nowdenationalised, they would take it back into public ownership as soonas they were returned to power. They were more likely to carry out this threat if the process of disposing of the assets of the nationalised industry were so long drawn out that a Labour Government came into
office before it was compieted. The country&apos;s economic structurewould be undermined if the organisation of its basic industries was tobe the subject of drastic change by successive Governments of differ-ent political complexions. Equally, public faith in Parliamentaryinstitutions would be undermined if the country&apos;s main industries were thus to be made the sport of Party politics. For these reasons thewiser course for the Government to take would be to seek every means of finding some basis of agreement, within the steel industryand between the Parties, which would take the industry out of politics.On the other side the following arguments were put forward infavour of proceeding with the Bill:  (e) When they first assumed office the Government had recog-nised, and announced, that the country was facing acute economic difficulties. It might have been open to them then to abjure all con-controversial measures and call for national unity in facing those difficul-ties. They had not taken that course, and it was too late to take it now especially when they had announced their intention to proceedwith the Transport Bill. At this juncture a call for national unitywould evoke no favourable response from the Labour Party. Itwould certainly be misrepresented in the House of Commons; andby public opinion throughout the country it would be widely regardedas a sign that the Government were irresolute and lacked confidence in their own policies. The Government would be represented asclinging to office without a policy or a theme.(/) Though the introduction of the Iron and Steel Bill wouldrefresh the political rancour of the Opposition, its postponement would involve the Government in political difficulties with their own supporters both in Parliament and outside it. Those supporters ofthe Government who had disliked the Excess Profits Levy would befurther provoked if the Government now shelved the denationalisa-tion of the steel industry. The Federation of British Industries, forexample, had specifically asked that this measure should be intro-duced without delay.ig) Political controversy over this Bill would not increase thedifficulties which the Chancellor of the Exchequer had to face in handling the economic situation. In financial circles, both in thiscountry and abroad, confidence in sterling was more likely to be strengthened than weakened by a decision to proceed with this Bill.(h) By their pledges at the time of the Election the Governmentwere firmly committed to pass early legislation denationalising the steel industry. And in the King&apos;s Speech at the Opening of Par-liament they had declared their intention to pass this legislation inthe current session. They could not now abandon this policy withoutexposing themselves to a charge of breach of faith. abandonment of the policy would seriously weaken the cohesion of the conservative party.(/) The abandonment of the policy would also shake the con-fidence of all who believed in the principle of private enterprise.There was a serious risk that all confidence in that principle would be lost unless the present Government took active and early steps to foster it.(;&apos;) Continuing uncertainty about the future of the steel industry would seriously impair its efficiency. Plans for development whichwas urgently needed were being held up; and it was important thatthe industry should be enabled to proceed confidently with its plans for the future.In further discussion the view was expressed that the best solution, if it were possible, would be to find some basis of agree-ment within the industry, if not between the political Parties which,while preserving the essential principles of the scheme outlined inthe White Paper, would take into account the difficulty of sellingthe assets of the Iron and Steel Corporation and the need for givingthe industry a greater degree of certainty about its future. This wouldinvolve placing more emphasis on the Governments proposals for
the future supervision of the industry as a whole and less on theproposals for returning to private ownership all those sections ofit which had been nationalised. The Minister of Supply said thathe was not without hope that some basis of agreement could be found,and he indicated the broad lines along which he would propose, ifthe Cabinet approved, to seek it. The Cabinet agreed that therewould be great public advantage if they were able to put forward proposals which were likely to command a wide measure of support in the country, even if those proposals were attacked on Party groundsby the Labour Opposition in the House of Commons. It was also agreed that the Government could not wholly abandon their policyof denationalising the steel industry: the only question at issue was whether they should proceed with it at once and by the method out-lined in the White Paper. The issue was thus narrowed down to oneof timing and of form. In particular, if it were decided to seek some basis of &quot;agreement, it was for consideration whether this could best be done before or after the publication of a White Paper. some ministers considered that, by publishing a White Paper, the Govern-ment would appear to be taking up a firm position from which theycould not thereafter recede without giving an impression of weakness.Other Ministers argued that the publication of a White Paper wasa necessary preliminary to the negotiation of an agreed settlement.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at their meeting on the following day.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,16th July, 1952.
