-reign Affairs.       Mr. Churchill said that it was for him a unique experience andprivilege to preside over a Cabinet meeting attended by so manyPrime Ministers and other Ministers from other countries of theCommonwealth. In considering the many grave problems whichconfronted them they would be encouraged by the knowledge thattheir combined influence was capable of affecting the course of worldevents. They would all welcome a review by Mr. Eden of the main features of the international situation.Germany. Mr. Eden said that in Germany, through which ran the dividingline between East and West, Dr. Adenauer was working strenuouslyto bring the Federal Republic into the closest possible association with Western Europe. His greatest difficulty was the failure to reach an agreement with the French over the Saar. At an earlier stageagreement had almost been reached on the basis of Germanacceptance in principle of the permanent autonomy and &quot; European-isation &quot; of the Saar. It had not proved possible, however, to provideadequately for the economic needs of France, to whom Saar coal was vital in order to maintain the balance of the Schuman Plan.The results of the recent elections had created an atmosphere morefavourable to a settlement and there would be further discussionswhile Ministers were in Paris for the meeting of the North atlantic council in the following week. Dr. Adenauer was genuinely anxious for a settlement and the election results should have strengthenedhis position vis-a-vis, the more extreme opinion in Germany.East/West Relations with Russia, in respect of Germany, were settling downTrade. on the basis of Russian consolidation in the east and Russianacceptance of our consolidation in the west. This position, thoughit could not be called satisfactory, had certain advantages to all parties, not excluding the Germans themselves. The Russians doubt-less believed that they were better able to withstand a protracted&quot; cold war &quot; than were the Western Powers, and it must be expectedthat they would exploit all the difficulties of the Western Powers andany differences of view between them which might reveal themselves.Soviet Satellites. The recent executions of political leaders in Czechoslovakia were thought to be due partly to the failure of the Governments economicprogramme and partly to personal rivalries within the local Com-munist Party. It was possible that M. dementis had had ambitionsto follow Marshal Tito&apos;s example, but this was not true of M. Slanskywho was an orthodox Communist. He was also a Jew, but there wasno conclusive evidence of anti-Semitic motives behind the recent events in Prague, though Russia was undoubtedly opposed to Zionismbecause of its appeal to Jews to leave their countries of domicile forPalestine. The recent events m Prague had given rise to seriousapprehensions in Hungary.European There appeared to be a reasonable prospect that the european defence Defence Community Treaty would be ratified -by Germany beforeCommunity. the end of the year. Dr. Adenauer hoped for a clear majority whenthe Bundestag voted upon it at the end of the present week. it seemed unlikely that the Federal Court would intervene and therewas a fair prospect that a majority would be obtained later in the bundesrat. The prospects of ratification by France were moreuncertain. M. Pinay&apos;s Government was becoming weaker and theFrench were keenly apprehensive of the effect of the war in Indo-China upon the relative strengths of the French and German elements in the proposed European Army. The French Government would undoubtedly welcome some move by the United Kingdom in thedirection of closer association with the Community but we had alreadygone as far as we could short of full membership. We should con-tinue to discourage any suggestion that the cohesion of the community should be loosened in order to make our participation possible andto do everything in our power to persuade the French Governmentto ratify the Treaty. If the European Defence Community were notformed, it would be difficult to avoid the admission of a nationalGerman army to the forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation43401-2 B 2
Si3Austria.yugoslavia and Italy:Trieste.Turkey.Egypt.(N.A.T.O.).   This alternative, though it might well be preferablemilitarily, would not be politically agreeable to the French.Mr. Churchill said that, while he agreed that this should be our policy, he would not be unduly disturbed if the present plans for a european Defence Community were not carried into effect. It had still to be shown that an international army could be an efficientinstrument in spite of differences of language and weapons betweenthe participating contingents. And he doubted whether the soldierin the line would fight with the same ardour for an internationalinstitution as he would for his home and his country.Mr. Eden said that there was no real prospect of a Treaty forAustria, as the Russians clearly intended to stay there so long as theWestern Powers remained in Germany. There had, however, been an improvement in Austria&apos;s relations with Yugoslavia.Tne Western Powers&apos; relations with Yugoslavia continued to grow closer but the differences between Yugoslavia and Italy overTrieste persisted. At the time of his visit to Belgrade Marshal Titohad been willing to accept a permanent division of the Free Territoryon the basis of Zone A (including the city of Trieste itself) going toItaly and Zone B to Yugoslavia. The United States Government hadbeen unwilling to press Italy to accept a settlement on these lines,and they were now in favour of urging Yugoslavia to give upCapodistria to Italy. It seemed to him unwise, particularly in viewof the impending Italian elections, to encourage Italy to look forfurther concessions by Yugoslavia which we were in no position toenforce. He was therefore trying to keep matters in suspense untilthe new United States Government had assumed office.The recent visit to London of the Turkish Prime Minister andForeign Minister had been very successful and relations with thatcountry were now more cordial than they had been for many years.The full co-operation by Turkey, on which we could now rely, wouldbe of great assistance to us in connection with the many problems arising in the Middle East.Mr. Eden said that the main difficulties with Egypt were thefuture of the Sudan and the revision of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty.Since the abdication of King Farouk the Sudan problem had becomesomewhat easier, since General Neguib had abandoned the demandfor the unity of the Sudan and Egypt under the Egyptian Crown.Satisfactory progress was being made towards the holding of elections in the Sudan, but there remained the particular difficulty of theSouthern Sudan. This was much less advanced than the North andmight possibly develop separatist tendencies; and we therefore thought it important that the Governor-General should retain special powers over it for some time to come. It was likely that the Egyptianscould be brought to agreement with us on this point. An ElectoralCommission would then be appointed, consisting of representativesof the United Kingdom, Egypt, the Sudan, the United States and,he hoped, India. Subsequently an Advisory Commission would beset up, consisting of representatives of the United Kingdom, Egypt,the Sudan and, he hoped, Pakistan; and ultimately the way wouldbe open to self-determination for the Sudan. The form of constitu-tion which the Sudan would adopt could not, of course, be foreseen,but he hoped at any rate that she would be bound by Treaties to theUnited Kingdom and to Egypt.On defence questions progress was less satisfactory. GeneralNeguib claimed that he could not discuss defence with us until wehad left the Canal Zone, but he might shortly adopt a more concilia-tory attitude. It would be difficult for us to contemplate abandoning the Base and all the valuable installations which we had created inEgypt before we had any assurance that satisfactory alternative arrangements would be accepted. ,Mr. Churchill said that the previous Government in the UnitedKingdom had proposed a seven-Power plan for the protection of the canal&apos;Zone,  this had not been acceptable to Egypt.  But we would
certainly not be forced out of the Canal Zone until some satisfactory alternative method of protecting the international waterway could befound. He still hoped that other countries would be persuaded tocontribute token forces to an international garrison. At the moment,we were keeping 70,000 soldiers in the Canal Zone and that was a burden which would could not carry indefinitely. He was thereforemost anxious to find some method of sharing the burden with othersor, if that were impossible, of finding some means of controlling thearea from a remoter base. Cyprus was an attractive alternative, andthe establishment of a base there would be welcomed by Turkey,which would play a great part in delaying any attempted Sovietinvasion of the Middle East.Mr. Eden said that the accession of Turkey to the North atlantic treaty Organisation had changed the whole problem of Middle east defence. He also hoped that we should conclude a Treaty with Libyawhich would give us certain strategic facilities. It might well bepossible to devise a successful form of defence for the Middle East,based on Turkey, Cyprus and Libya. Nevertheless, he had not given up hope that General Neguib might be more forthcoming on defence problems. The GeneraFs main difficulty was that the economic position of Egypt was weak: the standard of living had fallen since his coup d&apos;etat, and his own political position was weakened inconsequence.Mr. Eden expressed his gratitude to Australia, New Zealand andSouth Africa for the practical assistance which they were giving inthe formulation of plans for the defence of the Middle East.Our relations with other Arab States were very satisfactory and syria had recently asked us to conclude a Treaty with her. Relationswith Jordan and Iraq were good. Iraq, was receiving  60 millions ayear in return for oil concessions and was using this money on soundschemes of development. The military coup d&apos;etat in Iraq was probably a facade behind which Iraqi politicians remained in controland was not a radical military revolution, as it was in Egypt.The only real difficulty which had arisen with Arab States wasthe encroachment of Saudi Arabia on the small Trucial Sheikdoms,where we enjoyed considerable oil concessions. We should have to resist this and it might be necessary to increase the size of the leviesemployed by these Sheikdoms. It was easy to justify resistance toKing Ibn Saud&apos;s claims, since in point of fact the standard of living in the Sheikdoms was a good deal higher than in Saudi Arabia.In Persia a split seemed to be developing in the National Front.Kashani, the most extremist of the Nationalist leaders, was moving towards co-operation with&apos; the Tudeh Party in opposition toMusaddiq and the more moderate members of the National Front.This conflict might soon come to a head, but he could not foreseewhether it was likely to assist towards a settlement of the oil problem.The United States Government were still anxious for a settlement.He believed that General Eisenhower had found rather too severethe terms under which we had insisted that the problem should besubmitted for arbitration by the Hague Court. Although we werenot in fact expecting to get a very large sum in compensation, we had thought it necessary to our case that the terms of compensation shouldbe fixed on a fair basis by an international tribunal. general eisenhower also seemed to be considering the possibility of increasingthe offer of American financial assistance from $10 millions to$30 millions.The situation in Malaya had improved, but matters had grownworse in Indo-China. If the French were unable to maintain their position in Indo-China, there was a grave danger that Communismwould spread through Burma and Siam. and reach the frontiers ofIndia and Malaya. The United States were giving substantialfinancial and material help to the French in Indo-China. The maindanger was the possibility of direct intervention by China, but that,on the whole, he thought unlikely. ...
&quot;&quot;5 J    jFar East. In Japan there was a danger of future difficulties, even thougr?the present Government was anti-Communist. The population was increasing at the rate of one million persons per year, and the attraction of developing close trading relations with China was verygreat.General Eisenhower had told him that the sole object of his visit to Korea was to make a military review. Some American opinion was in favour of using Japanese forces in the Korean war, but thiswould be strenously resisted by the Government of South Korea.Hardly less welcome would be the introduction of Chiang Kai-shek&apos;forces into Korea, and in practice there were only two divisions whichcould be made available. He did not think that General Eisenhowersupported either of these two suggestions. There seemed to be only two possible courses to follow in Korea either to continue to hold the present position, equipping and organising South Korean forces as fast as possible, or to undertake a major military operation withthe object of destroying the Chinese Army in Korea. The latter course would mean the provision of additional American divisions which General Eisenhower would find politically difficult.In general our object in the Far East must be to divide China .and the Soviet Union, and it was particularly for this reason thathe welcomed the recent Indian resolution on Korea in the general assembly of the United Nations. The support which the resolutionhad received was a remarkable tribute to this Indian initiative. Inhis efforts to secure its adoption he had received most valuable help from Mr. Pearson, the Canadian Foreign Minister, and from therepresentatives of other Commonwealth countries. It would not bepossible to accept a cease-fire in Korea until agreement had beenreached on the prisoners of war question. If we did so before then,it was very doubtful if we should ever recover our own prisoners ofwar and the enemy would also have opportunities to build up hisair power unobserved.Relations with In conclusion Mr. Eden said that it remained a cardinal point the United in the foreign policy of the United Kingdom Government to retainStates. and develop the closest possible co-operation with the United States.He had found General Eisenhower insistent that one of his chief aimswas to co-operate with the Commonwealth and with France, and hehad in general been greatly encouraged by the appointments in thenew United States Administration which had so far been indicated by General Eisenhower.In the discussion which followed, the representatives of other commonwealth Governments expressed their appreciation ofMr. Eden&apos;s valuable survey of the international situation. Tributewas also paid to Mr. Eden&apos;s skill in the conduct of foreign policy.Mr. Menzies said that there was widespread appreciation of the courage and competence with which Mr. Eden faced his heavyresponsibilities; and he himself believed that the improvement in international relations which was discernible Over the last twelvemonths owed much to the knowledge, perception and wisdom which mr. Eden had shown in the discharge Of his duties as foreign secretary. Mr. Holland said that at the current meeting of theAssembly of the United Nations he had had personal experience ofthe great influence which Mr. Eden exercised in international affairs.There was no doubt that the wide support which had eventually been secured for the Indian resolution on Korea was due in no smallmeasure to his personal influence and diplomacy.In further discussion the following particular points were raised: -(a) Mr. St. Laurent said that the initiative which India had takenin the United Nations discussion, on Korea had given great encourage-ment to all Commonwealth Governments. The large number of-States which had eventually, supported that resolution was an encouraging demonstration of the strength and solidarity of demo-cratic feeling throughout the world.
(b) Mr. Havenga said that the general objectives of UnitedKingdom foreign policy had the full approval and support of theSouth African Government, who were resolved to do everything intheir power to prevent a third world war. Though South Africa wasbeing somewhat roughly treated in the United Nations at the presenttime, it should not be forgotten that South Africans were fighting in korea to uphold the stand which the United Nations had taken against aggression.(c) Mr. Holland recalled that New Zealand had also made hercontribution towards the United Nations Forces in Korea. Thoughshe was a small country she would always do her utmost to help thosewho were seeking to preserve world peace. When he had last beenin London it had been suggested that New Zealand should contribute to the British garrison in the Middle East, and he was glad to beable to say that a New Zealand contingent had now arrived in Cyprus.(d) Sir Chintaman Deshmukh said that, although there had recently been some improvement in international relations generally,the situation in Indo-China and Korea continued to give cause forgrave anxiety. He agreed with Mr. Eden that it was unlikely that theChinese would intervene directly in Indo-China: he thought theywould be reluctant to add to the commitment which they had already undertaken in the north. He could see no easy or quick solution ofthe difficulties in Indo-China, and he feared that the United states would have to be asked to continue for some time the support,whichthey were giving to the French in that theatre. One could not helpwondering for how long the Americans would be willing to carry thisheavy burden. In Korea also a heavy responsibility rested on theUnited States, and there seemed no alternative but to persevere onthe lines indicated in the resolution which the Indian Governmenthad brought forward in the United Nations Assembly. Any policywhich entailed an extension of the area of the conflict in Korea wouldinvolve very great risks; and he agreed with Mr. Eden that a cease-firepending negotiations would give the Chinese an opportunity tobuild up their strength on land and in the air. India had fewerillusions than was sometimes supposed about the policies and in-contentions of her northern neighbours.Mr. Churchill agreed that it would be a grave mistake to take any course which would widen the area of conflict in Korea. It wasthe considered policy of the United Kingdom Government that these operations should be confined within the frontiers of Korea itself.(e) Mr. Nazimuddin said that, while he fully supported theresolution on Korea which India had moved in the United nations assembly, resolutions alone would not suffice to bring the hostilities in Korea to an end. He was alarmed ai the degree of success which the Soviet Government had attained in their cold-war policyof weakening in advance the nations which, if the time came, would seek to withstand an open aggression by Russia. The strength ofthe French was being sapped in Indo-China. In Malaya and else-where the resources of the United Kingdom were being subjected tosevere strain. In Korea the United States were suffering casualties and loss which even they were finding it hard to bear. These tacticswere subjecting the democracies to great strain. While he could not say what counter-moves should be made, he thought that no opportunity should be lost of consolidating the forces of the democracies and putting them in a position to offer a more effectiveresistance if aggression should come. In particular, any outstandingdifferences between them should be resolved without delay so that,if open aggression occurred, they could meet it united and strong.Mr. Eden said that it was true that the operations in Korea wereimposing a great strain on the United States; but, as against this,it should be^remembered that President Truman&apos;s decision to meetthe aggression in Korea had resulted in a very great strengthening
of the United States Forces and a vast defence production If- :\)gramme which had substantially increased the military power of thewestern democracies.In conclusion, Mr. Churchill said that he had welcomed this opportunity for an exchange of views on questions of foreign policy.He suggested that this might be supplemented by a similar meeting in his Map Room, where the Minister of Defence could give acorresponding review of defence policy. The representatives ofother Commonwealth Governments gladly accepted this suggestion.Finally Mr. Churchill suggested that a suitable communiquemight be issued to the Press to let it be known that the leaders ofthe Commonwealth Delegations had met together with the cabinet for a general exchange of views on the international situation.Mr. Menzies suggested, and it was agreed, that it might be stated inthis communique that the representatives of the other commonwealth countries had placed on record their appreciation of the conduct ofthe foreign policy of the United Kingdom Government and theirrecognition of its contribution towards the preservation of world peace.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,4th December, 1952.
