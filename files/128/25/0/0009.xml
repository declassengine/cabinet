)Parliament.Business in theHouse ofCommons.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Opposition leaders had been sounded about the arrangementsfor debating the agreements relating to the contractual settlement with Western Germany. They had indicated a preference for post-postponing this discussion for the time being and- holding meanwhile aforeign affairs debate restricted mainly to the problems of the far east and South-East Asia. The Cabinet agreed that no objectionneed be raised to this, so long as it was understood that not morethan one day of Government time would be devoted to the twosubjects. _Central african federation.(previous reference:C.C.(51) 7thConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The Commonwealth Secretary said that a White Paper onCentral African Federation would be published on 18th June. TheOpposition leaders had asked that there should be an interval of about two weeks before this was debated in the House of Commons. Inthis interval, however, the White Paper would have been discussed in the Lords; for a debate on this subject had already been arranged for 24th June.The Cabinet agreed that there was no reason why this subject should not be discussed in the Lords before it was debated in the commons.Economic 3.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, although thereSituation.       had been in recent weeks an increase in the gold and dollar reserves(Previous        of the sterling area, there were signs of a renewed loss of confidenceReference:      in sterling.  He was making a statement in the House of CommonsC.C. (52) 57th   that afternoon on the recent meeting of the Council of the Organisa-Conclusions,    tion for European Economic Co-operation, and he proposed to takeMinute 6.)       that opportunity of saying something to strengthen confidence in sterling. This would involve anticipating to some extent the quarterlystatement which was not due until the beginning of July; and he was considering Whether statements about the position of the reservesshould not in future be made at more frequent intervals.   He alsowished to take this opportunity of stating publicly that in all their economic policies the Government proposed to give first priority to measures for remedying the adverse balance of payments; and hethought of promising that Parliament would be informed from timeto time of the various measures which might have to be taken for thispurpose.In discussion doubts were expressed about the expediency offoreshadowing at this stage further announcements of this kind. Thiswould provoke speculation about the nature of the measures whichmight have to be taken; and the Government might also be pressedfrom week to week to indicate when further announcements were likely to be made. It would be preferable for the Chancellor toavoid volunteering at this stage any promise of further Governmentannouncements of additional measures to remedy the adverse balanceof payments.The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to modify the termsof his statement in the light of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion.Supplementary 4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofPension Labour (C. (52) 186) reporting the results of the consultations whichSchemes. he had been authorised to hold with the Trades Union Congress(Previous (T.U.C.) on the questions arising from current proposals for reference:      supplementary pension schemes.CC. (52) 51st ffte Minister of Labour said that he had made it clear to theConclusions,    J.U.C. that if these schemes went forward the Government would minute 8.)      regard them, not as representing any new departure in principle, butas measures necessary to remove anomalies and to bring the positionof the staffs concerned into line with those in other nationalised
Deface 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisterPriorities. of Supply (C. (52) 187) reporting on the progress of the scheme for(Previous according special priority to certain items of defence equipment; and reference: proposing that, subject to the approval of the Treasury, orders shouldC.C. (52) 30th be placed forthwith for 200 Gloster F.4 all-weather fighters and 50 B.35Conclusions, heavy bombers, and that the same special priority, which had alreadyMinute 5.)       been applied to the F.4, should be extended to the B.35.The Minister of Supply said that the scheme was workingsmoothly and the checks which he had applied had failed tobring to light any serious abuses. The issue which he now put beforethe Cabinet was whether orders for the two new types of aircraft should be placed in advance of the Cabinefs consideration of the newstrategic appreciation which was being prepared by the Chiefs ofStaff. If the orders were not placed now, there would be a hiatus in production, or the firms would have to make more than we needed ofthe types which they were at present producing.In discussion it was suggested that it would be unwise to put theB.35 into production until the Cabinet were satisfied, after their forth-coming review of the latest strategic appreciation, that the Royal AirForce would in fact need strategic bombers of this type. On the otherhand, it was pointed out that great embarrassment would be caused ifaircraft firms were compelled, for lack of orders, to reduce their labour force so soon after they had been assured that their labour require-ments would receive special priority. The Cabinet attachedconsiderable importance to this point. Every effort should be madeto avoid labour redundancy as a result of modifications in the defence production programme.   From this point of view there was much to industries. The T.U.C. had accepted this. They were, however,quite unwilling to co-operate at the present time in any wider enquiry into the growing cost of pension schemes and their economic andfinancial implications; and it was clear that, if such an enquiry were launched, they would boycott it. The Minister was therefore satisfiedthat for the time being it would be impracticable to proceed with thefull-scale enquiry which he had originally envisaged. Meanwhile,some limited progress might be made by arranging for the facts tobe assembled, either by an interdepartmental committee of officialsor by a committee within the framework of the National InsuranceAct.The Minister of National Insurance said that of these alternativeshe preferred the second. He was gravely concerned about the futurefinances of the National Insurance fund; and he was anxious thatthis should be the subject of a formal enquiry, possibly by theAdvisory Committee established under the National Insurance Act.He would wish to consult the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the precise form which the enquiry should take.The Chancellor of-the Exchequer supported the suggestion madeby the Minister of National Insurance.The Cabinet-CD Agreed that approval of the draft schemes for supplementary pensions for persons employed on the railways and inthe gas industry need no longer be delayed.(2) Agreed that no further progress could be made for the timebeing with the project for ar large-scale enquiry into thelong-term economic and financial implications of making provision for old age.(3) Agreed that in the meantime a more limited enquiry shouldbe made into the financial prospects of the national insurance fund; and invited the Minister of national insurance to consult with the Chancellor of the Exchequerregarding the precise scope of that enquiry.

The Foreign Secretary said that he could also find a number of suitable foreign buyers who would be able topay in hard currency for any defence equipment surplus to our own needs.The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked that any extension of thespecial priority should await the forthcoming review of the defence production programme.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, subject to detailed Treasury approval, orders should be placed forthwith for 200 Gloster F.4 all-weatherfighters and for 50 B.35 heavy bombers.(2) Postponed a decision on the grant of special priority to theB.35 until after their forthcoming review of the defence production programme.Visit of United 6. The Foreign Secretary said that since the Cabinet&apos;s lastStates Bomber meeting he had discussed further with the Secretary of State for air squadrons to the proposed visit of twenty of the largest American strategic bombersthe United to this country. It now appeared that this proposal was not asKingdom. formidable as had previously been thought. The bombers would be(Previous coming in small groups, and would not be conspicuous among the reference: considerable air traffic already flowing between the United StatesCC. (52) 58th and the bases in the United Kingdom. The visit was expected to conclusions, attract little or no publicity. He considered that the CabinefsMinute 9.)       objections to the proposal could be withdrawn.The Secretary of State for Air said that it was the policy bothof the United States authorities and of the Royal Air Force that no publicity should be given to the arrivals and departures of american aircraft. These bombers would not be coming from Spain, as had previously been reported.The Cabinet Agreed that no objection need be raised to the proposed visit of United States strategic bombers to the UnitedKingdom.The High 7.   The Commonwealth Secretary said that the South AfricanCommission Government, in response to a request from the Leader of the Opposi-Territories. tion in their Parliament, proposed to publish a selection of documents(Previous on the question of the transfer of the High Commission Territories.Reference: He was satisfied that this publication would bring no discredit onCC. (51) 18th United Kingdom Governments indeed, it would bring out theConclusions, strength of the United Kingdom&apos;s case. He proposed, however, that minute 6.) a somewhat fuller selection of the documents should be published inthis country, as a White Paper, two or three weeks after the publica-tion of the White Paper on Central African Federation.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the action proposed by theCommonwealth Secretary.Mr. Menzies&apos; 8.   The President of the Board of Trade said that he had madeVisit: Trade little progress in his discussions with the Prime Minister of AustraliaTalks. on Australian import restrictions.  Mr. Menzies had agreed to take steps which would help to secure that the import quotas would beused for existing contracts before they were applied to new ordersfor similar goods. He had also promised to see what could be done to relax the very stringent treatment of cases involving special hard-ship, particularly the exclusion of goods which were made specially
for the Australian market and were not saleable elsewhere, but h Hwas not so far prepared to treat these as falling outside the quotas.He had not been prepared to consider anything to ease the positionof the textile industries or the other industries, such as pottery andlace, which had been hard hit by Australia^ import restrictions. nor was he willing to allow any discrimination in favour of the UnitedKingdom. He argued that this was precluded by the provisions ofthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and that it would involvegiving offence to his European customers. The compelling reasonbehind his refusal was no doubt a fear that discrimination in favourof the United Kingdom would make it more difficult for him to obtain a loan from the United States.The President of the Board of Trade said that he was having afinal talk with Mr. Menzies on 16th June, when he would press himto make some further concessions.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the President of the Boardof Trade.Meetings of 9.   The Commonwealth Secretary reminded the Cabinet that atCommonwealth several meetings and in his public speeches Mr. Menzies had stressedMinisters.       the value of a united Commonwealth policy on economic and com-(Previous        mercial matters, especially in negotiating with the United States.  reference:      believed that Mr. Menzies would find it easier to make concessionsC.C.

It would be useful if Mr. Menzies could be asked, when he attended the Cabinet on 17th June, whether he had formed any views aboutthe possibility of an early Commonwealth meeting on commercial policy.In discussion the point was made that, before any such Common-wealth meeting was held, the United Kingdom Government would need to define their own long-term commercial policy, and they werenot likely to be able to do so before October. Any approach to theUnited States Government as the result of a Commonwealth meeting would most profitably be made towards the end of 1952, when the presidential election was over. From this point of view the mostsuitable time for a Commonwealth meeting might be November 1952.The Prime Minister said that, before coming to any conclusions on this matter, the Cabinet should hear Mr. Menzies&apos; views at their meeting with him on 17th June.british transport commission. -Appointmentsof Members.(previous reference :C.C. (52) 49thConclusions,Minute 8.)10. The Minister of Transport said that the appointments of alarge number of the members of the Transport Commission and itsExecutives would expire on or before 30th September; and he wasto be asked in the House of Commons that day to what extent he intended to continue these appointments. He intended to state inrepfy that he was anxious to give the members of the Commissionand its Executives the earliest possible information about their per-sonal future, and proposed to discuss the position with each of them;and that he intended to offer to the majority renewed appointmentsfor one year, though not necessarily in the same capacity.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement which theMinister of Transport proposed to make on the renewal ofthe appointments of members of the British transport commission and its Executives.Cabinet Office, SWA,12th June, 1952.
