Egypt(previous reference:C.C. (52) 54thConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The Cabinet were informed that during the previous nightthere had been a coup d&apos;Etat in Cairo by a group of military officers,who had now assumed complete control over the city and had openedparleys with the Government in Alexandria. The leaders of the group had announced that they were not concerned with foreign relations and aimed only at suppressing corruption within the country. Theyhad, however, made it clear to the British Embassy that they would offer organised resistance to any British intervention. The embassy had already asked the British military authorities in the Canal Zoneto give them notice in advance before taking any military action, inview of the possible political consequences. The Foreign secretary might wish to go further and ask that there should be no military intervention without specific authority from London.The Minister of Defence said that he hoped that a reasonablediscretion would be left to the local Commanders, who could be trusted to avoid any appearance of taking sides in a domesticEgyptian dispute.The Prime Minister said that in present circumstances any move-ments of British troops in Egypt should be as unobtrusive as possible.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Persia. 2.

(52) 60th.Conclusions,Minute 7.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary (C. (52) 254) proposing a time-table ofwork to be undertaken in preparation for the commonwealth economic Conference in November.The Commonwealth Secretary said that, if the Conference wasto open on 25th November, the preparatory meeting of Common-wealth officials should start not later than 22nd September. this meant that United Kingdom Ministers must define, by the end of
the first week in August, the broad objectives at which they intendedto aim in the Conference, and be ready during the. remainder ofAugust and the first part of September, to give guidance to officials who would be working out detailed proposals designed to achievethose objectives.In discussion it was recognised that the issues for decision were of great importance and difficulty. It was, however, most desirablethat the Conference should be held in November as proposed; andall concerned should therefore do their utmost to conform to thetime-table outlined in C. (52) 254.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the time-table in C. (52) 254 for the work to becarried out in preparation for the commonwealth economic Conference in November 1952.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would send to other commonwealth Prime Ministers telegrams finally settling the date of the Conference and the preparatory arrange-ments, so that a formal announcement could be made inthe House of Commons on 29th July,Defence 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisterProgramme.     of Defence (C. (52) 253) on the estimated cost of the rearmament programme up to the year 1955-56 and the load which this would impose on the metal-using industries.The Prime Minister said that he had already discussed with someof his colleagues the possibility of reducing the load of the defence production programme on the metal-using industries in order to freemore resources for export. They had provisionally agreed that inthe calendar year 1953 this load should in no circumstances exceed 500. million, and that every effort should be made to reduce ittowards  450 million by means which would facilitate the expansionOf engineering exports. Further meetings of Ministers would haveto be held during the next six weeks to consider what assumptionscould be taken about the level of defence expenditure in theyears after 1953, with regard both to the defence load on the metal-using industries and also to the Budgetary consequences of defence expenditure as a whole. In the meantime, the supply departments,, without imposing any general standstill on orders for production in 1954 and later years, should avoid prejudging by anyabnormal ordering the decisions which Ministers would have to take in the coming weeks.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he must warn theCabinet that, in his view, it was quite unrealistic to suppose that thecountry could support the rising burden of defence expenditure out-lined in paragraph 3 of C. (52) 253. He calculated that, if expendi-ture on civil defence, atomic energy and other defence preparations were added, the total cost of defence in 1954-55 would amount to half the total budget. He believed that means would have to be found of preventing defence expenditure from rising much above the levelof 1952-53.The Minister of Defence said that an increasing load on the metal-using industries was a natural and inevitable consequence ofa rearmament programme. If a?fiat level of expenditure were imposed, no sufficient provision could be made for the introductionof new types of equipment, since a large proportion of allottedcapacity of the metal-using industries would have to be devoted tothe maintenance and replacement of existing types of equipment. Ifthe total size of the Forces was to be reduced, there would have tobe a complete review -of eommitments-not only peace-time commit-ments in the cold war, but also obligations to the North Atlantic
53CC 72 (52)Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.) in the event of war. It was difficultto see where our efforts in the cold war could be relaxed, and sub-stantial curtailment of our N.A.T.O. commitments would impair thespirit of the Alliance.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) If the defence load on the metal-using industries were limitedto  500 million a year or less over the next three years, the services would be denied the improved equipment which was essential to their efficiency in war. The load must increase on a rising curve untilre-equipment was completed, and the curve would then flatten contributory decrease. On the other hand, this made it the more important that the curve should start at a point which would leave some scope for the engineering industry to accept increased orders for export.(b) The conflict between the demands of defence and of exportsupon the metal-using industries could not be resolved, and no firmplan adopted for either, unless some total figure for the limitationof the defence load were fixed for some years ahead. Otherwise itwould be impossible to avoid sudden variations in the rearmament programme and wasteful cancellations of contracts.(c) If the total size of the forces remained constant, the impo-sition of a flat level of expenditure, whether in money or in the useof metal, would fall largely upon new production. If the total size of the forces was reduced, then the corresponding reduction in main-tenance would permit some new production for re-equipping thesmaller forces. On the other hand, smaller forces could not fulfilall existing cold war commitments and obligations to N.A.T.O.The Prime Minister said that he would like to see an analysis for each service of the load imposed on the metal-using industries for (i) main-tenance, and (ii) new production.(d) The Minister of State said that the Foreign Secretary feltthat any review of the demands of the defence programme upon thenational economy would offer no sound basis for judgment unless it was accompanied by a review of the demands made upon the economy by the housing programme and other social services. TheChancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that considerable cuts hadalready been imposed on civil investment, social services and con-sumption and he was seeking to impose more.The Prime Minister said that no decisions could be reached atthis stage on the level of defence expenditure over the next threeyears, but examinations should immediately be put in hand inaccordance with the provisional decisions to which he had referredat the outset of the discussion. In the meantime, he and the Chan-cellor of the Exchequer, when speaking in the forthcoming debate on the economic situation, would be careful to avoid prejudging thelevel of defence expenditure over the next three years.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their discussion on the defence programme at a later date.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,23rd July, 1952.
