Parliament.Business in theHouse ofCommons.Parliament.legislative programme:1952-53Session.(previous reference:C.C.(52)66thConclusions,Minute 1.)Suez Canal.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the first week after Parliament reassembledat the end of the summer recess.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord privy Seal (C. (52) 261) submitting a provisional legislative pro-gramme for the 1952-53 Session based on proposals by Departments.The Lord Privy Seal said that, while final decisions could be deferred until the Cabinet considered the draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech,early approval of a provisional programme would enable progress to be made in formulating policy and preparing draft Bills. TheGovernments inability to pass this Session any of the measures fore-shadowed in the late King&apos;s Speech made it all the more important that in the next Session they should be clear about their legislativeintentions and should so far as possible avoid &quot; standstill&quot; measures.He would therefore be glad if, even at this stage, the Cabinet couldexpress a provisional preference between leasehold, monopolies and town and country planning, as the subject for a fourth major Bill in.the coming Session.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that a standstill Bill on town and country planning would be unavoidable,but its passage would be greatly eased if a comprehensive amending bill could simultaneously be introduced or at least foreshadowed ina White Paper. The Committee Stage of the major Bill might betaken upstairs and its enactment might be delayed until the end ofthe Session in order to ease pressure on the House of Lords.The President of the Board of Trade said that a draft monopolies and Restrictive Practices Bill could be brought forward at short notice. He would welcome an early decision on the question whetheror not it should be included in the programme for the coming Session.In discussion support was expressed for the following views:-(a) Standstill Bills should be avoided, as far as possible, particu-larly if they could not be accompanied by definitiveproposals;(b) Prima facie the case for amending the financial provisionsof the Town and Country Planning Act, .1947, which were acting as a serious impediment to development, wasstronger than that for leasehold reform or for aMonopolies and Restrictive Practices Bill.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of housing and Local Government to bring before them for decision in the next few weeks the question of amendmentof the financial provisions of the Town and country planning Act, 1947.(2) Agreed to resume consideration of C. (52) 261 in the lightof the decision to be taken under Conclusion (1) above. :3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (52) 267) drawing attention to the danger that an ill-disposed Government in Egypt might restrict or stop traffic through,the Suez Canal, either by direct obstruction or by pressure on the suez Canal Company, and proposing that there should be a con-fidential exchange of views between the maritime Powers, on an anglo-French initiative, on the possibility of (i) obtaining firmer

The Foreign Secretary said that there were some indications(Previous that the new Egyptian Government under Ali Maher&apos;s leadershipReference: might be able to establish a position in which they would not beC.C.

(52) 51stConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary and the President of the Board of Trade (C. (52) 266) onthe extent to which firms in the United Kingdom should be allowedto fulfil contractual obligations, undertaken before the introductionof export controls, to. supply to countries in the Soviet bloc goods which were now subject to embargo on strategic grounds.The President of the Board of Trade said that the United StatesGovernment were asking us to restrict deliveries of such goods. Theyhad, however, over-estimated the quantities involved: they believedtheir total value to be $5 million, whereas in fact it would not exceed$T5 million. There were powerful commercial considerations infavour of honouring these obligations; and we should be careful to avoid action which might prejudice our prospects of obtainingadequate supplies of coarse grain from the Soviet Union. It wastherefore proposed that export licences should be granted for goodsin this category unless they were of overriding strategic importanceor, in the case of machine tools, were on the embargo list; but that,in considering the grant of licences, preference should continue tobe given to the claims of British and Allied defence programmes.The Colonial Secretary said that the proposals in C. (52) 266would permit the export to Russia of the large machine tools manu-factured by Messrs. Craven Brothers of Stockport. These tools,though they could be used for some forms of civil production, would contribute to the industrial war potential of the Soviet Union andwould be commonly supposed to be required for the manufactureof armaments. It was on this account that members of the Govern-ment, when in opposition, had criticised the previous Government fortheir readiness to allow these machine tools to be exported to Russiaand Poland; and as a result of those criticisms, expressed in a debate in the House of Commons on 18th September, 1950, export licences for these types of machine tools had been refused. The PrimeMinister recalled that he had also voiced the same criticism on an earlier occasion in a broadcast made on 26th August, 1950.The Cabinet agreed that they could not defend a policy whichwould permit the export to countries in-the Soviet bloc of heavymachine tools which, though they might, have some civil use, wouldbe commonly regarded as a direct contribution to the industrial war potential of the Soviet Union. The policy proposed in C. (52) 266could be justified only if special steps were taken to exclude from thegoods to be exported as prior commitments, not only goods of guarantees from the Egyptian Government and (ii) taking joint actionCl)if the Egyptian Government failed to give such guarantees or tomaintain free transit through the Canal.The Cabinet Approved the proposals put forward in paragraph 23 ofC. (52) 267.
overriding strategic importance, but also any which had been madethe subject of a special veto by the previous Government as a resultof the debate on 18th September, 1950.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Foreign Secretary and the President of the Boardof Trade, in consultation with the Colonial Secretary andthe Minister of Supply, to make a detailed scrutiny of the list of goods which would be exported to countries in theSoviet bloc if all contractual obligations were fulfilledwhich had been undertaken before the introduction of theexport controls, and to identify those on the embargo list,those which would be regarded as of overriding strategic importance and those whose export had been vetoed bythe previous Government following the debate in theHouse of Commons on 18th September, 1950.(2) Agreed to resume consideration of the policy recommended in paragraphs 16-18 of C.

(52) 62nd privileges and immunities to the international organisations listed in conclusions, an earlier memorandum by the Foreign Secretary (C. (52) 191).X&apos;1 1U   1 The Attorney-General said that he had confined himself to thequestion whether the Government were under a legal obligation to accord these privileges, and he was of opinion that such an obligationcould be shown to exist in respect of only three of these organisations.The Lord Chancellor said that he had felt obliged to take a somewhat broader view of the question. He had thought it inappropriate-priate, in considering international commitments which were notenforceable by any court of law, to confine himself to strictly legal obligations: he had felt impelled to take account also of political and moral obligations. He could not therefore advise the Cabinet todraw a distinction between agreements which the United KingdomGovernment had ratified and agreements which had been signed onbehalf of the Government but had not been formally ratified. if that course were followed it would have the result, for example, thatwe should withhold these privileges from the North Atlantic treaty organisation, though the agreement defining them had in thatinstance been drawn up on our initiative by a committee over which our own representative had presided. His conclusion was that theGovernment were under a clear obligation to accord the agreedprivileges to all these organisations, save only the one which had notyet been established.The Prime Minister said that he greatly deplored the extensionof diplomatic immunity contemplated by these agreements. Theadvantages thereby conferred on the international staffs would tendto encourage the proliferation of these international agencies, of whichthere were already too many. If it was necessary to honour the commitments accepted in this matter by the previous Government, he hoped that the Foreign Secretary would do his utmost to prevent theestablishment of still more international agencies to which similarprivileges might have to be accorded.In further discussion attention was drawn to the point made inparagraph 2 of C. (52) 262, that the agreements would have the effectof limiting to some extent the privileges which could otherwise be

(52) 232) on the handling of colonial questions at theColonial forthcoming session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.Questions. This memorandum drew attention to the importance of avoiding a position in which Colonial Powers might appear to be accountable to the United Nations for the administration of their Colonies, and set out, in an Annex, the main principles which we could not afford to see established in United Nations procedure. It recommendedthat the leader of the United Kingdom Delegation to the general assembly should threaten to withdraw, and, if necessary, shouldactually withdraw from any proceedings in the Assembly which seemed likely to establish any of those principles. It was proposedthat the leader of the Delegation should be authorised in advance to threaten to withdraw from any such proceedings; but that, save in emergency, this threat should not be carried out without priorreference to London.The Cabinet Authorised the Foreign Secretary to instruct the leader ofthe United Kingdom Delegation to the forthcoming meetingOf the General Assembly of the United Nations in the sense proposed in C. (52) 232.Wages. 8.   The Minister of Labour said that there were indications that(Previous        a check had been administered to the mounting pressure for wageReference:      increases by his action in referring back to the Wage Councils theCC. (52) 7.1st    proposals for wage increases for workers in the distributive tradesConclusions,     and by the action of the National Coal Board in rejecting a minute 1.)       wage claim by the National Union of Mineworkers.  The employers&apos;organisations in the engineering and shipbuilding industries, whowere meeting union representatives that day on their claim for anincrease of  2 a week, had shown readiness to adopt a firm line inthe national interest, but some anxiety lest good relations within these industries should be endangered by subsequent Government inter-vention or the undermining of their position by the awards of arbitra-tion tribunals.  He had explained to them that the Government hadno, means of influencing the decisions of arbitration tribunals,although they confidently hoped that such tribunals would pay regardclaimed at common law by national representatives attending the^meetings of these international organisations. Those members ofthe Government who, when in opposition, had in both Houses ofParliament criticised the grant of these privileges to these inter-national organisations would find their position easier if this pointwere more clearly explained when the matter came before Parliamentagain.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should now accord to the international organisations listed in Annex III ofC. (52) 19.1 the privileges and immunities prescribed inthe agreements concluded by the respective organisations.(2) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to present the Orders inCouncil required for this purpose, as set out in Annex iii of C. (52) 191.(3) Asked the Foreign Secretary to give them early notice of any new proposal to extend similar immunities and privilegesto other international agencies.
in their awards to the economic state of the country. So far as theGovernment was concerned, he had assured them that unofficial strikes would be allowed to take their course, but he had explainedthat where the accredited representatives of employees invoked themachinery for conciliation or arbitration he was under a stautory obligation to act, provided that the normal processes of negotiationwithin the industry had been exhausted. The employers&apos; organisa-tions had appeared satisfied with what he had told them.The situation would remain delicate and it was important that nothing should be said publicly which might be interpreted asencouraging or even countenancing a breach of restraint on anysector of the wages front.The Cabinet-Affirmed their support of the policy of the Minister ofLabour in regard to wages.NationalService.Call-up of skilled Workers.(previous reference:CC. (52)29thConclusions,Minute 2.)9. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Supply (C. (52) 270) and the Minister of Labour (C. (52) 273) onthe deferment of call-up of engineering apprentices.The Minister of Supply said that, as a natural corollary to the adjustment of the defence programme, the Departments concernedought now to reapportion scarce categories of skilled engineeringlabour in the manner best calculated to serve the general interest.He knew of firms whose production for export was being impededsolely by a shortage of such skilled men and it might well be foundnecessary, as part of any scheme for reapportionment, to grant ameasure of deferment of apprentices to particular firms with impor-tant export prospects.The Minister of Labour said that he accepted in principle theneed for a measure of deferment of call-up of engineering apprenticesin the interests of exports, but he felt strongly that this should besecured by an extension of the scheme already in operation in respectof armament production of the highest importance. This could bedone without delay. Discrimination in favour of particular firmswould, however, be politically indefensible: he would also wish theperiod of deferment to continue to be restricted to two years.The Minister of Defence said that the Services did not object inprinciple to what the Minister of Supply had in mind, but it wouldbe wrong to assume that readjustment of the defence programme would reduce the Services&apos; need for skilled tradesmen. Great carewould have to be taken to prevent any extension of deferment of apprentices leading to further breaches in the principle of universalityof national service.The Prime Minister said that it was important that some schemefor deferring call-up of engineering apprentices engaged on importantexport work should be introduced with the minimum of delay.The Cabinet-(1) Approved in principle the introduction of a measure of deferment of call-up of engineering apprentices engaged on important export work.(2) Invited the Minister of Labour to work out detailed arrange-ments for this purpose, in agreement with the Ministerof Defence, the Service Ministers and the Minister ofSupply.
The FishingFleet.FinancialAssistance for reconstruction.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 73rdConclusions,Minute 10.)10. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (52) 269) recommending thatExchequer assistance for the reconstruction of the fishing fleet shouldbe on the following basis:  (a) grant at the rate of 25 per cent, of cost for smaller vesselsowned by working fishermen, subject to a maximum of  4,000;(b) grant at the rate of 20 per cent, of cost for other vessels,subject to a maximum of  16,000;(c) no assistance to be given for the construction of vesselsexceeding 140 feet in length.The Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Agricul-ture and Fisheries said that they accepted the Chancellors proposals.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (52) 269.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,31st July, 1952.
