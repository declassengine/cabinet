enya.(previous reference:CC. (52) 79thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Prime Minister drew attention to newspaper criticisms of the recent ordinances made by the Government of Kenya for thepurpose of checking the activities of a secret society known asMau Mau.The Colonial Secretary said that, before approving these ordi-nances, he had satisfied himself that the members of this society whohad been guilty of crimes of violence could not be brought to justiceby the ordinary processes of law. He had not, however, approved allthe proposals which had been submitted to him by the Governmentof Kenya and, so far as possible criticism in Parliament was concerned,he would have no difficulty in showing that the special powers con-ferred by these ordinances were less drastic than some which had beenapproved during the period of office of the Labour Government.In further discussion the suggestion was made that a show ofmilitary force might assist the civil authorities in Kenya in preservinglaw and order. The Colonial Secretary said that he would consider this suggestion; and the Minister of Defence undertook to enquire whether a small force could be sent from Egypt for this purpose, if required.The Cabinet Took note of the Colonial Secretary&apos;s statement.Persia. 2.   The Minister of State said that Dr. Musaddiq had now sent(Previous        a formal reply to the joint message from President Truman and the reference:      Prime Minister on the Persian oil dispute.   This reply was whollyCC. (52) 79th   unsatisfactory.   The fact that it was addressed only to the PrimeConclusions,     Minister suggested that Dr. Musaddiq still hoped to deal separatelyMinute 2.)       with the two Governments and to play one off against the other; andthis made it all the more important that the joint Anglo-Americanapproach to the problem should be preserved.   There would be every advantage in sending a short joint reply to this message, even if this had to be supplemented by a more detailed British note refuting someof the arguments advanced in Dr. Musaddiq&apos;s message.The Prime Minister expressed his preference for a brief reply onthe general lines that Dr. Musaddiq&apos;s arguments could not be accepted and that his message made no contribution towards a reasonable of the dispute. Every effort should be made to induce theUnited States Government to stand firm on the offer made in the jointmessage to which President Truman had set his name.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of State to prepare a draft reply to dr. Musaddiq&apos;s message on the lines indicated in the dis-cussion and, after consultation with the Foreign Secretary,to submit this for the Prime Minister^ approval.Pacific Defence.(previous reference:CC. (52) 54thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Commonwealth Secretary said that, despite the repre-sentations made to him by the Foreign Secretary, the United states secretary of State continued to insist that the United Kingdom couldnot be associated in any way with the Council established under the tripartite Treaty between the United States, Australia and NewZealand for the preservation of peace and security in the Pacific onthe ground that this would make it impossible to resist similar appli-cations from other countries. This ignored the fact that the United42967 B 2
Kingdom was the only other country which would immediately go tothe assistance of Australia and New Zealand if they were attacked.The Governments of Australia and New Zealand had, however,accepted the view of the United States Government and, if we con-tinued to press our claim, we should risk a further rebuff. This didnot mean that we should feel precluded from stating in Parliamentour reasons for claiming that we should be associated with the Counciland our disappointment that our claim had not been conceded.Dr. Evatt&apos;s criticism of our exclusion could not fail to embarrass theAustralian Government.The Prime Minister said that he greatly regretted the Australianacquiescence in this attempt by the United States to usurp our special position in relation to Australia and New Zealand, particularly whenhe recalled our promise in the late war that we would divert our forces from the Middle East if Australia were attacked by Japan. He was disposed to send personal messages about this to the Prime ministers of Australia and New Zealand and possibly also to the AustralianForeign Minister.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would communicatepersonally with the Prime Ministers of Australia and NewZealand on this question.OPersian Gulf.The TrucialSheikhdoms.(previous reference:GC. (52) 47thConclusions,Minute 6.)4. The Minister of State said that the Saudi Arabians were taking steps to extend their influence in the neighbouring Trucialsheikhdoms. Their motive was clearly the desire for further oil con-cessions. We were taking such steps as were open to us to oppose this encroachment, for example, by dropping leaflets over the oases.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.Meat Supplies.Negotiationswith Argentina.(previous reference:GC. (52) 80thConclusions,Minute 1.)5. The Minister of State recalled that on 18th September theCabinet had agreed in principle that some measure of credit shouldbe offered to the Argentine as part of a general agreement providingfor our requirements of meat. The Ministers concerned had subse-quently agreed, after consultation with Her Majesty&apos;s ambassador in Buenos Aires, that up to  10 million of credit should be offered in the first instance.The Lord President said that he was doubtful whether this wouldbe sufficient. It was vital that these negotiations should be broughtto a successful conclusion, and if this could be achieved speedily itmight be possible to avoid reducing the present meat ration even inDecember. If our initial offer of credit was refused we ought at onceeither to increase it or to express willingness to buy more meat than was at present contemplated and pay for part of it in advance.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the present state ofour reserves obliged us to pay careful regard to the short-term pros-pects for our balance of payments and that the grant of credit toArgentina was bound to affect these adversely.The Prime Minister said that the timing of any reduction thatmight have to be made in the meat ration in December would need careful consideration. The Minister of Food would doubtless submit to the Cabinet in due course his proposals about Christmas foodgenerally.
Egypt. 6.   The Minister of State said that General Neguib now seemed(Previous likely to accept the conditions relating to trade and payments mattersReference: which we had attached to our offer to the Egyptian Government ofC C (52) 78th an advance of  5 million to be set off against the release due on conclusions, 1st January, 1953, under Article 3 (3) of the Sterling Releases Agree-minute.)       ment.   He had also promised to let us have by 1st October at thelatest the Egyptian Government^ views on our proposals regardingthe Sudanese elections (see C (52) 308).The Cabinet Took note of these statements.Malted Nations. 7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Corn-Relations with commonwealth Secretary (C. (52) 306) discussing what attitude should beSouth Africa. adopted by the United Kingdom delegation at the forthcoming(Previous Assembly of the United Nations on those subjects on which the SouthReference: African Government seemed likely to be criticised, namely the treat-C.C. (52) 75th ment of Indians in South Africa, the general racial policy of the UnionConclusions, Government and the problem of South-West Africa.1 umu &apos;&quot; The Commonwealth Secretary said that on these matters the delegation would find themselves in a delicate position. Withoutimplying approval of Dr. Malan&apos;s racial policy, we must maintain theprinciples that political affairs of dependent territories fell outside the- scope of the United Nations and that members of the Commonwealthrefrained from interfering in each other&apos;s internal affairs. If theprinciple of non-interference were undermined, there would be no limit to the activities of the Fourth Committee of the Assembly andmoderate opinion in South Africa would be forced into the nationalistcamp. The line suggested in paragraph 14 of his memorandum would avoid these pitfalls and was as favourable to the South african government as they could reasonably expect it to be. Unfortunately,India&apos;s choice of delegates to the Assembly did not encourage thehope that the debates could be kept moderate in tone.The Minister of State said that it was on the question of thegeneral racial policy of the Union Government that the danger wouldbe greatest. It would probably be argued that the concern of theAssembly with human rights overrode Article 2 (7) of the Charter;and, if there were a debate on the merits of Dr. Malan&apos;s policy, itmight be difficult for the United Kingdom delegation to avoid anyexpression of views. Withdrawal by the South African government from the United Nations would be regrettable, since they were playingan active part in the Korean war and South Africa&apos;s vote in theAssembly was often of considerable value to the Atlantic Powers.The Colonial Secretary said that, if there were a debate on the merits of Dr. Malan&apos;s racial policy, the only safe course for the UnitedKingdom delegation would be to decline to take part in it on theground that we could not admit that the Assembly were competent to discuss this matter. Any other course would involve us in serious difficulties either with South Africa or in the Colonial Empire.The Cabinet-Anproved the recommendations made in paragraph 14 ofC. (52) 306.
Tariff Policy. 8.   The President of the Board of Trade recalled that on 18thJapan and the    September the Cabinet had authorised an immediate approach to theG.A.T.T.        United States Government with the object of securing at the forth-(Previous        coming session of the signatories of the General Agreement on TariffsReference:      and Trade (G.A.T.T.) deferment of consideration of Japan&apos;s appli-C.C. (52) 80th    cation to enter into tariff negotiations with a view to her eventualConclusions,     accession to the Agreement.   The outcome of this approach had been minute 2.) &apos;     unexpectedly successful, and the operative paragraph of the resolution which the United States Government now proposed to move at the geneva Conference would secure postponement of the whole issuefor some six months.   Its terms were as follows (Telegram No. 1820from Washington):  &quot;In order that further consideration can be given to theconditions and timing under which the Japanese application should be pursued, the Inter-sessional Committee should make a detailed examination of the matters involved in bringing Japaninto the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and reporton them.&quot;The draft reply to Washington which he had prepared suggestedthat the words &quot; the practical issues arising from this application &quot;should be substituted for the words &quot; the matters involved in bringing Japan into the G.A.T.T.&quot; but left our representatives in. Washington a discretion to accept the State Departments wordingin the last resort. There seemed likely to be general Commonwealthsupport for the line which we and the United States government now intended to adopt at Geneva.In discussion it was pointed out that the United States Govern-ment had come a long way to meet us and that it would be unfor-unfortunate to risk losing the agreement with them which now appearedto be within our grasp. The Prime Minister said, however, that he saw no need to give our representatives discretion to accept the StateDepartments wording, which clearly went beyond what we should wish.It was the general view of the Cabinet that we should not give way to the United States Government on this point, but should propose the simple deletion from the resolution of the words &quot; in bringing Japan into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.&quot;The Cabinet Invited the President of the Board of Trade to amend thedraft telegram in the light of their discussion and, subjectto the Prime Ministers approval, to arrange for its despatch to Washington.9. The Minister of Labour reported to the Cabinet the latest developments in the negotiations for wage increases in theengineering and shipbuilding industries. He had kept in close touchwith the representatives of both sides of these industries, and he had that morning received indications that both sides would be willing toaccept invitations to be represented at a joint meeting to be held underthe chairmanship of a representative of his Department. He now had reasonable grounds for hoping that it would be possible to secure an agreed settlement.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,26th September, 1952.Wages.Engineering andShipbuildingIndustries.(previous reference:C.C.
