ply-Elections.Speeches by ministers.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 90thConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The Prime Minister said that the Chief Whip would no doubtconsider whether the forthcoming by-elections at Farnworth and small Heath were of sufficient importance to warrant a departure from the rule that Cabinet Ministers should not normally be askedto speak in by-elections. Arrangements should in any event be made if or a number of other Ministers to speak in these by-elections.Parliament.Business in theHouse ofCommons.2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The debate on the Second Reading of the Iron and Steel bill would be opened on 25th November by the Minister of Supply. Onthe following day the Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Supply,would speak early and the Minister of Housing and Local Govern-ment would reply to the debate.On 28th November there would be a debate on aTPrivateMember&apos;s Bill to establish a Press Council. It had been hoped thatthe newspaper proprietors would reach agreement with representa-tives of those working on the newspapers for the voluntaryestablishment of such a Council, but no such agreement had beenreached and the Government would have to indicate in the debatetheir attitude towards the proposal for a statutory Council. TheCabinet agreed that the Home Secretary should ascertain, before the debate, the present views of the Newspaper Proprietors&apos; association on this question.The Coronation.R.A.F. Review.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 96thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Cabinet were informed that The Queen had assented tothe proposal, put forward in their earlier discussion on 13th Novem-ber, that the projected RAF. Review should not be included amongthe events immediately following the Coronation. It had now beenarranged that this Review should be held on 15th July, 1953, and her majesty had agreed to attend it on that day.Commonwealth 4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theDevelopment. Colonial Secretary and the Chancellor of the Duchy of LancasterVolta River (C. (52) 402) seeking the Cabinet^ approval for the publication of aAluminium White Paper outlining a scheme for the development of aluminiumScheme. production on the Volta River in the Gold Coast and announcing the appointment of a Preparatory Commission to complete the investigations into the scheme.The Colonial Secretary said that under this scheme the resourcesof water power and bauxite in the Gold Coast would be developed- in order to produce aluminium at an ultimate rate of 210,000 tons ayear. The United Kingdom would have an option on 75 per cent, ofthis production. This would assist our balance of payments, sincefour-fifths of our aluminium requirements were now drawn from dollar sources. The scheme involved capital expenditure on hydro-electric and other works provisionally estimated at about  100millions initially and about  144 millions ultimately. The share ofthe United Kingdom Government would &quot;be of the order of 43 millions initially, rising to about  57 millions. The Gold coast government would have a share in the equity interest in the smeltercompany, and would thus have a substantial stake in the success of
housing programme.0?previous reference:C.C. (52) 73rdConclusions,Minute 8.)5. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Housing and the Minister of Works (C. (52) 396 and 408) on thefuture prospects of the housing programme.The Minister of Housing said that the number of houses com-pleted in 1952 was now likely to be 240,000 i.e., 10,000 in excess ofthe target. It was possible that the programme of 260,000 houses for 1953 might also be exceeded. Much, however, would depend upon the weather, which had been particularly favourable during1952. He was now asking the Cabinet to approve a programme of300,000 houses for 1954. He thought that this could be achieved without detriment to the necessary building programmes for defence,industry, agriculture, education, &amp;c, but in order to reduce the costto the Exchequer he hoped to include within that total a substantiallylarger number of privately-built houses. For this purpose he proposed to relax the control by building licence over private building of houses within a limit of 1,000 square feet and 1^ standards of timber. It was, however, for consideration whether this control should be removed entirely or whether a modified test of need shouldbe retained on the lines indicated in the Appendix to his memo-randum. This was a political question which he would be glad todiscuss with a few of his Cabinet colleagues.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the programmeproposed must have an effect upon the Budget and upon building for productive industry and defence. The Minister of Defence saidthat he hoped the works programme for defence would have passedits peak by 1954.the scheme. This would reduce the risk of eventual expropriation b^Hthe Gold Coast Government. The first step was to set up aPreparatory Commission to complete the investigation of the scheme;but the Cabinet should understand that, if the Commission reportedin favour of the scheme, it would be difficult for the Government toavoid going on with it.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) It might at the present stage be as well to avoid a directexpression of opinion that the scheme was soundly conceived, andthe Colonial Secretary undertook to see whether this expression ofopinion could not be modified in paragraph 17 of the White paper and in the Summary of Proposals.(b) Would there be advantage in withholding publication of theWhite Paper until after the opening of the Commonwealth EconomicConference? Some visiting Commonwealth Delegations might feelthat the matter had been decided without due consultation, and thattheir chances of receiving support from the United Kingdom in development schemes would now be less. It was urged, on the otherhand, that the scheme was already public knowledge and had beendiscussed over a number of years. Any further delay at this stagemight endanger the whole scheme.The Cabinet Approved the early appointment of the Preparatory Corn-mission to complete the investigation of the Volta Riveraluminium scheme; and authorised the Colonial secretary and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to present a white Paper on the scheme in the terms of the draft annexed to C. (52) 402, subject to a suitable modification ofparagraph (v) of the Summary of Proposals and para-graph 17.
National 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisterInsurance. of National Insurance (C. (52) 405) recommending a revision in the maternity       rates of maternity benefits.Benefits- The Minister of National Insurance said that increases of 25 per(Previous        cent, had been made in all other National Insurance benefit schemesReference:      in the spring of 1952, but maternity benefits had been left unchangedCC. (52) 39th   because they were then being reviewed by the National InsuranceConclusions,    Advisory Committee.   This Committee had now reported.   the minute 3.)       general effect of their recommendations was to increase maternitybenefits by 31 per cent, for housewives and by 45 per cent, for employed women.  The lump-sum payment before the child&apos;s birthwould be increased and the period during which a special weekly allowance was given would be extended from 13 to 18 weeks, butthis weekly allowance for an employed woman would fall from365. to 32s. 6d. The extra cost of  2 millions a year could be carried by the National Insurance Fund until the next quinquennial review in 1954.In discussion it was argued that a reduction in the weekly allowance for employed women would be singled out for criticismregardless of the increase in the lump-sum benefit. It was for con-sideration whether this criticism might not be avoided, either byleaving the weekly allowance at its present rate of 36.?. and accepting the additional cost of  300,000 per annum, or by offering recipientsthe option of 36s. for 13 weeks, or 32s. 6d. a week for 18 weeks.On the other hand, it was urged that the Advisory Committeehad expressed the firm opinion that some women risked serious damage to their health if they did not stop work for more than13 weeks at the time of a confinement. Moreover, any departure from the recommendations of the Advisory Committee would expose the Government to pressure for alterations in other parts of thescheme.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thepreponderant opinion in the Cabinet was in favour of adopting therecommendations of the Advisory Committee as a whole. If serious criticism developed regarding the proposed reduction of the weekly allowance, the Cabinet could consider whether any modificationsshould be proposed on the Committee stage of the Bill.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals for a revision of maternity benefitsput forward by the Minister of National Insurance inC. (52) 405; and authorised him- to proceed with the intro-duction of legislation to give effect to them.:(b) The Minister of Works said that he was satisfied that the productivity of the building industry would expand sufficiently todeal with a programme of 300,000 houses in 1954.(c) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it seemed likely that 270,000 houses would be built in 1953, and he proposed toproceed on that assumption in framing the Investment programme for 1953.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in C. (52) 396 regarding the housing programme in 1954.(2) Invited the Minister of Housing, in consultation with theLord Privy Seal, the Home Secretary, the Minister ofLabour and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,to consider what modification should be made in theexisting arrangements for licensing the private building of houses.
corporal punishment.(previous reference:CC. (52) 89thConclusions,Minute 2.)8. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the HomeSecretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland (C. (52) 386 and387) on the question of corporal punishment as a penalty for crimesof violence.The Prime Minister said that he was not attracted by the sug-gestion, put forward in the Home Secretary&apos;s memorandum, that a royal Commission or Departmental Committee should be appointedto make a further enquiry into this question. He would prefer thatthe Government should hold themselves free to introduce legislationrestoring corporal punishment if at any time it became clear thatthere was a sufficient body of public support for this course to makeit possible to pass the necessary legislation through Parliament.Corporal punishment, if it were reintroduced, should be available as a penalty for all crimes of violence or brutality; and he did not exclude the possibility that this penalty might be reintroduced on an experimental basis, for a period of not more than five years, at theend of which it could be seen whether there had been an appreciabledecrease in the crimes for which it was made available. He thoughtthat, if a plebiscite could be held on this question, the majority of thepeople of this country might be found to be in favour of reintroducingthis penalty.The Home Secretary said, that he recognised that there was wide-spread public anxiety about the increase in the number of crimesinvolving violence. But robbery with violence was the only suchcrime for which the penalty of corporal punishment had recently beenHigher 7.   The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Lord PresideUJTechnological   an(i the Secretary of State for Scotland (C. (52) 371 and 378) outliningEducation.      proposals for providing increased facilities for higher technological education.The Paymaster-General said that the immediate step proposed was the expansion of the Imperial College of London University. TheLord President suggested, however, that this development in london should be supplemented by the provision of similar facilities at the manchester Municipal College of Technology and the Royal TechnicalCollege, Glasgow. He and the Secretary of State for Scotlandstrongly supported that suggestion. If, however, the new technological-logical work of those two Colleges was to have the status andreputation of University teaching, arrangements must be made to separate the more advanced work from the technical education whichthey also provided. The first step would be to encourage the twoColleges to put forward proposals for securing a sufficient demar-cation between the two types of courses.The Chancellor of the Exchequer supported the proposals putforward in these memoranda. Work was already in hand on theexpansion of Imperial College, London; and he would urge theUniversity Grants Committee to encourage the two colleges at manchester and Glasgow to put forward proposals on the lines suggested by the Paymaster-General.The Minister of Education said that, while she supported theseproposals, she was anxious that the changes envisaged at Manchester. should not be allowed to have the effect of reducing the facilities which would be available there for technical education.The Cabinet Agreed that facilities for higher technological education should be provided at the Imperial College of LondonUniversity, the Royal Technical College, Glasgow, and the manchester Municipal College of Technology on the lines proposed in C. (52) 371 and 378.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,20th November, 1952.available, and it should be remembered that the incidence of thisparticular offence had in fact decreased since that penalty was with-drawn in 1948. The increase in crimes of violence had been in other offences, for which the penalty of corporal punishment had not been available for nearly 100 years. He had little doubt that the properremedy was to build up the strength of the police forces, which were now far below establishment in all our principal cities. He himself was doubtful whether the Government would be justified in promotinglegislation on this subject without a further enquiry which wouldtake account of post-war conditions. But the Cabinet should in any event consider the political difficulties of introducing legislation to restore corporal punishment: there seemed to him to be little prospect of passing such a measure through the House of Commonsif, as he believed, the Labour Party would oppose it and at least one-fourth of the Governments supporters would be unwilling to vote for it.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that a majority of scottish Members in the House of Commons would be opposed to therestoration of corporal punishment.In further discussion it was pointed out that, since the two memoranda were circulated, a Member who had obtained a high placein the ballot for Private Members&apos; Bills had indicated his intention tointroduce a Bill to restore corporal punishment as a penalty for crimesof violence. The Second Reading of this Bill, which would be takenin February, would provide a convenient opportunity to test publicopinion on this question and to obtain a free expression of the viewsof the House of Commons. Though the Government would beexpected to indicate their views, the issue could properly be left onthat occasion to a free vote of the House.The Cabinet (1) Decided not to proceed further at present with the suggestion for a further enquiry into the question of corporal punish-ment as a penalty for crimes of violence.(2) Agreed that Members of the House of Commons should be encouraged to express their views on this question, in a free vote, on the Second Reading in February of theCorporal Punishment Bill which was shortly to be intro-duced by a Private Member.(3) Agreed to consider at a later meeting what views should beput forward on the Governments behalf in the debate onthat Bill.
