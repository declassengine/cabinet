f^jerritorial\- Waters.IcelandFisheriesDispute.(previous reference:CC. (52) 74thConclusions,Minute 5.)By-Elections.Speeches by ministers.(previous reference:CC. (52) 87thConclusions,Minute 1.)United Nations.Handling ofColonialQuestions.(previous reference:CC (52) 75thConclusions,Minute 7.)1, The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (52) 357) reporting that, owing to the definition of territorial waters adopted by the Icelandic Government, British trawlers were being excluded from grounds which they had been accustomed to fish for over fifty years; and that in retaliation Britishtrawler-owners had prevented Icelandic trawlers from calling at Hulland Grimsby to land their fish.The Foreign Secretary said that representations had been madeto the Icelandic Government without effect. There was now a danger that Icelandic firms would refuse to continue to place orders in theUnited Kingdom if their trawlers were prevented from landing theirfish in United Kingdom ports. In these circumstances he recom-mended that, an attempt should be made to bring the fishing interestsof the two countries into direct discussions, even though it could notbe assumed that any solution at which they might arrive would be endorsed by their Governments. If this recommendation was approved, he would ask the Icelandic Government to do what theycould to facilitate these discussions.The Cabinet Agreed that the most profitable step in the Icelandic fisheriesdispute would be to promote direct discussions between the fishing interests of the two countries; and invited the foreign secretary to urge this course upon the Icelandic Govern-ment.2. The Cabinet agreed that the Foreign Secretary should speakin the forthcoming by-election at High Wycombe.The Chief Whip reminded the Cabinet that the Minister ofHealth was due to make a Party political broadcast oh 30th october and said that the Opposition might seek to exercise their right of reply on 1st November or on 3rd November, on the eve of the poll. the broadcast by the Minister of Health would not be related to the by-election. If, therefore, an Opposition speaker made on 1stNovember a broadcast which was directly related to the by-election,a Government speaker could, if necessary, exercise the right of reply on 3rd November. If such a broadcast were made by an Oppositionspeaker on 3rd November, the Government would have no otherredress than to represent to the British Broadcasting Corporation that facilities should not have been given for an electioneering manoeuvreof this kind.3. The Foreign Secretary said that he had received informationsuggesting that an attempt might be made to initiate discussion inthe United Nations on the current disorders in Kenya and the steps which had been taken to check them. Such an attempt, if successful,would breach the principles which he had outlined in his memo-randum (C. (52) 232) on the need to prevent the development of adoctrine that Colonial Powers were accountable to the United nations for the administration of their Colonies. He had, therefore, after consulting the Colonial Office, instructed the Leader of the UnitedKingdom Delegation to the General Assembly that if the Assemblysought to discuss the present situation in Kenya he should threaten to withdraw, and if necessary should actually withdraw, from theproceedings. This course was consistent with the principles whichthe Cabinet had approved at their meeting on 31st July (CO. (52) 75thConclusions, Minute 7).The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the instructions which theForeign Secretary had sent to the Leader of the UnitedKingdom Delegation to the General Assembly regarding theattitude which he should adopt towards any attempt by theAssembly to discuss the current situation in Kenya.43319-3b 2
Iron and SteelIndustry.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 74thConclusions,Minute 1.)4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the minister^of Supply (C. (52) 366) submitting the final draft of the Iron andSteel Bill.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had not yet com-pleted his discussions with the Finance Corporation for Industryregarding their rights under the Iron and Steel Act, 1949. This point,which might require some amendment of paragraph 10 of the first schedule of the Bill, would be settled in consultation with the Ministerof Supply before the Bill was introduced.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Supply to settle the final formof paragraph 10 of the First Schedule of the Iron and steel bill in the light of the results of the discussions which theChancellor of the Exchequer was holding with the finance corporation for Industry.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1) above, approved the text of theIron and Steel Bill annexed to C. (52) 366, and authorised the Minister of Supply to arrange for its introduction atthe opening of the new session of Parliament.The Queen&apos;sSpeech on theOpening ofParliament.Preservation ofHistoricBuildings.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 88thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Minister of Works invited the Cabinet to review their decision that The Queen&apos;s Speech should not include specific referenceto the proposed legislation for the preservation of historic buildings.This legislation would be welcomed by Government supporters andwas unlikely to be criticised by the Opposition. The Governmenthad decided, on 21st October, that the Bill should be introduced inthe coming Session; and its omission from The Queen&apos;s Speech was likely to excite unfavourable comment.In discussion there was some support for this suggestion. Onthe other hand it was argued that, in view of the evident determination of the Opposition to delay the passage of Government legislation, theGovernment would be ill-advised to give any avoidable promises to enact legislation before the end of the coming session. Moreover, itwas arguable that this specific reference to historic buildings might seem out of place in a Gracious Speech which did not mention anyplans for facilitating the repair of ordinary dwellings.The Cabinet-Reaffirmed their decision that The Queen&apos;s Speech on theOpening of Parliament should not include specific referenceto the proposed legislation for the preservation of historicbuildings; but agreed that in the Debate on the Address itmight be stated that the Government hoped to be able toproceed with a Bill for this purpose and, if time permitted,to pass it into law before the end of the session.The Coronation.Television.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 87thConclusions,Minute 7.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (C. (52) 367) suggesting that the Coronation commission should be invited to review their earlier decision that no facilities should be given for televising the Coronation ceremonies east of theScreen in Westminster Abbey.The Prime Minister said that he had been concerned at the publicdisappointment caused by this decision and, together with certain ofhis Cabinet colleagues, he had discussed the matter informally withthe Archbishop of Canterbury, the Earl Marshal and The Queen&apos;private Secretary. As a result, he suggested that the decision might now be reviewed on the basis of the principles which he had set outin paragraph 2 of his memorandum.   He did not think it would be
^ possible to defend against public criticism a decision which dis-criminated between the televising and the filming of the ceremony.The spiritual parts of the proceedings should be excluded from boththe films and television, but the other proceedings within the Screenmight, he thought, be televised on the general understanding that no more intimate a view would be given than that which would be avail-able to the average person seated within the Screen.The Prime Minister also read to the Cabinet the draft of a state-ment which he was proposing to make in the House of Commons that afternoon in reply to Questions on this matter.In discussion there was general support for the principles set outin the Prime Ministers memorandum C. (52) 367. The Cabinet were,however, informed that the technical problems of televising the pro-ceedings within the Screen had not yet been fully explored, and thatit might be unwise to give the impression that this amount of televisionwould be allowed until it was certain that all the technical difficultiescould be overcome. It was agreed that words should be added to thestatement which the Prime Minister was to make in the House ofCommons that afternoon in order to safeguard the possibility thatthe televising of the ceremony might have to be further curtailed onaccount of technical difficulties. In this connection it was also agreedthat additional lighting within the Screen, whether for television orfor a colour film, should not be permitted to an extent which would impair the dignity of the proceedings.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Prime Minister to ask the Earl Marshal to move the Coronation Commission to review, in the light of theprinciples set out in paragraph 2 of C. (52) 367, their earlier decision that no part of the Coronation ceremony withinthe Screen at Westminster Abbey should be televised.(2) Took note with approval of the statement on this matter which the Prime Minister was proposing to make that afternoon in the House of Commons; and invited theCommonwealth Secretary to make a corresponding state-ment in the House of Lords.Seating in the The Cabinet had before them a note by the Prime MinisterAbbey. (C. (52) 353) covering a minute by the Earl Marshal seeking guidance on proposals for allocating seats in Westminster Abbey at the coronation. Under this plan it was proposed that, in order to provideplaces for representatives of other Commonwealth countries and ofTrade Unions, the seats available for Members of the House of lords and of the House of Commons should be restricted to 880 and 650respectively; that the general body of Peers and Members of theHouse of Commons should ballot for seats; that Peers successful in the ballot should be allowed to be accompanied by the Peeressesor Dowager Peeresses; and that Members of the House of Commonssuccessful in the ballot should be allowed to be accompanied, by theirspouses.In discussion it was suggested that, if 650 seats were available for members of the House of Commons, it might be preferable that anyMember should be allowed to claim a seat as of right and that thebalance should be available for wives of Members to be selected byballot. A similar arrangement could perhaps be adopted for thegeneral body of Peers. The Minister of Works might provide special facilities on the route of the procession for Members of both houses of Parliament who were not given seats in the Abbey.Some arrangement would also have to be made for determining the extent to which Trade Union representatives should be accom-panied by their wives; but the best course there might be to allota definite number of seats for Trade Union representatives and leave it to the Trade Union Congress to determine which of the represen-tatives chosen could be accompanied by their wives.
Comment was made on the large numbers of seats which it wa^proposed to allot to members of the Civil Services and FightingServices. It was pointed out that these Services were now much larger than they had been in 1937. On the other hand, they included a larger number of Knights Grand Cross, for whom separate provision wasto be made in the Abbey. It was thought that on this account therewas scope for some further reduction in the number of seats allotted to the Services.The Cabinet-(3) Invited the Minister of Works to make, in the light of their discussion, a critical analysis of the proposals set out inC. (52) 353 for the allocation of seats in Westminster Abbeyand to submit this, together with his recommendations, tothe Prime Minister.Seating on The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the minister the route. of Works (C. (52) 358) setting out the main arguments for and against certain aspects of the Coronation arrangements which had been thesubject of public comment.The Cabinefs discussion turned on the plans for providing seatsalong the route of the Coronation procession. Comment was madeon the high charges which were being made for accommodation in private buildings along the route. The Cabinet recognised that itwould be impracticable to regulate these charges by any system of price control, and that public action to check extortionate chargesmust be limited to increasing as far as possible the number of seats to be provided by public authorities. The proposed extension of the outward route should be of value from this point of view.The cost of erecting Government stands along the route wouldbe even higher than had been expected and, if the full cost was tobe recovered from seat-holders, the charges would have to be at least 6 for a covered seat and  4 for an uncovered seat. Some of theCommonwealth High Commissioners in London were inclined, tosuggest that these prices were too high, particularly as some of them had made tentative arrangements on the basis of earlier, and lower,estimates of the charges which were likely to be made. The cabinet agreed, however, to maintain the principle that the United kingdom excequer could not be expected to make any contribution towardsthe cost of erecting these stands though other Commonwealth. Governments and organisations like the Trade Union Congress, who took over whole stands from the Ministry of Works at the full cost,would be free, if they chose, to sell the seats at lower prices and make up the difference themselves.The Cabinet-(4) Took note of this memorandum by the Minister of Works.industrial 7.  The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Minister of disputes Labour (C. (52) 303) and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (52) 309)Order, 1951.    on a proposal that members of professional organisations should bebrought within the scope Of the Industrial Disputes Order, 1951.The Minister of Labour said that this Order enabled him in cer-tain circumstances to refer to compulsory arbitration industrial disputes which were reported to him. The Order continued the war-time measure first introduced in 1940, and had been made by the late government after long discussions with industry. By an error in drafting it had accidentally excluded many professional organisations,e.g., the Royal College of Nursing and the National Union of Teachers,from the right to compulsory arbitration which they had enjoyedunder the original Order. There was no reason why these organisa-tions should be excluded and he was under heavy pressure to amend
the Order so as to bring them within its scope. He did not think then-inclusion would lead to claims and awards, on the lines of theDanckwerts Award, which would do harm to the policy of wage restraint; for the Industrial Disputes Tribunal was a responsible body with long experience in dealing with wage claims.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was convincedthat, unless the amended Order excluded from compulsory arbitration by the Tribunal persons earning more than, say,  1,500 a year, therewould be a grave danger to the policy of wage restraint. On the otherhand, it was argued that, if this upper limit were imposed, many persons who now enjoyed the right to compulsory arbitration wouldbe denied it.(b) The Minister of Health said that, if the Order were amended as proposed by the Minister of Labour, the consultants and specialistsin the Health Service would almost certainly resort to arbitration bythe Industrial Disputes Tribunal.The Prime Minister said that it was desirable to defer for as longas possible making any amendment of the industrial Disputes Order,1951. If political and public pressure increased, the Minister ofLabour could bring the matter before the Cabinet again.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Labour to defer making any amend-ment of the Industrial Disputes Order, 1951, for the timebeing.Scheduling of 8.   The President of the Board of Trade said that the EconomicNew Policy Committee had agreed upon certain measures with regard to development the distribution of industry. Before announcing these to ParliamentAreas. he wished to obtain the approval of the Cabinet.  In the first place,he intended to schedule a development area in North-East Lancashire.The effect of this would be to attract some assistance in the building of factories and some facilities for loans from the Treasury. By agree-ment with the Secretary of State for Scotland he wished to take actionwhich would have a similar effect in the Buckie-Peterhead area of north-East Scotland. He also intended in certain other areas tomodify and make easier the conditions which had to be fulfilled beforelicences were granted for the building of factories.The Cabinet-Approved the course of action proposed by the President ofthe Board of Trade.Employment. 9.   The Minister of Labour said that the latest figures of unem-(Previous ployment showed an increase of only 8,500 during the past month.Reference: The seasonal increase at this time of year was usually much larger:C.C. (52) 66th during the last four years the average increase over the same periodConclusions, was about 30,000. The total number of unemployed persons was stillMinute 4.) under 400,000.In discussion reference was made to the fact that industrial pro-duction was failing to expand to the extent which had been expected.It was suggested that this was due largely to difficulty in maintainingexport sales. The engineering industries, in particular, were likely tofind it increasingly difficult to attain their export targets.
The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster undertook to circulatHto members of the Cabinet a report which he had obtained, for theinformation of the Employment Committee, on recent trends in industrial production.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Minister of Labour andof the points raised in the discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,28th October, 1952.
