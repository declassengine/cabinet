CommonwealthEconomicConference.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 92ndConclusions,Minute 1.)DevelopmentPolicy.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (52) 379) about the attitude which theUnited Kingdom Delegation should take on Development Policy atthe Commonwealth Economic Conference.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in intensifyingdevelopment directed towards improving the sterling area&apos;s balanceof payments, a proper balance should be preserved between develop-ment at home, where special attention would be given to the expansionof certain parts of the engineering industry, and development in other sterling area countries, towards which,&apos; it was suggested, the UnitedKingdom Government should make a contribution. He was con-sidering how such a contribution could best be made and would submit a further memorandum on that point in due course.The following points were made in discussion:  (a) The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster drew attention tothe statement in paragraph 16 (d) of the memorandum that we might hope that the recent fall in the outflow of private capital from theUnited Kingdom to the sterling area would continue. The flow ofprivate capital was essential to development of certain raw materials.(b) The Minister of Agriculture said that the statement inparagraph 10, that no special measures were called for in respect ofthe agricultural expansion programme, should not exclude the develop-ment of, for example, rural electricity and water supplies.(c) The Minister of Supply asked that civil aircraft might beadded to the engineering products mentioned in paragraph 10 of thememorandum.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the recommendations in C. (52) 379, subject to thepoints noted in paragraphs (a)-(c) above.Commodity The Cabinet also had before them a memorandum by thePolicy. President of the Board of Trade and the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster (C. (52) 380) about the line to be taken by the UnitedKingdom Delegation on Commodity Policy.The President of the Board of Trade said that the three possible courses open to us were set out in paragraph 8 of the memorandum and that, for the reasons given in paragraph 11, it was recommendedthat we should, adopt the third of these, namely, that we should proceed as at present with the empirical examination of individual commodities, case by case, within the internationally-accepted frame-work of principles and procedures. Thus, we should continue toparticipate in international discussions of wheat, sugar, rubber and cotton and, when the time was ripe, of tin, wool and possibly other commodities.The Foreign Secretary said that the suggestion in paragraph 11that we should follow this line &quot; with no positive bias in favour ofan agreement in principle in any particular case &quot; implied, in his view,\Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet discussed the arrangements for the remainingBusiness in the stages of the Debate on the Address. They agreed that on house of 7th November, when the Opposition intended to direct attention toCommons. Colonial affairs, the Colonial Secretary should make a statement onhis mission to Kenya and should answer any points raised in the debate. On 10th November the Minister of Labour would speak onbehalf of the Government. On the last day of the Debate on11th November the Government spokesmen would be the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Lord Privy Seal.The Cabinet were also informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the remainder of that week.
&apos;c-- 76United Nations.Handling ofColonialQuestions.(previous reference:CC. (52) 90thConclusions,Minute 3.)Relations with south Africa.(previous reference:CC (52) 81stConclusions,Minute 7.)3. The Foreign Secretary said that the United States Govern-ment had now indicated that, on juridical grounds, they would vote infavour of the competence of the United Nations to discuss theTunisian issue. This was a serious development and he intended todiscuss the position with the Foreign Ministers of the United Statesand France as soon as he arrived in New York. If the matter were raised in the House of Commons that afternoon he would expresssupport for the French Governments point of view.It was possible that the competence of the United Nations todiscuss the racial policy of the South African Government might also be raised in the Debate on the Address. The repercussions ofthat policy outside the boundaries of the Union made it difficult to enlist support for the view that this was a domestic South Africanissue. But in framing any statement which it might be necessary tomake in the House he would give full weight to the assurances alreadybeen given to the South African Government, following the cabinets discussion on 26th September, about the attitude which we should adopt towards this in the debates in the Assembly.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statements.Sudan.(previous reference:CC. (52) 54thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (52) 388) covering the draft of a reply which he pro-posed to have sent to a letter he had received from Mr. Omar, theSecretary of the Sudan Party, which hoped that the Sudan would eventually adhere to the British Commonwealth.The Foreign Secretary said that the reply could only be non-committal but it was for consideration whether it would not be wise to take preliminary soundings of other Commonwealth governments on their attitude towards a possible application by the Sudan to join the Commonwealth.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Common-wealth Relations said that the South African Government wouldcertainly oppose the admission of the Sudan to the Commonwealth.Canada, Australia and New Zealand, also, would be reluctant to agreeto the admission of the Sudan, not on racial grounds, but becauseany increase in the number of small member countries would weaken the Commonwealths coherence and detract from the value of commonwealth discussions.rather too negative an approach. The only international commodityagreement at present in operation, namely, the Wheat Agreement, had proved more favourable in practice to us than we had expected, andhe would prefer that we should be rather more forthcoming in our attitude towards international discussions on other commodities. Itwas explained that the guarded wording of the recommendation beforethe Cabinet reflected a compromise reached at the preparatorymeeting between a wide variety of conflicting views. There was,however, general support in the Cabinet for the view expressed bythe Foreign Secretary.The Cabinet (2) Approved generally the proposals in C. (52) 380 but agreedthat at the forthcoming Conference the United KingdomGovernment should indicate that in principle they were disposed to favour the conclusion of international com-commodity agreements in appropriate cases.
Atomic Energy 5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theOrganisation. Paymaster-General (C. (52) 317) recommending the establishment ofan independent Corporation to take over from the Ministry of supply the responsibility for all atomic research and production. They also had before them a memorandum by the Colonial. Secretary (C. (52)363) supporting this recommendation, and one by the Minister ofSupply (C. (52) 364) recommending that, before a decision was taken,the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed change should befurther examined.The Paymaster-General said that the change which he recom-mended had been urged by Lord Portal of Hungerford, the firstController of Atomic Energy, and was favoured by the present seniorstaff in the Atomic Energy Establishments. Atomic energy develop-ment in this country had plainly suffered from delays: we had takenmuch longer to make an atomic bomb than either the Americansor the Russians. This was due, in his opinion, to the decision to entrust atomic development to a Government Department, whosestructure and procedures were unsuited to the special needs of this work. The Ministry of Supply had been unable to recruit adequatenumbers of first class production-engineers and there had been losses of experienced staff which could have been avoided if it had beenpossible to offer generous gratuities to those completing the periodof service provided for in their contracts. The normal Civil Servicesecurity procedure was also too cumbrous for application to staff engaged on atomic work. This was an opportune moment for trans-ferring responsibility from the Ministry of Supply, because theindustrial application of atomic energy was only just beginning. the atomic Energy Establishments were approaching half the size ofImperial Chemical Industries and needed a comparable Board of directors enjoying a large measure of freedom from detailed inter-ference. Adequate Treasury and Parliamentary control could be ensured if the proposed organisation were financed by means of grants-in-aid. It was significant that in no other country did responsi-bility for atomic development now rest with a Government Depart-ment.   He did not, however, wish to press -his suggestion that aIn discussion the view was expressed that a study should bemade of the general implications from this point of view of our colonial policy of developing Colonies to the stage at which theycould attain &quot; independence within the Commonwealth.&quot; There wasno difference in principle between admitting the Sudan to Common-wealth membership and accepting, say, the Gold Coast as a full member.The view was also expressed that, while the reply to Mr. Omarmust be non-committal, it might be made more acceptable if the sentence: &quot; It is not possible for Her Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom at this time to express any opinion about the form which that relationship should take&quot; were modified to read asfollows : &quot; This is not, however, the time for Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom to express an opinion about the form which that relationship should take.&quot;The Cabinet (1) Approved generally the draft letter attached to C. (52) 388but invited the Foreign Secretary to consider the modifica-tion suggested in discussion.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation withthe Foreign Secretary and the Colonial Secretary, to con-sider and report to the Cabinet on the problems involvedin admitting to full Commonwealth membership colonial territories which might in future attain the status of&quot; independence within the Commonwealth.&quot;
m. separate Ministry should be set up with responsibihty for carryingOut the proposed transfer of.responsibility: this might be effectedunder the aigis of the Lord President.The Minister of Supply said that he was concerned, not to defend a  preserve of his Ministry, but rather to ensure that the future atomic energy organisation would promote the maximum degree of efficiency.It seemed to him essential that, before a decision was taken on sovital an issue, the facts should be more fully investigated. Forinstance, his information did not suggest that the present senior staffin the Atomic Energy Establishments favoured a change on the lines suggested by the Paymaster-General, although there might be somedesire among them for rather greater freedom from control. Again,the statistics of staff losses in the Atomic Energy Establishments didnot compare unfavourably with those in comparable industrial firms.It seemed likely to be a year at least before a Bill on the subject couldbe introduced in Parliament; and in these circumstances the case forany change in the existing arrangements, which would be bound to cause some disorganisation, ought to be fully established before adecision was taken.The Foreign Secretary said that he was inclined to favour thechange recommended by the Paymaster-General, both because a non-Departmental form of organisation would allow greater flexibility,subject to broad Government direction, and because the United StatesAtomic Energy authority would probably find it easier to co-operate with such an organisation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in his view the paymaster-GeneraPs memorandum tended to underestimate the achievements of the existing organisation and to exaggerate its draw-backs. It was important that the Atomic Energy organisation, whichat present cost the Exchequer some  30- 40 million a year, should remain subject to effective financial control. The Atomic Energyorganisation in the United States, although non-Departmental, was subject to detailed financial control by Congress. He thought it undesirable to do anything which would impede contact between the atomic Energy organisation and the many Government Departmentsintimately affected by its work. Care must also be taken to preservesome balance between the conditions of service of staff engaged on atomic work and staff engaged on other projects of almost equalimportance.The Minister of Defence said that the experience of the canadian government, which had recently and with success transferred respon-sibility for atomic energy from a Government Department to a StateCompany, was of interest.The Minister of Works said that it would be necessary to consider how the building programme of the Atomic Energy organisation would be carried out if responsibility were transferred from theMinistry of Supply. The staff of the Ministry of Works at present engaged on this work was large and possessed experience which wasnot available in any other quarter.In further discussion other Ministers spoke in favour of theproposal put forward by the Paymaster-General in C. (52) 317.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said thatthe general opinion in the Cabinet appeared to favour the changerecommended by the Paymaster-General, but he thought that, before any final decision was taken, the facts should be more thoroughlyinvestigated and presented to the Cabinet. This could best be doneby a small body of Ministers who would hear the arguments on bothsides and advise the Cabinet whether a change in the existing arrange-ments was desirable, if the Cabinet approved the proposed transferin principle, a small Committee of Experts could be appointed toconsider in detail how responsibility should best be transferred toa non-Departmental organisation.
investment programme.(previous reference:C.C,(52)73rdConclusions,Minute 8.)Blitzed Cities.The Cabinet (1) Appointed a Committee comprising:  The Lord Privy Seal (Chairman),The Minister of Labour,The Minister of Housing and Local Government,to consider with the Ministers concerned and to reportto the Cabinet whether responsibility for atomic research and production should be transferred from the Ministryof Supply to a non-Departmental organisation.(2) Agreed that, if the Cabinet should decide in favour of trans-ferring responsibility, the form of non-departmental organisation to be established for the purpose and thearrangements for effecting the transfer of responsibility should be made the subject of further study by a small body of experts.6. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Minister of housing and Local Government, the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Minister of Works (C. (52) 350, 385 and 390) regarding thelimits imposed by the Investment Programme on reconstruction workin blitzed cities.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that,if this work was to be limited in 1953 to the  2 5 milllionalready authorised, only  ^ million would be available for new projects, and in the course of the year work on the blitzed citieswould come to a standstill even though there was local unemployment among building workers in the cities concerned. The slow progress made in this reconstruction work was already the subject of public criticism, which might cause the Government considerable embarrassing-rassment in Parliament. Public funds, both national and local, would gain rather than lose if this work went forward. For the cost wouldbe borne by those who undertook the development, and the erection of shops, cinemas, &amp;c, would increase rateable values and wouldrelieve the Exchequer of its present obligation to pay grant in respectof the land acquired for this purpose by the local authorities.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in present circum-stances all available building resources should be concentrated onprojects likely to increase our industrial productivity, and it wouldbe difficult to defend the building of shops rather than factories evenin blitzed cities. He was unwilling, therefore, to increase the alloca-tion for this work in the Investment Programme for 1953. He would,however, agree that, if it became clear that under this Programmethere was not enough work in particular localities and that abnormalunemployment of building workers was likely, ad hoc additions tothe Programme might be made on a local basis.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Capital Investment Progamme imposed limits on build-ing work of all kinds, and a fair distribution of resources could not beachieved unless Ministers kept their projects within those limits. Onthe other hand, it would be illogical to apply too rigidly a restrictivesystem which prevented progress in building projects where localconditions justified additions to the programme.(/;) Authority to start building projects was given in all cases bythe Minister of Works, arid in existing circumstances there was little difficulty in allotting imfnediate starting dates in most of the blitzedcities.&apos;;:[; . (c) While it would be reasonable to allow an expansion of thebuilding programme where local ernployrheht conditions justified it,The President of the Board of Trade and The Minister of Supplyargued that first priority for the use of any surplus building labour should be given to the construction of factories and industrial premises. . V &apos;        ;v.
The Prime Minister said that failure to continue and expand workon the reconstruction of blitzed cities would be open to the gravestcriticism. He thought that the more flexible system suggested in thediscussion might suffice, so long as it was made clear that no opportunity would be lost for expanding this work. The system should allow all claimants on the building programme to receive theirfair share of any surplus building resources in accordance with theconditions in any locality.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Minister of Housing and Local Government andthe Minister of Works, to consider what arrangements couldbe made to give greater local flexibility in the applicationof the Investment Programme to the work of reconstruction in blitzed cities, and what public announcement could bemade on this question, and to submit their recommendations: for approval by the Prime Minister.7. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in the circum-stances indicated in his memorandum C. (52) 391, it had become clearthat the Ministry of Supply and the War Office were likely to over-spend their Votes this year the former by  50 to  70 million, and thelatter by  25 to  30 million. Owing to the claims on parliamentary time of the Transport Bill and the Iron and Steel Bill, it would not bepossible to make provision for the necessary Consolidated Fund bill before Christmas. He therefore proposed that, before the SecondReading of the Civil Contingencies Fund Bill which was to be takenin the House of Commons in the following week, he should announce that a large Ministry of Supply supplementary estimate was in pros-pect, and that the Ministry would be financed from the Civil Con-contingencies Fund when their present Vote was exhausted. The WarOffice was likely to be able to finance itself from its existing provisionuntil the middle of February, but before that date a supplementary estimate and a Consolidated Fund Bill would be unavoidable.It was pointed out in discussion that these supplementary estimates had been made necessary by a combination of factors,including the deliberate placing of orders for textiles to relieve unemployment, increases in prices, the improvement in regular recruit-ing for the Army which had doubled in the past year, demands fromcontractors for earlier payment owing to restrictions on credit, andother unforeseen contingencies.The Lord Privy Seal said that he agreed with the procedure proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, although he foresawconsiderable criticism by the Opposition, who would complain thatthe necessary supplementary estimates should be presented to Parlia-ment in the normal way before Christmas. The prospect of a Con-solidated Fund Bill early in the New Year would make it necessaryto review the present programme for legislative business in the early part of the session.   -The Cabinet Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to announce in the House of Commons on 11th November that a largeMinistry of Supply supplementary estimate was in prospect,and that the Ministry would be financed from the CivilContingencies . Fund when their present funds wereexhausted; and that a supplementary estimate for the army would also be needed early in 1953.defence programme.supplementary estimates.Cabinet Office, S.W.
