Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in the the House of Commons in the following week.House of In the Statement on Business later in the &quot;day, the Lord PrivyCommons.       Seal would say that the Government hoped that sufficient progress would be made with outstanding business to enable Parliament to be adjourned fpr the summer recess before the August Bank Holiday,&apos;        though it might be necessary for the House of Commons to sit on saturday, 2nd August.       ;&apos;  &apos;   The Lord Privy Seal said that in the discussion on Business hewas likely.to be asked whether the Government proposed to makeany statement on Korea.   It was agreed that in that event he should- say that a brief statement on military developments in Korea would-    be made before the summer recess.eBusiness in the        Reference was made to the debate held in the House of LordsHouse of Lords, on the previous day on Lord SamueFs motion regarding the encroach-:&apos;: ,   ,      \  ment of the State upon individual liberties.   One of the questionspressed.in the debate was.whether officials should have power toenter private dwelling-houses without a Justice&apos;s warrant.  The,  cabinet were informed, that a number of officials having this power, had been reduced by 2,101 since June 1951.   This power was still&apos;  . V;   exercisable, however, by 3,887. officials.   The Cabinet asked, theChancellor of the Exchequer to consider whether a further substantial&apos;      &apos; reduction could not be made in the number of officials exercising this.,&apos; &apos; - power.Admission of - 2. The Prime Minister said that, in pursuance of the requestForeigners to made in the Cabinefs discussion on 15th July, the Home SecretaryUnited had made further enquiries into the suggestion that Professor EmilKingdom,       Fuchs&apos;had moved intq the Soviet Zone of Germany after his son&apos;sProfessor        conviction.

Fuchs should be allowed to come to this country to attend the forth-coming conference organised by the Society of Friends, he should notbe allowed, while he was here, to; visit his son in prison.It was the view of the Cabinet that, on the facts now reportedto them, it would be preferable that Professor Fuchs should not begiven facilities to visit this \ country. The Society of Friends might perhaps be able to arrange for other delegates to be chosen in placeof Professor Fuchs and Miss Hager to represent East Germany atthe forthcoming conference.The Cabinet-Agreed that no facilities should be granted to enableProfessor Emil Fuchs,to visit this country, and invited theHome Secretary to. make arrangements accordingly.investment programme.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 27thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C. (52) 240), the Minister of Works (C. (52) 239)and the Minister of Housing and Local Government (C. (52) 241) on investment in new building in 1953.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the investment pro-gramme which he recommended was based on the assumption thatthe output of new building in 1953 would total  900 million a larger42618-3 b 2
output than the building industry had ever achieved but thedemands for new building were still, after rigorous pruning  87 million in excess of that figure. The resources available for new buildingwere insufficient to meet all the demands put forward and, unless some, further restriction were placed on housing and on building for defence purposes, it would not be possible to provide the increasedcapacity in productive industry which was essential for the expansionof the export trade. He therefore proposed that expenditure on defence works should be cut back to  110 million, and that the housing programme should be slowed down. The Government had notpublicly announced their aim of building 260,000 houses in 1953,and he proposed that expenditure on housing in that year should belimited to  372 million, instead of  416 million. This could be doneby slowing down the rate of approval of contracts. If these reduc-tions in defence works and housing were not accepted, it would benecessary to curtail still further the programmes of other Depart-ments; and it would also become impossible to allow the increasedtotal of  100 million for new building by productive industry. Itwould be difficult to defend such a course of action, which would add nothing to our economic strength and would give no confidence that we were determined to develop our export trade and balance our external accounts.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that therewere two possible methods of controlling the resources used in new building. The first was the method of financial limits, which was used in the investment programme proposed by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer. This was a convenient method, but in his view it wasnot reliable. Fixed money limits, if enforced, must cramp the expan-sion of productivity in the building&apos; industry. The total outputof the industry, in new building and maintenance, was estimatedat  1,600 million: the gap between output and requirements was thus only about 5 per cent, of the total capacity, and a deficiency of that order could surely be made good by increased productivity.The alternative, and in his view the preferable, method was to control the use of imported materials. In the earlier discussions theChancellor of the Exchequer had suggested that the building industry should use no more imported materials in 1953 than it had in 1952.So far as concerned the housing programme he could not accept thatlimit. In order to build 260,000 houses it had been estimated that additional timber would be needed to the value of  4^ million; but bythe introduction of more economical designs, he hoped to be ableto reduce that additional demand to  3^ million.The Minister of Works said that during the past year there hadbeen a marked increase in the productivity of the building industryand he was most anxious that this momentum should not be lost.For his part, however, he was ready to accept the proposal that thebuilding industry should use in 1953 no more imported materialsthan it had used in 1952. The recommendations which he had madein C. (52) 239 were designed to maintain the productivity of theindustry without imposing any further strain on&apos; the balance ofpayments. If this was to be done, however, there must be increased output of home-produced materials for the industry; and for thispurpose he asked for a small increase (of about  2 million) in the limit which the Chancellor of the Exchequer sought to impose on theexpansion of. industrial capacity for producing those materials.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was ready to discuss this.suggestion with-the Minister of Works.The Minister of Defence said that the Services were ready tooffer a reduction of  13 million (or 15 per cent.) on the defence works programme. The Minister of Supply said that he could not yetestimate what reduction he could offer. . Revised defence production programmes had not, yet been approved and, until they had, he couldnot assess what fresh industrial capacity might have to be created inorder to carry them out.
;    In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) Several Ministers supported the view that the method of controlling new building by money limits based, on an estimate ofthe total output of the building industry was artificial and unreliable.There was necessarily a considerable margin of error in the calcu-lation of the total capacity of the industry; and all the allocationswere liable. to be falsified by a relatively small change in the productivity of the industry. It would be more defensible to limit the industry&apos;s use of imported materials, which had a direct bearing on the balance of payments.(b) The housing programme was going forward successfully and bringing credit to the Government. It was argued that a deliberaterestriction of the programme would bring a loss of confidence. Onthe other hand, it was pointed out that on average  300 worth of imported materials were used for every house built; and it was estimated that the materials needed for 30,000 houses would, ifdiverted to export industries, benefit the balance of payments by 20 million.., (c) New designs and more economical methods of building would eventually bring substantial savings in steel and timber, but no great benefit could be reaped from this in 1953, since the contracts for mostof the houses in that year&apos;s programme had already been let. It waspossible that in 1954, the programme for which would have to besettled at the end of 1952, 300,000 houses of new design could be builtwith no more timber than was being used for 230,000 houses in 1952.(d) The export outlook was not encouraging. If the necessaryexpansion of exports was to be achieved, some reduction must bemade in the resources now devoted to defence and to social services,including housing. In particular, more of the available building resources must be transferred to the development of the engineering industries, which were capable of expanding their exports. TheMinister of Supply suggested, and it was agreed, that special arrange-ments should be made for building houses for key workers in industries which could make an important contribution to the exporttra&quot;de.-The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was still convincedthat the Government were imposing on the national economy a greaterburden than it could bear. We were attempting to do too much,and some substantial reductions must be made in some programmes in order to free the resources needed to balance our overseas account.Parliament would expect to hear, in the forthcoming debate on theeconomic situation, a convincing statement of the Governments plans for making the most productive use of available resources. He hopedthat the Cabinet would be ready to look closely into the question ofthe defence investment programme in the following week: Mean-while, he would discuss with the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment arid the Minister of Works whether it was possible todraw up a statement on housing and civil building which would indicate that closer control ^would be maintained on the use of imported raw materials for this purpose.The Cabinet-I Agreed to resume their discussion of the investment programme at meetings in the following week.Colonial 4.

The Coronation.Representationof India.(previous reference:,C.C. (52) 67thConclusions,Minute 8.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Com-commonwealth. Secretary (C. (52) 235) about the part to be played by representatives of India in the official Coronation ceremonies.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the Prime Minister ofIndia.had indicated informally that, if he were invited by The Queento attend the Coronation Service, he would accept the invitation. Ifthe Cabinet agreed, he would now instruct the Acting High Com-missioner in New Delhi to find out informally from Mr. Nehruwhether he would desire that India should participate in the same way as the other members of the Commonwealth in the attendantceremonial. If India should wish to do so, it would in his view be inexpedient to discourage her.The Prime Minister said that he would welcome a decision bythe Indian Government to send a contingent of troops to take partin the Coronation procession.. The Cabinet-Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, after taking the queen&apos;s pleasure, to instruct the Acting High commissioner in New Delhi to ascertain the views of the Prime Ministerof India on India&apos;s participation in the Coronation.Proposed NewHotel inLondon.8. The Cabinet had before ,them a memorandum by the Presi-dent of the Board of Trade (C. (52) 236) proposing that a buildinglicence should be granted for the erection of a new first-class hotelin Portman Square, to.be built with British capital but to be managed by an American company, primarily for the accommodation of american tourists.The President of the Board of Trade said that the erection ofthisvhotel would ease the shortage of hotel accommodation which was at present the main obstacle to the development of (he tourist trade.The effect of its construction upon the housing programme wouldbe marginal, and the grant of a building licence would be made con-ditional oh the American company&apos;s providing the necessary steel.The impending conversion of the Mayfair Hotel into offices would,in his view, strengthen the case for his proposal.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that he did not wish to object to the proposal on planning grounds but itwould be unfortunate if the project were to receive publicity at atime when the Government might have to announce some modifica-tion of the housing programme.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the grant of a building licence for theerection of a new first-class hotel in Portman. Square.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to arrange thatthis project should receive no publicity until after theforthcoming debate in the House of Commons on theeconomic situation.Cost of Living. 9; The Minister of Labour said that the figures for the monthof June would show, a rise of three points in the cost-of-living index.- This was attributable to the increased cost of meat, meat products and tea, and was part of the rise forecast as the result of the reduc-tion of food subsidies in the Budget. Reductions in clothes prices had&apos;-&apos; , been offset by rises in fares and in the cost of fuel.The Cabinet-..   Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,- /y 17th July, 1952.
