Town and 1.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum byCountry Minister of Housing and Local Government (C. (52) 399) covering txPlanning draft of a White Paper explaining how the Government proposed toAct, 1947. amend the financial provisions of the Town and Country Planning(Previous Act, 1947, and the draft of a Bill to abolish development charge and reference: to hold the position generally until a comprehensive amending BillCC. (52) 85th could be introduced. They also had before them a memorandum by conclusions, the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (52) 404).Minute 2.) In discussion attention was directed to the following paragraphs of the draft White Paper:  Paragraph 27The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that it was proposed to provide that development charge should not be payable in.respect of development begun after the date of introduction of theBill. This arrangement would be in line with that adopted whendevelopment charge was. brought into operation: to provide that development charge should cease to be payable from a certain date would benefit those from whom payments were overdue at theexpense of those who had paid the charge promptly.The Cabinet approved this proposal.Paragraphs 36, 37 and 37AThe Minister of Housing and Local Government said that, indescribing the Governments intentions regarding the local authori-ties&apos; use of their powers of compulsory acquisition, it was important to strike the right balance between two considerations. On the onehand there must be an adequate defence against the criticism thatthe Governments scheme would allow land-owners to demand anextortionate price for land which was neither required by a localauthority nor prevented from being developed. The safeguard against this was that the local authorities would be able to acquire the land compulsorily and to sell to private developers such parts ofit as were not required for public purposes. On the other hand, itwas no part of the Governments intentions that local authoritiesshould make too extensive a use of their powers in this matter.The Commonwealth Secretary said that some restriction oughtto be placed upon the price at which local authorities might sell land which they had acquired by compulsory powers. Otherwise localauthorities might be tempted to buy substantial areas of land undercompulsory powers and sell off portions for private development at prices which brought them a substantial profit.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that themain amending Bill would contain provisions designed to meet this possibility, although it would be necessary to allow local authoritiesto charge for any land they might sell a price which allowed for any expenditure which they might themselves have incurred in buildingroads and providing other services.The Solicitor-General suggested that the last two sentences ofparagraph 37 and the whole of paragraph 37A might with advantage be replaced by a sentence on the following lines: &quot; If experience shows them to be insufficient to prevent extortionate prices beingdemanded, the Government will not hesitate to strengthen them.&quot;The Cabinet approved these paragraphs of the draft white paper subject to the amendment suggested by the Solicitor-General.Paragraph 39The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he must press for more effective supervision by the central Government of local plan-ning decisions which would involve compensation payments by the
Government 2.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theInformation Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (52) 356) reporting the results of anServices. enquiry which he had undertaken, at the request of the Cabinet,(Previous into the division of information work between the Central Office ofReference: Information and separate staffs in the Departments concerned.C.C. (52) 34th jy7e Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the evidence suggestedConclusions, that there were certain kinds of information work which should minute 3.) continue to be carried out by a central agency rather than byExchequer than was implied by the present wording of this para-graph. He would settle a revised form of words with the Minister of housing and Local Government.Paragraphs 44-48, 48A and 48BThe Minister of Housing and Local Government said that these paragraphs dealt with some of the detailed problems which would arise in the transition from the existing to the new system. It was desirable to include them because the individuals affected would be anxious to learn where they stood.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that two questions inparticular required consideration:  (a) Paragraph 48B. Should any attempt be made to recover from the eventual developers the equivalent of the payments whichwould be made to land-owners who had sold at its existing-use valueland which had not yet been developed?He accepted the view that it would be very difficult as a matterof administration to recover the money in these cases and that it must therefore be abandoned. This would mean a loss of about  2 millions to the Exchequer.(b) Paragraph 48A. Should payments be made in all caseswhere land had been developed and development charge had been paid?He saw no alternative but to make payments in all such cases.The cost would amount to about  6 millions.The Solicitor-General asked whether it was necessary to make such payments to persons who did not actually hold a claim on the 300 millions. The Prime Minister said that the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Minister of Housing should consider this pointin consultation with the Solicitor-General.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had felt bound inhis paper to draw the Cabinefs attention once again to the serious financial implications of this scheme. The cost to the exchequer in 1954-55, the first year in which the new arrangements would operate, would be likely to be of the order of  60 millions and the eventual total cost might rise to as much as  350 millions.On the other side it was pointed out that the Exchequer wouldenjoy the immediate advantage of avoiding payment of the  300millions in 1953, and that the ultimate cost of compensation underthe new scheme, even if it ever reached the theoretical total of 350 millions, would not do so for forty or fifty years.The Cabinet (1) Subject to the points raised in their discussion, approved thedraft White Paper annexed to C. (52) 399 and authorised the Minister of Housing and Local Government to publishit early in the following week.(2) Approved the draft Bill annexed to C. (52) 399 and authorised .the Minister of Housing and Local Government to intro-duce it in the House of Commons.
Departmental staffs. In spite of this fact, the staff of the CentralsOffice had been reduced from 1,364 to 864 between September 195JSPand September 1952, and further reductions would be made as they became possible. The National Savings Committees were resolutelyopposed to surrendering responsibility for their information activities and he proposed to accept this position, although it would continueto be his general aim to reduce departmental information staffs as opportunity offered. The Treasury would be making a furtherinspection of these staffs in connection with the forthcomingestimates.The Prime Minister said that the results of the Chancellor^enquiry appeared to be satisfactory so far as they went, but theCabinet must feel free to reconsider the issues involved at a later date. Meanwhile he hoped that the Treasury would subject Depart-mental inforniation staffs to the most rigorous scrutiny.The Cabinet-Took note of the report made in C. (52) 356.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,14th November, 1952.
