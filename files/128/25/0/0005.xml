It was hoped that the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill would by then have been completed. In that event Parliament would reassembleon 10th June: otherwise it would be necessary to curtail the recess and reassemble on 9th June.Coal. 3.   The Prime Minister drew attention to the large increase in exports. coal stocks in this country.   He suggested that the Cabinet shouldtake an early opportunity of considering whether this was sufficientto justify an increase in coal exports, which would be of great help inredressing our balance of payments. Was there not some risk thatthe miners would relax their efforts if they found that, owing to theheavy stocks already held, there were delays in removing coal fromthe pithead?The Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and power said that in his view there was little risk of this. Inland stockshad not reached abnormal levels, but there was now some possibilityof increasing exports. He would circulate a memorandum on thisquestion to the Cabinet.The Cabinet Agreed to resume this discussion at a later meeting.Cotton- 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theImports of President of the Board of Trade and the Chancellor of the DuchyDollar Cotton, of Lancaster (C. (52) 170) seeking an immediate decision on the(Previous amount of cotton of American type to be imported from dollar and reference:      other sources during the coming season.C.C. (52) 39th The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that in recentConclusions, months Lancashire spinners had been receiving from dollar sourcesMinute 10.)      57 per cent, of their total requirements of cotton of American type.&apos; This was cheaper than Brazilian cotton and, although the gap in prices was at present narrow, it might widen if there were a revival in theworld cotton trade or if our imports of dollar cotton were undulyrestricted. The price of cotton was averaged on sale to the spinners,and if there were any considerable premium on Brazilian cottonLancashire spinners had to pay more than their competitors for dollarcotton. The industry had therefore asked for complete freedom to buy dollar cotton; and, if this were given, it would greatly increase its dollar purchases. The President of the Board of Trade agreed with him that our dollar shortage made this impracticable, but theyboth believed that, if the proportion of dollar cotton was raised to66f per cent, the premium was likely to disappear. An increase to60 per cent., though its effects would be less certain, would offer a1. The Cabinet discussed the terms of the reply to be given toa Question by Miss Ward, M.P., about the attempt of the DurhamCounty Council to compel all persons in their service to join a tradesunion or a professional association.It was the view of the Cabinet that nothing should be said onbehalf of the Government to discourage the Durham teachers from continuing to oppose the policy which the Council were seeking toenforce.The Cabinet were informed that the Minister of Education had power to give directions to a local education authority, if satisfiedthat the authority was acting unreasonably in the exercise of its powers or the performance of its duties. They agreed that it shouldbe made clear, in reply to this Question, that the Minister would not hesitate to use this power if need arose.
good prospect of removing the premium. If this smaller increase could be authorised, they would be willing to accept the risk involvedin reducing stocks to a six months&apos; supply based on a rate of consump-tion 10 per cent, below that of 1951. This would involve dollar expenditure of $150 million, as compared with an expenditure of$158 million last year and $143 million if only 57 per cent, of dollarcotton were authorised.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he agreed with theproposal to reduce stocks. While he would prefer that dollar pur-chases should not exceed 57 per cent, of total purchases, he recognised the importance of abolishing or reducing the premium on Braziliancotton and the desire of the President of the Board of Trade and ofthe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to keep their demands for dollars for cotton purchases as low as possible. He was thereforeready to accept their proposal.The Cabinet-Authorised imports of dollar cotton in the coming season upto 60 per cent, of total requirements of cotton of Americantype, to the extent necessary to maintain total stocks equiva-lent to a six months&apos; supply on a rate of consumption of90 per cent, of that of the year 1951.Economic 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chan-Policy, cellor of the Exchequer (C. (52) 166) reviewing the economic situation(Previous        and describing the policy which he proposed to follow in order to reference:      regain economic stability and to build up a strong, free and prosperousC.C. (52) 42nd   country. The memorandum summarised the causes of our economicConclusions,     weakness, viz., the loss of capital wealth during the war and the deteri-minute .)       oration in the terms of trade; the increase in social expenditure andin standards of amenity at home; the growing cost of defence; and the pressure on our overseas account resulting from our present liabilities,the need to build up our reserves and the need for overseas invest-ment.   It then reviewed the main economic and financial problems which had to be solved, viz., the management of sterling as a worldcurrency: the limitation of our overseas commitments to correspond with our economic strength; the control of imports and the encourage-ment of exports, especially of coal; the control of internal inflation,the limitation of Government expenditure, the control of investment and the review of the resources devoted to defence production.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there were indications that the recent improvement in our overseas account might not bemaintained. Unjustified criticisms of our financial and fiscal policyin some sections of the Press were having an adverse effect on con-fidence. Steps were being taken to counter this. He thought that among the suggestions for action made in C. (52) 166 the most urgentwere those for Ministerial review of (i) the possibility of divertingfrom defence production to exports some part of the capacity of the metal-using industries and (ii) our overseas expenditure on military purposes and in support of our foreign policy.The Colonial Secretary said that, while he was in general agree-ment with the Chancellors memorandum, he thought that it laid too much stress on increasing the export of highly-developed manu-factured goods which were difficult to sell and too little on increasingthe production and export of raw materials both at home and in otherparts of the Commonwealth. We must of course export the products of our skill and craftsmanship but we must not neglect primaryproduction at home (e.g. steel) or the long-term prospects of restoringan economic balance between the dollar and the non-dollar world by further development of the resources of the Commonwealth.The President of the Board of Trade supported this view and suggested that it should be kept in mind in the forthcoming study ofcommercial policy.  We must recognise that, if we were to buy less
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,22nd May, 1952.,from dollar sources, we must also expect to sell less to dollar countries.This would increase the importance of developing production in theCommonwealth and trade exchanges with it. He attached greatimportance to the proposal in paragraph 9 of C. (52) 166 that theneeds of the export trade should not be subordinated, as at presentthey were, to any other objective.The Prime Minister said that there should be no interferencewith the special priority accorded to certain types of armsproduction.The Minister of Supply said that, outside that limited field, hewas at present proceeding on the basis that in those industries withwhich he was concerned production for defence and for export shouldrank as of equal importance. Production of the less essential types of defence equipment could be slowed down if the Cabinet should so desire, though a switch to production for export would take some little time to bring about. He was already considering in whichdirections engineering exports could most readily and most profitablybe expanded, and he would report to the Cabinet on the means of doing this with the least damage to the defence programme.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their examination of the economicsituation at a later meeting.
