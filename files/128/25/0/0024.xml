\   iron and SteelIndustry.(PreviousReferencesC.C. (52) 71stConclusions,Minute 2.)parliamentary delegation to canada.Amnesty forDeserters.1. The White Paper on the future of the iron and steel industry had been presented to Parliament on the previous day. The firstPress comments had been favourable.The Commonwealth Secretary said that he assumed that, inaccordance with the Cabinets decision of 22nd July, one of the Gov-ernment spokesmen in the economic debate which was opening in theHouse of Commons that afternoon would be making a statement onthe lines suggested in paragraph 3 of C. (52) 246 indicating theGovernments readiness to consider constructive criticisms of their plan. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was proposing to refer briefly to this in his speech that afternoon. The Cabinet in-invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to confer with the Common-wealth Secretary regarding the terms in which this reference was tobe made.2. The Prime Minister questioned the expediency of thearrangement by which the members of a Parliamentary delegation which was to visit Canada during the recess were to fly there together in a single aircraft. It was pointed out that this aircraft had beenplaced at their disposal by the courtesy of the Canadian Government,and it might be embarrassing to decline that offer; and that, even ifthe Delegation crossed the Atlantic by sea, they could not avoidsubstantial use of air transport during their stay in Canada. TheCommonwealth Secretary undertook, however, to consider whether any alternative arrangements could be made which would reduce therisk to which the Prime Minister had drawn attention.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Defence (C. (52) 248) presenting the arguments for and againstthe granting of an amnesty for men who had deserted from the armed forces during the last war.The Prime Minister said that, in his view, it was a grievous thing that, seven years after the end of the war, a large number of war-timedeserters should still be living in this country as outcasts and outlaws.After the First World War an amnesty had been granted after fouryears. He had received many expressions of reproach and indig-nation from the public on this matter. On reflection he did not wishto press the suggestion that an amnesty should be declared in con-nection with the Coronation; but he felt very strongly that the existing position should not be allowed to continue indefinitely. Amnestieshad already been granted by Canada, Australia and South Africa;and it was inhuman to condemn so many men to live the lives ofoutlaws under assumed names.In discussion there was some support for this view. On theother side it was strongly contended that the Government shouldnot, by an amnesty, appear to condone the serious crime of desertingfrom the Forces in time of war. Some Ministers thought it would be specially dangerous to do this at a time when men were being draftedabroad for operations in Korea and Malaya.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of C. (52) 248 at a later meeting.
Disposal ofAdmiraltyand WarDepartmentProperty in bermuda.(previous reference:CC. (52) 67thConclusions,Minute 3.)Territorial 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ForeignWaters. Secretary (C. (52) 247) and a joint memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Power, the First Lordof the Admiralty and the Minister of Transport (C. (52) 255) dealingwith the effect upon the delimitation of territorial waters of a judg-ment given by the International Court at The Hague in the Anglo-Norwegian fisheries case.The Foreign Secretary said that the principles enunciated in thisjudgment would enable countries to delimit their territorial watersfrom a &apos;: base line &quot; joining headlands and outlying islands or rocks.Norway, Iceland, Sweden and France had already adopted this method, which resulted in a substantial extension of territorial waters, and Denmark was under great pressure to follow suit. Ifthese countries, as seemed likely, gave a wide and liberal interpreta-tion to this new method, our fishing interests would suffer. If weadopted the new method, we should be in a position to influenceother countries to apply a reasonable interpretation, and it wouldenable us to exclude foreign fishing fleets from our own fishinggrounds e.g., the Moray Firth. It would also enable us to make effective representations to the Mediterranean Powers, who at presentinsisted upon a six-mile limit for their territorial waters.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) A great extension of territorial waters would limit ourexercise of belligerent rights in war and increase the opportunities for unfriendly Powers to interfere with our shipping in peace. Itwould hamper the operations of the Royal Navy in war in keepinghostile coasts under observation and clearing minefields.  In general,4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Firs^fLord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State for War (C. (52) 260)recommending that, if the Bermuda Government were not willing to reconsider their latest offer of  650,000 for Admiralty and war department property in Bermuda, the&apos; United Kingdom Governmentshould proceed to dispose of it piecemeal through a direct Serviceagency or through a United Kingdom firm of estate agents.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) If the offer of the Bermuda Government were now refused,it was possible that they would cancel the remainder of their voluntarycontribution to United Kingdom defence costs, amounting over thenext twelve years to a total of  480,000. In addition to that loss,there would be the cost of maintaining the property while the piece-meal disposal was in progress, and the fees for estate agents. It was doubtful whether the proceeds of piecemeal disposal would in theevent exceed the sums thus lost or expended.(b) It was argued, on the other hand, that the Bermuda Govern-ment were well able to pay a higher price than  650,000 and wouldcertainly seek to dispose of the property at considerable profit to themselves.(c) There was considerable support for a proposal that further negotiations with the Bermuda Government should be conducted onthe basis that the United Kingdom Government would accept an initial payment of  650,000 for the property, on the understandingthat its disposal was undertaken jointly by the Governments ofBermuda and the United Kingdom and that any profits over  650,000would be shared equally between them.The Cabinet-Invited the Colonial Secretary to continue negotiations withthe  Bermuda Government  on the lines  indicated  inparagraph (c) above.
it was to the advantage of a great maritime Power to keep free of territorial control as large an area as possible of the sea and of theair above it.(b) The White Fish Authority were in favour of adopting thenew method. The Scottish fishing interests, which had long suffered from the incursions of foreign fishing fleets into the Moray Firth,were anxious that immediate advantage should be taken of The Hague court judgment to exclude these fleets. On the other hand, it waspointed out that a base-line drawn across the Moray Firth would extend to seventy-eight miles; and, if we claimed that as reasonable,it would be difficult to argue against similar interpretations by othercountries.(c) It would be useful if, before a final decision were taken, theviews of the Governments of the United States and of other Common-wealth countries, were ascertained.(d) The International Law Commission of the United nations was now studying the question, but it was doubtful if they would give any decision until late in 1953. If we took no action until their decision was made, other countries would adopt the new method&quot; andwe should have lost the opportunity of influencing them in theirinterpretation of it.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of,Defence, in consultation with other ministers concerned, to examine further the militarysignificance (in peace, in a precautionary stage, and inwar) of the new base-line method of measuring territorial waters, and to report to the Cabinet.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary and the Commonwealth Secre-tary to ascertain what views were held on this question by the Governments of the United States and of other commonwealth countries.Persia.(previous reference:CC. (52) 72ndConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The Foreign Secretary said that Dr. Mussadiq&apos;s political position in Persia had been greatly strengthened as a result of the shah&apos;s abortive attempt to form an alternative Government. At thefirst interview which he had held with H.M. Charge dAffaires inTeheran after his reappointment as Prime Minister, Dr. Mussadiqhad taken a conciliatory line about the oil dispute and had indicated that he might be ready to consider some form of arbitration whichwould not be limited solely to the question of compensation. on receiving the report of that interview the United Kingdom Depart-ments concerned had recommended that this offer should be followed up. But, before instructions in this sense could be sent to H.M.Charge d&apos;Affaires, Dr. Mussadiq at a second interview had alreadywithdrawn his earlier suggestion. As things now stood there seemedto be no early prospect of a favourable development in the oil dispute.Dr. Mussadiq was likely to ask for the relaxation of trade restrictions which had been applied in consequence of the dispute; and it wasagreed that, if he did so, we should say in reply that we should beready to consider this when some move had been made to end the deadlock in the oil dispute.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Defence 7.   The President of the Board of Trade said that, as theProgramme. Cabinet had not yet reached any final decision about the impact of the(Previous defence production programme on the metal-using industries in 1953Reference: and subsequent years, he was concerned to know what would be saidCC. (52) 72nd on this point by Government spokesmen in the forthcoming debateConclusions, in the House of Commons on. the economic situation.   If these minute 5.) industries were to be required to carry in those years the same load
of defence work as they were now carrying, and if there was to be\no reduction in the proportion of building resources devoted to housing, he saw no prospect of our being able to expand exports tothe extent necessary to redress our adverse balance of payments.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was in consultationwith the Minister of Defence about the arrangements for assemblingthe necessary material on the basis of which final decisions could betaken by Ministers regarding the defence load on the metal-using industries in the years 1953-55. Those decisions should not beprejudged by what was said in the forthcoming debate. The formula which he was proposing to use, with the concurrence of the Ministerof Defence, read as follows: &quot; Under the new pattern of our defence effort it will be possible to limit the demands made by defence onthe engineering industries in the near future. Consequently thegreater part of any increase in output that can be achieved in theengineering industries over the next few years by improved methods,greater productivity and new capacity will be available to swell the flow of exports and help relieve our balance of payments difficulties.&quot;In discussion it was suggested that it would be preferable tostate that any further increases in output by the engineering indus-tries would be available to swell the flow of exports. Subject to this amendment the Cabinet approved, for use in the forthcoming debate,the formula proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister of Defence regarding the limitation of the defence load onthe metal-using industries.8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (52) 265) commenting on the points made in the previous cabinet discussion on Marshall Scholarships.The Foreign Secretary said that the proposal to admit women and married men as candidates for Marshall Scholarships had beenconsidered and warmly commended by the Vice-Chancellor&apos;s Com-mittee as a whole, and individually by the Vice-Chancellors of Oxford,Cambridge and London Universities. . This condition, together withthe proposed upper age-limit of thirty, made the scholarships distinct from Rhodes Scholarships and therefore made the grant of higheremoluments to Marshall Scholars less open to criticism.The Prime Minister said that there was still some feeling in theCabinet that better results might be obtained if Marshall Scholarshipswere open only to unmarried and younger men, and it was desirablethat this memorandum should come before the Cabinet again on an occasion when they would have more time to discuss it.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their discussion of Marshall Scholarshipsat a later meeting.9. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofCivil Aviation (C. (52) 220) seeking approval for the development ofGatwick Airport as an alternative civil air terminus to the london airport at Heathrow. The estimated cost of this project was about 6 million over the next seven years.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was ready to acceptthe Ministers proposal, on the understanding that the project wouldbe fitted into the investment programme over those years and thatTreasury approval would be sought for the detailed expenditure involved in its successive stages.The Cabinet-Approved the proposal for the development of gatwick airport outlined in C. (52) 220.
^Overseas 10.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign information     Secretary (C. (52) 259) covering a report by a committee of officialsServices. on the Governments overseas information services.The. Foreign Secretary said that at this stage he sought only two decisions on this question. First, he recommended that in futurethere should be no financial limit on the aggregated expenditure onall overseas information services, but that each of the departments responsible for part of those services should justify its own estimateseparately to the Treasury. Secondly, he sought authority to announce the Governments intention to appoint a small body of independent people to review these services and to report on their value as an instrument of policy and on the best distribution of available funds between different areas and different methods of propaganda.The Cabinets discussion centred on the second of these proposals.It was pointed out that these services were in part designed to supportthe foreign policy and defence policy of the Government. Was itexpedient that these confidential activities should be subjected to independent investigation by persons outside Government service?Moreover, would not Parliament expect that, if such an independent enquiry were held, the report of the enquiry would be published?Might it not be preferable for these reasons that the enquiry shouldbe made by, or under the direction of, a number of Ministers who might take evidence from independent persons or might perhaps be assisted by a panel of independent consultants or assessors withspecial experience in this field?On the other side it was pointed out that there was strongParliamentary pressure for an independent enquiry. A large amountof detailed investigation must be carried out before an informedjudgment could be given on these questions; and it was difficult tosee how Ministers could find time for this. Care would be taken,in choosing the members of the committee of enquiry, to select people who could be trusted to handle with discretion such confidential information as might have to be imparted to them. Many of therecommendations likely to be made by such a body could be publishedwithout embarrassment: and any recommendations which they wished to make on the confidential aspect of this work could be embodied in a separate report.The balance of opinion in the Cabinet was in favour of pro- -ceeding with the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposal for an independent enquiry into the overseas information services.The Cabinet-(lj Agreed that the Departments responsible for overseas infor-mation services should not in future be required to operatewithin a financial limit for aggregated expenditure on alloverseas information work, but that each such department should separately justify to the Treasury its own estimates for its overseas information work.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to settle, in consultation withthe Ministers directly concerned, the precise method bywhich further enquiry should be made into the overseas information services and the terms in which he should announce to Parliament the decision to hold this enquiry.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,29th July, 1952.
