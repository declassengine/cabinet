!G7iiPPersia;(previous reference:C.C.(52)74thConclusions,Minute 6.)1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (52) 276) reporting the results of further consultations&apos;which had taken place with the United States Government regarding;the future handling of the Anglo-Persian oil dispute. :   .The Foreign Secretary said that if we declined to make any fresh overtures to the Persian Government, basing ourselves on theview that no satisfactory agreement could ever be made withdraw. Mussadiq, there was a real danger that the United States Govern-ment would make an independent offer of financial assistance to- Persia with the object of preyenting the establishment of a Communistregime. The Foreign Secretary therefore proposed that, if only to gain time, he should inform the United States Government that wewere in principle prepared to see the oil dispute referred to arbitra-tion, if acceptable terms of reference could be found; that, as soonas a basis for arbitration had been found which was acceptable to both parties, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company should try to arrangefor the movement of oil from Persia to be resumed; and that, whenthe existing deadlock in the oil dispute had been broken, we would,as circumstances required, relax some of the restrictions at presentimposed on trade between the United Kingdom and Persia. If hecould say that we were ready to take this fresh initiative, he couldpress the view that the grant of American financial assistance to persia should be conditional upon Persia&apos;s acceptance of our proposals for arbitration and for the resumption of oil shipments from Persia. It was contemplated that these proposals would be put to Dr. Mussadiq in a joint approach on behalf of the Governmentsof the United Kingdom and the United States.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he fully supported theproposals put forward by the Foreign Secretary.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that a fresh approach might be made to the PersianGovernment if it complied with the conditions andlimitations summarised in paragraph 19 (a)-(c) ofC. (52) 276 and the further condition that any offer of american financial assistance to Persia should be con-ditional upon Persia&apos;s acceptance of these proposals forresolving the oil dispute.(2) Authorised, the Foreign Secretary to explore with the UnitedStates Government the possibility that the two Govera-ments might make a joint approach to the PersianGovernment on that basis.MarshallScholarships.(previous reference:   &apos;C.C.(52)74thConclusions,Minute 8.)2. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the Foreign Secre-tary&apos;s memoranda (C. (52) 244 and 265) on Marshall scholarships.The Foreign Secretary said that he had considered the Cabinefscriticisms of the proposal that these scholarships should be open to persons up to thirty years of age and to married men. He was now prepared to recommend that the upper age-limit should be twenty-eight and the majority of candidates should be under twenty-five. Thisshould have the effect of restricting the number of married scholars.He would also re-examine the proposal that the members of the selection Committee in the United States should receive for eachmeeting an honorarium of $100 in addition to travelling expenses.The Cabinet Approved the proposals for the establishment of Marshallscholarships outlined in C. (52) 244 and 265 on the under-standing that the Foreign Secretary would (i) ensure that theupper age-limit would be twenty-eight and the majority of candidates would be under twenty-five, and (ii) re-examinethe amount of the honorarium to be paid to members of the selection Committee in the United States.
3. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of. the Foreign Secre-tary&apos;s memorandum (C. (52) 229) on the disposal of Japanese,.assets in the United Kingdom for the benefit of former prisoners of war.The Foreign Secretary said that the earlier decision to hand this money over to benevolent organisations for distribution among all prisoners of war, whether they had been captives of the Japanese orthe Germans, would not satisfy the feeling, which was strongly heldby Government supporters in the House of Commons, that theseJapanese funds should be applied solely for the benefit of those whohad suffered at the hands of the Japanese. Those who held this viewwere also disposed to reject the principle that the available money should be distributed according to need: they thought of it as com-pensation for past suffering rather than relief of present hardship.This view, if it were accepted, led to the conclusion that the money should be distributed on a per capita basis among those who hadbeen captives of the Japanese.On the other side it was pointed out that two Ministers hadalready stated publicly that the Government intended to carry out theearlier decision; and, if the opposite policy were now to be adopted,it would have to be announced and defended in the House ofCommons. Was there evidence of any widespread dissatisfaction with the earlier decision? The benevolent organisations were under-stood to be unwilling to handle the distribution of this money if it hadto be applied regardless of present need for the benefit only of thosewho had been captives of the Japanese. It might therefore benecessary for a Government agency to undertake the task of identified-fying and tracing all the individuals who would be entitled to share in a per capita distribution of the assets. It was understood that theFar East Prisoners of War Association had lists covering about 90 percent, of those concerned, but it would still be necessary to trace theremaining 10 per cent, before any distribution could be made. this might have the effect of reviving individual claims by British subjects in this country and in the Colonies for compensation for loss ofproperty and chattels in Japan.The Cabinet considered that, before final decisions were taken,they should see a practical plan for distributing these assets on thebasis proposed by the Foreign Secretary.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of Pensions to submit for their con-sideration a practical plan for distributing these japanese assets on a per capita basis among persons who had beenprisoners of war or civilian internees in Japanese hands.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of C. (52) 229 when theyhad before them a report by the Minister of- Pensions inpursuance of Conclusion (1) above.Commonwealth 4. The Colonial Secretary said that at the commonwealth economic Economic Conference in November he would wish to have theConference. assistance of a panel of advisers drawn from the Colonies principally(Previous concerned.   Some of the members of this panel would be officials,Reference: but some Colonies would wish to nominate for this purpose politicalCC. (52) 72nd members of their Governments. He proposed that a few of these conclusions, advisers should accompany him at each of the sessions of the Con-Minute 4.)        ference : they would not be free to take part in the discussions at theirown discretion, but he would like to be able to call on one or other of them to speak from time to time.In discussion the following points were made in support of thisproposal:  (a) This procedure had been followed with success at themeeting of Commonwealth Finance Ministers in January 1952.Japanese assets in the UnitedKingdom.(previous reference:CC. (52) 71stConclusions,Minute 7.)
(b) The Colonies made a very substantial contribution towardsthe dollar earnings of the sterling area. It was reasonable therefore that they should be directly represented at a Conference which was toconsider how the future pattern of world trade could be adjusted toserve the interests of the sterling area as a whole.(c) As a result of the Conference some Colonies might have tobe asked to take, in the interests of the sterling area as a whole,measures which were not immediately advantageous to them indi-individually. It would be easier to secure the adoption of such measures,particularly in Colonial Legislatures with an unofficial majority, if theColonies had been directly represented at the Conference.Oh the other hand it was argued that a dangerous precedentwould be set if some of the Colonies appeared to be given a rightto participate in a meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers. Pro-procedures which might have been appropriate for a meeting of finance ministers were not necessarily suitable for a meeting of PrimeMinisters. The test to be applied was the constitutional status of thecountry concerned, not its capacity to earn dollars. Meetings of commonwealth Prime Ministers should be confined, as they hadbeen hitherto, to the full members of the Commonwealth. It wouldbe dangerous to do anything which might encourage countries likeMalta and the Gold Coast, which had achieved a measure of indepen-dent government but not full Commonwealth membership, to claima right of direct participation in such meetings. The Colonial Secre-tary bore the constitutional responsibility for safeguarding theinterests of the dependent Colonies, and he should himself assume the responsibility for representing their interests at meetings of commonwealth Prime Ministers. He could, if he so desired, drawadvice from officials or, if necessary, from political members of colonial Governments brought specially to London for this purpose;but, if any political members of Colonial Governments were nomi-nated for this duty, they should clearly understand that they werebeing invited to London to advise the Colonial Secretary and not toparticipate in the Conference itself. It would be preferable that as many as possible of these advisers should be officials. There was noreason why officials from the Colonies should not attend the pre-paratory meeting of Commonwealth officials which was to be held inSeptember.The Cabinet Took note that the Colonial Secretary would arrange for representatives of some of the Colonies to be in London,. at the time of the Commonwealth Economic Conference inNovember, so that he might be able to consult them and obtain their advice on matters affecting the Colonies whichwere under discussion at the Conference; but agreed thatthese advisers should not accompany the Colonial Secretaryto the meetings of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers.North Atlantic .5.   The Foreign Secretary said that the military authorities of treaty the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.) had planned toOrganisation, hold between 13th and 25th September a military exercise (knownManoeuvres in as &quot; Mainbrace &quot;) which was to take place off the coast of Norway,Northern in the North Sea and in the Western Baltic, where the operationsEurope. would include sea and air activities off the coast of Bornholm.  Theexercise was to be conducted by the Commander-in-Chief, allied forces, Northern Europe, with his own forces and with forces drawn from the command of the Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic.Only Danish, Norwegian and British forces would be used in that partof the exercise which took place within the Baltic. The Russians hadalready drawn public attention to the provocative nature of anexercise conducted in the Baltic, especially on the island of Bornholm
Ifwhich, although Danish, had been in the past a subject of dispute &quot;between the Soviet Union and Denmark. Nevertheless the Govern-ments of Denmark and Norway were anxious to proceed with theexercise within the Baltic, Which they themselves had suggested.In discussion the following points were&quot; made:  (a) While there could be no political objection to those parts ofthe exercise which were to take place off the COast of Norway andin the North Sea, an exercise within the Baltic might well be thought to offer provocation to the Soviet Union. Moreover, it would involvea real risk of incidents, both at sea and in the air, especially as theRussians claimed a. 12-mile limit to their territorial waters in theBaltic.(b) It was argued, On the other hand, that if the exercise withinthe Baltic were abandoned now that exception had been taken to itpublicly by the Russians, this would be construed as a sign of weak-ness and would discourage the Danes and Norwegians, who had shown *a healthy determination to go through with the plan.(c) It was unfortunate that the attention of N.A.T.O. Govern-ments had not been drawn to the plans for this exercise at an earlier stage. Plans for military exercises, which might have political conse-quences, should be reported by the Commanders concerned, throughthe Standing Group, to the North Atlantic Council.The Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary to urge the Governments of norway and Denmark to agree that the part of Exercise&quot; Mainbrace &quot; which was to take place within the Balticshould be abandoned.Egypt. 6.   The Minister of Defence said that the preparations for opera-(Previous tions designed to protect British lives in Cairo and Alexandria couldReference: not be kept indefinitely at 48 hours&apos; notice.   He suggested that theCC. (52) 73rd notice should now be extended to 96 hours, on the understandingConclusions, that no action would be taken which would lead the Egyptians to minute 5.) suppose that our preparations were being relaxed.  Units and ships would remain in their present positions.The Cabinet Agreed that the period of notice for the operations designedto protect British lives in Cairo and Alexandria should beextended to 96 hours on the understanding that there wouldbe no dispersal of ships or units.Germany. 7.   The Foreign Secretary said that he was anxious to secure a contractual wider public understanding of the policy towards Germany whichSettlements. Parliament had now approved by its ratification of the contractual(Previous settlements.   For this purpose there had ,been prepared a popularReferences:      pamphlet designed for sale to the public, and a shorter leaflet for freeCC (52) 69th    distribution.   He sought the views of the Cabinet on the channel for conclusions,     distributing this material.   It had originally been suggested that itMinute2; and    should be handled by the Conservative Party organisation; but he7lstConclu-     feared that this would be taken to imply that the Government weresions, Minute 3.) treating their foreign policy as a Party matter and he was most anxious to avoid giving that impression.   He therefore proposedthat the pamphlet should be placed on sale under the auspices ofthe Central Office of Information and that the leaflet should be distributed through Post Offices,  Employment Exchanges  and national Insurance and Food Offices.  He recognised, however, thatthe Labour Party, as they had voted against the ratification of the settlements, might challenge the propriety of this procedure.
- The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it -was open to argu-ment whether Government agencies should be used for the distri-bution of popular statements.on a matter which had become an issueof political controversy between the Parties.. : Much would depend,however, on the terms and the tone of the statement. He had seena draft of the proposed pamphlet and leaflet and he felt that the concluding section of each would be open to challenge on this account,since it dealt with the particular question of timing on which thepolitical Parties were at present divided. He thought, however, thatit might be possible to adjust the terms of the drafts so as to reducethe risk of criticism, and he would welcome an opportunity to discuss this with the Foreign Secretary.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellorof the Exchequer would together consider what changescould be made in the terms of the proposed popular state-ments on the contractual settlements with Germany soas to reduce the risk of challenge of the propriety of distributing them under the auspices of the Central Officeof Information.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to circulate to the Cabinet the revised texts of these statements.Meeting of 8.   The Commonwealth Secretary said that all CommonwealthCommonwealth Governments had agreed that a meeting of Commonwealth PrimePrime Ministers Ministers should be held in London immediately after the Coronationin 1953. in June 1953.   He therefore proposed that a firm decision to hold(Previous the meeting should now be taken and that other CommonwealthReference: Governments should be so informed.   A public announcement might,CC. (52) 58th however, be postponed until about the middle of September.Conclusions, xMinute 3.) The Cabinet Took note that a meeting of Commonwealth Prime ministers would be held in London in June 1953, that other Common-wealth Governments would be so informed forthwith, butthat a public announcement would be deferred until september.industrial 9.   The Minister of Labour said that a dispute with the ElectricalDisputes. Trade Union over a redundancy of meter readers and a wages claim(Previous might well result in an early strike in the electricity undertakings.Reference:       The power stations might be affected.CC.

The firmMinute?.)       were refusing to reinstate or to submit the question to arbitration.It was, however, unlikely that the consequences of this dispute wouldbe widespread.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour.Meeting of the 10. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, owing to theinternational work involved in the preparations for the Commonwealth EconomicBank and Conference in November, he had decided that it would not be wiseinternational for him to attend the meeting of the International Bank and Inter-Monetary Fund, national Monetary Fund in Mexico City in September.   He proposed
that the United Kingdom should be represented at this meeting bythe Minister of State for Economic Affairs.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Minister of State for Economic affairs should represent the United Kingdom Government at theforthcoming meeting of the International Bank and theInternational Monetary Fund.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,8th August, 1952.
