Defence &apos; &apos;Programme.(previous reference;CC. (52) 79thConclusions,Minute 6.) &apos; -&apos;The,Cabinet had before them the following memoranda on thedefence&apos;programme: -    ...C. (52) 316 and D. (52) 46: by the Minister of Defence.C. (52) 320 and C. (52) 393 : by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.. C. (52) 394: by the Service Ministers.D. (52) 45: by the Chiefs of Staff.- The Minister of Defence said that, when he took office in March1952, the planned defence programme for 1953-54 was estimated to cost  1,838 million and that for 1954-55  1,916 million. The Chiefsof Staff had then set in hand a radical review of strategy and their conclusions had been approved in principle at the beginning of July.The forces needed to support this strategy were then costed at  1,719million for 1953-54,  1,777 million for 1954-55 and  1,790 million for,1955-56. In view of the difficulties of the financial situation he had then insisted upon further drastic cuts in the programme which had brought the figures for these three years down to  1,645 million, 1,688 million and  1,698 million respectively. He could, therefore,claim that he had reduced the programme very substantially since theearly part of the year, and the reduction was in fact even greater thanit seemed owing to the rise in costs and the additional items whichwere now to be included in the Service Estimates. He was satisfiedthat it would be impossible to fulfil all our overseas commitments and-our obligations to our Allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organi-sation (N.A.T.O.) if the budgetary figure in 1953 were reduced below 1,645 million.::: The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while he was grateful for these reductions in the programme, the figure now put forward by the Minister of Defence as the minimum was more than thecountry could afford. He had himself advanced from the figure of 1,550 million, which he had first proposed, and he was now preparedto accept a figure in the neighbourhood of  1,600 million for 1953,provided that a radical review of the future pattern of our defence effort was undertaken at once, with due regard not only to strategicneeds and foreign commitments but also to economic and financialfactors. Within the figure of  1,600 million he was prepared to agreeto a load on the metal-using industries of  480 millions in 1953. Thefinancial position of the country and the fall in productivity made itimpossible to contemplate a rising curve of defence. It was alreadyclear that he would be faced with a very difficult budgetary positionin the spring. He was prepared to recommend severe cuts in civil expenditure, which would involve substantial retrenchment in thesocial services. He indicated to the Cabinet some of the main pro-posals which he would have to bring forward under this head. But,even if they were all approved, the savings thus secured would do no more than offset the increase in defence expenditure for which theMinister of Defence was asking. He would thus be left with nomeans of enabling industry to increase its productivity and com-petitive power; and we should then be faced with the prospect ofdiminishing exports and greater financial instability which must, in turn, undermine our defence effort.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Service Ministers said that, as explained in C. (52) 394,any further reduction below the&quot;  1,645 million proposed by theMinister of Defence must diminish the fighting strength of theServices. All possible economies in the administration of the services had already been taken into account and the allocation of less money&apos;.to&apos; the defence programme could only result in fewer fightingformations, and a reduced supply of new equipment. The Secretary,of State for Air said that it would mean, for example, that the with-ydrawal of a number of operational squadrons from the Middle Eastand Far,East Air Forces would have to be put in hand immediately.
- The Prime Minister said that he was not fully satisfied on this point-and would:wish;to examine the organisation of the three Services in greater detail once the budgetary figure for 1953-54 had been fixed.(b)The Minister of Supply pointed out that failure to plan a firm&apos; production programme over three years might well lead to waste ofmoney through compensation for the cancellation of orders.. The-curtailment of the defence programme had already forced him to cancel certain orders for tanks and aircraft, the production of whichhe had made every effort to accelerate less than a year ago.   ThePrime Minister-said that every effort should be made to avoid having&apos;to -pay compensation for the cancellation of contracts for valuableequipment.   He would be glad to have a detailed report on this fromthe Minister of Supply.- (c) The figure of  1,645 million proposed by the Minister ofDefence was based on existing wage rates in the engineering industry.If, as seemed likely, these were increased, there would be a cones-&apos; ponding increase in the total cost of defence production in 1953,which might possibly amount to  15 million. The Chancellor of theExchequer agreed that the additional cost arising from this wagesaward would have to.be added to the figure finally approved by theCabinet that day for defence expenditure in 1953.(d) In arriving at his figure the Minister of Defence had assumed that United Kingdom costs in Germany would not exceed  30 million.It was possible that this was an optimistic assumption. TheChancellor of the Exchequer agreed that, if German costs exceeded 30 million, the Service Departments should not be required to find the surplus by savings on other parts of their Vote. Other means of financing any such surplus would have to be found.; (e) The&apos; President of the Board of Trade said that he was pre-pared to accept a defence load of  480 million on the metal-using industries in 1953, on the understanding that he and the Minister ofSupply would be free to consider, firm by firm, what transfers couldeffectively be made from defence work to exports. He believed,however, that the general level of defence expenditure contemplated by the Minister of Defence was higher than the national economycould bear, and that greater efforts would have to be made to reduceGovernment expenditure, both civil and military, so that industry could be enabled to increase exports. It was the view of several ministers that to accept a defence budget beyond what waseconomically wise at the present stage might well lead to a still lower figure for defence in subsequent years. It was therefore vital to thesuccess of the rearmament programme that the right figure for defence should be determined now.(/) The Foreign Secretary said that a decision on the defence budget for 1953-54 was urgently needed in order that N.A.T.O.could complete its annual review. Any drastic reduction of expendi-ture at this stage would severely shake the confidence of our allies in N.A.T.O. But he fully agreed that, once the 1953-54 figure hadbeen fixed, an exhaustive review should be undertaken on the lines suggested by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. He could not foreseeany large reductions in our oversea commitments, although he stillhoped that it would be possible to come to some arrangement with egypt and other interested Powers which would enable us to makeeconomies in the Middle East. In this connection it was suggestedthat it would be helpful if a distinction could be made between thecost of&apos;temporary commitments (e.g., in Korea and Malaya) whichmight be expected to diminish or disappear and that. of our morelasting commitments in respect of N.A.T.O. and the re-equipment of our Forces. , ,   . j.! ,   &apos;The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet might fix a sum of  1,610 million for the defence budget forthe financial year 1953 on the understanding that this figure did not include any additional cost arising from the current claim for a wagesincrease in our engineering industry or any increase in United
Kingdom, costs in Germany over the  30 million at present allowed. ; for this. Such a decision;would allow the necessary submission to beI S,;made.to N.A.T.O. for, its annual review though he would wish to/.0,i examine in detail, the incidence of this further cut upon the three.&apos;i ijServices. He was most anxious -that there should be no substantialm;reduction in the fighting strength of the Services, and he still hoped,.iv:that the cuts could be made in such a way as-to avoid destroyingfighting formations or curtailing the production of the latest types; 7, of equipment.   A radical review of the defence programme for sub-sequent years should be undertaken against a comprehensive back-&apos; ground of our, strategy, our oversea commitments and our financial,,  and economic position.,,    t    The Cabinet  ,ii *&apos;     (1) &quot;Decided that defence expenditure in the financial year 1953:   &apos;     ,        should:-be^fixed at  1,610 million calculated at existing-*w ,*,&apos;* i * &apos; &quot;prices^ and that this, figure should not be held to include any additional cost arising from the current, wages dispute,   .....      the engineering, industry, or from any increase inA      ,:       United Kingdom costs in Germany above the  30 million&apos;  already allowed for this.(2) Agreed that in the financial, year 1953 the load of defence i production on the metal-using industries should not exceed-        .        480 million.     , :. , (3) Invited the Minister of Defence to arrange for the necessary;,A:    i information based on the decisions in Conclusions (1): . v      .   - and (2) above to be given to N.A.T.O. with the least: . . possible delay; and to discuss further with the Prime-    ,,(&apos;;&apos; Minister the effect which this limit of expenditure in 1953y:.       would have on the organisation of the three Services.; (4) Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation with the* :    ,     ; Foreign Secretary, the Chancellor of the Exchequer andt,    the Minister of Defence, would put in hand a radical, i;   , , i      review of the pattern of our defence effort in the years-&quot;  V after 1953.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,q r 8th November, 1952.
