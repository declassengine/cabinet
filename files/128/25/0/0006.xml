The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, although con-fidence in the strength of sterling was not good, the state of our gold and dollar reserves at the next half-yearly date (i,e., the end of June)would be better than he had at one stage feared. But there was stilla fundamental unbalance between our income and outgoings on overseas account. And he was disturbed to find that the level ofimports, particularly from Europe, had fallen very little as a result ofthe cuts made in the winter. There was some evidence that reduc-tions in the purchases of particular items (especially of food-stuffs)were being offset by increases in other directions. He was lookinginto this more closely.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.2. The Cabinet took note of the signature of the contractualsettlement terminating the system of occupation in Western Germanyand granting sovereignty to the German Federal Republic.   -The Cabinet invited the Prime Minister to send to the foreign secretary on their behalf a message of congratulation on the success-ful conclusion of these negotiations.3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary(C. (52) 176) covering a draft of a Parliamentary statement on civil air transport policy.The Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and power and The Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation said thatthe statement was the outcome of full consultation with the various interests concerned. So far as concerned air transport to foreigncountries and other Commonwealth countries it would go a long wayto fulfil the Governments Election pledges. While the Corporationswould retain their existing services, private companies and the corporations would be able to apply on an equal footing for licences to operate new scheduled services. The licences Would confer muchgreater security on operators than the arrangements under whichprivate companies now operated.It had not proved practicable as yet to offer to private companiesa similar opportunity to participate in the operation of scheduled services within the British Isles. The internal services at presentoperated by British European Airways should not be handed overexcept to private companies of assured stability who could be certain of being able to operate them for some time. Applications to operateprivate internal services had not been forthcoming from suitablesources to the extent expected by Ministers.Various drafting amendments of the statement were suggested and agreed.-  The Cabinet -Invited the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation tomake in the House of Commons the statement annexed toC. (52) 176, as amended in their discussion; and invited the Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, fuel and Power to make a similar statement in the House ofLords.
East Lothian.The Cabinet were informed that there was likely to be a seriousconflict of interests over this. The land affected was admittedlyamong the finest agricultural land in Scotland. On the other hand,it seemed likely to contain a substantial quantity of high-grade coal,suitable for open-cast working, in an area where coal was urgently needed, as many of the deep seams were being exhausted. The HomeAffairs Committee, which had discussed the problem on 7th March,had considerd that no final decision should be taken until the quantities of coal available and the cost of working it had been more precisely assessed; and they had agreed that prospecting shouldcontinue for this purpose.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that no further open-cast working of coal should beundertaken in East Lothian without the authority of theCabinet.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland to explain theposition to Major Anstruther-Gray, M.P., who representedthis area in the House of Commons.Coal Exports. 5.- The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secre-(Previous tary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Power and reference: the Minister of Fuel and Power (C. (52) 174) proposing that up toC.C. (52) 55th the end of September 1952 a further 1+ million tons of coal should conclusions, . be made available for export in addition to the 10 million tonsMinute 3.) previously authorised for export in .1952, this additional amount toinclude 675,000 tons already added to the original 1952 allocation.The Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and power said that he was anxious to increase coal exports to the greatestpracticable extent. But caution was necessary in estimating coalprospects so early in the year. While he hoped that it might bepossible later on to allocate even more for export, he was satisfiedthat it would not be possible at the present time to go beyond theproposal in C. (52) 174 without risking a serious breakdown in home supplies; for stocks of house coal were still inadequate. The greaterpart of the additional coal which it was now proposed to export wouldhave to be small coal of poor quality.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had hoped thatit might be possible both to increase the proportion of good qualitycoal for export and also to increase the 1952 total to 12 million tonsof coal and \\ million tons of slurry. Inland stocks of coal werenot only higher now than a year ago, but seemed likely to reachnearly 20 million tons at the beginning of next winter. He doubted the need for stocks at this level. If extra exports would involve a risk of shortage at home, this risk might be a lesser evil than a furtherdrain on our currency reserves. The export of coal to Europe meant a direct saving of gold;, and increased coal.exports would be thesurest means of restoring confidence in our determination to defendour reserves. Moreover, if we could not increase those exportsquickly and improve the proportion of high quality coal in them,we might well lose our long-term markets.The President of the Board of Trade said that nothing would do so much as an increase in coal exports to restore our commercial&apos; prestige in Europe and to increase the readiness of foreign countries to take from us other exports of less essential goods.&apos; ( jCoaL 4.   The Prime Minister drew attention to the ParliamentaryOpen-cast       difficulties which might arise if the Government proceeded with a working in      proposal to work open-cast coal in East Lothian.
6. The Cabinefs attention was drawn to published reports of conditions in the camps on Koje Island for prisoners of war captured by United Nations forces in Korea. The troops which had nowbeen despatched to restore order in these camps were in the mainAmerican but included small contingents of Canadian, Greek, DutchCC (52) 47th anc* United Kingdom troops. The Canadian Government had conclusions represented, in a note to the United States Government, that the minute 4) &apos; Canadian contingent should not have been included without prior consulation with them. This episode illustrated the need for improved arrangements to enable the Governments contributingtroops to the United Nations forces to know what was going on in korea.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Korea.Prisoners ofWar. -(previous reference:Cabinet Office, S.W.1,27th May, 1952The Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and power said that he fully appreciated these considerations. He would arrange for as much of the better quality coal to be made available as he could. But he could not agree at the present time that exportsshould be raised above the quantities which he had proposed. Therewere still too many uncertainties in the situation. He would keepthe matter under continuous review and if possible would propose an increase in the export allocation as soon as the outlook became. clearer. The Minister of Fuel and Power said that there were some indications that a long-term movement of man-power back to the mines might be beginning; but it was too early yet to be certain of this.There was some opinion in the Cabinet that the gravity of thebalance of payments problem outweighed the risk involved in increasing coal exports to the extent suggested by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer. The majority view was, however, that the proposals made in C. (52) 174 should be accepted for the time being and thatthe matter should be reviewed again in June.The Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Trans-port, Fuel and Power and the Minister of Fuel and Powerto arrange for coal exports to be increased to the extentproposed in C. (52) 174; and agreed to consider thepossibility of further increases in the light of their forth-coming study of the balance of payments and of the import programme.
