Parliament. 1.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theBusiness in the  House of Commons in the following week.House of The second reading of the Transport Bill would be debated onGommons 17th and 18th November. The Cabinet agreed that the government spokesman in this debate should be the Minister of Transport, theHome Secretary and the Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry ofTransport.The Coronation.      2.   The Cabinet considered various aspects of the Coronation(Previous        arrangements.Reference:C.C. (52) 95thConclusions,Minute 1.)Uniform andDress.Peers&apos; Coaches.Seating in theAbbey.43539The Commonwealth Secretary said that he had recently sent the earl Marshal a note embodying the views of his Committee on thedress to be worn by various classes of persons at the Coronation.The only outstanding point was whether Service Officers should beallowed to wear full-dress uniform if they wished to do so. It was proposed that civilians invited to the Abbey (including PrivyCounsellors, Ministers not in the Privy Council but entitled touniform and members of the Civil Services) should be authorised towear any of the following:  (a) Civil uniform, either with trousers or with white kerseymerebreeches;(b) velvet court dress;(c) evening dress with trousers (white tie, white waistcoat);(d) morning dress.The Prime Minister said that all Ministers who were PrivyCounsellors and other Privy Counsellors among government supporters in the House of Commons ought to wear at the Abbeyceremony the levee dress of a Privy Counsellor or, if they preferredand could obtain it, full dress (with trousers).The Prime Minister said that he hoped that further consideration would be given to the suggestion that Peers who would be attending the ceremony and still possessed coaches should be allowed to driveto the Abbey in them.The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordChancellor (C. (52) 403) on the allocation of seats in the Abbey to members of the two Houses of Parliament.The Lord Chancellor said that, since the Cabinefs meeting on11th November, he had discussed with the Commonwealth Secretary,the Lord Privy Seal, the Minister of Works and the Chief Whip the earl Marshals proposal that the numbers of seats in the Abbey tobe made available for Peers and Peeresses and for Members of theHouse of Commons and their wives should be 880 and 650respectively. When allowance was made for the separate provision to be made for the 76 Privy Counsellors in the House of commons and their wives, it became clear that the figures proposed gaveproportionately a great advantage to the Commons over the Lords.He and his colleagues who had considered the matter recommendedthat 70 additional seats should be found at the expense of the armed forces, the Civil and Foreign Services, the attaches on the ForeignOffice list ,and Westminster school-boys, and should be divided between the two Houses in the proportion of 40 for ,the commons and 30 for the Lords, bringing the total allotments to 800 for the commons and 910 for the Lords. Even on this basis a ballot seemedinevitable, at least in the Lords.B 2
mlThe Commonwealth Secretary said that he saw no prospect of .n\)securing agreement among the Peers on the basis of any less figurethan 910.The Minister of Works said, as regards the Commons, that theminimum figure for all Members and their wives was of the orderof 1,100 so that the gap between the number of those Members whowould wish to attend the ceremony with their wives and the numberfor whom accommodation in the Abbey would be available (i.e., 800)seemed likely to be substantial.The Parliamentary Secretary, Treasury, said that it was very important to avoid, if possible, adopting arrangements which wouldbe unacceptable to Members generally. It seemed to him possiblethat sounding of opinion would show that the offer of four freeseats in a stand in Parliament Square as an alternative to two seats in the Abbey would prove sufficiently attractive to Members to enable a ballot for seats in the Abbey to be avoided.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Earl Marshal should be asked to proceedwith his general plans for allotting seats in the Abbey onthe basis that the total number of seats to be occupied byMembers of the two Houses of Parliament and their wiveswould not exceed 1,710.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to discuss with the leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords how atotal of 910 seats in the Abbey could best be allottedamong Peers and Peeresses.(3) Invited the Parliamentary Secretary, Treasury, to takesoundings amongst Members of the House of commons on the best method of allotting a total of 800 seats inthe Abbey among Members and their wives on the basis that this total included Privy Counsellors and officers ofthe Household and then wives to whom seats would inany case be available in their respective categories, andon the assumption that four seats in a stand in parliament square would be made available as ah alternative to twoseats in the Abbey.The Cabinet also considered the proposed allocation of seats tocertain other bodies.The Cabinet-(4) Invited the Prime Minister to make the following recom-mendations to the Earl Marshal:  (i) that the allocation to the Colonial Office should beincreased from 280 to 300, to provide, in particular,.for members of Colonial legislatures and their wives;(ii) that a larger number of seats should be allocated to women&apos;s organisations;(iii) that the numbers of seats to be allocated to employers&apos;organisations should be increased from 16 to 40and possibly to a still higher figure by reducing thenumber provisionally allocated to nationalised industries.Television. The Cabinet had before them a Note by the  Secretary(C. (52) 406) covering an extract from the Draft Second Report ofthe Coronation Joint Committee on still photography, films and television of the Coronation service.
territorial waters.IcelandFisheriesDispute.(previous reference:GC (52) 90thConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Cabinet were informed that the Icelandic Governmenthad rejected our proposal for direct negotiations between the fishingindustries of the two countries on the dispute arising from the exclusion of fishing trawlers from Faxa Bay. They had been unwilling to do more than offer to have this matter discussed by thePermanent Commission which was to be established in 1953 underthe Overfishing Convention, and in the meantime to send technical experts to this country to explain to British trawler-owners thereasons which had led them to impose these new restrictions onfishing in Icelandic wafers. Meanwhile, an Icelandic trawler was expected to arrive shortly at Grimsby, where an Icelandic firm hadfacilities which would enable it to land its fish. An attempt wasbeing made to persuade the Icelandic Government to divert this ship to Germany, but if this failed, there was a risk that the crews ofGrimsby trawlers would refuse to go to sea. The purpose of such astrike would be to induce the United Kingdom Government to bringfurther pressure to bear upon the Government of Iceland. But therewas in fact no prospect of our being able to persuade the icelandic government to modify their attitude; for they claimed that they wereprohibiting all fishing in the disputed areas and were showing no discrimination against British trawlers.The Cabinet were informed that officers of the Ministry ofAgriculture and the Ministry of Labour would do their utmost toprevent such a strike by the crews of Grimsby trawlers.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements.The Cabinet-(5) Took note of this extract from the Draft Second Report ofthe Coronation Joint Committee annexed to C. (52) 406,and invited the Prime Minister to recommend to the earl marshal that he should omit the last two paragraphs ofthe draft press announcement on television of the Corona-tion service.Naval and The Commonwealth Secretary said that The Queen had nowR.A.F. approved the proposal that both Naval and R.A.F, Reviews shouldReviews. be held in Coronation year. The date proposed for the Naval review was 15th June but the only possible date for the R.A.F. Reviewwould be 10th June when The Queen was due to attend the RoyalTournament.The Secretary of State for War said that it was intended that theRoyal Tournament of 1953 should be a special occasion in whichDominion and Colonial troops would take a prominent part. Therewould be keen disappointment if The Queen were unable to attend it.The Secretary of State for Air said that he would be content thatthe R.A.F. Review should be held in July rather than June, if this could be arranged.The Cabinet-(6) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to take Her Majesty&apos;pleasure on the suggestion that the proposed R.A.F.Review should not be included among the eventsimmediately following the Coronation but should be heldsomewhat later in the year, e.g., in July.
4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the AgricultulgMinisters and the Minister of Food. (C. (52) 401) outlining a scheme under which the Exchequer subsidy on animal feeding-stuffs wouldbe withdrawn in April 1953 and the existing schemes for rationing,price control and Government trading in feeding-stuffs and cerealswould be discontinued at the time of the following harvest.The Minister of Agriculture said that this would be a hazardousprocess and the details of the scheme would need to be discussed in confidence with representatives of the farmers and the millingindustry before any public announcement was made. It was important that in the meantime there should be no reduction in the stocks of feeding-stuffs.The Minister of Food also referred to the risks involved inabandoning this control and stressed, in particular, the importanceof resisting pressure from the farmers for higher prices for agricul-tural products to compensate for the expected rise in the price of feeding-stuffs. He also mentioned the possibility that the price of bread might have to be increased when the flour subsidy to millerswas withdrawn, in order to reduce the risk of loss on account of thedifficulties of administering a heavy subsidy through bakers.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he hoped it would notbe necessary to increase the price of bread: other means could probably be found of overcoming those difficulties. The greater risk,in his view, was that the withdrawal of this control might lead to increased imports of feeding-stuffs. But, even so, the additional expenditure overseas would be more than offset by the internalsaving arising from the abandonment of the subsidy. He fully supported the proposals in C. (52) 401; and he preferred that theyshould be presented, not as part of the next Budget, but as an incidentin the development of agricultural policy.The President of the Board of Trade said that, before anypromise of price support were given to the farmers, he would be glad to have an opportunity of discussing the matter with the ministers concerned in the light of our international obligations under theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.The Cabinet-(1) Approved in principle the proposals in C. (52) 401 for with-drawing Government control over feeding-stuffs andcereals.(2) Invited the Agriculture Ministers and the Minister of food to consult the President of the Board of Trade on thequestion whether the scheme outlined in C. (52) 401would give rise to difficulties under the General Agree-ment on Tariffs and Trade.(3) Authorised the Agriculture Ministers and the Minister ofFood to discuss the details of the scheme in confidencewith representatives of the farmers and the trades con-cerned, and to report the result of those discussions tothe Cabinet before any public announcement was made.animal feeding-stuffs.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,13th November, 1952.
