Commonwealth 1.EconomicConference. C.(previous reference:CC. (52) 76th C-Conclusions,Minute 4.)Finance andTrade qQuestions.The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda:  (52) 373: by the Foreign Secretary covering the reports ofthe meeting of Commonwealth officials held in preparation for the Commonwealth Economic Conference.(52) 376: by the Foreign Secretary, recommending that theUnited Kingdom Government should put forward as thebasis for the discussion at the Conference the proposals outlined in the Annex to that memorandum for a collectiveapproach to multilateral trade and payments.(52) 377: by the Paymaster-General, summarising his objec-tions to these proposals.The Foreign Secretary said that his Committee on preparations for the Commonwealth Economic Conference had carefully con-sidered the report of the officials on Finance and Trade Questions.They had come to the-conclusion (the Paymaster-General dissenting)that the United Kingdom Government should put forward proposalsfor a collective approach to multilateral trade and payments modified in the light of the comments made at the meeting of officials. Thesemodified proposals were set out in the Annex to C. (52) 376. Theyshould be put forward as the best plan that could be devised at thepresent time. They were, however, proposals for discussion, first withthe Commonwealth Governments and subsequently, if the Conferenceso decided, with the leading European countries and, finally, with theUnited States. If therefore the Government now adopted these pro-posals, they would not be committing themselves to entering at once a system of multilateral trade and payments; the approach would be gradual and the ultimate decision would not be taken by the UnitedKingdom Government until the end of these discussions.The Paymaster-General said that he did not dissent from thegeneral view that the ultimate objective must be a system of multi-lateral trade involving convertibility of sterling. But, before this objective could be attained, the economic position of the UnitedKingdom must be strong and, on present forecasts, it seemed as if our balance of payments was likely to deteriorate seriously in the latter half of 1953. Convertibility of sterling would involve serious risks to our export trade. Foreign holders of sterling would be enabled to buy in dollar markets and would reduce their imports of british goods: meanwhile, the fall in the value of the pound would reducethe foreign exchange earned by our exports. Such a scheme was unlikely to appeal to the United States, since essential parts of it were that discrimination would be practised only against them, thatthere would be no convertibility for residents of the sterling area,and that there would be an increase in Imperial Preference. On this basis, it seemed to him most unlikely that the Americans would agreeto contribute to an exchange support fund, or increase their subscriptions-tion to the International Monetary Fund. A considerable numberof objections had been raised to the scheme at the preparatorymeeting of Commonwealth officials and he was doubtful whether theother Commonwealth Governments would be willing to adopt it. Hewas particularly afraid that, in the course of negotiations with them,all the safeguards on which we were relying would be surrendered.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that convertibility wasnot an end in itself. It was simply one of the methods by which we might advance to a multilateral trade and payments system whichwould support our own economic position and extend the scope ofour trade. Without convertibility sterling could not be regarded asa strong world currency. It was in any case intended that the move towards this system should be gradual and that the ultimate decision should rest with the Government of the United Kingdom, which acted as bankers for the whole sterling area. He thought that the latest proposals for obtaining the necessary financial support through theInternational Monetary Fund (in place of a direct credit from the
United States Government) would be likely to make it easier to obtainthe approval of Congress and to satisfy the susceptibilities of Indiaand Pakistan. It was true that, in any case, the additional funds would have to be found by the United States, but he calculated thatif use was made of the International Monetary Fund, it would onlybe necessary to increase the $1-3 billion, now frozen in that Fund,by a further $1 billion.The Cabinefs discussion turned mainly on the effects which a return to a system of multilateral trading and payments were likelyto have on domestic policies in this country.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Governmentwould have to be prepared for a more flexible use of monetary and credit policy. Investment and domestic consumption would have tobe adjusted so as to prevent an excessive volume of imports and toleave scope for an expansion of exports. And plans for development would have to be pushed forward, in the United Kingdom as wellas in other parts of the Commonwealth, with a view to improving the trade balance of the sterling area and strengthening its competitive power. It was, however, his view that all these measures would haveto be taken for the purpose of redressing our trade balance and pre-venting a further drain on our reserves of gold and dollars, even ifsterling remained inconvertible. There was no doubt that currentpolicies were imposing on our national economy a greater burdenthan it could bear; and he was already seeking means of securing asubstantial reduction in the volume of public expenditure. he recognised the political difficulties of making any reduction of. thehousing target; but he was aiming, in consultation with the Ministerof Housing and Local Government, to reduce public expenditure on housing by improving the balance, within the programme, betweenprivately built houses and subsidised houses. He also hoped to find some means of reducing expenditure on social services, possibly byeconomies in hospital administration and education services and bythe abolition of some of the costlier forms of food subsidy. Savingssecured by this means would help to offset the increasing cost of thedefence programme though defence expenditure must itself be keptbelow the figures which were at present contemplated by the Services.These measures, which he believed it would be necessary to introducelong before a multilateral system of world trade and payments couldbe brought into operation, should have the effect of increasing our economic strength and competitive power and would to that extentreduce the risk that our return to a multilateral system might involve us in increased unemployment and rising prices.In further discussion on this point it was argued that the greatestlimitation on the competitive power of British industry was the high level of taxation. Unless that could be reduced, it would be almost impossible to expand the volume of our exports; and it was difficultto see how it could be reduced without significant cuts in public expenditure either on defence or on social services. There would,however, be great political difficulties in reducing&apos; social serviceexpenditure, and it might be more difficult for the Government to face these now than when they first took office.In the ensuing discussion, further reference was made to the risks involved in any premature movement towards a multilateral system.Several Ministers said that they had shared the apprehensions whichhad been voiced by the Paymaster-General on this point. They were,however, fortified by the assurance, given by the Foreign secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that the proposals outlined inthe Annex to C. (52) 376 were to be put forward only as the basis for the discussion, and that the United Kingdom Government wouldreserve to themselves the right to make the final judgment, when thetime came, whether the conditions were such that the plan should he put into operation.
Special reference was also made to the question of imperial preference. The proposals originally put forward on behalf of theUnited Kingdom had received no support from the representativesof the other Commonwealth countries in the course of the preparatorymeeting of officials; but the Cabinet agreed that, none the less, theyshould be put forward for consideration by Commonwealth ministers at the Conference. Though it was unlikely that they would findacceptance, the United Kingdom Government should not be the first to turn their backs on the system of Imperial Preference. In any event, the other Commonwealth Ministers should be pressed to agreeto the limited proposals for enabling this country to regain its freedom to move tariffs which was at present limited by the conflict betweenthe &quot; no new preference &quot; rule of the General Agreement on tariffs and Trade and the commitment, under the Ottawa Agreements, to admit Commonwealth goods free of duty.. The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that there seemed to be general agreement in the Cabinet that the proposals out-lined in the Annex to C. (52) 376 should be put forward as the basis for the discussion at the Commonwealth Economic Conference.Although the United Kingdom Government were not finally com-.mitted to them, they should be put forward with conviction as the best plan which we had been able to devise.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that, in the exchanges on finance and trade questions at the Commonwealth Economic Conference, the UnitedKingdom Government should put forward, as the basis for the discussion, the proposals outlined in the Annex toC. (52) 376 for a collective approach to a system of multi-lateral trade and payments.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to inform other commonwealth Governments that the United KingdomGovernment would table these proposals for discussion atthe Conference.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that at the Conferencesecret discussions would have to be held with commonwealth ministers about the price of gold and the re-establishment of a goldmarket in London.The South African Government were very anxious that the dollar price of gold should be increased, and they would probably be reluctant to support the proposals for a collective approach to multi-lateral trade and payments unless it were also agreed that the UnitedStates Government should be pressed to accept a higher price forgold. The Chancellor said that, subject to the views of other commonwealth Ministers, he would favour making this approach tothe United States Government though he was doubtful whether itwould succeed. The method of approach to the Americans could bediscussed with South African Ministers after the Conference.The Chancellor also said that, quite apart from the question ofthe dollar price, it was desirable that a gold market should be re-estab-lished in London if the proposals for a collective approach to mulit-lateralism went forward. There was a better prospect of securingAmerican agreement on this point.The Cabinet-(3) Agreed that at the Commonwealth Economic Conferencesecret discussions should be held with other Common-wealth Ministers on the dollar price of gold and on there-opening of a gold market in London, as proposed bythe Chancellor of the Exechequer.   .,
