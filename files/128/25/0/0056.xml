&apos; -parliament.JBusiness in theHouse ofCommons.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the week after the Christmas recess.The Lord Privy Seal said that he proposed to offer the Oppositionone additional day for the report stage of the Transport Bill. he hoped to reach agreement with them on a timetable for the Iron andSteel Bill which would obviate the need for a guillotine motion; and,if final agreement were reached in time, he would announce this beforethe House of Commons adjourned for the recess.Palace of 2.   The Lord Privy Seal said that the Opposition were urging the westminster. appointment of a Select Committee to enquire into the control and management of the Palace of Westminster, including such questions as the allocation of accommodation between the two Houses and themethods of appointment of staff.The Minister of Works said that responsibility was divided between himself and the Lord Great Chamberlain. Some Membersof the House of Commons believed that, as a result of this dividedresponsibility, the accommodation in the Palace of Westminster wasnot being allocated to the best advantage and that appointments ofstaff were being made without due consideration and competition.The Prime Minister said that he would deprecate any encroach-ment upon the traditional responsibilities of the Lord Great Chamber-lain unless this could be clearly shown to be necessary and urgent.He doubted whether it could; and he therefore suggested that theLord Privy Seal should let it be known to the Opposition that theGovernment were considering this matter but felt that any formalenquiry would have to be conducted by a Joint Select Committee ofboth Houses of Parliament.The Cabinet Endorsed the suggestions made by the Prime Minister.H.R.H. The 3.   The Cabinet were informed that The Queen had expressedDuke of the wish that early in the New Year H.R.H. the Duke of EdinburghEdinburgh.      should be appointed to, high rank in each of the three Services.Service R. 3. ii k sThe Lord Chancellor said that he had made enquiries into this,at the Prime Minister^ request. It raised no legal or constitutional difficulties; and he was assured by the Service Ministers that it wouldbe warmly welcomed in all three Services.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet would certainly wishto support the suggestion that H.R.H. the Duke of Edinburgh shouldbe appointed Admiral of the Fleet, Field-Marshal and Marshal of theRoyal Air Force. He thought it desirable that this should be thesubject of formal advice from the Cabinet. He therefore proposedthat he should tender advice in this sense to Her Majesty on their behalf, and that formal submissions should be made thereafter by each of the Service Ministers.The Cabinet-Endorsed the Prime Ministers suggestion..

The Cabinet resumed their discussion of a memorandum byAmnesty for the Minister of Defence (C. - (52) 248) on the question whether anDeserters. amnesty should be declared for men who had deserted from the(Previous Armed Forces during the war.r^cT-V) 74 h The Prime Minister said that he found great difficulty in acceptingC.

Common Land.       5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries (C. (52) 426) recommending that a Royallives of outcasts and outlaws. Nearly eight years had passed sin^the end of the war, and he could not accept the view that desertkK-should never be condoned. The national rejoicing at the time of the coronation would provide a suitable occasion for an act of mercytowards these men.Discussion showed that opinion in the Cabinet was divided onthis question. The Service Ministers, supported by some membersof the Cabinet, expressed the firm conviction that an amnesty fordeserters would be taken as implying that desertion in war was nolonger regarded as the most serious of military crimes, and would lead to increased desertion from the Armed Forces at a time whenvery large numbers of men were serving overseas in circumstances which imposed the most disagreeable duties upon them. Thenumbers who would benefit from an amnesty, now estimated as notmore than 2,000, were not so large as to justify this risk to the generaldiscipline of the Forces. No true comparison could be drawn withcircumstances after the 1914-18 War, when the Services were much smaller and were not engaged in active military operations.The majority of the Cabinet, on the other hand, doubted whetherthe effect on Service discipline would be as severe as the service ministers foresaw, and thought it was outweighed by considerations of mercy and by the disadvantage of driving these deserters and their children into criminal habits by branding them as outlaws. If the amnesty were granted in connection with the Coronation of a newSovereign, no man now serving in the Forces could be led thereby to expect that, if he deserted, his offence would be condoned if he escapeddetection for a few years.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of the opinion in the Cabinet seemed to be in favour of recommending that Her Majesty should grant some form of amnestyfor men who had deserted from the Armed Forces in the war as aspecial act of clemency in the year of her Coronation.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Defence to consider what procedure should be adopted for extending clemency to men whohad deserted from the Armed Forces in the last war.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would take steps toascertain informally whether Her Majesty would wish suchan act of clemency to be associated directly with herCoronation.Amnesty for The Cabinet also considered a memorandum by the home civil Prisoners. Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland (C. (52) 436) on thequestion whether an amnesty should be granted to civil prisoners onthe occasion of the Coronation.The Home Secretary said that this would necessarily involveunfairness between one prisoner and another and, for the reasonsindicated in the memorandum, could not be applied at all to various classes of prisoner. He and the Secretary of State for Scotland were agreed that it would be inexpedient to recommend an amnesty orother form of special clemency for civil prisoners on the occasion ofthe Coronation.The Cabinet-(3) Agreed that no recommendation should be made for theexercise of special clemency towards civil prisoners on theoccasion of the Coronation; and authorised the HomeSecretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland to makea public announcement to this effect.
(*! 157 C.C. 106 (52).(^Hl Commission should be established to enquire into the need for amendment of the law relating to common land.The Minister of Agriculture said that the law on this subject was extremely complex and many interests were involved. It wouldbe helpful if the complexities of the law could be resolved and a considered policy evolved for the best use of common land whether for amenity or for agriculture.It was the view of the Cabinet that if a Royal Commission were appointed, its terms of reference should be so drawn as to give toall the interests concerned the fullest possible opportunity to make their views known. It would be unfortunate if the Royal Commis-sion&apos;s investigations had the effect of restricting public access to the countryside, especially as it seemed doubtful whether much of thiscommon land could, in fact, be brought into profitable agricultural use.In the last war, when powers of requisition had been extensively used,only 1 per cent, of common land had been brought under cultivation.The Prime Minister said that he saw no urgent need for an enquiry by a Royal Commission, which might well stir up demands for the nationalisatiori^oOhj^landZI The.-expansion&quot; oT.. agricultural production couTdbe better served by finding means of bringing moremarginal land under cultivation.The Cabinet Decided to proceed no further with the proposal for theestablishment of a Royal Commission to enquire into theneed for amendment of the law relating to common land.territorial waters.IcelandFisheriesDispute.(previous reference:CC. (52) 96thConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the PrimeMinister (C. (52) 447) and the Foreign Secretary (C. (52) 444) on thealternative courses of action now open to the United KingdomGovernment in the fisheries dispute with the Iceland Government.The Prime Minister said that the Government of Iceland werenot justified in using the judgment of the Hague Court in the Anglo-Norwegian fisheries dispute as a ground for depriving our trawlersof the free access to Faxa Bay, which they had enjoyed for half a century, in order to promote the interests of Iceland&apos;s own inshorefishermen. It was satisfactory that, in spite of the ban on landingsof fish from Iceland, we had obtained our normal supplies for thelast two months; but, if the restrictions imposed on our trawlersaround the coast of Iceland were extended to other traditional fishinggrounds, the threat to our fish supplies would become serious. Ifwe now referred the dispute to the International Court, which might appear to the Cabinet to be the least objectionable course, the banon landings was likely to be maintained while proceedings in theCourt were pending and in progress, since there was no means ofcoercing the trawler owners and skippers in the matter. Moreover,the Courfs ultimate judgment might well prove unfavourable to ourcause.One view expressed in discussion was that the United KingdomGovernment might refrain from taking any special action in the matter for the time being. We could explain once again to the Governmentof Iceland that the ban on landings represented a spontaneous reactionby our fishing interests, over whom the Government had no control.The closing of the English market to Icelandic fish might well be thebest deterrent to discourage others from following Iceland&apos;s example.If we adopted this course we must expect retaliation against our exports to Iceland.Other Ministers were, however, inclined to favour referring thedispute to the International Court. The Icelanders&apos; interpretation ofthe Hague Court ruling in the Anglo-Norwegian fisheries case wasexceedingly wide and went beyond what the Court itself had intended.
The Court might welcome an opportunity of narrowing the inter-pretation placed in practice upon its earlier ruling.The general view of the Cabinet was that, on balance, we shouldbe wise to refer the dispute to the International Court and that, in doing so, we ought if possible to be able to say that, if the Govern-ment of Iceland withdrew their restrictions on our trawlers pending a decision by the Court, the ban on landings of Icelandic fish in thiscountry would be similarly lifted.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should refer the Iceland fisheries dispute to the international court of Justice.(2) Invited the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries to obtain from the trawler owners and skippers concerned thenecessary assurances to enable Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentto inform the International Court that, if the restrictionson our trawlers imposed by the Government of Icelandwere raised pending a decision by the Court, the ban onlandings of Icelandic fish in this country would also be lifted.(3) Invited the President, of the Board of Trade to examine thepossibility of revoking the open general licence for theimport of fish from Iceland and of imposing quota restrictions should such measures prove eventually to benecessary.7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePostmaster-General (C. (52) 446) on the extent to which coloured people from the Commonwealth and Empire were at present em-ployed by the Post Office.The Postmaster-General said that the problem of -colouredworkers was not confined to the Post Office. It was natural that his department, which employed by far the largest number of staffgenerally, should employ the largest number of coloured workers butthey were also to be found in other Departments. If government policy on this matter should be modified, his Department would fall into line; but it could hardly be expected to introduce discriminationon grounds of colour in its recruitment of staff as a matteer of departmental policy.The Rome Secretary said that legislation would be necessary before coloured British subjects could be deprived of their traditionalfreedom to enter this country. The late Government had reviewed and confirmed the policy of according free entry to British subjects of whatever colour, although they had recognised some of the risks involved. There seemed, however, to be a case for an enquiry by officials of the Departments concerned to establish the facts of thesituation, including any special difficulties to which the presence of substantial numbers of coloured people in particular localities (forexample, the east end of London and Liverpool) were giving rise inpractice.The Colonial Secretary said that his Department would be readyto collaborate in the proposed enquiry, but there would be graveobjection to any suggestion of discrimination between coloured andother subjects of Her Majesty in the matter of entry to the UnitedKingdom.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the increasing numberof coloured people entering Government service raised rather special problems which also appeared to merit examination.
The Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for officials of theDepartments concerned to examine the possibilities of preventing any further increase in the number of coloured people seeking employment in this country.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for con-current examination of the possibility of restricting thenumber of coloured people obtaining admission to theCivil Service.8. The Lord President said that Lord Denman, a formerGovernor-General of Australia, had consulted him about a proposal that a plaque should be erected in St. Paul&apos;s Cathedral in memoryof Mr. William Hughes, a former Prime Minister of Australia. Hehad mentioned Lord Denman&apos;s proposal to Mr. Menzies, whohad welcomed it and had not felt that it would create any awkwardprecedent.The general view of the Cabinet was that the Government wouldbe well advised to avoid expressing a definite opinion on this proposal.It should be possible to sustain the line that, while the Governmentnaturally shared the high regard felt for Mr. Hughes throughout theCommonwealth, the erection of a memorial to him in St. Paul&apos;s wasa matter for private initiative and for the discretion of the Dean and chapter.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord President to deal with this enquiry on thelines suggested in discussion.9. The Committee had before them a report (C. (52) 414) by theCommittee which they had appointed on 10th June to formulate plans for checking any tendency towards widespread unemployment.The Commonwealth Secretary said that his Committee were satisfied that there was little risk of widespread unemployment andthat action was already in hand to deal with such localised unemploy-ment as had already occurred or was in prospect. In thesecircumstances he doubted whether his Committee need be kept in being. The responsibility - for watching unemployment trends and recommending such remedial action as might be necessary could restin future with the Economic Policy Committee.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the report by the Employment Committee(C. (52) 414).(2) Agreed that the Committee should now be dissolved andthat responsibility for watching unemployment trends and suggesting necessary remedial action should in futurerest with the Economic Policy Committee.Redundancies The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that on the previous day in South Wales, the Minister of Supply had succeeded in persuading the SteelCompany of Wales and Richard Thomas and Baldwins not toproceed with their intention to close down temporarily for the christmas week a number of hand tin-plate mills employing some9,000 people and to give four weeks&apos; notice of permanent dischargeto some 1,200 British workers and 200 Italians employed by the leastefficient of these mills which they intended to close down permanently.The prompt action taken by the Ministry of Supply had averted a situation which would have caused the Government grave difficulty and embarrassment.The Cabinet-(3) Took note of this statement.The Rt. Hon.WilliamHughes.Employment.Report of theEmploymentCommittee.(previous reference:CC. (52) 58thConclusions,Minute 4.)
