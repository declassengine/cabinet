/Kenya.(previous reference:CC. (52) 87thConclusions,Minute 5.)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum on the MauMau movement (C. (52) 407) which the Colonial Secretary had circulated on his return from his visit to Kenya.The Colonial Secretary reported to the Cabinet the latest news of the disturbances which had taken place in Kenya in the last fewdays. The most serious of these was the attack which Kikuyu tribes-men had made on a police patrol in the Fort Hall reserve. The policehad been compelled to fire on the crowd and several tribesmen hadbeen killed.In discussion it was suggested that tear gas would be a preferablemeans of controlling crowds on such occasions. Consideration might also be given to the possibility of issuing some shot guns to the localpolice so that, if they had to open fire, they might use buckshot asa first means of defence.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the Colonial Secretary&apos;s report (C. (52) 407).(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to consider, in consultationwith the Minister of Defence, whether arrangements could be made for the use of tear gas and buckshot incontrolling disorders by tribesmen in Kenya.Parliament. ^ 2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in the  the House of Commons in the following week.House of The business for 3rd December had not yet been finally deter-Commons. mined. The choice lay between general debates on Welsh affairs or on the Council of Europe, and the Second Reading of theEducation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. After discussion theCabinet invited the Lord Privy Seal and the Chief Whip to settle,in consultation with the Ministers concerned, which of these subjectsshould be proposed.Purchase Tax.D Scheme forFurniture.(previous reference:CC. (52) 85thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that,he would shortly be making an Order introducing the D Scheme for furniture whichhad been foreshadowed in the debates on the Finance Bill. Thiswould require an affirmative resolution by both Houses of Parliament,and he was anxious that the debate in the House of Commons shouldbe held before the Christmas recess.The Prime Minister asked whether the introduction of thisscheme could not be delayed. The Chancellor of the Exchequer saidthat it would yield between  4 and  5, millions a year in purchase tax and it was important that he should obtain this revenue, particularly as there was a falling-off in the yield of purchase tax generally. Underthe scheme no purchase tax would be payable on the cheaper types of furniture.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to lay beforeParliament an Order introducing a D Scheme for furniture-ture; and invited him to discuss with the Lord Privy seal the possibility of arranging for the debate on the necessaryaffirmative resolution to be taken in the House ofCommons before the Christmas recess.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to send to the PrimeMinister a note explaining the nature of this D Scheme.
Judges&apos;Salaries.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 87thConclusions,Minute 2.)Magistrates&apos;Courts.Compensationfor part-timeClerks.(previous reference:C.C.(52)71stConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the proposal, putforward in a memorandum by the Lord Chancellor and the HomeSecretary (C. (52) 231), that the regulations to be made underSection 42 of the Justices of the Peace Act, 1949, should provide for compensation for the part-time Clerks to Justices who would bedisplaced by the reorganisation to be carried out under that Act.The Lord Chancellor and The Home Secretary repeated thearguments in favour of this course which they had placed before theCabinet at the earlier discussions on 22nd July.   As an additional4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Lord&apos;Chancellor, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary ofState for Scotland (C. (52) 416) covering a draft Bill providing foran increase in the remuneration of Judges of the High Court.The Lord Chancellor recalled that at their earlier discussion on21st October the Cabinet had agreed that the Judges&apos; remunerationshould be improved by providing that a proportion of their salaryshould be exempted from taxation. On investigation it had beenfound that this method would have conferred the greater benefit onJudges with private means; and it was now proposed to proceed bythe simpler method of providing that all Judges should receive, inaddition to salary, an allowance of  1,000 a year which would be free of all taxation.In discussion there was general support for this method of improving the remuneration of the Judges.The following particular points were raised in the discussion:  (a) The Lord Chancellor said that under the Bill as presented to the Cabinet this tax-free allowance would not be available to lord chancellor&apos;s. He thought it his duty to future holders of his officeto point out to the Cabinet that, if the Bill stood as now drafted, thenet remuneration of the Lord Chancellor would in future be sub-stantially less than that of the Lord Chief Justice, the Master of the rolls and the Lords Justices of Appeal. The Cabinet might thinkit inappropriate that the head of the Judiciary should receive a smaller net remuneration than the holders of these other judicialoffices. They might even think that such a disparity might on some future occasion prevent an individual from accepting the offer of appointment as Lord Chancellor.It was the view of the Cabinet that the office of Lord chancellor should be included among those to which the benefits of this bill would apply. The present Lord Chancellor would doubtless wish todiscuss with the Prime Minister what remuneration he should receiveduring the period for which Cabinet Ministers had voluntarily agreedto draw less than their statutory salary.(b) The Bill should be introduced as soon as the parliamentary time-table allowed. Before its introduction, however, the PrimeMinister would discuss its terms with the Leaders of the opposition parties in the House of Commons.(c) The introduction of this Bill was likely to provoke pressure for an increase in the salaries of Members of the House of Commons.The Cabinet agreed, however, that any such pressure must be resisted.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the proposals in C. (52) 416 for improving the remuneration of Judges of the High Court, and approved the terms of the draft Bill annexed to that memorandumsubject to the omission of the words &quot; other than LordChancellor&quot; in Clause 1 (1) (b) of the draft.(2) Took note that before the introduction of the Bill the PrimeMinister would discuss its proposals with the Leaders ofthe Opposition Parties in the House of Commons.(3) Subject to Conclusion (2) above, invited the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer to arrange, in consultation with the lord privy Seal, for the early introduction of the Bill in theHouse of Commons.
United states forces in the united kingdom.Provision ofMarriedQuarters.6. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Air (C. (52) 415 andC. (52) 422) on the provision of married quarters for the United StatesArmed Forces in the United Kingdom.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he thought it desirablethat some further provision should be made for married quarters for members of the United States Armed Forces stationed in theUnited Kingdom. He had contemplated that 5,000 pre-fabricatedtimber houses might be erected by private companies who wouldmake their own arrangements for finance and would receive aguarantee for rents for at least five years. A scheme on these lines would bring in about $6 millions a year by way of rent and an addi-tional $10 millions a year as a result of the extra expenditure whichwould be incurred by the families living in these- houses. he recognised, however, that there would be considerable difficulty aboutselecting sites and he was prepared to agree that in the first place theSecretary of State for Air should arrange for this to be examined indetail in consultation with the other Departments concerned.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The scheme proposed by the Chancellor of the exchequer was profitable, would make use of pre-fabricated houses which wereavailable for sale, and would not interfere with the housing pro-gramme. It was, however, desirable that sites should be selectedwhich would not entail the provision of additional water and sewerage schemes. -(b) The Secretary of State for Air said that he feared that thecreation of American communities with their higher standard ofliving might cause criticism and discontent among English com-munities in their neighbourhood. The additional married quartersshould therefore be established to the greatest possible extent withinthe confines of United States airfields or, failing that, on land owned or held on requisition by the Air Ministry. He hoped that no furthercommitment would be entered into until the sites had been selected.The Prime Minister said that the presence of United states forces in the United Kingdom was an essential feature in the coldargument in favour of an early decision the Lord Chancellor saidthat he was being pressed to state in the House of Lords whether itwas the Governments intention to provide compensation for thepart-time Clerks.On the other side The Chancellor of the Exchequer argued that,if this course were taken, the Government would be pressed to extend to part-time officers the compensation under other post-war Actswhich had hitherto been limited to full-time officers. The Ministerof Housing and Local Government said that the Cabinet need notfear that this pressure would be irresistible: it should not be impos-sible to find a basis for distinguishing the part-time Clerks to Justicesfrom the part-time officials displaced in consequence of those otherActs.The Prime Minister suggested that a decision on this question might be deferred for a further period.The Cabinet Deferred consideration of the proposal in C. (52) 231, butauthorised the Lord Chancellor to state meanwhile that no decision had been taken to withhold compensation frompart-time Clerks to Justices who would be displaced by there organisation to be carried out in 1953 under the justices of the Peace Act, 1949.
&quot;7 *&quot;iTelevision 7.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Postmaster-Development.   General (C. (52) 420) and the Secretary of State for Scotland(C. (52) 421) on the provision of further television transmitters.The Postmaster-General said that, with the concurrence of theChancellor of the Exchequer, he had already authorised the openingof temporary television stations in North-East England and in belfast at a cost to the British Broadcasting Corporation of approxi-mately  60,000. There was now pressure to extend the service toAberdeen, Isle of Wight and Plymouth. The cost of these extensionswould probably reach a figure of  200,000 and it was open to questionwhether it was justifiable in present circumstances to devote so muchof the country&apos;s economic resources to this purpose. If theseextensions were approved, pressure would then develop for extensions to the Channel Islands, the Eastern Counties and other parts of theUnited Kingdom. Television was now available to 84 per cent, ofthe population in England, 80 per cent, in Scotland, 80 per cent, in wales and 40 per cent, in Northern Ireland.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this was not atime at which we should make any avoidable diversion of economic resources to non-productive projects. He considered that thereshould be a standstill in the provision of further television servicesuntil the country was in a position to afford such luxuries.(b) The Secretary of State for Scotland urged the particularslaims of Aberdeen and pointed out that private operators had in-formed the Aberdeen Town Council that they were prepared tosupply the necessary equipment and to organise a service if theB.B.C. would not, though they would have to obtain a licence forthe purpose from the Postmaster-General.   Against this it was. argued that, even if the Postmaster-General granted a licence, therewould still be the same wasteful use of resources. Moreover, one ofthe main objections to the extension of the service was the increased demand for television sets which would inevitably result.The Cabinet-Agreed that no decision to extend the television service tofurther areas of the United Kingdom should be taken for six months.war and it was possible to defend on this ground the provision o^reasonable amenities for the United States Forces. The first step should be the selection of sites on the lines suggested by the Secretaryof State for Air. Continuous effort should be made to preservefriendly relations between the United States Forces in this countryand their English neighbours and he would be glad to hear from theSecretary of State for Air what was being done for this purpose.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that help should be given in the provisionof married quarters for the United States Armed Forcesin the United Kingdom on the general lines suggested bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer.(2) As a first step invited the Secretary of State for Air toarrange for an interdepartmental committee of officials,representing the Departments affected, to carry out a selection of the sites on the basis indicated in the cabinets discussion.(3) Took note that the Secretary of State for Air would reportto the Prime Minister what arrangements were being madeto foster good relations between the United States armed forces in the United Kingdom and their English neigh-bours.
&quot; Z &quot; and &quot; G &quot; 9. The Secretary of State for War said that with the agreementClass of the Minister of Defence he was not proposing to call-up &quot; Z &quot;Reservists.       Reservists for training in 1953.  Now that the Territorial Army wasfilling up with men who had completed their National Service but were still subject to their reserve liability, it was less necessary to -call-up &quot; Z &quot; Reservists for training.   These men would, however,remain available for call-up in emergency.The Secretary of State for Air confirmed that he did not wishto call up &quot; G &quot; Reservists in 1953.The Cabinet Took note with approval that the Secretary of State for Warand the Secretary of State for Air did not propose to callup their &quot; Z &quot; and &quot; G &quot; Class Reservists in 1953.Korea. 10.   The Secretary of State for War said that on the advice of daily Mirror the Security Service he had refused to accredit the Daily Mirror war war correspondent for Korea.  The Editor of the Daily Mirror wished toCorrespondent, know the reason for this decision. It could be stated, without corn-promising secret sources, that the man,selected by the Daily Mirrorfor this duty had Communist associations. The Secretary of State saidthat he was disposed to give this explanation to the Editor.After discussion, the Cabinet Authorised the Secretary of State for War to inform the editor of the Daily Mirror that the person nominated ashis war correspondent in Korea could not be accreditedas such because it was known that he had Communistassociations.AlanNunn 11.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeMay. Secretary (C. (52) 419) regarding the release of Alan Nunn May fromthe sentence which he was serving for an offence under the official secrets Act.The Home Secretary said that May had been sentenced in 1946to ten years&apos; imprisonment: he was entitled under the Prison Rulesto earn remission by good conduct and industry and, if he continuedto behave well, he would be due for discharge on 29th December.It had been suggested that his release would give rise to public anxietyin this country and unfavourable comment in the United States, andthat on this account he should be held in custody for the full periodof ten years. This would be a most unusual course which, in his view, could be justified only on over-riding grounds of public security.He had therefore asked the Security Service whether they regardedMay as a potential source of danger to the State. It was their viewthat, if he were enabled to earn an honest living, he was unlikely to repeat his offence. It thus appeared that there were no over-ridingsecurity considerations which would warrant depriving May of there mission of sentence which he had earned by his good conduct andindustry in prison.general Post 8.   The Prime Minister asked whether the Post Office wereOffice. employing larger numbers of coloured workers.   If so, there wasEmployment of some risk that difficult social problems would be created.ColouredWorkers. The Cabinet Invited the Postmaster-General to report on the employmentof coloured workers by the General Post Office.
Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,25th November, 1952.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Judge, in passing sentence on May, would have had itin mind that by good conduct and industry he would be able to earnremission by one-third of his sentence. He must therefore have considered that May would have expiated his offence by spending6^- years in prison.(b) Would any company or person be willing to offer1 employ-ment to a man who had committed this act of treachery against theState? There could be no question of giving him any employmentin Government service. Nor should he be employed by any firmengaged on defence production. It was thought, however, that somescientists would befriend him, and that he could expect to find some form of employment in this country.(c) His knowledge of atomic energy development was now outof date, and so long as he obtained no further employment on work ofthis kind, he was unlikely to be able to give any valuable information to a potential enemy. On the other hand, if after his release fromprison he made his way to the Soviet Union, there would undoubtedly be a public outcry which would seriously impair the prospects of closer Anglo-American co-operation on atomic energy development.It was the general view of the Cabinet that, before May wasreleased, further consideration should be given to the possibility of ensuring that he would not be able to leave this country, at any rateuntil the end of the full period of ten years from his conviction in1946. Even if it were not practicable to devise methods which would ensure with certainty that he could not leave this country during thatperiod, the Government should at least be satisfied, before he wasreleased from prison, that there were reasonable grounds for believing that he would not do so. From this point of view it would be relevant to know whether he had a home and family in this country to returnto and what prospects he had of finding reasonable employment here.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary to consider, and report to them at a later meeting, whether arrangements could be madeto give a reasonable assurance that Alan Nunn May, if he were released from prison, would not leave this country,at any rate until the expiration of the full term of ten years from the date of his conviction in 1946.
