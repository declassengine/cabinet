Persia.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 78thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Colonial Secretary said that the Government of Kenyawould shortly be introducing drastic legislation for the preservation of law and order. He thought therefore that it would be helpful tothat Government if he could at an early date announce, as a more positive measure of improvement, the appointment of a proposedRoyal Commission on land tenure in the Colony, even though a chairman had not yet been appointed.The Cabinet Authorised the Colonial Secretary to announce, at such time as he thought fit, the appointment of a Royal Commissionon land tenure in Kenya.2. The Committee had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (C. (52) 295) reporting thepresent position of the Anglo-Persian oil dispute and proposing thatthe Persian Government should be informed that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment were not prepared to accept Dr. Musaddiq&apos;s most recentconditions for arbitration on compensation by The Hague Court.The Foreign Secretary said that we had already made a reason-able offer to Persia and that we should stand by this. It could not beassumed however that the Americans would continue to stand by us.Should the Americans retreat, it would be necessary for us to devise a&apos;new line of action. In that event, he had it in mind to suggest thatsome suitable person should be appointed to act as a conciliator, ashad been done in the case of the Kashmir dispute. This wouldprobably be the least objectionable course in the circumstances, if theright person could be found for this task. He did not, however, wishto reach any conclusion on this point at the present stage.In discussion the following points were made: -(a) It was suggested that we might perhaps accept some corn-promise between, on the one hand, Dr. Musaddiq&apos;s unwillingness torecognise the 1933 Concession and, on the other hand, the UnitedKingdom view that this Concession remained valid and that thereforeany computation of its value must be based on the profits to beexpected during the whole of its remaining term. It was argued that,looked at realistically, the value of any such concession must vary according to the reliability and honesty of the Government which hadgranted it. On the other side, it was argued that to abandon theclaim for compensation based on the full remaining term of the Con-cession would be very dangerous and might well lead to similardisputes with Iraq and elsewhere.(b) The main object of stopping exports to Persia had been to save dollars, and sterling orders could be fulfilled, though with some measure of delay.&apos;       . ....;&apos;:;V;The Cabinet reached the following conclusions:(1) Her Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires in Tehran should be instructed to inform Dr. Musaddiq that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment were not prepared to accept his conditions and that responsibility for the consequences of rejecting the Truman-Churchill proposals would lie with Persia.(2) The United States Government should be informed that wecould not modify these proposals and that we earnestlyhoped that they too would stand by them.-   (3) No Official statement should be made in explanation of theproposals.
1ConditionalAid.3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C. (52) 294) setting out the sum which might beexpected as the United Kingdom share of Conditional Aid under theUnited States Mutual Security Act, 1952, and the conditions attachedto such aid.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the United kingdom had the chance of receiving United States aid to the amount ofabout $14 million, if the conditions attached to this could be accepted.He thought that the money could usefully be spent on projects suchas those outlined in Annex A to the paper, and that the conditions should be accepted. He was not sure if the proposed use of themoney would satisfy the terms of the Act, but it was not possible forHer Majesty&apos;s Government to go any further towards fulfilling the anti-monopoly conditions and he would make this clear in discussions with the United States authorities.In discussion some distaste was expressed at the idea of accepting the American conditions, but it was generally felt that a bid for thisaid should be made on the terms proposed. We should, however,resist any attempt to impose a joint Anglo-American supervision ofthe spending of such aid as might be granted.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to put in a bid for additional aid under the United States Mutual Security Act,1952, on the general lines indicated in Annex A to C. (52)294.japanese assets in the united kingdom.(previous reference:CC. (52) 76thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Pensions (C. (52) 288) setting out a practical plan for distributingJapanese assets in the United Kingdom, on a per capita basis, amongpersons who had been prisoners of war or civilian internees in japanese hands.The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Pensions, said that themethod proposed was thought to be entirely practicable adminis-tratively and would not require any large additional staff.In discussion, it was recalled that the alternative course was to hand over the money available to various benevolent organisations for distribution over a period of time to all prisoners of war on a hardshiptest. There was, however, no strong case for this; the formerprisoners themselves hoped for a distribution on a per capita basis,which had precedents both in the United States and in Australia.There was a real distinction between those who had been prisoners ofthe Japanese and those who had been prisoners in Germany; the pro-posed basis of distribution was sensible and would be appreciated bythe public. The sum available for each person under this scheme would be between  17 and  20. It was proposed that, of the civilian internees, only those normally resident in the United Kingdom shouldbe eligible for the grant, but that all merchant seamen would be eligible. There would be no difficulty in checking the claims ofmilitary internees, and the Far Eastern Prisoners-of-War Associationclaimed that they were in touch with 95 per cent, of the former(4) If the Majlis and Senate recommended counter-proposalsbased on the conditions recently put forward by Dr.Musaddiq, Her Majesty&apos;s Government should at oncemake it known that they could not regard such suggestions as counter-proposals and could not consider them.(5) Sterling exports to Persia could continue at a measured rate.
East-west trade.PriorCommitments.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 75thConclusions,Minute 5.)defence programme.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 74thConclusions, .Minute 7.)Sale ofEquipment5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theForeign Secretary and the President of the Board of Trade (C. (52)297) recommending that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should take theirstand on the principle that the United Kingdom would be prepared togrant export licences to the Soviet Bloc for(i) prior commitments where the goods concerned were on the embargo list but not of overriding strategic importance;(ii) machine tools not on the embargo list.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Since Craven Brothers had now decided to regard their Polish and Russian contracts for machine tools as in abeyance, it was verymuch easier to accept the principle that export licences would begranted for machine tools not on the embargo list. The outstandingorders for machine tools which had already been accepted were only four in number to a total value of  33,000.(b) The fact that prior commitments to the value of $6 millionshad already been cancelled, because they were of overriding strategic importance, was evidence of the Governments intention to deal effectively with this problem.The Cabinet Approved the recommendation by the Foreign Secretary andthe President of the Board of Trade that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment should stand on the principle that the UnitedKingdom would be prepared to grant export licences to theSoviet Bloc for: (i) prior commitments where the goodsconcerned were on the embargo list but not of overridingstrategic importance; and (ii) machine tools not on the embargo list.6. The Minister of Supply said that he was concerned to see that action had been suspended on the telegram (No. 3334 Saving to Paris)instructing Her Majesty&apos;s Representatives in various posts abroad todraw attention to the increased opportunities for the purchase ofcertain types of United Kingdom defence equipment. He had under-stood that it was accepted policy that the sale of equipment surplus to our immediate needs should be pressed forward in order to makea valuable contribution to the balance of payments difficulties and tohelp us to maintain a substantial war potential.prisoners of the Japanese. It was intended that the dependants ofthose who had died while actually in Japanese hands should be eligiblefor the grant, but not the dependants of those *-ho had died since.The Cabinet agreed (1) That the available Japanese assets should be divided on thelines proposed in C. (52) 288, undei the responsibility ofthe Minister of Pensions.(2) That applications from merchant seamen should be dealt withby ihe Ministry of Pensions with the assistance of theMinistry of Transport, and applications from civilian internees by the Ministry of Pensions with the assistanceof the Foreign Office.(3) That the details of the scheme should be worked out by theMinistry of Pensions, in consultation with the ForeignOffice, Ministry of Defence, Wr.r Office and Ministry ofTransport, and that a public announcement should bemade by the Minister of Pensions ?&quot; soon as this had beendone.
In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The view was expressed that, while the export of arms offeredimmediate opportunities for improving the balance of payments, itcould not be regarded as a satisfactory substitute for the long-termexpansion of other engineering exports and, if there were surplus capacity in the armament industry, it would be better from a long-termpoint of view to switch this to other engineering production.(b) It was argued, on the other hand, that the export of armsoffered certain advantages over the export of other engineering products. The export of ships and other engineering productsenabled foreign countries to enter into competition with the UnitedKingdom; this could not be said of the export of arms.The Foreign Secretary suggested that the long-term problems ofthe right balance between the export of arms and other engineering products should be examined by the President of the Board of Tradeand other Ministers concerned. The immediate issue was the formof instructions which should be sent to Her Majesty&apos;s Representativesabroad about the sale of defence equipment to ease the balance ofpayments situation in the near future. He suggested that he and theMinister of Defence and the Minister of Supply should re-examinethe terms of the telegram so that it could be despatched before13th September. He agreed that it was not necessary to send the telegram to N.A.T.O. countries, Yugoslavia and Burma and he wouldreconsider which countries in South America should be approached.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary, the Minister of Defence andthe Minister of Supply to redraft the telegram of instruc-tions on the sale of defence equipment (No. 3334 saving to Paris) in the light of the discussion and to arrange forits despatch before 13th September.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to consider, inconsultation with other Ministers concerned, the problemof the right balance of exports between defence equipment and other engineering products, and to report to theCabinet.legislative programme,1952/3 Session.(previous reference:CC. (52) 75thConclusions,Minute 2.)7. The Cabinet resumed consideration of a memorandum bythe Lord Privy Seal (C. (52) 261) submitting a provisional legislative programme for the 1952-53 Session. They also had before them the following memoranda: -C. (52) 293 : by the Minister of Supply on the time-table forthe Iron and Steel Bill;C. (52) 277: by the Home Secretary on the Leasehold&apos;   Reform Bill;C. (52) 289: by the Secretary of State for Scotland On LongLeases in Scotland;C. (52) 280: by the President of the Board of Trade on the monopolies and Restrictive Practices Bill.The Minister of Defence said that the wording of the instructions^?needed careful thought. It was important to avoid giving theimpression that the United Kingdom were relaxing their defenceefforts and simply maintaining an armament industry for export. Inhis view it was not necessary to tell countries like Burma and Yugo-slavia that equipment was available for sale since, they were alreadyassiduously demanding it. Members of the North Atlantic treaty organisation (N.A.T.O.) also were well aware of the possibilities.
&apos;C(52)79th Cones.Minute S109 C.C. 79 (52)Discussion turned mainly on the time-table for the Iron andSteel Bill and on the anxieties expressed by the Minister of Supplylest this Bill should not receive the Royal Assent much before the summer recess in 1953. It was pointed out that, although it had beenagreed that the Transport Bill should take precedence in time, theprogramme still allowed for the Iron and Steel Bill to go to *he Houseof Lords on 12th March and to receive the Royal Assent towards theend of April or the beginning of May. There was no alteration tothis programme.In discussion the following additional points were made:  -(a) It was most important that, when the Leasehold Reform Actfor England and Wales and the corresponding measure for scotland were extended, the standstill Bills affecting this should be accompaniedby permanent proposals.(b) Although the inclusion in the Programme of the monopolies and Restrictive Practices Bill was not so urgent, the Government had given a pledge in the late King&apos;s Speech to introduce it, and failure to do so would lead to criticism and comment. It might be possibleto introduce this Bill in the first place in the House of Lords before christmas.(c) The Minister of Housing and Local Government suggestedthat the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947, and the rent restrictions Acts might be dealt with in the coming session by bringing forward two short Bills on which the main points of principle couldbe argued, and leaving consideration of the detailed amending Billsuntil a later Session. Even if there were room in the legislative programme, it was doubtful if major Bills on these two subjects couldbe prepared in time. It was, however, essential that if any action wereto be taken on either problem, and especially on the Rent RestrictionsActs, it should be taken in the near future, and not left to a late stage in the life of the present Parliament.(d) It was now clear that the Public Works Loans Bill would haveto be renewed during the next Session and this would involve a furtherdemand on Parliamentary time.(e) It was agreed that all Bills to be introduced into the Legis-lative Programme for the coming Session should be prepared in draftas early as possible. The Bill to amend the Town and country planning Act could be prepared on the alternative assumptions of(i) no development charge; (ii) a reduction in the development charge.(/) The Minister of Transport said that he would in the following week be considering, with the other Ministers concerned, certaindifficult points about the Transport Bill, and would then report tothe Cabinet.115The Foreign Secretary said that no final decisions could be taken on the Legislative Programme for the next Session until the PrimeMinisters return. In the meantime, however, the Minister of Supplymight rest assured that it was still expected that the Legislative Pro-gramme would allow for the Iron and Steel Bill to receive the royal assent by the end of April or the beginning of May. All ministers who wished to promote Bills in the next Session should prepare themin draft as early as possible.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume consideration of the Legislative Pro-gramme on the Prime Ministers return.
nationalised industries.(previous reference:CC. (52) 40thConclusions,Minute 2.)Pensions for full-time members of boards.8.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the*Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Power(C. (52) 279) pointing out the difficulties that had arisen with regardto the granting of pensions to full-time members of the boards of nationalised industries.The Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and power said that a confused situation had arisen with regard to pension rights for full-time members of the boards of nationalised industries.If the right type of man was to be attracted to this form of service,it would be necessary to grant him pension rights, provided that hehad given a minimum of ten years&apos; services. It would be difficult inpresent circumstances to introduce any sort of uniform conditions and he therefore hoped that the Cabinet would agree in principle that service on these boards should be pensionable, but that the proposals in each case should be worked out and dealt with by the issue of a ministerial determination with Treasury approval, as provided for inthe relevant sections of the Nationalisation Acts.While it was recognised that it was difficult to regularise thepresent position by uniformity of practice, some misgiving was expressed at the thought of agreeing in principle to the granting ofpensions without any clear idea of the method by which this principle would be applied. The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to circulate a report to the Cabinet explaining what the application ofthe principle would mean in practice.The Cabinet-Agreed in principle that pensions should be paid to full-time members of the boards of nationalised industries, subject totheir being satisfied about the conditions and methods by&quot;which this principle would be applied.; and invited theChancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and power, to prepare a report for the Cabinet.Cabinet Office, S.W. T, .12th September, 1952.
