The Prime Minister welcomed the Minister of Defence onhis return from Korea and expressed the Cabinefs congratulationson the success with which he and the Minister of State had conductedtheir mission. He suggested that the two Ministers should make afull report to the Cabinet on 30th June.The Cabinet briefly reviewed the discussion which had takenplace in the House of Commons on the previous day about the bombing attacks on power stations on the Yalu River. The foreign secretary said that, while he would continue to support the actionof the United States Government in authorising the United NationsCommander to make this attack, he proposed to make it clear in private conversation with the United States Secretary of State thatthe United Kingdom Government thought they ought to have been consulted in advance and would expect to be so consulted on any future similar occasion. The Prime Minister agreed that this wouldbe justified, but stressed the importance of avoiding any public statement which might be taken to imply that there was any divergence of view on this matter between the Governments of the UnitedKingdom and the United States.2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The proposed debate on the cost of living would be held on30th June. The Government spokesmen would be the Minister ofFood and the Financial Secretary, Treasury. The Chief Whip would arrange for back-bench supporters of the Government to take this opportunity of emphasising the extent to which responsibility for thecountry&apos;s current economic difficulties rested with the previous government.On 1st July the Minister of State would make a statement onthe mission which the Minister of Defence and he had made toKorea. (This would be in similar terms to the statement which theMinister of Defence would himself be making that afternoon inthe House of Lords.) There would follow a debate on the Far East,in which the Foreign Secretary, and possibly the Prime Minister,would speak on the Governmenfs behalf.3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer reported to the Cabinetthe course of the discussions in the Select Committee on the civil list. The Committee was expected to complete its work that afternoon. Its report would be presented during the following week,and debated in the week beginning 7th July. He had been able to adjust his original proposals so as to meet all the reasonablesuggestions put forward by Labour members of the Select Committee,and it should be possible to avoid any controversial discussion whenthe report came before the House of Commons.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Health (C. (52) 206) covering the report of the Committee whichhad investigated the security arrangements at Broadmoor. In this the Minister proposed that the report should be presented&quot; toParliament forthwith and that he should make a statement in theterms set- out in the Appendix to his memorandum, announcing thatthe Government accepted in principle the recommendations made in; the report and would proceed to put them into effect without delay.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that one of the recom-mendations in the report was that the pay and conditions of thenursing staff at Broadmoor should be better than those generallyapplicable&quot; in other institutions under the National Health Service.
The Treasury had not been consulted on this and he could not therefore agree that the Minister of Health should immediatelyannounce that the Government accepted in principle all the* recommendations in the report. Some reservation must be made about this particular recommendation and he would propose asuitable form of words which the Minister might use.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the report of the Broadmoor Inquiry Committeeshould be presented to Parliament as a White Paper on30th June.(2) Invited the Minister of Health to settle with the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Minister of Labour what shouldbe said in any public statement on the recommendations- in paragraphs 20-23 of the report about the pay and con-ditions of the nursing staff at Broadmoor.(3) Authorised the Minister of Health to announce, when pre-senting the report, that the Government accepted itsremaining recommendations and would proceed to put them into effect without delay,national health Service.remuneration of Doctors.(previous reference:CC. (52) 33rdConclusions,Minute 8.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (52) 190) on the award made byMr. Justice Danckwerts in his arbitration on the remuneration ofgeneral practitioners in the National Health Service.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the gross total to beprovided under this award in the current financial year was  37million. He had considered whether this could be spread over aperiod of years, but he had come to the conclusion that this wouldnot be practicable. He was, however, anxious, that the governments acceptance of this award should not be taken to imply that the salaries of other professional grades in the public services should be increasedto rates 100 per cent, above those in force in 1939; and he suggestedthat he should take an early opportunity to make a statement to this effect in the terms set out in the Appendix to his memorandum.The Cabinet: (1) Took note of the cost of applying the Danckwerts award inrespect of general practitioners employed in the national health Service.(2) Agreed that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should have discretion to make a statement, on the lines indicated inthe Appendix to C. (52) 190, making it clear that by applying this award the Government had not accepted theprinciple that the proper standard of remuneration ofother professional classes was a rate 100 per cent, above that in force in 1939.Road and RailTransportDraft transport bill.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 49thConclusions,Minute 8.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secre-tary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Power(C. (52) 204) covering a draft of the Transport Bill; and a memo -randum by the Secretary of State for Scotland (C. (52) 205) recom-mending that provision should be made in the Bill for the appoint-ment of a Scottish Committee to assist the Transport Commission in scottish matters.
The main points raised in the Cabinefs discussion were thefollowing:  (a) Ministers Powers of DirectionUnder section 4 (1) of the Transport Act, 1947, the Minister ofTransport was empowered to give to the British Transport Corn-mission &quot; directions of a general character as to the exercise and per-formance by the Commission of their functions in relation to matters which appear to him to affect the national interest.&quot; Clause 22 (3)of the draft Bill substituted for this a power to give &quot; all such directions as to the exercise and performance by the Commission oftheir functions as the Minister may think proper in relation to any matter which in his opinion is of sufficient general public importanceto warrant his intervention.&quot; This change was designed to make itclear beyond doubt that the Minister had power to intervene inmatters which, although local or particular, raised issues which he considered to be of general public importance.In favour of this change it was argued that any element of doubt on this question should be resolved in favour of giving more power to ministers, who were responsible to Parliament, and limiting theindependence of the public corporations, who were not so responsible.The provisions of the existing law had not enabled the Minister ofTransport to exercise sufficient influence over the British transport commission in matters which, though local or particular, were ofnational importance. The fact that section 4 (1) of the Act of 1947made the Minister the judge of what affected the national interest andtherefore justified his intervention did not provide a sufficient safe-guard, since the Minister was only empowered by the section to give&quot; directions of a general character,&quot; and this phrase was open tointerpretation by the Courts.Against making the change it was argued that it would be inexpedient, on the basis of circumstances peculiar to the pastrelations between the Ministry of Transport and the British transport commission, to confer on the Minister increased powers of interven-tion which would stimulate pressure, not only for. undesirableinterference by that Minister in detailed matters (e.g., appointments),but for corresponding modifications in the Acts relating to other nationalised industries. It would be specially inopportune to proposethis change at a time when the general question of the relation ofthese corporations to Parliament was under consideration by a SelectCommittee. The change might also be criticised as casting doubt onthe propriety of the Governments recent intervention in regard tofares.The Minister of Transport said that, as under Clause 22 (4) ofthe draft Bill the Chairman of the British Transport commission would in future be required to keep the Minister at all timesadequately informed of the activities and intentions of the Cornmis-sion, he would himself be content to rely on the powers of directionavailable under the existing law.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Bill as introduced should not include any provision modifying the powers of direction undersection 4(1) of the Transport Act, 1947; but that thepossibility of proposing some modification of those powers during the passage of the Bill through parliament should be open to review by the Cabinet, in the light of views expressed in the debates and of any recommenda-tions made by the Select Committee.(b) Charges SchemesSome disquiet was expressed at the terms of Clause 19 (2) (d) ofthe draft Bill, which required any charges schemes to &quot; provide for preventing the making by the Commission of unduly low charges.&quot;
The Cabinet were informed that this provision had been included with a view to preventing the railways from using their great financial resources to kill competition in particular localities by deliberateundercutting.It was suggested that this danger might be avoided withoutappearing to prevent the fullest possible reduction of charges, ifprovision were made for appeal to the Transport Tribunal by any undertaking which considered that the railways were deliberatelytrying to put it out of business by uneconomic undercutting.(c) The Workers&apos; CharterIt was explained that it had not been considered practicable ornecessary to include in the draft Bill provisions on&quot; the lines of clause 3 (e) and (/) of the Iron and Steel Bill on account of thenumber of small undertakings which were likely to supplant theRoad Haulage Executive.The Minister of Labour said that in any event the Workers&apos;Charter was more suitable for embodiment in a code of practice thanin statutes.(d) Redundancy and CompensationThe Minister of Labour said that the main target for trade unioncriticism would be the redundancy resulting from the disbandment of the Road Haulage Executive. This would, of course, be an inevitable consequence of the Bill.Attention was drawn to Clause 25, which provided for the pay-ment of compensation to those displaced.(e) Time-tableThe Minister of Transport said that it was now clear that hecould not adhere to the time-table laid down by the Cabinet on15th May. He should be able, however, to present the Bill on 9th July with a view to publication on 10th July. This would giveMembers more than a fortnight to study the Bill before the SecondReading on 28th July.The Cabinet *(2) Agreed that the Transport Bill should not be presented until some time in the week beginning 7th July.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Trans-port, Fuel and Power:  (i) to arrange for the Committee on Transport policy to consider outstanding points on. the draft Bill,including the proposal made by the Secretary ofState for Scotland in C. (52) 205;(ii) to submit a final draft of the Bill for the Cabinefsconsideration in the following week.defence programme.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 27thConclusions,Minute 4.)Sale of aircraft.7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (52) 214) regarding a suggestion that the United StatesGovernment might pay for the manufacture of aircraft in this countryfor delivery to forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation(N.A.T.O.).The Foreign Secretary said that the United States Governmenthad recently offered to finance the manufacture in Europe of a specified number of aircraft for N.A.T.O. forces. The ministers concerned, after discussion with the Prime Minister, had agreed thatan attempt should be made to secure that a substantial proportion ofthese orders should be placed in the United Kingdom;  and
preliminary overtures had already been made to this end in discus-sions in N.A.T.O. Our offer to manufacture these aircraft for delivery to N.A.T.O. countries was in fact dependent upon modifica-tions in our aircraft production programme which were now underconsideration; and in the discussions in Paris representatives of otherN.A.T.O. countries had already deduced that the United Kingdomno longer intended to make available to R.A.F. units operating insupport of N.A.T.O. the full number of these types of aircraft towhich they were committed under earlier agreements. The foreign secretary said that in his view the time had now come When weshould make it clear to the United States Government that, unless they financed the manufacture of these aircraft under their plan, theaircraft would not be produced in this country at all. It should be explained to the Americans that we were now able to make these aircraft available for N.A.T.O. countries partly because of modifica-tions in our aircraft production programme and partly because of the review of our defence production programme generally which wewere being forced to undertake by reason of our adverse balance ofpayments. We should at the same time make the point that these particular aircraft could be produced more quickly and more cheaplyin this country than in any other European country. In the further discussions with representatives of other N.A.T.O. countries in Pariswe should try to avoid, so far as possible, detailed explanation of thereasons why we were now able to make these aircraft available for members of the Organisation. It should suffice to say that the effectof the changes in our aircraft production programme would be made clear in the annual review which would shortly be undertaken byN.A.T.O.The Minister of Supply and The Secretary of State for Airsupported the proposals put forward by the Foreign Secretary.The Cabinet-(1) Endorsed the action already taken, as described in C. (52) 214,to secure for the United Kingdom a substantial share ofthe orders to be financed by the United States Govern-ment for the production in Europe of aircraft for delivery to N.A.T.O. forces.(2) Agreed that the basis of our offer should be explained to theUnited States Government, and defended in N.A.T.O.,on the lines suggested by the Foreign Secretary in para-graph 6 of C. (52) 214; and invited the Foreign Secretaryto send instructions accordingly to Her Majesty&apos;ambassador in Washington and to the United kingdom representative on the North Atlantic Council.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,26th June, 1952.
