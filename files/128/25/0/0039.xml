^Parliament.Business in theHouse ofCommons.corporal punishment.(previous reference:CC. (52) 65thConclusions,Minute 1.)The AccessionDeclaration.(previous reference:CC. (52) 85thConclusions,Minute 9.)2. The Prime Minister drew attention to the strength of theviews expressed in the debate in the House of Lords on the previous day in favour of restoring corporal punishment as a penalty for crimesof violence. He thought it would be unwise for the Government to close their minds to the possibility of restoring this penalty if the case for doing so were fully established and public opinion hardened infavour of it. There had been a great increase in crime and the prisonswere overcrowded: the problem of prison administration would be eased if, through having discretion to impose corporal punishment,the courts sentenced fewer offenders to long terms of imprisonment.The Lord Chancellor said that, since corporal punishment wasabolished in 1948, the incidence of offences for which it could then be imposed had in fact decreased. The demand voiced in the House ofLords debate that it should be available as a penalty for all crimes of violence involved reverting not merely to 1948 but substantially to1827, when felonies were punishable by death and misdemeanours bywhipping. In reply to the debate he had taken the line that, beforecorporal punishment was restored, the Act of 1948 should be given a longer trial and Parliament should be satisfied first that corporal punishment would be an effective means of checking the increase inviolent crime and, secondly, that no other penalty would be equallyeffective.The Prime Minister said that it would be useful if, at some con-venient opportunity, the Cabinet held a fuller discussion on thisquestion.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary to circulate a memorandum which would serve as a basis for a discussion on the questionof corporal punishment as a penalty for crimes of violence.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordChancellor (C. (52) 351) on the.form of the Accession Declaration tobe made by Her Majesty at the opening of Parliament.The Lord Chancellor said that there were two points to consider.In 1937 the words &quot; of my Realm &quot; had been omitted from thedeclaration made by King George VI, on the ground that they did not take account of the independence of the other members of the Com-commonwealth; This variation from the original form of declarationprescribed by the Accession Declaration Act, 1910, could be justifiedin law on the ground that it did no more than take account of theconstitutional change since made by the passing of the Statute of westminster. Should these words be omitted on this occasion?. The second question was whether The Queen should be styled&quot;Elizabeth&quot; or &quot;Elizabeth the Second&quot;? There were precedents for either style.On the first point, the view of the Cabinet was that Her majesty should be advised that, if she so desired, she might follow the customestablished by King George VI and omit the words &quot;of my Realm.&quot;On the second point the Cabinet felt that the style should be deter-mined in accordance with Her Majesty&apos;s wishes.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would advise Her Majestyon the form of her Accession Declaration at the openingof Parliament in accordance with the views expressed in the, discussion. , .43319-2 b21. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week. It was hoped that Par-liament would be prorogued on Thursday, 30th October.
nrfPersia.(previous reference:CC. (52) 82ndConclusions,Minute 5.)Egypt.Supply of jet aircraft.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (52) 349) reporting that the Egyptian Government hadformally asked for the release of 65 jet aircraft which they had orderedfrom British firms in 1.950.The Foreign Secretary said that we had already agreed to supply14 jet aircraft to Israel and. 14 each to Iraq, Syria and the Lebanon.Deliveries to Egypt had been suspended, and if any jet aircraft were now supplied to Egypt suspicion and hostility would be aroused inIsrael. On the other hand, this gesture might help in persuading thenew Prime Minister of Egypt to adopt a more reasonable andco-operative attitude towards the establishment of a Middle east defence Organisation. There were indications that General Neguibwas himself in favour of closer co-operation with the West, but thathe needed to be able to demonstrate to his supporters that such apolicy was in Egypt&apos;s own interests.  An offer of 15 jet aircraft might4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (52) 354) outlining the further course of action whichmight be pursued in the Persian oil dispute.The Foreign Secretary said that he could not advise the Cabinetto accept the latest proposals made by the Americans for the settle-ment of this dispute. Tney had suggested that, in place of arbitration,compensation should be paid to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company inthe form of a lump sum to be agreed between the Governments ofthe United Kingdom and. Persia and to be paid in oil. The figuresuggested by the Americans was  150 millions or possibly, as amaximum,  250 millions. If these proposals were adopted, not only would the company receive far less compensation than it had expectedto obtain at arbitration, but a dangerous precedent would have been created which might have incalculable effects on our oil concessionsand. other investments elsewhere. He therefore proposed that weshould stand by the joint Anglo-United States proposals made on30th August; but that we should try to make these more attractiveby suggesting to the Americans that, as they were anxious to find some means of giving Persia quick financial aid, they might increase sub-stantially the sum of money which they had offered in the jointproposals. We might at the same time try to intimate discreetly tothe Persian Government that there were limits to the amount ofcompensation we expected to be awarded by The Hague Court, andthat in any event the compensation awarded would probably be payable over a number of years. He was not optimistic about the chances of American agreement to this course of action, and it was more than possible that they would insist upon making payments to persia in ways inconvenient to us. It would, however, give some further time. If the Cabinet so desired, he would explore further thepossibility of a scheme by which the Americans would themselves payan agreed sum for compensation to the Company and in return beleft to make what arrangements they could with the Persian Govern-ment for the production and marketing of Persian oil. Although anarrangement of this kind was financially attractive and would relieve the Company of responsibilities with regard to Persian oil which theyno longer wished to assume, there was perhaps some risk in inviting the Americans to take over any part of our oil interests in the middle east.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the course of action proposed bv the foreign secretary in C. (52) 354.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to explore further the possi-bility of making an arrangement by which the americans would pay an agreed sum of compensation to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and receive in return the right tomake whatever arrangement they could with the PersianGovernment.
The Saar.(previous reference:.C.C. (52) 88thConclusions,Minute 4.)help him to overcome his internal difficulties. He might perhaps be content with fewer and the Foreign Secretary was willing to askHer Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cairo whether an initial offer of 5 jet aircraft and 2 trainers was likely to have any useful effect. Furtheroffers could then be made if Egyptian policy developed in the way-we wished.    :In discussion the following points were made: -^(a) Israel would certainly view with suspicion the release of jet aircraft to Egypt. In fact, however, these aircraft would not be a real danger to Israel; for the Egyptians would not be able to operatethem without the R.A.F. ground services in the Canal Zone and their use would be largely within our control.(b) An offer of additional jet aircraft could be made to Israel if she were in a position to pay for them. We could try to find meansof supplying more aircraft to Israel on generous terms and we couldcertainly undertake to train more Israeli pilots in the UnitedKingdom.(c) In present circumstances it was in the best interests of theR.A.F. that these obsolescent types of jet aircraft should be sold to suitable overseas customers. The adjustments in the defence programme made it impossible for the R.A.F. to take as many ofthese types as they had expected to take; but their continued produc-tion was essential to the maintenance of the potential of the aircraft industry and to the eventual production of the more modern typeswith which the R.A.F. were to be re-equipped.The Cabinet-   -(1) Agreed in principle that a maximum of 15 Mark 7 andMark 8 Meteor aircraft might be released to Egypt now;but invited the Foreign Secretary to try to limit the offer inthe first instance to 5 Mark 8 Meteors and 2 Mark 7Meteors. :(2) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to assure the israeli government that we should be willing to sell additionaljet aircraft to them, if satisfactory terms could be arranged,and to train additional Israeli pilots in the UnitedKingdom.6. The Foreign Secretary said that he had now heard that theFrench Government had rejected the formula about the Saar whichhe had urged them to accept during his visit to Paris earlier in theweek. He greatly regretted this decision, for it was most unlikelythat the German Federal Government would feel able to make anygreater concession to the French Government. He had at oncepressed the French Government to arrange for the Saar elections tobe postponed, at any rate for a few days, so as to give further time inwhich an accommodation might be found between the French andGerman Governments.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.East/west trade.Exports of rubber.(Previous ;;-Reference:C.C. (52) 80thConclusions,Minute 7.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary and the President of the Board of Trade (C. (52) 322)recommending that in 1953 (i) the present embargo on exports of rubber to,China and North Korea should continue; and (ii) exports from United Kingdom-controlled sources to Russia and her satellitesshould not exceed 80,000 tons and 30,000 tons respectively. .... The Foreign Secretary said that the United States Governmentseemed unlikely to object to these proposals, which represented no increase as compared with 1952.
In discussion it was suggested that exports of rubber to russia should be proportioned to Russian deliveries of coarse grains, ofwhich we had so far obtained only 200,000 tons this;year comparedwith 800,000 tons under the 1951 contract. It was, however, thegeneral view of the Cabinet that it would be undesirable to resort tosuch elementary methods of barter with the Russians since they couldpay in gold for any purchases of rubber in excess of what they couldfinance by their sales of coarse grains and other commodities whichwe obtained from them, and could resort to other sources of supply to the extent that we did not meet their needs.The Parliamentary Undersecretary of State, commonwealth relations Office, said that the Cabinet should be aware that Ceylonwere contemplating supplying China with a substantial amount of rubber annually in return for rice.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals in C. (52) 322.Monopolies and 8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisterRestrictive of Agriculture and Fisheries (C. (52) 348) suggesting that the farmers&apos;Practices. representatives should be given an assurance that producer marketingPosition of boards in agriculture would not be made subject to investigation by agricultural     the Monopolies Commission.Marketing . jne Minister of Agriculture said that progress both with restoringBoards. the powers of the pre-war Boards and with the establishment of certain(Previous       proposed new Boards was at present held up by uncertainty whetherReference:      the Boards would later be made subject to investigation by theC.C. (52) 84th   Monopolies Commission. The Opposition would hardly feel justifiedConclusions,    in criticising their exclusion from the purview of the CommissionMinute 4.) &apos;     since, when they were in office, they had been content to strengthen the pre-war safeguards for the public interest by the agricultural marketing Act, 1949, and had led the farmers to suppose that the boards would not be made subject to the Commission.   further negotiations had recently taken place with the farmers&apos; representatives in order to secure their agreement to the&apos; creation of additional, safe-guards, including the establishment of an independent MarketingCouncil whose operations would be less cumbrous than those of the monopolies Commission.   It had become clear, however, that the farmers&apos; representatives would not be prepared to proceed with the revival of the old or the establishment of new Marketing Boards,unless they received an assurance that the Boards would not later bemade subject to investigation by the Commission.  He hoped, there-fore, that the Cabinet would authorise him to give them such an assurance.The President of the Board of Trade said that the Governmentwere committed by their election manifesto to bring the statutorymonopolies within the purview of the Monopolies Commission. Ifan assurance were now given to the farmers&apos; representatives in the sense suggested by the Minister of Agriculture, the Government wouldbe in great difficulty in giving full effect to their electoral promisesabout monopolies. Agricultural Marketing Boards would have to be specifically excluded from the scope of any legislation extending thework of the Monopolies Commission and it would then be difficult. to include the nationalised industries since they were also subject to. , Ministerial control. Would it not be wiser to take the line that theGovernment could not forecast the provisions of a future MonopoliesBill, which was not in any case included in the programme for theforthcoming session?   &apos;      .v \ &apos;. ... : The general.view of the Cabinet was that it would be expedient to give the farmers a more direct assurance on the lines preferred by,the Minister of Agriculture. ;
The Cabinet-/Authorised the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries to assure the farmers&apos; representatives that the Government didnot expect that it would be necessary to make any furtherchange in the position of producer marketing boards in viewof the powers already exercisable by the agriculture ministers for ensuring that the interests of the consumer weresafeguarded.Tariff Policy.HorticulturalProducts.(previous reference:CC. (52) 84thConclusions,Minute 7.)9. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Presi-dent of the Board of Trade (C. (52) 343) seeking their agreement tothe course of action which he proposed to follow in respect of certainapplications by the National Farmers&apos; Unions for increased importduties on horticultural products.The President of the Board of Trade said that our commitmentsunder the Ottawa Agreements and the General Agreement on tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.) were together preventing us from making, in response to these applications by the Farmers&apos; Unions, certain increases in import duties on horticultural products upon which all departments concerned had agreed. Indeed, the combined effect ofthe &quot;no new preference&quot; rule of the G.A.T.T. and the free-entryundertakings to other Commonwealth countries under the ottawa agreements was virtually to freeze the whole of the United Kingdomtariff. It was our intention to raise this issue at the forthcomingCommonwealth Conference, but in the meantime the Farmers&apos; Unionsmust be given some indication of the Governments attitude towards their applications, which had been lodged as long ago, as 1950. Itwas also desirable to do something to satisfy those government supporters in the House who were interested in Empire preferenceand in horticulture, and were combining to exert pressure on theGovernment. He therefore proposed, with the Cabinefs agreement,to explain our dilemma to the Farmers&apos; Unions and other leadingtrade organisations on the lines set out in Annex B to his raemo-randum and thereafter to make a statement in the House in the same general sense. Subject to the views of the Farmers&apos; Unions and trade organisations, he also proposed to increase the rates of import dutyforthwith on a limited number of items on which, for special reasons,our hands were not tied.In discussion the view was strongly expressed that the Govern-ment should avoid making any public statement on this matterimmediately before the Commonwealth Conference. Other Common-wealth countries were not disposed to be helpful to us on this issue,and a public statement might seriously prejudice our chances ofsecuring their agreement to the course of action we intended to proposeto them. It was also not clear why, having refrained for so long fromexplaining our dilemma, we should choose to do so now when, bywaiting a few weeks longer, we might be able fully to justify not having explained the position earlier. The same objections did not,however, apply to private explanations of our dilemma either to the farmers&apos; Unions and trade organisations or to interested groups of. Government supporters in the House of Commons.The Cabinet recognised that it might not prove possible to avoidmaking some Government statement on this matter during the debate on.the Address, but there was general agreement that, if such a state-ment should prove to be necessary, it should be as brief as possible.In any event, no public statement on this matter should be made onbehalf of the Government without Cabinet authority.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for commonwealth relations said. that the last sentence of the fourth paragraph of annex B to C. (52) 343 was inaccurate, since it ignored a gentlemen&apos;s agreement which existed with Commonwealth Governments wherebyit was open to us to seek their consent to the imposition of duty on
