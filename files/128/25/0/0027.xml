42816Flood Damage        1.   The Minister of Housing and Local Government made aat Lymmoufe.   report to the Cabinet on his visit to Exmoor, where he had inspectedthe havoc caused by the heavy floods of the previous week, particu-larly at Lynmouth.The Min. .er said that at Lynmouth the immediate need wasto build up some protection against the heavy tides which would shortly be experienced; for, if this were not done quickly, much ofthe remainder of the town would be swept into the sea. He was satisfied that this and other emergency work was now adequatelyorganised and co-ordinated. Ample assistance was being given bythe military; and, in addition, he would ensure that all necessarytechnical advice and assistance was afforded by the centralGovernment.The problems of reconstruction fell under two heads. First,there was the relief of individual hardship and compensation for lossof property and chattels. The insurance companies were likely tomeet the bulk of the claims by tradesmen and householders undercomprehensive insurance policies. This would substantially relieve the burden which would otherwise fall upon the relief fund which hadbeen opened by the Lords Lieutenant of Devon and Somerset.Nevertheless there would still be many claims on that fund, both by persons not fully covered by insurance and also in respect of loss and hardship which lay beyond the scope of insurance! Relief wouldbe afforded from the fund, not only to local inhabitants, but also toholiday-makers from other parts of the country. He recommendedthat as a practical demonstration of their sympathy for the individualloss and suffering caused by this disaster, the Government shouldmake a suitable contribution towards this relief fund.Much larger expenditure would, however, be involved in thereconstruction of roads, bridges, houses and local services of all kinds.The local authorities concerned had already made it clear that thesetasks would be far beyond their resources, even though the normalrates of Exchequer grant were taken into account. Here the first need was to make it plain that the central Government would see to it that all necessary work was carried through without delay, irrespective-tive of the final. apportionment of cost between national and localfunds; but it would be helpful if it could be stated at the same time that the Government recognised that something more than theordinary rates of Exchequer grant would be required.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was in broad agree-ment with the statements and recommendations made by the Ministerof Housing and Local Government.The Cabinet (I) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for animmediate Government contribution of  25,000 to thefund opened by the Lords Lieutenant of Devon and- Somerset for the relief of individual loss and sufferingcaused by the recent flood damage in those counties.(2) Authorised the Minister of Housing and Local Government- to announce at a Press conference later, in the day thedecision recorded in Conclusion (1) above, to declare theGovernments intention to play their full part in thenecessary work of reconstruction at Lynmouth and other places where serious flood damage had occurred, and tomake it clear that, while the final apportionment of costbetween national and local funds would be determinedlater, something more than the normal rates of exchequer grant Would be available for this work.
n/Persia.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 76thConclusions,Minute 1).2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisteJIof State (C. (52) 285) reporting a further conversation between her majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires in Teheran and the Persian&apos; PrimeMinister regarding the Anglo-Persian oil dispute. They also had before them a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet (C. (52) 286)covering an exchange of telegrams on this subject between the PrimeMinister and the President of the United States.The Minister of State said that in this latest conversationDr. Mussadiq had made three proposals. First, he had offered thatthe question of compensation should be submitted to arbitration bythe International Court. This offer should certainly be followed up.If it could be agreed that the submission would be sufficiently wideto cover the whole question of compensation for the abrogation ofthe 1933 Concession., we could accept arbitration by the international court. Secondly, he had asked for immediate financial aid from theUnited Kingdom. Although we could relax some of the existing restrictions on our trade with Persia, we were not in a position tomake any financial grant. But the United States would doubtless be willing to provide interim financial aid to Persia; and we needraise no objection to this once we had secured a satisfactory basis for discussing the outstanding issues in the oil dispute. Thirdly,Dr. Mussadiq had asked that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company should discuss ways and means of restarting the flow of oil from Persia; andthe company were willing to open such discussions as soon as an acceptable basis had been found for an arbitration on the question ofcompensation.The Minister of State said that progress could be made on thebasis of Dr. Mussadiq&apos;s latest proposals provided (i) that the arbitra-tion covered the whole question of compensation for the loss of the1933 Concession and (ii) no arrangements were made for future sales of Persian oil which would secure for Persia terms more favourable than those enjoyed by other oil-producing countries in the middle east. These provisos would safeguard two of the three objectives which we had kept in mind from the outset of this dispute. We nolonger had any hope of securing the third of our original objectives,viz., assurances of the efficient management of Persia&apos;s oil industryin the future. The Minister added that, once the question of com-pensation had been submitted to arbitration, we should no longer beable to maintain the interim embargo on current sales of persian oil. It would, however, become increasingly difficult to maintain this embargo in any event; and the company thought it unlikelythat any substantial traffic would be resumed while the arbitrationwas proceeding.The Cabinefs discussion turned mainly on the messages&quot;exchanged between the Prime Minister and President Truman. ThePrime Minister said that, since receiving the Presidents telegram of18th August (C. (52) 286) he had sent him a further message (ForeignOffice telegram to Washington No. 3403 of 20th August) suggesting that they might join in sending a personal message to Dr. Mussadiq.He had also had prepared a draft indicating the lines on which such ajoint message might be framed. This was read to the Cabinet. in discussion there was general agreement that a message on these linesmight be helpful. It would, however, be important to ensure that neither President Truman nor Dr. Mussadiq misunderstood the reference to Persia&apos;s nationalisation of the oil industry. It could bemade plain to the Americans that we no longer sought to challenge,before an international tribunal; the validity of the Persian nationalisa--tion law. But we should be careful to preserve our right at arbitrationto claim compensation for Persia&apos;s unilateral abrogation of the 1933Concession. It was agreed that the opening paragraph of the draft message to Dr. Mussadiq should be so amended as to avoid ambiguityon this point.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the terms of the draft message, as amended in thelight of the discussion.
Japan.jurisdiction over Membersof UnitedKingdomForces.Release ofTwo naval ratings.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (52) 281) reporting the steps which he had taken tosecure a satisfactory jurisdictional status for members of United King-dom forces in Japan.The Minister of State said that, by virtue of their Security Treatvwith Japan, the United States had obtained extra-territorial privilegesfor members of their Forces in Japan. These would lapse in May 1953.The United Kingdom had been unable to secure the same treatment for members of their Forces, but the Foreign Secretary had decidedto make one last effort to achieve it and, if this failed, to negotiate anagreement based on the N.A.T.O. model which would secure for members of United Kingdom Forces immunity from local jurisdictionwhile on duty. It would be made clear to the Japanese that we should only accept this if they released members of our Forces now held in prison and agreed that minor offences should be dealt with by us.The Cabinet (1) Took note with approval of the line of action proposed bythe Foreign Secretary.The Minister of State explained the latest proposal for securingthe release or two naval ratings from H.M.S. Belfast who were nowlying in a Japanese prison. A Japanese citizen would offer bail forthe two sailors, who would then be released and, by agreement withthe Japanese Government, sent out of the country immediately.Arrangements would be made for the repayment of the bail to theprivate individual, possibly by the Japanese Government. any arrangement by which the two sailors, after release on bail, were laterreturned to the Japanese was unacceptable. If the Japanese refusedto accept this proposal, then the two sailors would remain in prisonuntil the determination of their appeal, which might result insuspended sentences. If the sentences were confirmed on appeal, theywould have to wait for release until the conclusion of the generalagreement according N.A.T.O. status to members of United kingdom forces in Japan.The Cabinet (2) Took note of this statement by the Minister of State.Town andCountryPlanningAct, 1947.(previous reference:CC. (52) 75thConclusions,Minute 2).4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Housing and Local Government (C. (52) 282) and the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C. (52) 283) on the amendment of the financial pro-visions of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that thedistribution of the whole sum of  300 millions before 1st July, 1953,in accordance with the terms of the existing Act, would have aninflationary effect and be a heavy charge upon the Exchequer. Heand the Chancellor of the Exchequer therefore agreed that compensa-tion for loss of development rights should only be paid as and whenjustifiable claims arose i.e., when permission to develop was refused,or when land was compulsorily purchased. The issue between them was whether development charge should continue to be levied. in existing circumstances little land was being offered for development and, so long as the charge was continued, it would be very difficultto make any progress with the private building of unsubsidisedhouses. The charge was widely disliked and regarded as a restrictive(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would send this draft to president Truman for his consideration (see Foreign office telegram to Washington No. 3419 of 20th August).
and arbitrary tax;- and he was in favour of abolishing it entirely.Early legislation would be needed in any event. It would be possibleto introduce a short stand-still Bill before 1st July, 1953, but thiswould be politically embarrassing if it were not accompanied by legislation embodying the&apos; Governments long-term intentions.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the abolition ofdevelopment charge would destroy the whole financial basis of theAct and would deprive the Exchequer of a considerable revenue.Moreover, a Conservative Government would be liable to verydamaging political criticism for restoring site values to landlords. Hewould therefore prefer a solution by which the development charge would be retained but reduced to a lower figure, e.g., 60 per cent.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Act was based on the assumption that, when all develop-ment rights had been acquired by the State, land would change handsat its value for existing use. In practice this had not happened. Littleland Was in fact being sold for development; and what little wasbeing sold was commanding a market value higher than the existing use value. The only way to hold the 1947 values would be to insist,that all sales of land, even between private owners, should be negotiated by a system of compulsory purchase. That was undesir-able as a general system. It might, however, be possible in extremecases to prevent exploitation by landlords by applying compulsory purchase for purposes of private development.(b) It would hardly be practicable to retain development chargebut exempt from it all land bought for the building of private houses and small shops, since these represented together about seventy percent, of all development.(c) Although the Conservative Party had in their election manifesto advocated the modification of the development chargerather than its complete abolition, many individual supporters of theGovernment had pledged themselves to its abolition, and it was believed that among Opposition Members also there would be some support for this course.The Prime Minister said that this problem should be further considered by the Ministers principally concerned so that agreedrecommendations might be submitted to the Cabinet. It was prefer-able that any legislation on this subject in the coming Session shouldbe so devised as to make the least possible demands on parliamentary time. It would be helpful if means could be found of deferring majorlegislation on this subject for two or three years.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerof Housing and Local Government to reconsider thequestion of development charge, in consultation with other ministers principally concerned, and to report further to theCabinet.emergency powers.(previous reference:C.C (52) 53rdConclusions,Minute 10).5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C (52) 274) reporting the results of his review of theemergency powers currently in force.The Home Secretary said that it had not proved possible to makemuch progress towards the fulfilment of the pledge, which the Con-servative Party had given at the General Election, that emergency powers should be reduced to. the minimum required for currentpurposes and that these should be incorporated in new statutesrequiring annual renewal. Before the end of the year a few of these powers could be finally abandoned, and a Bill could be introduced to make permanent some miscellaneous provisions which should nowforni part of the statute law. But it was clear that the Government
could not in the near future dispense with the main bulk of the remain-ing emergency powers, on which they relied for their general controlover the national economy; and, in the current congestion of the Legis-lative Programme, there was no practical prospect of converting theseinto new statutes requiring annual renewal. In these circumstances the Government would have no alternative but to ask Parliament inDecember to renew the bulk of the, emergency powers, in theirexisting form, for a further year.The Cabinet- kTook note of the position described in the Home Secretary&apos;sreport (C. (52) 274).6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofDefence (C. (52) 278) proposing a system of tax-free educationalallowances for officers and men in the Armed Forces who were liableto be moved frequently from one place to another, whether at home or abroad. The object of these allowances would be to enable Serviceparents to send their children to boarding schools.The Minister of Defence and The Secretary of State for War saidthat there was greater need for some such system now that so large a proportion of the Army was serving overseas. Officers in the middleranks were finding it increasingly difficult to provide for the education of their children, and many of them were leaving the Services on that account. It was false economy to spend large sums on trainingofficers and then, for the sake of a relatively small additional expen-diture, allow them to leave the Services because, in the middle ranks,they could not afford to provide for their children&apos;s education.The Prime Minister said that Service parents were not alone inthis difficulty: all middle-class parents were finding it increasingly difficult to send their children to boarding schools by reason of thehigh level of taxation. The proposal in C. (52) 278, though it might cost a small amount of money, raised a large question of principle.Was it right that the effects of high taxation should be mitigated, bytax-free allowances, for particular sections of the community whowere paid by the State? Should not the Government aim rather atreducing taxation to a level which would enable people to meet their obligations out of taxed incomes?The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that he could not con-sider in isolation the difficulties which Service parents found in providing boarding education for their children. Members of theColonial Services had similar difficulties, on which he had recentlybeen approached by the Colonial Secretary. And representationshad also been made to him, on behalf of the public schools, regardingthe difficulties of middle-class parents generally. He was disposed to view this problem sympathetically, but he must look at it as awhole. The solution might be found to lie, not in the grant of tax-free allowances to public servants, but rather in some form of income-tax relief in respect of expenditure on children&apos;s education.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would confer with the Minister of Defence and the Colonial secretary on the extent to which any plans which he might be ableto devise for assisting parents to provide boarding educa-tion for their children would meet the special problemsof parents in the Armed Forces and the Colonial Services.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence to arrange for the PrimeMinister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer to be pro-vided with statistical evidence of the extent to whichserving officers in the middle ranks were leaving the armed Forces because they were unable to provide forthe education of their children.
Transport 7.   The Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, FuelCharges. and Power said that the National Union of Mineworkers were urgingConcessions that the local arrangements by which fare-concessions were made toto Miners. miners who had to travel long distances to their work should be embodied in a national agreement. If this were done there would bemuch greater risk of demands for similar treatment for workers inother industries and, if these demands were met, the policy of wagesrestraint would be undermined. He and the Minister of Labourtherefore proposed to resist this pressure from the Miners&apos; Union.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the course of action proposedby the Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport,Fuel and Power and the Minister of Labour.industrial disputes.ElectricalUndertakings.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 76thConclusions,Minute 9).8. The Minister of Labour warned the Cabinet that, owing tothe dispute over the redundancy of meter men in electrical under-takings, the Electrical Trade Union might order a stoppage of workon 23rd August, or a week later, which would affect some power stations.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,21st August, 1952.
