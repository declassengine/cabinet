a ... a town and 2.   After the . Cabinefs meeting on 1st October the PrimeCountry Minister had- invited the Foreign Secretary to discuss with the planning Ministers principally concerned the differences which had arisen overAct, 1947. the proposals for amending the financial provisions of the Town and(Previous Country Planning Act, 194?.   The Cabinet now had before them a reference: memorandum by the Foreign Secretary (C. (52) 325) reporting that,CC. (52) 83rd as a result of those discussions, the only issue outstanding for decisionConclusions, by the Cabinet was whether development charge should be abolishedMinute 3.) altogether or whether it should be reduced by regulation to 50 per... cent.    -   &apos; -           - &quot;  ;-.    - In discussion varying opinions were expressed on this question.In favour of retaining development charge at a reduced rate it;&apos; v/&apos;;&apos;..    was argued that, as the Exchequer was still to pay compensation to owners who were refused permission to develop their land or were.    /   required to sell it to a public authority, it. was reasonable that theExchequer should recover some offsetting revenue from land on which. private development was allowed.  The retention of some develop-&apos; ment charge would also reduce the inequity between one landownerand another, and would make it, easier to justify compensationrestricted to the 1947 development value. If development charge were&apos;    . abolished, it would become progressively more difficult to hold com-&quot;&apos;   ,    *&quot; ,  . pensation at that level and there was a risk that, as time went on, thedemand for a higher rate of compensation would become irresistible.43318-1      ,    : b 2Kei,ya-    &apos;. -1.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the(Previous Colonial Secretary (C. (52) 332) covering telegrams from the GovernorReference: of.Kenya proposing further measures for checking the activities ofCC. (52) 81st    the Mau Mau. -Conclusions, . .Minute 1.) The Colonial Secretary said that the Governor was satisfied that&apos; the crimes committed by members of the Mau Mau were instigated,&apos; 1    directly or indirectly, by Kenyatta and other leaders of the KenyaAfrican Union.   This view Was shared by most Europeans and manyresponsible Africans in Kenya.   The Governor therefore proposed to declare a state of emergency and to arrest Kenyatta and some of his\ principal followers under emergency powers.   There was a risk that. this action might provoke outbursts of violence, and a show ofV :- military force would help to reduce that risk.   The Governor there-fore asked that a British battalion.should be sent to Kenya from/ ;       Egypt by air, immediately before the state of emergency was declared.&apos;: The Colonial Secretary said that the action proposed by theGovernor was drastic, but he feared that if it were not taken the. situation would deteriorate still further..   &apos;        In discussion there was general support for the view that theGovernor should be authorised to put his plan into operation.   TheMinister of Defence confirmed that a British battalion could arrive-    .     -     from Egypt by the desired date.   He undertook to consider a furtherj. k suggestion, made by the Prime Minister, that this show of military;       , &apos; . force might he supplemented by the dropping of a number of para-&apos; chute troops to carry out exercises near the areas where disorders\ , might occur.!&apos;/    ^ The Cabinet-I   -     &apos; (1) Approved the plan outlined in the telegrams annexed toj      , &apos;  .    C. (52) 332, and invited the Colonial Secretary to authorise!-.&apos;-&quot; : - /              .   -          the Governor of Kenya to proceed accordingly.!.            &apos; 1                          (2) Approved the despatch of a British battalion from theI ,&apos;&apos;,\v- / .   .                               Middle East to Nairobi; and took note that the Minister of1 -                           Defence would consider whether, in addition, arrange-!.:&apos;&quot;!&apos; i.    ments could be made for British parachute troops to carry.   , &apos;,                         out exercises in Kenya.
Purchase Tax 3.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had to answerand Utility. that afternqon a Parliamentary Question by Mr. Albu, M.P., asking(Previous whether he had yet decided to introduce a D scheme of purchaseReference: &apos; tax on furniture. It was inconvenient that any announcement on this c.C.(52)20th subject should be made at the present time; but discussions with theConclusions, furniture trade were already in progress and nothing could be saidMinute 4.) - to imply that the Government were not intending to proceed with thisD Scheme for scheme. He therefore proposed to say that the furniture trade wereFurniture.       aware of the Governments intention to introduce a D scheme forfurniture and that no further statement could be made pending the outcome of the discussions with the trade.The Prime Minister suggested that this opportunity should betaken to make, if plain that under the proposed D scheme purchase tax would not be payable on the cheaper&apos; types of furniture.Germany. 4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ForeignReturn of  ; &apos; Secretary (C. (52) 329) regarding the request of the German FederalCaptured ; Government for the return&apos;of the official German documents v/hichArchives.&apos;   % fell, into Allied hands at the end of the war.,,&apos;      v-    The Foreign Secretary saidthat these documents fell into two classes-diplomatic and military.  It had. always been contemplated-     that all the diplomatic documents would ultimately be returned toIt was also &quot;argued that sOme. payment should be made to theExchequer in respect of development in recognition of the fact thatsome part of development value, had been created by public action.It might perhaps suffice for this purpose if development charge were retained at the rate of 33J per cent.. In favour of abolishing development charge it was pointed outthat the Government had already decided not to carry through thepurchase of all development values for  300 millions as provided inthe 1947 Act. ( This decision represented a substantial saving for theExchequer, ahd it would mean that many landowners would not nowreceive payments from the Exchequer on which they had counted. Itwould seem unreasonable that, the Exchequer should, in addition,continue to collect development charge. Moreover, it was known thatthis charge was acting as a brake upon development; and that ittended to fall, not on the owner, but on the developer, who had tomeet it after he had paid the full market value for the land. Theretention of the charge would tend to discourage private house-building, and would make it more difficult for the Minister of Housingto reduce, the cost of the housing programme by increasing theproportion of privately built houses to subsidised houses built bylocal authorities.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of opinion in the Cabinet was in favour of abolishing develop-meht charge.&apos;     .- -The Cabinet--   -\-    . ,. (1) Agreed to put forward, in substitution for the financial pro-1 . ;.   visions of the-Town and Country Planning Act, 1947, the limited compensation scheme (including the abolition of&apos;    -     development charge) outlined by the Minister of housing and Local Government in C. (52) 304.,  :   (2) Authorised the Minister of Housing and Local Government. tO&apos;arrange for legislation to be prepared for this purpose for introduction in the coming session.(3) Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government tosubmit for their consideration the draft of a White Paper&apos;   explaining his proposals.
;&apos; ,;     .: .:,.v-   . ;-  .   &apos; 21 C.C. 85 (52)1   -    : 1 ia&apos;future German Government; and an offer based on this principlehad,already been made by.the Occupying Powers in July .1951. Themain points&quot; in this offer were that we should lend to the Germanscopies of all the microfilm records made of these documents, andshould associate them with our project for publishing a selection ofthe documents.. It was now proposed that negotiations should be opened with the Germans on the basis of this offer.The disposal of the military documents (including scientific andtechnical documents) presented more difficulty, since there weresecurity, reasons for not returning some of these to the Germans. Itwas therefore proposed that, before negotiations were opened withthe Germans about these, preliminary discussions should be held withrepresentatives of--the United States and French Governments todetermine what classes of documents should continue to be withheld from&apos;the-Germans.,.   ..In discussion there was general agreement with the proposals putforward by the Foreign-Secretary. The Cabinet agreed that thereneed be no obligation to return all the German military documents which were now in Allied military possession; and that the Ministerof Defence should have discretion, after consulting the service ministers and.the Chiefs of Staff, to decide whether any particulardocument or class of document should be withheld for reasons of security..The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to enter into negotiationswith, the German Federal Government regarding the.i&apos;1      return of the captured German diplomatic documents onthe basis proposed in paragraph 3 of C. (52) J329.(2) Agreed that/preliminary discussions should be held withrepresentatives of the United States and French Govern-,ments regarding the return of the captured German&apos; . military documents, as proposed in paragraphs 7-8 of. , C. (52) 329; and authorised the Minister of Defence todetermine on their behalf, after consulting the Service.,;&quot; Ministers and the Chiefs of Staff, what categories of these documents should continue to be withheld from the. &apos;&apos; Germans.    ,

North Atlantic 6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ForeignTreaty&apos;... Secretary.(C. (52)-326) reporting that the Danish Government hadOrganisation.,, asked for the. views of Her Majesty&apos;s Government on a proposalUnited States &quot;that United States fighter bases should be established in DenmarkAir Bases in at the. expense of N.A.T.O. funds and that fighter aircraft should beDenmark. , stationed on them in peace-time. The memorandum recommended- .that the Danish Government should be informed that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment&apos;were in agreement with the United States proposal..&apos;-&apos;.&apos;;       ,&apos; The Foreign Secretary said that the - readiness of the Danish- 1 Government \o accept this proposal was evidence of a courageousattitude on their part, which deserved our support.r , &apos;The Cabinet-Approved the recommendation in C. (52) 326.RentRestrictionActs.(previous reference: -C.C, (52) 83rd&apos;. Conclusions,.Minute 4.).   7. . The Prime. Minister said that the Cabinet should consider at an early date the form of the scheme for amending the Rent&apos;--. Restriction Acts to which they had agreed in principle at their meetingon&apos; 1st October.&apos;\ , The Minister of Housing said that he hoped to submit his detailed proposals to the Cabinet shortly.  He thought it preferable that this. subject should not. be mentioned in The Queen&apos;s Speech on the1 Opening of Parliament, for the following period of uncertainty beforethe Governments detailed proposals were disclosed would be fullyexploited by the Opposition both in Parliament and in the country.1 &quot;- The Bill could not be ready before the beginning of the new year atthe earliest and its eventual presentation would be covered &quot;by theusual reference.,in The&apos;Queen&apos;s Speech to the bringing forward ofother measures. Once the Bill had been presented it should be carried; through-and brought into operation within the shortest possible time.
The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that, although the newspapers were showing considerable interest in this matter, mostof them were adopting a reasonable attitude and it ought not to bedifficult to continue to hold the position until the Government were ready to introduce a Bill.The Cabinet&apos; (1) Agreed that The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parlia-ment should not include any reference to prospectivelegislation to amend the Rent Restriction Acts.(2) Invited the Minister of Housing to bring his detailed pro-posals for amending legislation before the Cabinet at anearly date.8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (52) 328) suggesting a modificationof the local loans procedure.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, under Section 1 ofthe Local Authorities Loans Act, 1945, local authorities must borrowfrom the Exchequer through the Local Loans Fund unless authorised by the Treasury to do otherwise. The practical effect of this provision was that, apart from what they were authorised to borrow on privatemortgage, local authorities were able to meet all their needs of capitalthrough the Local Loans Fund. For each year since 1948-49 loansmade by the Government from the Fund had exceeded the provision made in the Budget, the probable excess for the present financial yearbeing estimated at about  100 millions., He now recommended thatthe section should be allowed to expire on 31st December by omittingit from the forthcoming Expiring Laws Continuance Bill, and that. local authorities&apos; borrowing from the Fund should in future be limitedto the sum provided for this purpose in the Budget, supplemented as necessary by mortgage loans and by issues of stock by authorities ofrecognised credit standing. Local authorities&apos; expenditure would continue to be controlled as at present through the machinery of the investment programme, but the necessity for the larger authoritiesto resort to the market for a proportion of their capital needs might&apos; be expected to make them rather more cautious in their plans. Whilethe practical effects of the proposed change would be limited, it wouldbe likely to strengthen both Government credit and public confidence.&apos; The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that he did not question the advantage of shifting part of the burden of localauthorities&apos; loans from the Local Loans Fund to the capital market,but he was doubtful about the method which the Chancellor proposedto adopt for effecting this. There did not appear to be anything inthe wording of,Section 1 of the Local Authority Loans Act, 1945,which would prevent the Treasury from allowing and, indeed, helpinga small number of the larger authorities to float issues of stock. By-proceeding on such lines the, Government might secure their object,without making any change in the existing law. He also wished theCabinet to understand that the proposed change would have norestrictive effect upon local authorities when they planned their capitalexpenditure. Of the total investment programme of local authorities,amounting to  476 millions during the present financial year, all but some  2 millions represented projects carried out at the instance ofGovernment Departments and under their control through themachinery of the investment programme. Further, the credit-worthiness of even the larger local authorities was not what it formerlyhad been. Expenditure on housing, which amounted to nearlv 400 millions out of their total programmes, was incurred by no lessthan 1,500 separate housing authorities, very few of whom wouldbe able to raise money on the market.
r v.     v.- ; ; 24 *       ..   &apos; -&apos;&apos; The Prime Minister said that some means must be found of preventing the capital expenditure of local authorities from exceeding the provision made for it in the Budget. The Chancellor should discuss his proposals in detail with the Minister of Housing before submitting the-matter again to the Cabinet for decision.. The Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to discuss theproposals in C. (52) 328 with the Minister of Housing and thereafter to submit the matter again to the Cabinet.The Accession        9,   The Lord Chancellor said that, in accordance with the Bill of delclaration.,   Rights, it would be necessary for The Queen, when She openedParliament on 4th November, to make the declaration required by the\    Accession Declaration Act, 1910J The form of declaration prescribed in the Act was as follows: - -i        -&quot; I do solemnly and sincerely in-the presence of God, profess,&apos; ^ :   testify and declare that I am a faithful Protestant, and that I will,according to the true intent of the enactments which secure the.&apos;. . Protestant succession to the Throne of My Realm, uphold and:maintain the said enactments to the best of My powers according- to law.&quot;It,would be necessary to decide whether, following the precedent&apos;  of 1937 when the declaration,had been made by The late King at HisCoronation^ the words &quot; of My Realm &quot; in the declaration should be../     - &apos; omitted. These words had been omitted in 1937, after considerationv v;:     .,     by the Cabinet, on the ground that they were inappropriate in view of&apos;C&apos; &apos; /       the change in the position of the Dominions brought about by the.;passing of the Statute of Westminster.  The Attorney-General of thetime had advised that the omission could be justified without legisla-tion and, in fact, no questions had been raised.- Y    &apos; ,        The Cabinet- &apos;;. Invited the Lord Chancellor to arrange for his Committeeon The Royal Style and Titles to consider the form of the; .    Accession Declaration to be made by The Queen at the&apos; &apos; Opening of Parliament.     &apos; -Cabinet Office, S.W.1,i &apos; 14th October, 1952.
