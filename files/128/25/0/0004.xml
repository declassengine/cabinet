Royal Visit toAustralia andNew Zealand.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 15thConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary(C. (52) 167) covering a minute by the First Lord of the admiralty and the Minister of Transport on the choice of a ship for use by her majesty during Her Visit to Australia and New Zealand in 1954.The Cabinet took note that the new Royal Yacht, which wouldnot be completed before the end of 1953, could not be used for thispurpose unless the Governments of Australia and New Zealand were willing that the Visit should end somewhat later than was now con-templated. This point would be taken up with the Prime Ministerof Australia during his forthcoming visit to London. The cabinets discussion turned mainly on the alternatives of using the s.s. Gothic,which had originally been converted for the projected Visit of His lateMajesty to Australia and New Zealand, or of chartering a suitableliner trading from Australian or New Zealand ports, which could be adapted there nearer the date of the Visit. The Secretary of State forCo-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Power said that it was alreadytoo late to convert the s.s. Gothic before she sailed on her nextscheduled /oyage; and it had been suggested that the Governmentshould pay a further sum of  27,000 to compensate the owners forthe loss, on that voyage, of the space reserved for the Royal Suite.He believed, however, that it should be possible to reach a more satisfactory agreement with the owners on this point. He also saidthat there were very few other liners suitable for this purpose whichcould be chartered in Australia or New Zealand.It was the general view of the Cabinet that, if the dates of the visit could not be so adjusted as to permit the use of the Royal Yacht,the balance of advantage probably lay in favour of using thes.s. Gothic.The Cabinet-(1) Took note that the Prime Minister would discuss this matter at his next Audience with Her Majesty in the light of theviews expressed by the Cabinet.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport,Fuel and Power to discuss financial terms with the owners of the s.s. Gothic.Egypt and 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that the Egyptian GovernmentThe Sudan. had now replied to his latest approach. They had rejected the formula(Previous which he had proposed as a basis for resuming negotiations, and had reference: put forward alternatives which he could not accept. It was evident,C.C. (52) 48th however, that they wished to avoid a definite break. The search for conclusions, an acceptable formula could be continued. Meanwhile, the EgyptiansMinute 9.)       had invited the Sudanese to send a delegation for discussions in Cairo.They were also beginning to relax their restrictions on the passage through the Suez Canal of ships bound for Israel; and the situationin the Canal Zone seemed to be more stable.In discussion it was suggested that it might be helpful if, a littlelater on, we could make some offer of military equipment for theEgyptian Army. It might also be possible to withdraw some of theBritish reinforcements which had been sent to the Canal Zone at thetime of the disturbances.It now seemed much less likely that military operations wouldhave to be undertaken to protect British lives and interests in cairo and Alexandria; but it was desirable that there should be an approved
Germany.Manufacture ofGuidedMissiles.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 52ndConclusions,Minute 7.)3. The Foreign Secretary said that good progress was nowbeing made in the negotiations for a contractual settlement betweenthe Three Occupying Powers and the German Federal Government;and it seemed likely that agreement would be reached. One of the few questions outstanding was whether the Germans should beallowed to manufacture short-range guided weapons. The FrenchGovernment were reluctant to agree to the concession on this point which he had suggested, in pursuance of the Cabinet&apos;s decision of13th May, mainly because they feared that experience gained by theGermans in the manufacture of short-range guided weapons wouldlater on be turned to good account in the manufacture of long-rangeguided weapons. He understood that there were sound technicalarguments for the view that those fears were ill-founded; and, if theCabinet approved, he proposed to arrange for technical experts to goover to Paris later in the day to put these arguments to the french authorities with a view to persuading them to withdraw their objectionto his proposal.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the course which the foreign secretary proposed to follow.Pacific Defence. 4. The Colonial Secretary said that his Department had beencollaborating with the Foreign Office in preparing a memorandumproposing that the United Kingdom, and possibly France, should be associated in some appropriate manner with the tripartite treaty between the United States, Australia and New Zealand for thepreservation of peace and security in the Pacific. He hoped that ministers would take the opportunity of discussing this proposal withthe Prime Minister of Australia during his forthcoming visit toLondon.The Cabinet were informed that this was among the points whichhad been listed for discussion with Mr. Menzies during his visit.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the colonial secretary (C. (52) 163) proposing the appointment of a Royal Corn-mission to consider what measures should be taken to achieve ahigher standard of living in East Africa having regard to the rapid increase of the African population and the consequent overcrowdingin certain parts of the region.In discussion it was suggested that the appointment of this Corn-mission would excite public controversy on this question.  Was itEast Africa.Land andPopulationProblems.VJprocedure for authorising those operations if an emergency arose and time did not permit of reference to the Cabinet.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary and the Minister of Defence toconsider whether any early reduction could be made inthe strength of the British forces in the Canal Zone; andalso to consider whether it would be possible for us tooffer, a little later on, to supply some military equipment to the Egyptian Army.(2) Agreed that, if it became necessary to put into operation at short notice the plans for military action to safeguardBritish lives and interests in Cairo and Alexandria, and time did not permit of reference to the Cabinet, the PrimeMinister might, in consultation with the Foreign secretary and the Minister of Defence, authorise this action on theCabinet&apos;s behalf.
Hong Kong. 6.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ColonialConstitutional Secretary (C. (52) 165) putting forward bis proposals for furtherReform. constitutional reform in Hong Kong.The Colonial Secretary said that the introduction of theseproposals had been deferred early in 1951, at the request of theForeign Office, on the ground that they did not provide for a wideChinese franchise and might on that account have given the chinese people&apos;s&apos;s Government an opportunity for damaging propaganda. Allthe Departments concerned had now agreed, however, that the time had come when these reforms should go forward, despite the unsettledsituation in the Far East. Some little time would elapse before they became fully effective; and, if that situation deteriorated further,they could again be deferred.In discussion it was suggested that the Indian Government shouldbe kept informed of our intentions, even though it was impracticable to accept their suggestion that the Indian population in Hong Kongshould be separately represented on the Legislative Council.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Colonial Secretary to proceed with constitu-tional reform in Hong Kong, as proposed in C. (52) 165.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to arrange for other interested Commonwealth Governments to be kept intouch with the progress of these reforms.Bechuanaland 7.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the protectorate. Commonwealth Secretary (C. (52) 164) proposing that an Order inChieftainship of Council should be made to give full legal effect to the Government^the Bamangwato decisions regarding the Chieftainship of the Bamangwato Tribe.Tribe; The Commonwealth Secretary said that he had hoped that this(Previous could be done by Proclamation. The Attorney-General had, however,Reference: advised that this might be open to challenge in the courts and thatCC. (52) 47th procedure by Order in Council would be preferable.   The Order,Conclusions, though it would be laid before Parliament, would not be subjectMinute 1.) to Parliamentary approval.The Commonwealth Secretary said that there was some reasonto hope that public agitation about Bamangwato affairs would now necessary to take the matter up at the present time? In reply it waspointed out that public interest had already been aroused, and theGovernment urgently needed informed advice, which they could not obtain without the searching and impartial enquiry which a RoyalCommission would make.The Cabinet agreed that the members of the proposed Com-mission should include at least one African.The further suggestion was made that, when the Chairman of theCommission had been selected, the Colonial Secretary might consider with him whether the draft terms of reference annexed to C.(52) 163could not be shortened and simplified.The Cabinet-(1) Approved in principle the proposal in C. (52) 163 for theappointment of a Royal Commission on land and popula-tion problems in East Africa.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to submit for the PrimeMinisters approval his suggestions for the composition of the proposed Commission.
die down, both here and in Africa. Seretse Khama was not com&quot;plying with his undertaking to refrain from political activities, whichhe had given when he accepted a monetary allowance from theUnited Kingdom Government; but it seemed inexpedient to threatenwithdrawal of the allowance on that account. His activities wouldbecome less embarrassing as public interest in his fortunes began to wane.The Cabinet Approved the proposal in C. (52) 164 for the submission ofan Order in Council on the succession to the chieftainship of the Bamangwato Tribe.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,20th May, 1952.
