OUSlJlgProgramme.Licensing ofPrivateBuilding.(previous reference:C.C.(52) 99thConclusions,Minute 5.)1. The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that,as requested by the Cabinet on 20th November, he had consideredwith some of his colleagues whether, in the licensing of private house-building, a modified test of need on the lines of the Appendix toC. (52) 396 should be retained or whether complete freedom shouldbe restored, subject only to planning permission, in the building ofprivate houses within a limit of 1,000 square feet and 1^ standards of timber. He and his colleagues were of the opinion that even a modified test of need would hinder progress, particularly as some local authorities would be likely to take advantage of it to withholdlicences because they objected in principle to any private house-building. Parliamentary criticism was inevitable in either event; butthis could be effectively countered by the argument that the numberof houses built for letting would continue to increase in spite of an estimated increase in the number of private houses built from30,000 in 1952 to 85,000 in 1954. Control would be preserved overthe programme as a whole but within it there would be virtualfreedom for the building of private houses of modest size.The Cabinet-Agreed that future arrangements for the licensing of private house-building should not include the application of anytest of need.Purchase Tax.D Scheme forFurniture.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 100thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was now clearthat the standards scheme for furniture would not be ready for introduction simultaneously with the D scheme. He proposed,however, to adhere to the decision that the Order introducing theD scheme should be laid and debated in the House of commons before the Christmas recess. He would announce in the debate thatthe standards scheme, whose introduction did not require an Order,would be introduced in due course.The Parliamentary Secretary, Board of Trade, supported theproposal made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements.delegated legislation.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 98thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Lord Privy Seal said that, as a result of discussions withLeaders of the Opposition Parties in the House of Commons, it was now intended that a Select Committee of the House of commons should be appointed to enquire into the procedure for exercisingParliamentary control over delegated legislation. The opposition leaders had been unwilling to agree to the appointment of a JointCommittee of both Houses; and it would therefore be necessary forthe House of Lords to appoint a separate Committee.The Commonwealth Secretary said that on reflection he was inclined to think that, as the procedures of the two Houses were sodissimilar, it would be preferable that separate Committees ofenquiry should be appointed by each House.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Parliament. 4.   The Cabinet were informed of the business, to be taken in business in the  the House of Commons in the period before the Christmas recessHouse of        which, it was hoped, would begin on 19th December.Commons. Apart from legislative business one day would be available fora general debate, and the Opposition might ask that this should be devoted to a discussion of the proceedings of the Council of Europe.The Foreign Secretary said that he would wish to take part in that43401-1 b 2
debate and it would be difficult for him to do so in the period befoflan)Christmas.  He therefore hoped that it might be possible to defer it until after Christmas.The Lord Privy Seal said that he had been re-considering theearlier decision that a compulsory time-table for the remaining stages of the Iron and Steel Bill should be passed before the christmas recess. He now thought it might be preferable to offer to discuss with the Opposition the possibility of framing an agreedtime-table-preserving, of course, the sanction of imposing a compulsory time-table if the Opposition failed to honour their agreement. He suggested that he might open discussions. for thispurpose before the Christmas recess. If these failed, a compulsorytime-table could/be introduced immediately after the christmas recess.  The Minister of Supply supported this proposal.The Cabinet invited the Lord Privy Seal to open discussions withthe Opposition on the lines which he proposed.5. The Prime Minister said that, as a result of the cabinets decision of 7th November to reduce the programme of defence expenditure in 1953, certain modifications of existing contracts wouldhave to be made and, if the savings desired by the Cabinet were tobe secured, the contractors would have to be notified of these beforethe new programme was announced to Parliament in the defence white Paper and the Defence Estimates which would be presented in February. The substance of these communications to contractorswas bound to become publicly known; and he therefore proposedto make a short statement in the House of Commons indicating thatthe Government had decided to make certain reductions in thedefence programme. This statement would be made, and the com-municatiohs to contractors would be sent, before the North atlantic council discussed the adjustments which were being made in thedefence programme.The Cabinet-Took note of the Prime Ministers statement.Foreign Affairs. 6. The Foreign Secretary said that the Prime Minister of FranceFrance. was anxious to pay an early visit to London.   He hoped to be able to.. arrange the timing of this visit, and the terms of its announcement,when he went to Paris at the end of the following week for the meetings of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation and the North Atlantic Council.Saar. The Foreign Secretary said that he also hoped that while he wasin Paris he would be able to secure some progress towards a Franco-German agreement on the Saar. ,Czechoslovakia. In reply to questions the Foreign Secretary said that it was not altogether clear Whether the recent political trial in Prague had been designed by the Soviet Government to check incipient tendenciestowards &quot; Titoism &quot; in Czechoslovakia. It was known that it had given rise to serious apprehensions in Hungary.Meat Supplies. 7. The Cabinet had before them a Note by the Chancellor of negotiations the Exchequer (C. (52) 427) covering a report by the Overseas Nego-with Argentina, tiations Committee on the course of the current trade negotiations(Previous        with Argentina. .Reference: The Minister of Food said that Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in C.C. (52).98th   Buenos Aires had now advised that, unless wc allowed the ArgentinesConclusions,    to use some of our proposed credit, ^whether directly or indirectly,Minute 3.)       to repurchase dollars which they had sold to us for sterling, no agree-ment could be concluded.   If no agreement had been made byDefenceProgramme.(previous reference:CC. (52) 94thConclusions.)
Food Rationing. 8. 1 The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisterSweets. of Food (C. (52) 423) proposing that rationing and price control ofsweets should be ended early in the New Year.The Minister of Food said that the position was now morefavourable than at the time of the late Government&apos;s abortive attemptto abolish sweet rationing in 1949. Stocks were higher by about30 per cent; production was running at the rate of rather under 6 oz.per head per week compared with 4  oz. in 1949; and the average price of sweets had increased since then by about one-sixth. Thewithdrawal of rationing would, however, undoubtedly involve some risk, particularly during the initial rush to buy. He proposed to meet this so far as possible by making available to manufacturers about15,000 tons of additional sugar, which he could obtain from varioussmall savings. It was also an essential part of his plan that price control should be ended with rationing and the small increase in pricest,J 20th December, the meat ration would have to be reduced to aboutIs. 4d. a week in March 1953; and by the end of that year stockswould have become so seriously depleted that the ration prospects for1954 would be most unpromising. Now that the Argentines hadreduced their price for beef to  160 a ton he hoped that the cabinet would be ready to make some concession to them.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that any concessionregarding the repurchase of dollars would expose us to the risk of losing up to $39 millions from our reserves. This was a serious risk;but, if the Cabinet thought that some concession should be made, hewas prepared to accept it, provided that some limit say $20 to $25millions was placed upon the possible loss to the reserves.There was general agreement that advantage should be taken ofthe improved atmosphere in Buenos Aires to conclude an early agreement.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that it should no longer be made acondition of our proposed credit to Argentina that no partof it should be used, whether directly or indirectly, torepurchase dollars previously sold to us for sterling.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to decide, in consul-tation with the other Ministers concerned, what limit should be placed upon the amount of dollars which couldbe repurchased at the expense of our proposed credit.The Foreign Secretary said that he hoped that he would not beasked to carry on the Foreign Office Vote what was essentially a com-mercial and not a political credit. Such an arrangement was unprecedented-cedented and would undoubtedly be misunderstood abroad.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that according to his advice the credit could not, without legislation, be carried on anyDepartmental Vote other than that of the Foreign Office. He would,however, arrange for the matter to be re-examined with every desireto meet the Foreign Secretary&apos;s wishes if it were possible. If this werenot possible, the Foreign Office could, of course, look to the treasury for help in defending the credit in Parliament.The Cabinet (3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider whether,without legislation, the proposed credit to Argentina couldbe carried on any Departmental Vote other than that ofthe Foreign Office.
which would follow should help to balance supply and demand. fjfPrise in prices was unlikely to exceed 2d. per lb. or to involve anincrease of more than -05 in the cost-of-living index. He feltjustified in recommending to his colleagues a relaxation of control which would free some 500 civil servants and 1,000 trade employees.There was general agreement that the course of action recom-mended by the Minister of Food was justified.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Food to abolish rationing and price control of sweets early in the New Year.Middle EastHeadquarters.proposed transfer to cyprus.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 91stConclusions,Minute 7.)9. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Defence (C. (52) 382) inviting them (a) to approve in principle the transfer of Joint Headquarters,Middle East, to Cyprus;(b) to authorise expenditure on certain preparatory work up toa limit of  500,000.This would leave open the question of the exact composition of the headquarters, but it was desirable that preparatory work on the siteshould begin without further delay.The Foreign Secretary said that a move to Cyprus offered certaindefinite political advantages. Thus, it would be very acceptable to turkey and should help to convince the Greeks that we intended to stay in the island.The Prime Minister sitggested that the Cabinet might approve inprinciple the proposed move to Cyprus but should reserve for detailed examination the numbers of Service personnel and civilians whom itwas proposed to accommodate in the new Headquarters and thedetails of the expenditure proposed.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed in principle that the Joint Headquarters, Middle East,should be transferred from Egypt to Cyprus.(2) Agreed that preliminary work on the preparation of the headquarters in Cyprus could be commenced, subject tothe normal Treasury sanction of detailed proposals for expenditure.(3) Invited the Minister of Defence to re-examine the proposedestablishment of the Joint Headquarters and to submit tothe Cabinet revised estimates of the Service personnel and civilians for whom accommodation would be required.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,3rd December, 1952.
