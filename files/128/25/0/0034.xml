leasehold reform.(previous reference:CC. (52) 75thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Home Secretary(C. (52) 277) and the Secretary of State for Scotland (C. (52) 289)recommending that the Government should put forward during thecoming session their long-term proposals for leasehold reform.The Home Secretary said that the standstill Act passed by theLabour Government in 1951 would expire in the middle of 1953.Proposals for permanent legislation had been discussed by the HomeAffairs Committee, and good progress had been made with thepreparation of a provisional draft Bill. It was unlikely that this could be passed through both Houses by July 1953, and it would therefore be necessary to promote separate legislation extending the standstill Act of 1951; but, if the permanent measure made good progress, only a short extension would be required. The major bill was one which could suitably be introduced in the House of Lords.In discussion it was pointed out that the. legislative programme for the coming session was already congested and there was no realprospect that Parliamentary time could be found for another majorBill in addition&quot; to those which the Government had already decided upon.. There would be no practical advantage in introducing this bill in the Lords if it was known that there would be no opportunityto complete its discussion by the Commons. A separate Scottish bill would be required, and this reduced still further the likelihood that parliament would be able to deal permanently with the leaseholdproblem in the coming session. The Government would therefore bewell advised to attempt to do no more in the coming session than toextend the duration of the standstill Act in a single Bill which couldcover Scotland. It was desirable that the Government should showthat they had worked out proposals for permanent legislation; butthis could best be done, not by publishing the long-term Bills, but bypresenting a White Paper when the legislation extending the stand-still Act was introduced. It might also be possible to include in the standstill Bill provisions (which were unlikely to be controversial)conferring security of tenure on tenants of residential properties.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that no major legislation in leasehold reform shouldbe included in the legislative programme for the coming session.(2) Invited the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forScotland to prepare legislation extending for furtherperiods the Leasehold Property (Temporary Provisions)Act, 1951 and the Long Leases (Temporary Provisions)(Scotland) Act, 1951, and to consider whether such legislation could include provision conferring security of tenure on tenants of residential properties.(3) Invited the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forScotland to submit to the Home Affairs Committee the drafts of White Papers which could be presentedsimultaneously with the introduction of the legislationmentioned in Conclusion (2) above, setting out the government&apos;s proposals for permanent legislation onleasehold reform.KZyio to arrange for the draft Transport Bill to be amended so asto include (i) provision for ensuring greater flexibility in railway charges, subject to suitable safeguards; and (ii) pro-vision that the second part of the proposed levy on road haulage should be brought into operation only if thefinancial situation of the railways justified it and affirmative resolutions approving its introduction had been passed by both Houses of Parliament.
MonopoliesBill.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 75thConclusions,Minute 2.)4.  The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the President oil the Board of Trade (C. (52) 280) inviting the Cabinet to decide whether legislation should be introduced in the coming session tostrengthen the Monopolies Commission and to widen its activities.In favour of including this Bill in the legislative programme forthe coming session it was pointed Out that this project had been given some prominence in the Party&apos;s election programme, and legislationhad actually been promised in the King&apos;s Speech at the opening ofthe present session.On the other hand it was admitted that there was no great pressure of public opinion for this reform and that there would beno serious administrative inconvenience if the legislation werepostponed for another year. From the point of view of theParliamentary timetable it was certainly preferable that this Billshould not be included in the programme.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices Billshould not be included in the legislative programme for thecoming session.Persian Gulf.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 81stConclusions,Minute 4.)The TrucialSheikdoms.5. The Foreign Secretary said that the Saudi Arabians werepersisting in their efforts to extend their influence in the neighbouringTrucial sheikdoms, and the Sultan of Muscat had now assembledsizeable forces for the purpose of resisting any further encroachmenton his territory. Ibn Saud had ignored the warnings conveyed tohim by his Ambassador in London, and even talked of bringing our intervention to the notice of the United Nations. There was some risk that more serious disturbances might develop in this area.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.War Criminals.        6.   The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that he hadAlbert von      decided to advise Her Majesty to remit the remainder of the sentenceKesselring.      which Field-Marshal von Kesselring was serving in British custodyas a war criminal.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement.Tariff PoSicy. 7.   The Colonial Secretary said that at the Conservative PartyImperial Conference he was to speak on a resolution inviting the GovernmentPreference to re-affirm their belief in the principles of Imperial Preference andand the to seek amendment of such Articles in the General Agreement onG.A.T.T. Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.) as were injuring Empire trade and(Previous development.

$public expenditure.(previous reference:CC. (52) 83rdConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in his speech atthe Mansion House that evening he proposed to refer in general terms to the need for further economy in public expenditure.The Cabinet agreed that such a warning would be salutary.They thought it would be helpful if it could be so framed as to makeit clear that the measures which the Government would be taking,in connection with the framing of the estimates for 1953-54, wouldbe part of the continual process of restoring the country&apos;s financeson which they had been engaged since they assumed office.Road and Rail. Transport.Draft transport bill.(previous reference:CC. (52) 65thConclusions,Minute 4.)- 2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Power(C. (52) 318) setting out the arguments for and against retaining inthe draft Transport Bill part two of the proposed transport levy,which was designed to make good to the Commission losses of ne trevenue due to future transfers of traffic from rail to road. they also had before them a note by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster (C. (52) 319) summarising the political arguments infavour of abandoning this part of the proposed levy.The Minister of Transport said that he was strongly in favourof abandoning forthwith the second part of the levy, which mightwell prove impossible to carry through the House of Commons, andof relying instead on provisions allowing the railways a greater degreeof freedom in varying their charges. Greater flexibility in thecharges system might go a long way towards enabling the railwaysto compete successfully with road haulage. The case for the second&apos; part of the levy had been greatly weakened since the Governmenthad decided to allow the railways themselves to operate substantialroad haulage interests. In any event it would be wrong to miss this opportunity to try a more flexible system of charging by the railways,which would have been introduced by the Conservative Governmentin 1939 if war had not prevented it. The dropping of part two ofthe levy should predispose the various interests concerned to reach agreement about railway charges; and the fact of such an agree-ment, if it were reached, would weaken the Opposition^ case againstthe Bill in Parliament.The Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and power said that there were limits to the freedom which could safely be given to the railways to vary their charges and to imposedifferential charges. In particular, there was bound to be a tendency for the railways to try to put themselves in a financial position to compete successfully with road haulage for the lighter forms of freight by increasing their charges for transporting coal and otherheavy goods which could only travel by rail. He considered that part two of the levy was a necessary part of the Bill and in this view he had the support of the Transport Commission.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that in his viewpart two of the levy was not only politically indefensible but wrong in principle. Why must it be assumed that the railways, reorganisedinto smaller units and with substantial road haulage interests of theirown, would necessarily be run at a loss? Their competitive power would be further increased if they could be given a greater measureof freedom in the matter of charges, for which there was widespreadpublic support. They were more likely to be made efficient by arrangements on these lines than by a levy on road haulage.The Home Secretary said that in spite of its political implicationshe was still in favour of part two of the levy, without which the bill would make no lasting contribution to the problem of regulatingcompetition between road and rail. The railways ought certainlyto be given whatever measure of freedom in the matter of charges&quot;&apos; &apos; &quot;would prove acceptable to the other: interests concerned, but this by43078&quot;&quot; : &apos;&apos;; b 2
itself could not be relied upon to put right a situation found in every country, in which railways were unable to compete with road haulage/Part two of the levy should ensure that the transport system of the&apos;country as a whole, including the railways, would always be self-&apos;supporting financially.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was in favour, of retaining part two of the levy as a protection to the Exchequeragainst an unlimited liability in respect of the railways and because,without it the Bill would provide for little beyond the disposal of apart of the Road Haulage Executive^ lorries. The government ought to commend the levy to the House of Commons and make concessions only if they were forced to do so by the course of thediscussions in the House.In further discussion it was urged that everything possible should,be done to make this first measure of de-nationalisation a success,,and that the retention of part two of the levy would be likely to.act as a serious deterrent to prospective purchasers of lorries. The,view was also expressed that it would be difficult to introduce the,.Bill in its present form and drop part two of the levy at a later stageif the Parliamentary situation should make this necessary. If parttwo were to be abandoned it was essential to substitute for it other means of assisting the railways financially in particular by giving them greater freedom in the matter of charges and it would bedifficult to add these alternative provisions to the Bill in theCommittee Stage.The Paymaster-General said that, although there appeared tobe a strong case for keeping part two of the levy in reserve as a protection for the Exchequer, there did not appear to be any reason,why it should be brought into operation before the effects of thede-nationalisation of road haulage upon the railways could be fairlyassessed. The railways, unlike nationalised road haulage, were atpresent working at a profit and it remained to be seen whether, with substantial road haulage interests of their own and possibly with greater freedom in the matter of charges, they could not continueto make a profit^ in spite of competition from de-nationalised road haulage. Why should not the Bill provide both for greater freedomof charging by the railways and for part two of the levy but leavethe latter in suspense until the need for it had been proved? although this part of the levy would continue to be related to loss incurred by future diversion of traffic from rail to road, there would be no justification for requiring road haulage to pay it so long as therailways&apos; operations as a-whole were yielding profits which exceededthat loss.The Prime Minister said that a solution to the problem shouldbe sought on these lines, which would have the merit of making it possible to drop a suspensory part two of the levy if this should prove unavoidable during the course of the Bill&apos;s passage through parliament. The Government ought not in his view to mindbowing to opinion in the House of Commons in a matter of thiskind: on the contrary, it was valuable to demonstrate that parliament had an active part to play in shaping legislation. Mean-while no public reference must be made either at the forthcomingParty Conference or elsewhere to the Governments intentions in thismatter. If the necessary changes in the draft Bill should make itnecessary to set back the time-table hitherto proposed for the Bill,this need not cause serious difficulty since discussion of the matter in the Debate on the Address could be prevented by giving oralnotice, at the outset of the new Session, of the intention to presentthe Bill.The Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Go-ordination  ofTransport, Fuel and Power and the Minister of. Transport.
15CC. 84 (52)recognised, however, that none of the other Commonwealth Govern-ments was likely to share their view on this particular provision ofthe G.A.T.T. and that it was unlikely that at the commonwealth conference any general disposition would be shown to seek relief from it.In discussion some minor changes were suggested in the wording of the Colonial Secretary&apos;s proposed statement, and these were approved.The Cabinet ;Authorised the Colonial Secretary to make a statement on imperial Preference in the terms which he proposed subjectto the amendments approved in their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.I.,7th October, 1952.
