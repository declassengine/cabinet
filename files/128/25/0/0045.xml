the Coronation.(previous reference:CC. (52) 90thConclusions,Minute 6.)Naval andR.A.F.Reviews.1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary (C. (52) 397) seeking decisions on certainproposed items of expenditure in connection with the Coronation.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that about half of theestimated minimum cost of holding a Naval Review ( 35,000- 50,000) would be for the entertainment of distinguished visitors.Other items of expenditure had been kept to essentials.The Secretary of State for Air said that the main purpose of anR.A.F. Review was that The Queen herself should review a repre-sentative detachment of the R.A.F., but some modest provision oughtperhaps to be made for the admission of the public: His estimate of 16,500 represented the lowest practicable expenditure.The Prime Minister said that, while the Cabinet would in principlefavour the holding of these Reviews, a resolute effort must be madeto reduce still further the estimates of expenditure which had beensubmitted. Would it not be possible, for example, to defray part ofthe cost of chartering liners by enabling them to carry a proportionof paying passengers? And should not members of the publicattending.the R.A.F. Review be charged for admission?The Commonwealth Secretary said that it would not be easy tofind room for both Naval and R.A.F. Reviews in The Queen&apos;s pro-gramme for the Coronation period.The Cabinet-(1) Subject to Her Majesty&apos;s pleasure, agreed in principle that naval and R.A.F. Reviews should be held in Coronationyear.(2) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretaryof State for Air to submit,. for the Prime ministers approval, reduced estimates of the cost of such Reviews.Decorations. The Minister of Works said that, with prices at their present level,the limit of  10,000 for expenditure on decorations off the proces-sional route, particularly in provincial centres, would mean thatGovernment buildings would compare unfavourably with those oflocal authorities and commercial organisations. He would not,however, be in favour of increasing this sum at the expense of thedecoration of the processional route itself.The Commonwealth Secretary said that his Committee had feltthat further expenditure for this purpose would not be justified andthat the  10,000 already approved should be used to the best advantage in places which The Queen would be visiting during the coronation celebrations..   The Cabinet^-(3) Confirmed their approval of expenditure of  150,000 ondecorations, floodlighting and fireworks, including  10,000on decorations off the processional route. .-,,.- .Ceremonies in The Secretary of State for Scotland said that there might beScotland and criticism in Scotland of the proposed expenditure of only  3,000 onWales. The Queen&apos;s visit to Edinburgh, when  10,000 was to be spent on the ceremony at Caernarvon Castle.The Minister of Works said that Caernarvon Castle was a responsibility of the Minister of Works and that there was no appro-priate local authority which could be expected to finance the ceremonythere. In Edinburgh, on the other hand, the local authority would be primarily responsible for organising the celebrations.
The Cabinet (4) Took note of the estimates of  3,000 and  10,000 for expendi-ture on ceremonies at Edinburgh and Caernarvon Castlerespectively.School-children. The Minister of Education recalled that it had been decided toleave the question of a Coronation present for school-children to the discretion of local education authorities. Most of these were likely togive some suitable present to school-children and were expecting toreceive education grant at the normal rate of 60 per cent, in respect ofexpenditure incurred for this purpose. The Minister agreed that somelimit should be placed upon the expenditure for this purpose whichwould rank for Exchequer grant.The Cabinet (5) Authorised the Minister of Education to pay education grant at the normal rate of 60 per cent, in respect of reasonableexpenditure by local education authorities on Coronationcelebrations, subject to expenditure admissible for grantnot exceeding 25. per pupil.Sale of Seats. The Minister of Works said that from the latest tenders for theerection of Government stands it seemed likely that seats would not pay for themselves if charges were kept at  4 (uncovered) and 6 (covered). He did not favour increased charges, which would belikely to expose the Government to criticism, but he would hope tomeet some part at least of the increased cost of erecting stands by making a rather larger profit from the sale of seats to agencies.The Financial Secretary, Treasury, said that the increased cost oferecting stands might mean the addition of some  100,000 to the net cost of the Coronation, the estimate for which was already sub-..&quot; stantially above that approved by the Cabinet on 19th June.The Cabinet (6) Authorised the Minister of Works to announce that charges for seats in Government stands would be  4 (uncovered)and  6 (covered).The Minister of Works said that he was under considerable pressure to disclose details of his proposed allocation of the seats inthese stands. At the Coronation of 1937 the Government had declined to make this information public.It was the general view of the Cabinet that the 1937 precedentshould be followed and that the Minister of Works should confinehimself to disclosing the broad proportions in which seats would be distributed as between Commonwealth Governments and homeorganisations, respectively, and the names of those home organisa-tions which would receive allocations.Seating in the The Lord Chancellor said that, with the Commonwealth Secre-Abbey. tary, he had recently seen the Earl Marshal, who was pressing for early agreement to his announcing that at least 880 seats in the Abbeywould be available for Peers and Peeresses and 650 for Members of theHouse of Commons and their wives.It was the general view of the Cabinet that it would be unwise to announce these figures until further consideration had been givento their implications. In particular, any suggestion that only a small proportion of M.Ps. would be able to be accompanied to the Abbeyby their wives would be likely to give rise to considerable feeling.
.J The Cabinet-(7) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, together with the LordChancellor, the Lord Privy Seal, the Minister of works and the Chief Whip to consider the request made by the earl Marshal and to submit early recommendations tothe Cabinet.Uniforms. The Prime Minister said that he had not felt able to accept a recommendation that Service officers attending the ceremony in theAbbey should be prevented from wearing full-dress uniform even ifthey wished to do so. He also wished consideration to be given to thepossibility of waiving purchase tax on the purchase of full-dress uni-form for use at the Coronation. .....The Cabinet (8) Took note that further consideration would be given to thequestion whether Service officers attending the ceremonyin the Abbey should have the option of wearing full-dressuniform.(9) Invited the Financial Secretary, Treasury, to consider whetherpurchases of full-dress uniform for use at the Coronationcould be relieved of purchase tax.Civil Aviation.Development ofGatwickAirport.(previous reference:CC. (52) 74thConclusions,Minute 9.)2. The Minister of Transport said that in view of oppositionto the proposed development of Gatwick Airport which was showingitself, especially among Government supporters, the Cabinet might wish to review their decision of 29th July. He suggested that forthis purpose he should circulate a memorandum, in the form of adraft White Paper, explaining the Governments attitude on all aspects,of the matter. This would set out the Governments intentions inregard to civil airfields in the London area generally; would explainwhy it was necessary to develop an alternative civil air terminus toLondon Airport and why Gatwick had been chosen for this purpose in preference to nearly 50 other possible sites; would disclose theGovernments attitude towards suggestions that long-distance airlineservices should terminate at airfields well outside the London area from which passengers would be conveyed to London by helicopter;and, finally, would explain how it was expected that a substantial proportion of the cost of developing Gatwick would be offset by therelease of no less than four of the seven civil airfields at presentretained in the London area. If, on the basis of such a document, theGovernment were to reaffirm their decision that Gatwick should be developed, a local enquiry might thereafter be held into the localaspects of the project, for example the exact siting of the runways.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that it was important to avoid a situation in which representatives of his Ministry,holding a local enquiry, were expected to deal with questions ofnational policy connected with the proposed development of gatwick airport which it would not be within their competence to answer.He, therefore, supported the Minister^ proposal.The Prime Minister welcomed the proposed submission of a draft white Paper but said that he was by no means convinced that itwould be right for the Government to reaffirm and make known fora second time their decision to develop Gatwick Airport beforeallowing local interests to express their views through some form ofpublic enquiry.The Secretary of State for Air said that he would wish to be associated with the preparation of the proposed White Paper.
Marketing of 3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theEggs. Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (52) 389) submitting the recom-mendation of the Economic Policy Committee that the existing1 arrangements for allocation and price control bf eggs should beended in March 1953, that the Exchequer subsidy for eggs should be discontinued at the same time, and that guaranteed support prices should then be substituted for the present system of fixed buyingprices.The Cabinet agreed in principle that a free market for eggsshould be re-established in the spring of 1953. The following points were, however, raised in discussion:  (a) Consideration should be given to the possibility of ensuring that sufficient supplies of eggs would continue to be available fornursing mothers and other priority classes. The Minister of health should be consulted on this point.(b) The farmers must be satisfied that there would be an assured market for their eggs after the interim period of twelvemonths during which foreign eggs would continue to be importedexclusively by the Ministry of Food. More.eggs were being produced in this country now than before the war; but production could fallrapidly if farmers had reason to fear that they would lose their assuredmarket. The President of the Board of Trade was doubtful whether,in view of our commitments under the General Agreement on tariffs and Trade, the farmers could properly be given an unqualifiedpromise of an assured market.(c) Large quantities of eggs were now being imported from australia and from the Irish Republic; and the commonwealth secretary wished to be consulted before any assurance was given to united Kingdom farmers which might make it impossible to maintainthe existing volume of imports from those countries.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that beforethe Government announced their decision to revert to a free market in eggs the Departments concerned should together concert the replies to be returned to the various questions which, as the Cabinet&apos;s dis-cussion had shown, would be provoked by such an announcement..  &apos;    No time should, however, be lost in considering these points; andin the meantime the Minister of Food might say, in reply to the. Parliamentary Questions which he had to answer in the course of, the week, that a statement about the future marketings of eggs wouldbe made before the end of November.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposals in C. (52) 389 forterminating in the spring of 1953 the existing arrange-ments for the allocation and price control Of eggs.(2) Authorised the Minister of Food to state, in reply to Parlia-mentary Questions later in the week, that an announce-ment about the future arrangements for the marketing ofeggs would be made before the end of November.The Cabinet  V-v; Invited the Minister of Transport, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Air arid other Ministers concerned, toprepare and submit to the Cabinet the draft of a White&apos; Paper setting out in full the case for developing gatwick airport as an alternative civil air terminus to london airport.
(3) Agreed that officials of the Treasury, Board of Trade,Ministry of Food, Agriculture Departments, Ministry ofHealth and Commonwealth Relations Office shouldtogether consider what replies could be given to thevarious questions which such a statement was likely to provoke.Food.ChristmasFood Bonuses.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 91stConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (52) 398) reporting the result of thediscussions which he had held with the Minister of Food, in pursuanceof the Cabinefs decision of 29th October, on the question whether any bonus issues of rationed food should be made at Christmas.This showed that the only bonuses which could be given on this occasion would be a special issue of 1 lb. of sugar and the postpone-ment for one month of the reduction in the margarine ration, whichwould otherwise come into force on 1st December. Both Ministersconsidered that in present circumstances it would not be justifiable to incur the additional overseas expenditure which these concessionswould involve.The Cabinet Agreed that there should be no special bonuses of rationed foods this Christmas.Meat Supplies.Negotiationswith Argentina.(previous reference:GC. (52) 81stConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Minister oj Food said that, in view of the improvedprospect of meat supplies from Australia, it might be possible tomaintain the weekly ration of carcase meat at an acceptable leveluntil March 1953, even if no shipments of meat from the Argentinearrived in the interval. This was a point which might be used with advantage in the current meat negotiations in Buenos Aires; and, inorder to assist those negotiations, he proposed to postponeannouncing the level to which the weekly meat ration would shortlyhave to be reduced.The Cabinet Took note that, in the announcement which he would shortly be making of impending changes in ration scales, theMinister of Food would not include any statement about thewinter level of the weekly meat ration.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,11th November, 1952.
