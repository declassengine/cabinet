JgjKenya.S&quot; parliamentary privilege.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 100thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Colonial Secretary made a report to the Cabinet on thelatest developments in Kenya. Although eleven more Africans hadbeen murdered by Mau Mau, he hoped that the situation was being brought under closer control.The Prime Minister referred to the proceedings for contempt of court which had been taken in Kenya against Mr. D. N. Pritt.. Q.C.,in respect of his references to the administration of justice in Kenya.He hoped that the House of Commons would not attempt to interferewith those proceedings on the ground that they involved a breach ofParliamentary privilege.The Cabinet were informed that the Attorney-General in Kenyahad been advised that any proceedings against Mr. D. N. Pritt shouldbe based on what he had said in open court or to the Press, and noton communications sent to Members of Parliament in this country.It was possible therefore that the proceedings would not give rise toany further suggestion that a breach of Parliamentary privilege was involved.In discussion the view was expressed that, as the Colonial Secre-tary was ultimately responsible for the administration of justice in kenya, communications on this subject to Members of parliament in this country might be held to be privileged. The Prime ministers aid that the Cabinet should have legal advice on this point, in case itshould arise in subsequent discussions in Parliament.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Privy Seal, the HomeSecretary and the Law Officers to consider whether Parlia-mentary privilege could properly be claimed in respect of a communication sent to Members of Parliament in thiscountry complaining of the administration of justice in kenya.Foreign Affairs. 2. The Foreign Secretary said that there were indications thatKorea. the new United States Administration might seek to free their hands(Previous        in dealing with the Korean situation by repudiating PresidentReference:      Truman&apos;s declaration that the Formosa Straits would be neutralised.C.C. (52) 82nd   Their object would be to allow raids to be made from Formosa againstConclusions,    the Chinese mainland or against neighbouring islands held by ChineseMinute 1.)       Communist forces. It would be represented, no doubt, that these raidsmight take some of the pressure off the French in Indo-China. Fromthe military point of view he thought that such raids would be of little value and were unlikely to be welcomed by the French, who were most anxious to avoid provoking large-scale Chinese intervention in indo-China and were chiefly in need of additional money and equip-ment with which to organise Vietnamese forces.  From the politicalangle there would be great disadvantage in taking this limited andunproductive step.   He would therefore seek to dissuade the newI United States Government from taking it, at any rate until there hadbeen an opportunity for full Anglo-American discussion on the wholeFar Eastern situation.Egypt. The Prime Minister said that in his forthcoming visit to the United(Previous States he would point out to General Eisenhower that, although weReference: had no intention of evacuating Egypt under duress, it was beyond ourC.C.(52)9lst strength to maintain permanently a force of 70,000 men in the CanalConclusions, Zone.  He would press for some effective assistance from the united minute 7.) States in this area.The Foreign Secretary said that the Americans might be morewilling to co-operate in a Joint Air Defence Organisation in the middle east and to contribute some air forces to it.   That seemed at the.  moment to be the best hope of getting American help in this area.It might be worth reminding the Americans that, as their investments43540-4 b 2

The Foreign Secretary said that the Minister of Agriculturewas that day seeing representatives of British trawler-owners andwould as,k them to lift their ban on the landing of Icelandic fish inthis country pending a decision on the application which the Govern-ment had decided to make to the International Court at The Hague.The trawler-owners were likely to ask that the Iceland Governmentshould similarly withdraw their new restrictions on fishing pending adecision by The Hague Court. He considered, however, that despite the Cabinefs decision of 18th December it would be inexpedient topress this request again upon the Iceland Government. The newrestrictions were now a part of the law of Iceland, and they would clearly be unwilling to pass special legislation to suspend their opera-tion. Moreover, our application to the Court would relate to FaxaBay only and not to the whole of Iceland&apos;s territorial waters. TheMinister of Agriculture would do his best to persuade the trawler-owners to raise their own ban without any corresponding concessionby the Iceland Government.The Cabinet Agreed that no further attempt should be made to persuade the Government of Iceland to suspend their new restrictionson fishing in territorial waters until judgment had been given on the forthcoming application to the International Court.Egypt- 4.   The Prime Minister said that he had been surprised to learnSterling that it was proposed to allow the Egyptians to draw  10 million ofBalances. their blocked sterling balances at the beginning of 1953. He had hoped(Previous that, as had been done twelve months previously, this release would reference: be delayed and held as a useful card in negotiations over the SudanCC. (52) 81st and over defence. He had certainly expected that this would be fullyConclusions, discussed in Cabinet before any decision was made.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the release of sterling balances to Egypt was controlled by the Sterling Releases agreement made with the Egyptian Government in July 1951. Under this Agree-ment  5 million could be released whenever Egypt&apos;s free sterling hold-ings totalled less than  45 million. These holdings were now down toa figure of  6 million and the release of the  5 million available in1953 had been made in advance as a result of the Cabinet decision inSeptember 1952. The Agreement also provided for the annual releaseof  10 million. This could be made in the course of any one year, but was normally made at the beginning of the year. In 1952 the releasehad been delayed until April owing to the grave political situation inEgypt and the disturbances in the Canal Zone. In the autumn of 1952the political situation had become easier and negotiations with GeneralNeguib&apos;s Government were more promising. Accordingly, an under-taking had been given at that time that, if there were no unforeseendevelopments, the release of  10 million for 1953 would be made atthe beginning of the year. From the United Kingdom point of view the Agreement was most satisfactory. Without it, Egypt would be able in the Middle East now totalled no less that $726 million, it was to their advantage to support our Middle Eastern policy in the same way asAwe had supported the French in North Africa.The Foreign Secretary said he did not propose to inform theUnited States Government in advance of our plans for British troop movements and for the development of local levies in the persian gulf area and in the Trucial Sheikdoms. It would be better to putthese measures in hand and to explain their purpose to the Americansafter they had been taken.
,f&quot; i to draw freely upon her total sterling balances, which amounted to 179 million. A refusal to honour the Agreement or to allow anydrawings from sterling balances would snake world confidence in sterling and was incompatible with the position of the United King-dom as the banker for the sterling area. It was, moreover, of impor-tance to United Kingdom trade that the economy of Egypt, which was now in a perilous condition, should receive some support and, eventhough Egypt would pay for United Kingdom imports with thesesterling balances, that was better than the cessation of all trade. Thematter had not been brought to Cabinet since it had been regarded by both the Treasury and the Foreign Office as the routine working of a contractual arrangement.The Prime Minister said that he found it difficult to regard this as a routine matter. The releases already made had not improved theattitude of the Egyptian Government towards the United Kingdom;and, while it was right that international agreements should be kept,it was possible to make exceptions where the other party to an agree-ment had repudiated a treaty as Egypt had done.The Cabinet-(1) Took note that  10 million of Egypfs blocked sterling balances would be released in January, 1953, in accordancewith the Sterling Releases Agreement of July 1951.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to bring before theCabinet any proposal for further releases of Egypfssterling balances.House ofLords Reform.(previous reference:CC. (52) 49thConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of theCabinet (C. (52) 453) covering a memorandum which Lord Simon had sent to the Prime Minister about his proposed Bill to authorise thecreation of a limited number of life peers; and a memorandum by theLord President (C. (52) 454) commenting on Lord Simon&apos;smemorandum.The Lord President said that, when Lord Simon had warned him of his intention to introduce this Bill, he had explained that theGovernment would be unable to give it any encouragement. They had made plain their intention to convene an all-Party conference on the reform of the House of Lords, and they could not prejudice the resultsof this conference by supporting any limited measure of reform whichmight be proposed in the meantime. Lord Simon had later written tosuggest that, before his Bill came to its Second Reading on 3rd february-ary, he should put a Question to the Lord President about the all-Party conference and that, if he were assured that the Governmentwould proceed at once to convene the conference and would reportits result to Parliament by mid-summer, he would not ask that his ownBill should proceed beyond Second Reading.The Lord President said that he was anxious to proceed with theconference but was not willing to do so under a threat of this kind.He would prefer to ask Lord Simon to accept a statement on theSecond Reading of his Bill that the conference was being summoned,and to withdraw the Bill. He could not, of course, give any promise that the results of the conference would be available by mid-summer and in fact he had no expectation that the three Parties would find any common ground of agreement. An attempt must nevertheless bemade as a result of the pledge given at the time of the Election. If theconference failed, the Government would be free to make its own pro-posals, which might or might not include the suggestion for thecreation of life peers made by Lord Simon.The Prime Minister agreed with the course proposed by the lord president.  The Leaders  of the Opposition  Parties  should  be
consulted, as soon as Parliament re-assembled, about the basis which the three-Party conference might be convened.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord President to submit to the Prime Ministerdraft letters inviting the Leaders of the Opposition Partiesto co-operate in a three-Party conference on the reform ofthe House of Lords and proposing a basis on which thework of the conference might proceed.(2) Invited the Lord President to seek to persuade Lord Simonto withdraw his Bill for the creation of life peers on theunderstanding that a three-Party conference on the reform of the House of Lords was to be convened without delay.Alan Niinn 6.   The Foreign Secretary said that, as Alan Nunn May has nowMay. been released from prison, he had been considering whether any(Previous        application which he might make for the grant of a British passportReference:      should be refused. The precedents suggested that the Foreign Secre-C.C. (52) 105th tary had discretion to refuse a passport, or to confiscate a passportConclusions,    already issued, in certain classes of case including those very rareMinute 5.)       cases where the activities of an individual were so notoriouslyundesirable or dangerous that Parliament could be expected to upholdhis action in doing so.  He considered that this was such a case andthat, if May applied for a passport, his application should be rejected.The Home Secretary supported the view expressed by the foreign secretary.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s inten-tion to refuse any application for the grant of a British pass-port which might be made by Alan Nunn May.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,30th December, 1952.
