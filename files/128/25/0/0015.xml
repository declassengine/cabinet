corporal punishment.Parliament.2.   The Cabinet Were informed of the business to be taken in business in the  the House of Commons in the following week.House ofCommons.The&apos; Cabinet considered whether it would be possible to com-plete before the August Bank Holiday the remaining business whichhad to be transacted before the summer recess. This turned largely on the question whether time must be found before then for theSecond Reading of the Transport Bill and also for a debate on theproposed White Paper on the Iron and Steel Industry. The cabinet agreed that it was as yet too early to announce the date on which parliament would be adjourned.Iroa and SteelIndustry.Draft white paper.(previous reference:CC. (52) 53rdConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Minister ofSupply (C. (52) 219) covering a draft White Paper embodying theGovernments proposals for the future of the iron and steel industry.In discussion reference was made to the following paragraphs ofthe White Paper:  ,Paragraph 9. This acknowledgment that the return of com-panies to private ownership would take &quot; some years &quot; to completewould forestall suggestions that securities of the nationalisedcompanies were to be summarily sold at whatever loss or, if theprocess of disposal proved to be slow, that denationalisation was a failure.Paragraphs 11 and 17. Securities of nationalised companies wouldbe sold at prices determined, not by the amount of compensationpaid on nationalisation, but by the current value of the assets whichthey represented and in the light of &quot; monetary conditions and thegeneral level of security prices prevailing at the time.&quot; Conversely,Iron and Steel stock would be accepted in payment at its current market value.It was suggested that the inclusion of the words &quot; the general level of security prices &quot; would provide undue scope for difference ofopinion on the fair price for the securities, and that this phrase might with advantage be altered to &quot; monetary and market conditions pre-vailing at the time.&quot;Paragraph 12-The Minister of Transport said that the preference to be given to former shareholders in iron and steel companies wouldbe contrasted with the arrangements for disposing of transport unitsunder the Transport Bill. It had not been found practicable to give such a preference to road hauliers dispossessed at the time of the nationalisation of road transport.Paragraph 14.-It was suggested that the words &quot;in regard to theappointment of directors of companies &quot; implied too narrow a con-ception of the. use which might have to be made of the Agency&apos;sshareholding power and that the Agency ought not to be precluded1. The Cabinefs attention was drawn to the view expressed bythe Lord Chief Justice, in a public speech on 2nd July, that crimes of violence would be less common if Parliament restored to the courtstheir power to impose corporal punishment as a penalty for theseoffences.The Lord Chancellor and The Home Secretary said that the statistical evidence did not support Lord Goddard&apos;s contention. Sincethe power to order corporal punishment had been withdrawn from thecourts by the Criminal Justice Act, 1948, there had been no appre-appreciable increase in the incidence of those offences for which the courtshad previously had power to impose this penalty.The Home Secretary undertook to send a note on this point tothe Prime Minister.
at least from approving companies&apos; reports and accounts. In fact,the Agency ought to be free to exercise any of the normal rights ofshareholders.Paragraphs 25 and 26. It was suggested that paragraph 25emphasised unduly the need for Government intervention in indus-try. Paragraph 26, which explained the Governments intentionsregarding the exercise of emergency powers, should be retained; butparagraph 25 might be omitted.Paragraph 33. The Bill would have the effect of bringing under thecontrol of the Iron and Steel Board for certain purposes a number of smaller firms which under nationalisation had not been subject tosuch control, but this was essential if the Board&apos;s supervision of, forexample, prices was to be fully effective. The Board would, however,rely on civil proceedings for enforcement: there would be no criminalsanction.Appendix. The Minister of Supply had found it possible to dispense with the distinction previously made (in the draft Bill attached toC. (52) 108) between processes which the Act would automaticallycover and others to which it might subsequently be applied by Order.Processes now to be automatically covered would include steel cast-ing, although the smaller firms which constituted a majority of those engaged in this process were opposed to their inclusion and wouldbe likely to exert pressure in Parliament in favour of their exclusion.Iron or steel forging would also be covered. On the other hand, ironor steel drawing (apart from bright steel bars) and extrusion wouldbe excluded as well as drop-forging and production of bolts, nuts,screws, &amp;c.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to arrange for the Steel Com-mittee to consider outstanding points on the draft white paper, including those raised in the Cabinefs discussion.(2) Invited the Minister of Supply to submit a final draft of theWhite Paper for the Cabinefs consideration on 8th July.Time-table. The Lord Privy Seal said that, while he recognised that publica-.tion of the White Paper would reassure Government supporters andthe interests concerned as to the Governments intentions, he was doubtful about the wisdom of disclosing now the Governments plans for the future of the iron and steel industry if, as seemed inevitable,there was no real prospect of proceeding with the necessary legislationuntil some time in the following year.It v/as pointed out that the intention to present the transport bill to Parliament in the following week would in any case precludepublication of the White Paper on the Iron and Steel Industry until some time in the week beginning 14th July.The Cabinet-(3) Agreed to consider at their meeting on 8th July when theproposed White Paper should be published. .Road and Rail        4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secre-Transport.       tary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and PowerDraft Transport (C. (52) 218) covering a final draft of the Transport Bill.Bill. The Cabinefs discussion turned mainly on the railways&apos; interests(Previous in road passenger services. A provision had been re-inserted in the reference: Bill enabling the Minister, if he thought fit, to require the BritishCC. (52) 63rd &quot;Transport Commission to divest themselves of majority shareholdingsConclusions, in road passenger transport undertakings. The Commission had minute 6.) greatly increased such holdings since nationalisation- and now had a virtual monopoly in certain parts of the country, notably in Scotland.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this Clause appearedto be neither necessary nor desirable. It was his understanding thatthe power which the clause would confer was already available to theMinister under section 4(5) of the Transport Act, 1947. The inclusionof fresh powers for this purpose in the present Bill was likely to havea prejudicial effect on the Exchequer. These shareholdings had been acquired by the Commission at high prices and their enforced salewould result in financial loss by the Commission and possibly inpressure for a higher transport levy. The inclusion of the clausemight also, in his view, imperil good relations with the Commission.The Minister of Transport said that he had been advised thatthe proviso to section 4(5) of the Transport Act, 1947, would preclude the Minister from using the power conferred by that section for thepurpose which Clause 17(6) of the present Bill was intended to fulfil.The &quot;clause would be very acceptable to Government supporters inthe House and might well prove necessary to equip the Minister tocarry out the recommendations of the proposed Committee ofEnquiry into the licensing of road passenger services (see Minute 5below). He intended to make it plain that the power to be conferred by the clause would not be exercised at least until that Committeehad reported, and the Treasury would, of course, be consulted bothon the timing and on the nature of its exercise. The Commission had shown no special dislike for the clause.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet both on the need for the clause and on the likelihood that,as these were the most profitable sections of the Commission^ under-taking, substantial losses would not be incurred if they were sold.The following points were also made in the discussion:-(a) The Secretary of State for Scotland said that he did not now wish to press the suggestion, made in C. (52) 205, for an AdvisoryCommittee for Scotland, but care would have to be taken when theBill was published to explain how Scottish interests were to be safeguarded.(b) The Bill would probably now be published on Wednesday,9th July, and debated on Second Reading on 28th and 29th July.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in the light of the cabinet&apos;s discussion, to consult further with the Secretaryof State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and power on the need for Clause 17 (6) of the Bill.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1), approved the draft Bill annexed to C. (52) 218.(3) Invited the Lord Privy Seal, the Secretary of State forCo-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Power, theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the Ministerof Transport to agree upon a time-table for the presenta-tion and publication of the Bill in the following week.Road 5. The Minister of Transport said that he was anxious to pro-Passenger ceed with the proposal for an independent enquiry into the licensingServices. of road passenger services under the Road Traffic Act, 1930. ThereLicensing of were three main reasons why such an enquiry should now be held.Passenger First, the British Transport Commission had acquired majorityVehicles. holdings in a number of road passenger services;, and this in itself(Previous warranted a review of the considerations to which licensing authori-Reference: ties were required by the Act to have regard to determining applica-C.C. (52) 49th tions for road passenger service licences. Secondly, a new situationConclusions, had been created by the greatly increased disparity, in passenger fares,Minute 9.) between road and rail. Thirdly, a recent decision of the High Courtwas causing some difficulty in the operation of contract carriages for
private parties on special occasions; and some investigation was needed in order to determine what change should be made in the lawon this account.The Cabinet endorsed the proposal that a Departmental Com-mittee should be appointed for this purpose.The Prime Minister said that he would be glad to have anopportunity of discussing the composition of the Committee withthe Minister of Transport. The Minister should first ascertaininformally whether the persons whom he had in mind would be willing to serve on the Committee if they were asked to do so.The Cabinet &apos; -        - &apos;       &quot; - &apos; - - - -(1) Approved the proposal that a Departmental Committeeshould be appointed to review, in the light of currentconditions, the operation of the provisions of the road traffic Act, 1930, relating to the licensing of public road passenger services.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport to consult with the PrimeMinister regarding the composition of the proposed committee.6. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary of Statefor Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Power and the Ministerof Fuel and Power (C. (52) 194), and by the Secretary of State forScotland (C. (52) 198) on the question whether open-cast coal-miningoperations should be undertaken on certain sites which had beenprospected in East Lothian.,The Minister of Fuel and Power said that this question had beenbrought before the Cabinet in pursuance of the request which theyhad made when they discussed it earlier on 27th May. He, however,had come to the conclusion that, despite the richness of the coaldeposits which had been discovered on these sites, it would be inexpedient to work them. This land was of such high agriculturalvalue that strong resentment would be aroused, both locally and in agricultural circles throughout the country, if open-cast operations were undertaken there. He recognised that the policy of workingopen-cast deposits could only succeed if care was taken to avoidoutraging agricultural opinion.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that he would have beenglad if it could have been decided as a general principle that open-cast coal-mining operations should not be undertaken on any high-grade agricultural land.The Cabinet-Agreed that open-cast working should not be undertaken on the sites in East Lothian mentioned in C. (52) 194and 198.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,3rd July, 1952.Coal.Open-castWorking in east Lothian.(previous reference:CC. (52) 56thConclusions,Minute 4.)
