The Cabinet took note of the terms of the reply which wasbeing sent, in agreement with the Governments of the United Statesand France; to the latest Soviet note proposing Four-Power discus-sions with a view to the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.2. The Minister of Defence made a report to the Cabinet onhis visit to Paris to discuss with the French Minister of NationalDefence technical questions affecting the association of British forces with the forces of the European Defence Community. These dis-cussions had been conducted in a frank and friendly atmosphere;but the French seemed obsessed with the logistical difficulties of joint military operations by forces drawing their supplies from differ-ent countries, and they had evidently not yet overcome their dis-appointment at our unwillingness to become full members of theEuropean Defence Community. Agreement had now been reached,however, on the practical step of initiating joint staff discussions on methods of associating the British forces with the forces of theCommunity in matters of training, administration and supply.In discussion attention was drawn to news reports that units ofthe future German forces might receive training in this country.The Minister of Defence said that no such statement had been madein the course of his conversations in Paris. There might beoppor-tunities of correcting this misrepresentation in the forthcoming debate in the House of Commons on Foreign Affairs. vThe Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Minister of Defence.3. The Cabinet discussed their tactics for handling the debate in the House of Commons on 16th May on a Private Memberismotion proposing the early introduction of equal pay for men andwomen in the public service. They agreed that it would be inexpedi-ent to seek to carry a Government amendment to this motion. this might be represented in the country as implying opposition to theprinciple of equal pay; and it would be unusual, and unpopular, toissue a Government Whip for a division on a Private Memberismotion on a Friday. The Cabinet agreed that the governments attitude should be stated in the debate by the Financial Secretaryto the Treasury, who should explain that the general economicsituation was likely to make it impossible to implement the principleof equal pay for some time to come; but, as the motion was the firstOrder of the Day, it was likely to be carried to a division.4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord President(C. (52) 156) submitting a further revision of paragraphs 7 to 10 ofthe draft White Paper on Broadcasting, which had been drawn up inthe light of discussions which he had held, in association with theHome Secretary and the Postmaster-General, with government supporters in the House of Commons.The Lord President said that it had been impossible to persuadethose Government supporters to accept the terms of the previousdraft, which had deferred any decision in favour of sponsored broad-casting. They had indicated that they would prefer a total rejection of their views to the very partial acceptance of them which that draftinvolved. In view of their attitude, he and his colleagues had reachedthe conclusion that it would be expedient to amend the relevant
paragraphs of the White Paper as shown in C. (52) 156. The new!draft would commit the Government (and the House of Commonsif it endorsed the White Paper in this form) to an expression of opinion in favour of competitive television; but all reference to commercialbroadcasting had been omitted, and Parliament would have anopportunity of determining the terms and conditions under whichcompetitive television would operate before the first licence was issued.The general opinion of the Cabinet was that, in view of the stateof Parliamentary opinion, the new version of paragraphs 7 to 10 ofthe White Paper should be adopted. Discussion turned mainly onthe reception which this policy was likely to meet in Parliament. an overwhelming majority of Government supporters, especially in theHouse of Commons, would welcome the expression of opinion infavour of competitive television; and there were good prospects,though by no means a certainty, that this body of opinion would obtain the adherence of all Government supporters in any division in the House of Commons. It would not be practicable to debate theWhite Paper in that House before 9th June; but a valuable indication of the trend of Parliamentary opinion would be given by a debate in the House of Lords, which could be held on an earlier date.The Prime Minister said that he would prefer that paragraph 25of the White Paper should be amended to read: &quot; The government agree that there should be no Minister for broadcasting as such.The Postmaster-General will continue to be responsible for the exer-cise of the Governments powers under the general authority and direction of the Prime Minister.&quot;The Cabinet (1) Invited the Postmaster-General to amend paragraphs 7 to 10of the draft White Paper on Broadcasting as suggestedby the Lord President in C. (52) 156, and paragraph 25as suggested by the Prime Minister in the cabinets discussion; and to make it available to Parliament on the evening of 15th May.(2) Agreed that the White Paper should be debated in the Houseof Commons on 9th June and in the House of Lords on an earlier date.Meat Supplies.        5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the purchases Chancellor. of the Exchequer (C. (52) 154) and a note by the Lordfrom South President (C. (52) 158) on the policy to be adopted in negotiationsAmerica. with Argentina and Uruguay for the purchase of meat.(Previous The Chancellor of the Exchequer, in his memorandum, recalledReference:      that the Cabinet had previously decided to limit the current year&apos;sC.C. (52) 32nd   expenditure on South American meat to  30 million.   The Argen-Conclusions,     tine Government had now offered 200,000 tons of carcase meat at aMinute7.)       price of  192 per ton. The Chancellor suggested,that, in view of thefinancial limit, we should now decide to buy only 160,000 tons in argentina, on the assumption that we should later agree to buy40,000 tons in Uruguay; though we should, at a suitable moment,indicate to the Argentines that we should be ready to buy more meat to the extent to which they proved ready to buy more less-essential imports from this country. The price of the meat was still subject to negotiation, but the procedure suggested involved some risk whichthe Chancellor was willing to accept that we might spend rather more than  30 million on South American meat.The Lord President and The Minister of Food expressed deepconcern about the shortage of meat. Consumption per head of popu-lation was now only 60 per cent, of pre-war consumption, and in viewof the other heavy reductions in food imports made by the present government, we ought now to buy in South America all the meatwe could.   The Argentines had made great efforts to provide more
R4Meat prices and Rations.Germany.Manufactureof guided missiles.(previous references:C.C. (52) 18thConclusions,Minute 2 and50th Con-   .elusions,Minute 2.)meat for export to this country and we should find it difficult tojustify, either to them or to public opinion in this country, limitingour purchases on financial grounds. If we indicated to the Argentinesthat we were prepared to buy only 160,000 tons, this would causethem to increase their price, so that we should obtain less meat fora given sum of money. We should aim to increase trading exchangeswith the Argentine in both directions rather than to limit them.The view of the Cabinet was that we should not at this stagedecide to limit our purchases below the amount of meat which wason offer. We should rather indicate that, while our aim was to buy the whole of the 200,000 tons available in the Argentine, our ability to do so must be affected not only by the price at which we could buyit but by the willingness of the Argentines to buy from us moreless-essential goods, such as textiles.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this proposal was acceptable to him. He would be willing that there should be addedto the  30 million already earmarked for the purchase of south american meat, the proceeds of any additional exports to Argentinaand Uruguay of goods which could not be sold in other markets for hard currencies. He fully accepted the importance of meatimports and would look again at the general import programme tosee whether any economies could if necessary be made in other directions in order to make more resources available for them.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Governments aim in the current negotia-tions on meat imports from South America should be tosecure all the meat which could be made available, providedthat reasonable prices could be negotiated; and that, ifArgentina and Uruguay could be persuaded to increase their purchases of less-essential United Kingdom exports, the proceeds might so far as necessary be added to the sum of 30 million which the Cabinet had provisionally allocated for South American meat purchases on 20th March.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Food (C. (52) 153) setting out the main changes in meatprices which were foreshadowed by the Budget statement of theChancellor of the Exchequer that meat prices would rise by anaverage of Ad. per lb. The approximate equivalent of the presentation of Is. 2d. would be Is. 5d. at the new prices; and the present level of supplies would allow the weekly ration to be increased toIs. Id. Both changes would take effect on 15th June.The Cabinet Approved the changes in meat prices and rations, proposedin C. (52) 153; and authorised the Minister of Food to announce them to Parliament on 15th May.7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theForeign Secretary (subsequently circulated as C. (52) 161) regardingthe German claim that they should be free to manufacture inGermany short-range guided weapons, particularly for anti-aircraft defence, subject to the general procedure for regulating armamentsproduction which was to be embodied in the Treaty establishing theEuropean Defence Community.The Foreign Secretary said that, when the control of Germany&apos;production  of armaments had been discussed in London in February,the Federal Chancellor had agreed that guided weapons should notbe manufactured in Germany except with the consent of the ministerial Council of the European Defence Community.   Sub-
United Nations 8. The Cabinefs attention was drawn to the activities of theAssociation. United Nations Association in organising a series of meetingsdesigned to influence public opinion in this country against theGovernment^ African policy. The Association were alreadychampioning the cause of Seretse Khama, and were about to attack the proposal for the establishment of a Central African Federation.sequently, however, Dr. Adenauer had proposed the modification^indicated above. This claim had been resisted, in accordance withthe decision of the Defence Committee on 30th April, mainly on theground that these weapons should not be manufactured in an area which in war might be overrun by the enemy. We had, however,offered to discuss means by which the Germans could co-operate with other members of the European Defence Community, the americans and ourselves, in research and development work on short-range guided weapons. The Germans had now proposed thatthere should be a common programme of research and development,with German participation in production, to the exclusion of allnational programmes. The Foreign Secretary set out in paragraph 4of his paper four possible methods of dealing with this situation.In discussion attention was drawn to the danger of allowingmanufacture of these weapons in Germany. The Germans were likely to devote great energy to this work, and they would do their utmost to organise the research in such a way as to advance their knowledge of long-range guided weapons. They might also succeed in attracting to their research establishments German scientists whowere now doing valuable work on these projects in this country.British public opinion would certainly be apprehensive, in view of theGerman development of the V 2 weapon in the last war, about anyresumption of German research on this type of weapon.On the other hand, the Cabinet recognised that there would beoverriding security objections to admitting Germany to knowledge ofour. own progress in the development of these weapons, throughGerman participation in a common programme of research, develop-ment and production. It was also argued that it would be difficult to deny to an independent Germany the means of manufacturing theonly effective modern weapon of anti-aircraft defence. There weresound technical reasons for the view that, if their work was confined to short-range defensive weapons of a limited size, they would thereby gain little knowledge of the wholly different scientific prob-lems of manufacturing long-range guided weapons. Finally, therewas little immediate risk of Germany&apos;s resurgence as an aggressivemilitary Power; and for many years to come the overwhelmingAmerican strength in atomic weapons would effectively deterGermany from turning against the Western Powers.The Cabinefs conclusion was that the balance of advantage layon the side of allowing a limited manufacture of these weapons inGermany, subject to suitable safeguards.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that no further attempt should be made to preventthe manufacture in Germany of short-range guided weapons for anti-aircraft defence, provided that manu-facture was limited to weapons not exceeding 2 metresin length and that all research, development and produc-tion work was located as far as practicable to the west ofGermany.(2) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to instruct his representa-tive to put this proposal forward in the discussions whichwere now proceeding between representatives of the occupying Powers and of the German Federal Govern-ment.
The Cabinet agreed that, if these activities continued, seniormembers of the Government who were now prominently associatedwith this organisation would have to dissociate themselves from it.The Foreign Secretary undertook to consider, in consultationwith the Commonwealth Secretary, what steps could be taken to persuade the Association to discontinue these activities.(Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,13th May, 1952.
