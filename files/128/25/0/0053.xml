CommonwealthEconomicConference.multilateral trade and payments.(previous reference:CC. (52) 92ndConclusions,Minute 1.)1.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ForeignerSecretary (C. (52) 430) covering a statement which he proposed tomake at the meeting of the Conference that afternoon.The Foreign Secretary said that the Commonwealth EconomicConference had made good progress with all its work, including theproposals for an approach to a system of multilateral trade and pay-ments. One particular point of difficulty had, however, emerged. Itwas an integral part of the scheme for limited convertibility of sterlingthat all members of the sterling area should maintain fixed rates withsterling after sterling had become convertible&apos;at a flexible rate. Therepresentatives of India, Pakistan and Ceylon found it impossible togive an undertaking at this stage that they would maintain a de factolink with sterling, though the Indian Finance Minister had expressedthe view that there was a 95 per cent, likelihood that when the time came India would decide to link her currency with sterling.The Foreign Secretary said that in his opinion it would beimpossible to continue with the plan unless all members of the sterling area came into it. He was prepared that the plan should be putinformally to the United States Government on the supposition thatall members of the Commonwealth sterling area would agree to keep their currencies in step with sterling; but before any formal Ministerialnegotiations were opened with the United States or other Govern-ments the Asian members of the Commonwealth must have taken a firm decision on this point. If the Conference accepted the plan on this basis, it could be put to the Americans informally in the firstinstance by Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington. When the americans had formulated their comments or any alternative pro-posals they might prefer, the attitude of the Asian members of theCommonwealth must be clearly defined before formal Ministerialdiscussions began.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) If India, Pakistan and Ceylon were allowed to link their currencies with the dollar it would be equivalent to the break-up ofthe sterling area. Australia would certainly wish to be free to enjoy the advantages of a link with the dollar. More difficult still wouldbe the position of many of the Colonial territories, which were the biggest contributors to the dollar reserves.(b) The difficulty of choice which faced India was political ratherthan economic. For technical reasons legislation would be requiredin the Indian Parliament to give effect to a link with sterling, and inthat process the Indian Government would lay themselves open tothe criticism that they were reversing a step taken after the transferof power. The Indian Finance Minister was evidently under closeinstructions from his Government on this point.(c) It was the general view of Ministers that the plan should notbe pressed at the expense of the unity of the sterling Commonwealth.If contrary to expectations India, Pakistan and Ceylon refused to linktheir currencies with sterling, then the plan would have to be abandoned, and either a different plan would be considered in its place or the sterling area would continue on its existing basis.(d) The Paymaster-General said that he was concerned lest the safeguards which had originally been envisaged as pre-conditions ofthis plan should be discarded in the course of the negotiations at theConference. Thus, it had originally been assumed that quantitative restrictions would be abolished, but it now appeared that mostCommonwealth countries wished to retain them for some considerable time. Another of the original pre-conditions had been definiteapproval by the United States Congress for a support fund; but it now seemed to be thought sufficient to rely on assurances by theUnited States Government. We also seemed to be prepared to con-template the break-up of the European Payments Union. Finally,he was concerned at the proposal that the drawings on the Inter-national Monetary Fund should&apos; be reviewed at annual intervals when
141 C.C. 103 (52)the other members of the Fund would have the right to scrutinise theinternal policies of the Governments concerned.In reply it was pointed out that quantitative restrictions were tobe abolished only to the extent that the dollar gap was reduced; andit might not be in our interest to abandon altogether our own rightto retain quantitative restrictions. There was no intention to embark upon the limited convertibility scheme until the support of the UnitedStates had been fully assured and a support fund was actually inexistence. It was also an integral part of the plan that the co-opera-tion of the leading countries of Europe would be secured; and theEuropean Payments Union would therefore be abandoned only for alternative arrangements which those countries fully approved. Asregards the International Monetary Fund, the latest proposalsenvisaged a committee which would be purely advisory and the pro-posal for an annual review had now been abandoned. Finally, it hadbeen made abundantly clear throughout the Conference that the plan for limited convertibility of sterling would not be launched unlessthe United Kingdom Government and other Governments concerned were fully satisfied, when the time came, that the circumstances were such that it had a reasonable prospect of success.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were evidently agreed that the Foreign Secretary should makea statement to the Conference on the lines suggested in the annex to C. (52) 430. If the representatives of the Asiatic countries accepted this position, the plan could be put informally to the Americans, inthe first instance; but before any formal Ministerial negotiations were opened with the Americans, the Asian members of the commonwealth would have to take a firm decision. If they then refused to link their currencies with sterling, the present plan would have to be abandonedin order that the unity of the sterling Commonwealth might be preserved.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to make his proposed statement to the Commonwealth Economic Conferencelater in the day.Imperial The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that, with thePreference. exception of Australia and Southern Rhodesia, there had been no support for the proposal for a general extension of imperial preference.Officials of all the Commonwealth Delegations had, however, been persuaded to recommend that their Governments should support an approach by the United Kingdom to the contracting parties to theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.) to permit theUnited Kingdom to raise tariffs against foreign countries and at thesame time to give freedom of entry to Commonwealth goods. this could be represented as an interpretation of the G.A.T.T. rules. Ithad also been agreed that the particular difficulty of accordablepreferences for Colonial territories should not at this stage, be raised with G.A.T.T. as a general proposition, but that each particularinstance of difficulty should be dealt with as it arose.It was pointed out in discussion that this meant that imperial preference was no longer to be regarded as an effective instrument of Commonwealth economic policy. The Foreign Secretary under-took to ask the Commonwealth Economic Conference if they wereprepared that the United Kingdom Government should explain totheir supporters that opposition to imperial preference had come fromall the other Commonwealth countries except Australia and SouthernRhodesia.The Cabinet-(2) Took note of this statement by the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster.
Pacific Defence.       2.   The Prime Minister said lhat he had had some discussion(Previous        with the Prime Ministers of Australia and.New Zealand about the reference:      Pacific Pact (ANZUS) and the refusal to admit the United KingdomCC. (52) 8lst   into its deliberations.   He had found them anxious to arrive at conclusions.    some form of understanding. Their presence in the United KingdomMinute 3.)       had marked once more the unity of the Commonwealth and to that extent had lessened his misgivings about the exclusion of the UnitedKingdom from ANZUS.    There would be a further opportunityfor discussing this problem after the meeting on defence policywhich was to be held with the representatives of the older Common-wealth countries on Thursday, 11th December.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Minister^ statement.Pakistan.constitutional developments.3. The Commonwealth Secretary said that the Prime Ministerof Pakistan had told him that the Committee which was framing anew constitution for Pakistan was about to recommend that Pakistanshould have the status of a Republic within the Commonwealth. TheCommittee&apos;s report would be published before the end of the year for submission to the Constituent Assembly but no final decisions on it were likely to be taken until after the Coronation. Mr. Nazimuddinhad suggested that this position should be explained to the Common-wealth Economic Conference, but the Commonwealth Secretary hadobjected that no prior notice had been given, that the matter wasnot relevant to the Conference and should not be discussed in theabsence of the Prime Ministers of India and South Africa. On the merits Mr. Nazimuddin had argued that Pakistan had in practicederived no advantage over India by reason of her continued allegiance to the Crown: on the contrary, he maintained that- India had on thewhole received the more favourable treatment at the hands of theUnited Kingdom Government., The Prime Minister said that he did not believe that this stepwas in the true interests of Pakistan and he hoped that every effort would be made to dissuade her from it.The Cabinet-Agreed that forthcoming constitutional changes in Pakistancould not suitably be discussed during the commonwealth economic Conference.Kashmir.(previous reference:CC (52) 60thConclusions,Minute 10.)4. At the request of the Prime Minister the commonwealth secretary undertook to circulate a paper to the Cabinet summarising the latest developments in the United Nations discussions on Kashmir.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,8th December, 1952.
