ly-Elections.&apos;&apos;5peechesby .Ministers.(previous reference:CC. (52) 31stConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Prime Minister said that the forthcoming by-election at high Wycombe was of such importance that the Cabinet should consider whether it warranted a departure from the tradition that cabinet Ministers did not speak in by-elections.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat on this occasion an exception should be made from the normal rule. It was agreed that it would suffice if one member of the Cabinetspoke in the High Wycombe election; and the Chief Whip was invitedto make arrangements accordingly.The Cabinet also agreed that no change should be made, byreason of this by-election, in the arrangements already made for party political broadcasts for the current quarter.Judges&apos;Salaries.^previous reference:CC. (51) 5thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Lord Chancellor(C. (52) 321 and 345) and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (52) 334)regarding the need to increase the remuneration of Judges of the HighCourt.The Lord Chancellor said that it was clear, from preliminaryconsultations which he had held, that there was general agreement among his colleagues that some improvement should be made in thefinancial position *of the Judges. The main question for decision bythe Cabinet was the method by which this should be done. there seemed to be a general disposition against granting an increase in salary; and the choice seemed to be to lie between granting a tax-freeallowance in addition to the existing salary, or.providing that some part of the existing salary should be free of tax.The Prime Minister said that a High Court Judge was in a uniqueposition, and was not to be compared with the holder of any otheroffice in public service. This had been marked by the quite excep-tional level of the salary fixed in 1832. The position and respect thusaccorded to the Judges had enabled them to maintain, throughouta hundred years and more, the unrivalled reputation of the EnglishBench for integrity and impartiality of judgment. This was a nationalasset which the Conservative Party should feel honoured to uphold.It could not be maintained if leading barristers were unwilling toaccept appointments to the Bench or, even worse, if Judges should feel obliged for financial reasons to resume practice at the Bar. Therewas in his view an overwhelming case for putting the Judges well beyond the possibility of financial embarrassment, and he thoughtthat the proper course was to arrange that  2,000 of a Judge&apos;s salaryshould be free of all taxation. This would follow the precedentcreated by the Labour Government, who had arranged for  4,000of the Prime Ministers salary to be free of tax.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this tax concession to the Prime Minister was based on the expenses which he necessarilyincurred in the performance of his official duties. It was admitted that the Judges had no necessary expenses connected with their workwhich would afford anything like the relief which it was desired togive them. Under the existing law the Board of Inland Revenue hadno authority to grant tax-free allowances to the Judges of anything like the amount which the Lord Chancellor and the Prime Ministernow had in mind. If a tax concession of this order was to be made,it would have to be authorised by special legislation. The Judgeswould then be the only members of the community to enjoy a sub-stantial tax-free allowance quite unrelated to the expenses necessaryfor the performance of their duties. Might they not feel that thisplaced them in a somewhat invidious position?It was the general view of the Cabinet that a concession of thiskind could be justified, especially if it were authorised by specificlegislation, on the ground that the Judges occupied a unique positionin the communitv.43318-3b 2
Borrowingby LocalAuthorities.(previous reference:C.G. (52) 85thConclusions,Minute 8.)3. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the memorandumby the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (52) 328) proposing a modifi-cation of the local loans procedure.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that, sincethe Cabinefs meeting on 14th October, he had had an opportunityof discussing this scheme with the Chancellor of the Exchequer andof commenting on the draft of the public statement which it was proposed to make about it. As a result, he was now prepared tosupport the scheme, on the understanding that nothing would besaid at this stage about the limits which might be set to local authority expenditure at the time of the next Budget. He thought that theCabinet should understand that the scheme would not in itself deter -mine the limits of local authority expenditure: that would continueto rest within the discretion of the Cabinet.The Cabinet-Agreed that Section 1 of the Local Authorities Loans Act,1945, should be allowed to lapse at the end of 1952; and authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to negotiate withthe local authorities the scheme outlined in C. (52) 328 for regulating the local authority borrowing in future years.Balance of 4.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had beenPayments. considering whether a larger allowance of foreign currency could beTourist made, in the coming year, to persons going abroad on holiday.  HeAllowance. had come to the conclusion that he would not at present be justified(Previous in raising the existing limit of  25 for adults.  He proposed, however,Reference: to make a small concession to &quot;families by arranging that the fullC.C. (52) 6th allowance should be given to children over twelve years of age and conclusions, not, as at present, only to children over fifteen years of age. jMinute 2.) &apos;&quot;&apos;The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.The Cabinet were informed that the Secretary of State foi(]ypScotland, who was unable to be present, wished to put forward a claim on behalf of the Scottish Judges, not merely that they shouldreceive a tax concession comparable to any granted to the EnglishJudges, but also that their remuneration should be brought more closely into line with that of the English Judges.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that the remuneration of the Judgesshould be improved by arranging for a proportion of theirexisting annual salary to be exempted from all taxation;took note that legislation would be required for thispurpose; and invited the Lord Chancellor and theChancellor of the Exchequer to work out a detailed scheme and submit it for final approval by the Cabinet.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor to discuss with the Secretary ofState for Scotland how corresponding concessions could best be made to the Judges of Scottish Courts.
Kenya. 5.   j/ie Colonial Secretary informed the Cabinet that a state of,; Previous emergency had been declared in Kenya on the previous day and the reference: plans for detaining the leaders of the Kenya African Union were beingCC. (52) 85th put into operation. The arrests had been timed to coincide with theConclusions, arrival of the British battalion from Egypt. The troops at the disposalMinute l.)       the Governor in the event of serious disturbances now amounted toabout 3i battalions of the King&apos;s African Rifles, in addition to theBritish battalion.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Colonial Secretary.Preservation 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Historic      of Works (C. (52) 342) asking approval for the introduction of a shortBuildings.       Bill during the forthcoming session giving him power to make grants for the preservation of historic buildings.The Minister of Works said that the object of the Bill would beto enable him to make grants towards the maintenance of inhabitedbuildings up to an annual sum of  250,000 to  300,000. It would alsoempower him to make purchases of historic buildings out of the LandFund up to a total of  500,000 in the next five years. His intention was that the Ministry of Works should look after those houses forwhich no private occupier could be found (e.g-, houses that becamemuseums or were occupied by some Government Department) andthat the National Trust in England and Wales should act in respectof privately-inhabited houses. The scheme applied to England andWales: he was discussing arrangements for Scotland with theSecretary of State for Scotland. It should be possible to keep theBill very short. He believed that it would be welcomed by theOpposition and he hoped that a reference to if might be included inThe Queen&apos;s Speech.&apos;The Cabinet-Approved the preparation of legislation giving power to theMinister of Works to make grants for the preservation of historic buildings on the lines proposed in C. (52) 342.The Coronation. 7. The Prime Minister said that Ministers should take note of(Previous public comment on the proposed arrangements for the Coronation.Reference: It would be helpful if the Minister of Works would circulate a paperCC. (52) 67th setting out the main points of criticism and the arguments in favourConclusions,    of the arrangements proposed.MmulL 8 The Cabinefs discussion turned mainly on the question whetherthe Coronation ceremony within the Abbey should be televised. Intheir earlier discussions on this point the Cabinet had been influenced by the importance of avoiding unnecessary strain for Her majesty and upholding the sanctity of the ceremony. Some Ministers feltthat this decision might be reviewed in the light of the serious publicdisappointment which it had caused.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Works to circulate a paper setting outthe arguments in favour of certain arrangements for the coronation which were now the subject of public criticism.(2) Invited the Prime Minister to arrange for the question oftelevising the Coronation ceremony within the Abbey tobe reviewed by a small group of Ministers, in consultationwith the Archbishop of Canterbury^ the Earl Marshal andthe Dean of Westminster.
CivilEmergencies.Use of troops to maintainEssentialServices.8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (52) 344) proposing that the Emergency Laws (Miscef.laneous Provisions) Bill should include a clause to make permanentthe provisions of Regulation 6 of the Defence (Armed Forces)Regulations which authorised the Admiralty, the Army Council andthe Air Council to employ troops on agricultural work or other urgentwork of national importance.The Home Secretary said that all Departments agreed that thepower to use troops for these purposes must be retained in some formor other. The previous Government had exercised this powerthrough Defence Regulations, but it was the policy of the present government to reduce as rapidly as possible, their dependence on waremergency powers. In his view there would never be a more favour-able time than the present for embodying this particular power in permanent legislation.The Minister of Labour, while fully agreeing that the power was needed, argued that .any proposal to embody it in permanent legislation at the present time would lead to unnecessary and undesirable disputes with Trade Union leaders and suspicions of theGovernments intentions. He hoped therefore that the Cabinet would continue to rely for this purpose on the Defence Regulations.The Cabinet-Decided that Regulation 6 of the Defence (Armed Forces)Regulations should be continued by Order in Council underthe Supplies and Services Acts and not included in theEmergency Laws (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.Wages.EngineeringandShipbuildingIndustries.(previous reference:C.C. (52.) 81stConclusions,Minute 9.)9. The Minister of Labour said that a meeting was to take placethat day between representatives of both sides of the engineering and shipbuilding industries, and he hoped that as a result of these nego-tiations an acceptable wage increase would be offered. The situation was likely to be difficult for some days and it was the main concern of his Department to see that the negotiations did not break down.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,21st October, 1952.
