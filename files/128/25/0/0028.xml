Persia.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 77thConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The Foreign Secretary said that he was following up by every possible means the joint approach which had been made to thePersian Government by the President and the Prime Minister, and,provided the United States Government would stand firm, therewas a good chance that the Majlis might prevail on Dr. Mussadiqto come to terms. Friendly Governments were being asked to advise the Persian Government to accept the offer. No further action couldbe taken for the time being. All exports to Persia had been stoppedbut it seemed desirable to release sixteen locomotives which had been specially manufactured for the Persian railway and had been paid for.He did not think there would be any harm in releasing theselocomotives after the Majlis had met.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.Egypt.      t(previous reference:C.C. (52) 76thConclusions,Minute 6.)2. The Foreign Secretary said that there was little new to report about the situation in Egypt, which remained somewhat precarious.We were giving what help we could to the Egyptian Government,and were releasing some non-operational equipment to the EgyptianAir Force.In discussion it was suggested that it might be possible to bring home from Egypt some of the large number of troops now in the canal Zone, with a view to increasing the feeling of detente. It waspointed out that three battalions were already under orders to comehome, a movement which was possible because of the presence of aMarine Commando Brigade at Malta, and it would be difficult to do much more without giving rise to the impression that we wereweakening ourselves unduly.The Minister of Defence suggested that closer direct contact between the British forces and the Egyptian Army might be a valuableway of stimulating friendship.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theMinister of Defence, to explore the possibility of action onthe lines suggested in the discussion.TheStraffen 3.   The Home Secretary informed the Cabinet that he hadCase. decided that Straffen should be kept in prison for at least two yearsand should not be returned to Broadmoor, at any rate for a consider-able time to come. In the normal course of events, a convict servinga life sentence was released after twelve or fifteen years, if his conduct was satisfactory. The action to be taken in Straffen&apos;s case would lie with the Home Secretary of the day, but he had recordedhis opinion that unless there was a marked change in Straffen&apos;s mentalstate, he should not be released at all.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.Germany.ContractualSettlements.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 76thConclusions,Minute 7.)4. The Foreign Secretary reminded the Cabinet that he had proposed to issue to the public a popular pamphlet and a leaflet on policy towards Germany. The pamphlet was to have been placed onsale under the auspices of the&quot; Central Office of Information, andthe leaflet was to have been distributed free through Post Offices,Employment Exchanges, and National Insurance and Food Offices.On further examination it had been found that the political difficultieswhich stood in the way of the free distribution of the leaflets through these channels could not be overcome.   He therefore proposed to
International 5,   The Foreign Secretary said that Her Majesty&apos;s AmbassadorOil industry. in Washington had seen Mr. Bruce, in the absence of Mr. Acheson,and had reported that the American Administration was deeply con-cerned at the prospect of Federal Grand Jury proceedings against theInternational Oil Industry, including two British firms. It appeared that action had been initiated for domestic political advantagebut that, once launched, it would be very difficult to stop. Theposition of the British oil companies who had received a subpoenawas doubtful but, before any further action was taken, it would bedesirable to await the outcome of further discussion between sir Oliver Franks and Mr. Acheson, who had now returned to washington.The Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, fuel and Power said that the two British companies were not quite in thesame position. One, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, carried on their operations entirely outside United States jurisdiction, and merely hada representative in New York. The other, the Shell Oil Company,had a small subsidiary in the United States. There was nothing to be done at present except to manoeuvre for delay, but it might bedifficult to extend the delay up to the Presidential Election becauseaction against the American companies, which could not be post-poned, might carry with it action against the British companies. the repercussions of Federal Grand Jury proceedings might be mostserious.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement.German 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ForeignExternal Secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (52) 290) coveringDebts. the report of the Conference on German External Debts which hadtaken place in London between 28th February and 8th August.The Foreign Secretary said that, although the Germannegotiators had been difficult in the early days of the Conference,their attitude had become more accommodating in the course of thenegotiations, and the results of the Conference were satisfactory andhelpful. Provisional terms of settlement for Germany&apos;s post-war debts arising out of the economic assistance given by the occupying powers since the war had been worked out at the end of 1951, andthe Conference had in the main been concerned only with Germany&apos;spre-war debts. He hoped that the Cabinet could approve the settlements reached in both cases.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in his view the settle-ments had been skilfully negotiated and were as satisfactory as couldbe expected.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the report of the German Debts Conference and authorised the conclusion of an Inter-GovernmentalAgreement to give effect to it.(2) Agreed that the provisional settlement terms for the UnitedKingdom post-war claims on Germany should be con-firmed, and a bilateral agreement with the federal republic concluded to give effect to them.drop the idea of a leaflet, and to proceed only with the pamphlet,which would be placed on sale as originally proposed.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.
InternationalConventionon Genocide.7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary and the Home Secretary (C. (52) 271) raising the questionwhether the United Kingdom should accede to the Convention onthe Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.The Foreign Secretary said that the Convention was unanimouslyadopted at the Third Session of the General Assembly of the united nations in December, 1948, and had come into force in January, 1951.Up to date thirty-eight States had ratified or acceded to it. In theoryit was possible to accede with reservations, but he had come to theconclusion that that would be contrary to our general policy and thatwe should either accede or not accede.The Home Secretary explained that the purpose of the Conven-tion was to prohibit and punish acts committed with intent to destroyin whole or in part a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.The crime always had a political origin and, if the United Kingdomacceded to the Convention, it would be necessary to see exactly what legislation would be required to provide that all the acts ofgenocide set out in the Convention should be made criminal offences,that all such offences should be made extraditable crimes and thatthe fact that the offence was of a political character should be no barto the extradition of an offender, provided always that the request for extradition was based on a bona fide charge of genocide.The Prime Minister said that it would no doubt be necessary to accede to the Convention, but there was no hope of including thenecessary legislation in the next Session of Parliament. The Legisla-tive Programme was already overloaded with many more importantBills. The Bill could, however, be prepared in draft on the under-standing that Parliamentary time would not be found for it untilopportunity offered.The Cabinet-Invited the Home Secretary to prepare a draft of the bill which would be required if the United Kingdom acceded to the International Convention on Genocide and then tobring the matter before the Cabinet again.Town and 8.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that since the lastCountry discussion in Cabinet he had not changed his view that developmentPlanning Act, charge could not with equity be abolished. The only adequate alter-1947. native to development charge would be some kind of sales tax and he(Previous        was most anxious to avoid any tax of this kind.  He was, however,Reference:      now prepared to agree that development charge should be reducedCC. (52) 77th   to 60 per cent., that exemptions from charge should be further conclusions,    extended, and that charge should not be exacted at the outset of minute 4.)       development but after the development had taken place.  There wasno practical means of making a firm distinction between improve-ment which had been carried out by an owner and improvementwhich was purely fortuitous.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that his main anxiety was to stimulate private development in order that moreunsubsidised houses could be produced, thus saving the large sub-subsidies now being paid on the major portion of the housing programme.The abolition of development charge was the most effective way of achieving this. He recognised that some inequity would result fromabolition and that there was a danger that ultimately, if site valueswere restored to landlords, there might be exploitation. He thought,however, that attempts at exploitation could be effectively defeatedby the use of powers of compulsory purchase, which could ensurethat if land was needed for the benefit of the community only its use value would be paid.
The Commonwealth Secretary pointed out that the weapon of compulsory purchase would not altogether remove the inequities. Alandowner whose land was required for the purposes of the com-munity would receive only its use value, whereas the landowner whoseland was not so required would be free to sell his land at its fullmarket value.The Prime Minister said that he was impressed with the need toencourage private development, especially the building of unsub-subsidised houses. That could be achieved by the abolition of thedevelopment charge; and exploitation by landowners could be prevented by compulsory purchase, or by some other method ofdealing with objectionable cases. He thought that the differences between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of housing and Local Government had been narrowed by the discussion, and he hoped that they would be able to submit to the Cabinet agreedrecommendations on the best course to pursue.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerof Housing and Local Government to continue their dis-cussions on development charge, and to report further tothe next meeting of the Cabinet.Kent; 9.   The Prime Minister said that he had noticed reports of land-Restrictions lords abandoning their house property because they were unable toActs- keep it in repair.   He had wondered if these houses could not be purchased by the State for a small sum and turned over to theMinister of Housing and Local Government for repair, so that theycould be included in the total of living accommodation provided bythe housing programme.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) A large number of the houses which were being abandonedby landlords were beyond repair and ought to be pulled down.(b) The operation of the Rent Restrictions Acts made it impos-sible for landlords to undertake necessary repairs and a great manyadequate houses would fall into disuse unless action was taken. TheMinister of Housing and Local Government said that he had devisedschemes for dealing with this difficulty, but that they would require legislation.(c) While it was difficult to find room for more legislation in ahalready overloaded programme, any repeal of the Rent RestrictionsActs, or amendments to make possible increases in rents to enablelandlords to undertake repairs, would be particularly difficult tointroduce immediately before a General Election. Legislation was urgently required, as the situation grew worse each year; and, fromthe political point of view, the earlier it was introduced the better.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government to circulate a memorandum outlining his proposals for amend-ing the Rent Restrictions Acts.Ceylon.UnitedKingdomDefenceInstallations.10. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary (C. (52) 287) reporting the present state of negotiations with the Government of Ceylon about United Kingdomdefence installations there and recommending further action.The Commonwealth Secretary said that, although it was desirableto reach a comprehensive settlement with Ceylon, this was not vital.
Food Prices. 11.   The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that(Previous        increases in the prices of bacon, butter, margarine, sugar and cheeseReference:      were to come into force early in October at the same time as theC.C. (52) 67th   increase in family allowances, pensions, &amp;c, allowed for in theConclusions,    Budget.  This arrangement would now coincide with the difficultiesMinute 5.)       which were being encountered with the engineering unions, who had decided to impose a ban on overtime and piece-work. It was hoped,however, that, with the help of the Ministry of Labour, a settlementof the dispute in the engineering industry might be obtained, on thebasis of some modest increase in wages. It was likely that this settle-ment would be made more difficult if, in the course of negotiation,an announcement were made that there was to be a further increasein food prices.  He felt, therefore, that it might be wise to postponethis increase for a further two months.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The increase in the price of bacon would enable home-produced gammon to be sold at the low price of 85. per lb. It was estimated that the profit made on the sale of gammon could be usedto reduce the total weekly increase in food prices, resulting from theBudget, from Is. 6d. to Is. 3d. per head.(b) If increased prices were to take effect at the beginning ofOctober, discussions with the trade would have to begin on 11thSeptember and, *even without any formal announcement by theMinistry of Food, the price increases would then become public knowledge.(c) While a postponement in price increases for two monthsmight possibly facilitate negotiations with the engineering unions,there was no certainty that at the end of two months there would notbe some other reason for still further delays.The Prime Minister said that the loss of overtime would muchreduce the wages of men employed in the engineering industries andhe was by no means convinced that the ban would in fact be imposed.In any case, he hoped that a settlement would be found by which theemployers would agree to some small increase in wages. He felttherefore that it would be inappropriate to postpone the increase in food prices, which had been carefully timed to take place when theincreased family allowances, pensions, &amp;c, came into force. Con-sultation with the trade should therefore go forward as proposed,On the other hand, the Ceylon Government had now reopened thequestion arid were anxious to obtain certain items of equipment,especially one frigate. On our side we were anxious to retain the wireless station at Anderson for a further period to avoid the cost of replacement, which would be some  2 millions. If we were willingto lend Ceylon a frigate, for which they were prepared to pay the refit,it would ease the difficulties of retaining the wireless station atAnderson and remove the risk of obstructions to the purchase ofsome land which the Royal Air Force urgently needed for extendingtwo of their signal stations.The First Lord of the Admiralty confirmed that a frigate couldbe made available on the understanding that the Ceylon Governmentwould bear the cost of the refit.The Cabinet-Agreed that there was no need to take the initiative in trying to reach a comprehensive agreement for the tenure of ourbases in Ceylon, but that the offer of a frigate, which shouldbe refitted at their expense, should be made to the ceylon government in order to facilitate negotiations over the replacement of the wireless station at Anderson.
though any official announcement to the Press should be delayed aslong as possible, and should be carefully devised to make plain theadvantages which the increases in family allowances, pensions, &amp;c,conferred, and the lower rate of increase in food prices which was now possible.The Cabinet-Agreed that increases in food prices should take place as planned at the beginning of October, that consultations withthe trade should proceed, but that any official announce-ment of the increases should be delayed as long as possible and should emphasise the compensating advantages referredto in discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.I.,5th September, 1952.
