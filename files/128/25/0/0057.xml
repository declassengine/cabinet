1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (52) 450) on the attempt of the Saudi Arabians to extend their influence into the territories of the Trucial Sheikdoms in thePersian Gulf.The Foreign Secretary said that this policy of encroachment hadbeen encouraged by our failure to protect our interests at Abadan.These States along the western shore of the Persian Gulf, with theirlarge potential resources of oil, were of great importance to us, andit was most desirable that positive steps should be taken to deter the saudi Arabians from further incursions. It was doubtful whetherIbn Saud would accept our offer of arbitration, though there was some reason to suppose that the Americans might support this course.If he did not, it seemed necessary that we should make some show of force in the area, and take steps to build up the military strength ofthese small States to enable them to protect themselves. He under-stood that the Chiefs of Staff could make some small British forces available in the near future, and he recommended that action shouldbe taken concurrently to increase the Trucial Oman Levies to a totalof 300 or 400 men, and&apos;to provide a cadre for a force of 200 men for the Sultan of Muscat.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) A cruiser (H.M.S. Ceylon) and a frigate would be in thePersian Gulf from mid-January to mid-February and thereafter twofrigates would be there. Twelve R.A.F. armoured cars could besent from Iraq in mid-January, and one squadron of Vampires could also be sent for short periods. It would take about a month to concentrate this small force.(b) British forces could not remain indefinitely in the area, andan immediate start should therefore be made with the building upof the local levies. Consideration might also be given to thepossibility of employing the Aden Levies.The Prime Minister said that it was clear that as an immediatestep there should be some concentration of British forces in the area.He hoped that it would be possible to send in stronger forces thanthose suggested in the discussion. At the same time measures shouldbe put in hand to build up the local levies, and the Colonial secretary should examine the suggestion that the Aden Levies should also beused. This concentration of forces should take place as unobtrusivelyas possible.The Cabinet-(1) Invited&apos;the Foreign Secretary to renew his offer to submitthese frontier disputes to arbitration, and to ask the UnitedStates Government to press Ibn Saud to accept this offer.(2) Approved in principle the early movement of suitable british forces to the Trucial Sheikdoms and the initiation of measures to build up the strength of the local levies.(3) Instructed the Chiefs of Staff, in consultation with the Foreign, Office and Colonial Office, to set in hand the action to giveeffect to Conclusion (2) above and to examine the possi-;_bility of using the Aden Levies in this area.Persian Gulf.(previous reference:C.C.

-Sudan&quot;.(previous reference:CC. (52) 93rdConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (52) 448) describing the stage reached in the negotiationswith Egypt about the future of the Sudan and seeking the Cabinetsauthority, to make our agreement conditional upon the fulfilment ofcertain of our requirements.The Foreign Secretary said that the following major points were still outstanding:-(i) The Governor-General&apos;s special responsibility for the South.This must not, in his view, be made subject to the overriding decisionof the Commission which was to be established to advise the Governor-General. The latest indications were that the Egyptians might be pre-pared to depart from the attitude they had hitherto adopted on this .point.(ii) The powers of the Governor-General&apos;s Commission, particu-larly in relation to the Governor-General&apos;s powers in an emergency.There seemed to be a reasonable prospect that the Egyptians would meet our views on this point.The Colonial Secretary said that, although he recognised thatthere was no exact parallel between the- position in the Sudan and inBritish Colonial territories, he would be grateful if the Foreign Secre-tary would bear in mind&apos; the possible effect on opinion in certain british Colonies if the reserve powers of a Governor-General were seen to have been put into commission..(iii) The duration of the transitional period. We were resistingan Egyptian formula which would enable Egypt to veto self-determina-tion on the ground that British officials were still employed in theSudan service and thus to bring pressure to bear on the Sudanese to terminate their-employment. There seemed to be a reasonable pros-pect that the Egyptians would meet us on this point..(iv) The question whether the establishment and powers of theGovernor-General&apos;s Commission and any change in the safeguards forthe South should be submitted to the Sudan Parliament, when elected,for approval. The Governor-General considered that this should bedone, but the Egyptians argued, with some force, that these werematters for decision by the Co-Domini.The Foreign Secretary said that the new Egyptian Governmenthad made a significant advance by abandoning the claim to recogni-tion of Egypfs sovereignty over the Sudan and it would therefore be expedient that we should meet their views where this was possible. In, his view, we ought not to compromise on any of the points sum-marised in paragraphs (i) to (iii) above, even though this meant a break-down in the negotiations. On the point set out in paragraph (iv),however, we should not press our view to the prejudice of reaching an agreement.The Cabinet Approved the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposals.
Federation.   . President, the Commonwealth Secretary and the Colonial Secretary(Previous (C. (52) 445) recommending that, at. the Conference due to open in reference: London on 1st January, assurances should -be given to the otherC.C. (52) 60th. Governments concerned that Her Majesty&apos;s Government would be conclusions, prepared to proceed with the federal scheme for Southern Rhodesia,Minute 9.) Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland provided that it was accepted at&apos; the referendum in Southern Rhodesia and by the legislatures of the- . other two territories, and that certain basic features of the scheme (setout in paragraph 5 of C. (52) 445) were not impaired.The Colonial Secretary said.that there was now virtually no vocalAfrican support for Federation. If the Governments concerned pro-ceeded to bring the Federation into being there would almost certainly be disturbances in the Rhodesias and possibly in Nyasaland also. Inthis country, too, there would probably be a considerable politicaldemonstration, although there was reason to believe that the more responsible elements in the Labour Party accepted the case for Federa-tion, provided that adequate safeguards for African interests were retained. There was, however, no doubt that our ultimate difficulties would be.greater if we were now to abandon the proposal for Federa-tion in the face of opposition from vocal elements in this country andin Africa.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the federal scheme offeredpossibly the last opportunity for adopting in Africa a progressive policybased on the ideal of co-operation between the races. If we were nowto retreat on this issue, the days of British administration in Africawould be numbered and there was every likelihood fhat SouthernRhodesia would join the Union of South Africa.The Lord President said that failure to bring the Federation into being, if it should be accepted at the referendum in Southern rhodesia and by the legislatures in the other two territories, would represent a victory for extremist opinion.Discussion showed that there was general support in the cabinet for the course of action recommended in C. (52) 445.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (52) 445.
Persia. 5.   The ^Foreign Secretary said that, with a view to inducing(Previous        Dr. Musaddiq to agree that the terms of compensation to the Anglo-Reference:      Iranian Oil Company should be fixed by arbitration, the United StatesCC. (52) 89th   Government had instructed their Ambassador atTeheranto emphasiseConclusions, &apos; the material advantages which would accrue to Persia once such agree-Minute 4.)       ment was forthcoming. He had agreed thatin deploying this argumentthe United States Ambassador could point out that the UnitedKingdom Government had publicly affirmed that they would regard the arbitral tribunal as free to decide whether and to what extent com-, pensation for loss of the Concession should be awarded. He had also agreed that the Ambassador might indicate that, once the award hadbeen made, reasonable terms of payment could no doubt be arranged.It was very likely, however, that Dr. Musaddiq would continue to reject arbitration and in that event the United States government might well exert renewed pressure on us to agree to their trying to persuade the Persians to offer the Company a lump sum of $500million, to be paid in1 oil, by way of compensation. Although it waspossible that such a solution would yield a higher figure of compen-sationthan arbitration, we still attached great importance to preserving the arbitral principle. The Cabinet should, however, be aware that, ifthe Americans renewed their suggestion of a settlement on the basisof a lump-sum payment and we again rejected it, this would almost certainly -mean the end of Anglo-American co-operation in the handling of the dispute. It was also also possible that, if Dr. Musaddiqrejected the latest approach on the basis of arbitration, the americans would revive their proposal to offer $25 million to Persia for long-term development purposes.&apos; The Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and. Power said that, in his view, it was of great importance that we should- preserve the principle of arbitration.&apos; ;- .
