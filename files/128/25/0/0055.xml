1. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that a White paper had been presented to Parliament setting out the text of the press communique issued at the end of the Commonwealth EconomicConference. Opposition leaders would probably suggest, in addition,that some statement on the work of the Conference should be madein the House of Commons, on behalf of the Government.The Cabinet agreed that no such statement should be made inadvance of any general debate on the work of the Conference, andthat no time could be found for such a debate before the christmas recess.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that during the last fewdays he and the Foreign Secretary had had opportunities in Paris to speak confidentially about the work of the Conference to representa-tives of the United States Government and of the principal European;Governments. These preliminary conversations had passed offreasonably well, though there were signs of future difficulty in handling the Italians.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.2. The Cabinet had. before them memoranda by the Ministerof Supply (C. (52) 307 (Revise) and C. (52) 331) seeking the cabinet&apos;s approval for the according of special priority,, under the scheme approved by the Cabinet on 13th March, to the production of:  (i) B.35 bomber aircraft,(ii) Comet, Britannia and Viscount civil aircraft.The Minister of Supply said that the special priority scheme wasin practice advancing delivery dates by six to eighteen months without detriment to engineering production generally. The global strategy;recently approved by the Defence Committee required the earliestpossible delivery of the B.35 bomber aircraft already on order. Inthe production of the latest types- of civil aircraft this country couldretain its lead over foreign competitors only if the delivery dates ofthe most promising types Comet, Britannia and Viscount wereadvanced as far as possible.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said&apos; that he was concerned atthis proposal on two- counts. First, the excess of expenditure overestimates for 1952-53 on the Vote for the Ministry of Supply now amounted to some  63 J millions, a substantial proportion of whichcould be attributed to the effect of the special priority scheme.Secondly, it seemed difficult to-justify the according of. special priorityconcurrently to three types of jet bomber aircraft, namely, the Valiantand two types of B.35. This might well result in a repetition of thesame over-production as had   occurred- with the Canberra.The Minister of Supply said that the effect of the special priorityscheme was to accelerate and not to increase expenditure, and itshould be possible so to frame his estimates for 1953-54 as to avoid the need for supplementary estimates on this, account. Retentionof special priority for Canberra, production had little practical effectbut was valuable for the purpose of securing overseas orders.The Secretary of State for Air said that the Valiant was boundto remain the backbone of our&apos;bomber force for some time to come.In due course it would be replaced by the B.35,. but it was too early to decide which of the two types of B.35 should be adopted.The Prime Minister said that the proposals put forward by theMinister&apos;of Supply seemed to be generally acceptable on the under-standing that,, so far as the B.35 bomber was concerned, special priority would cover production of no more than the 50 aircraftalready on order from A. V. Roe, Ltd., and Handley Page, Ltd.43540-1 b 2CommonwealthEconomicConference.(previous reference:CC. (52)103fd-Conclusions,Minute 1.)aircraft production.Special Priority.(previous reference:CC. (52) 59thConclusions,Minute 5.)
3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Supply (C. (52) 424) recommending that the scheme underwhich certain defence orders had been brought forward for thepurpose of relieving unemployment in the clothing and textile indus-tries should now be regarded as completed.The Minister of Supply explained that the total value of ordersactually placed under the scheme was likely to be about  20-5 millions,as compared with the figure of  23 millions approved by the Cabineton 10th June and with the expenditure limits of  20- 25 millionsoriginally announced in Parliament. Unemployment in the clothing and textile industries had dropped from 183,000 in May to 67,000in October and short-time working had been considerably reduced.The Cabinet-Approved the recommendation made in C. (52) 424.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Minister of Education (C. (52) 439) recommending that thestandard charge to parents for school dinners under the SchoolsMeals Service should be increased from &quot;Id, to 9d. and inviting theCabinet to decide whether the increase should operate from 1st February or 1st March. .The Minister of Education said that experience had shown thatan increase of even id. in the standard charge caused a reduction inthe number of meals taken. She would have preferred that the pro-posed increase in the standard charge should be deferred until the summer but was prepared in the circumstances to agree that it shouldtake effect from 1st March.The Secretary of State for Scotland supported the views expressedby the Minister of Education.There was general support for the view that it would be difficultto defend the introduction of the increased charge on 1st February.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in spite of theGovernments declared aim to make a substantial reduction in public expenditure, Departmental estimates continued to forecast increased expenditure. To meet his colleagues&apos; views he was prepared to agreethat the introduction of the increased charge for school dinners shouldbe deferred until 1st March but he could not contemplate any longerdeferment. *,The Cabinet-Approved the increase of the standard charge for schooldinners under the School Meals Service from Id. to 9d^with effect from 1st March, 1953.(1) Agreed that special priority should be accorded to the pro-duction of the fifty B.35 bomber aircraft already ordered,and of Comet, Britannia and Viscount civil aircraft.(2) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would discuss with the Minister of Supply the need for con-tinuing to accord special priority to the production ofCanberra aircraft.
(^JAJan Nunn 5.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Home&quot;&quot;May. Secretary (C. (52) 435) reporting the results of the further considera-(Previous tion which he had given, in the light of the Cabinefs discussion on reference: 25th November, to the question whether Alan Nunn May shouldC.C. (52) 100th be released from prison on the date when he would ordinarily be conclusions, due for discharge by reason of the remission which he had earnedMinute 11.) by good conduct and industry during his imprisonment.The Home Secretary said that, for the reasons given in theAppendix to his memorandum, no effective means could be devisedof ensuring that, if he were released, May would not leave this country before the expiration of the full period of ten years from the dateof his conviction. There were, however, no positive grounds forsupposing that he would leave the country. Though he was un-married, he was planning to stay with a brother after his dischargefrom prison; and there was a reasonable prospect that suitable employment would be found for him in this country. Despite the risks the Home Secretary recommended, for the reasons which he had advanced in the Cabinet&apos;s earlier discussion, that May should be released from prison on the date on which he would ordinarilybecome due for discharge.The Prime Minister said that he appreciated the difficulty whichthe Home Secretary found in holding May for the full period of the sentence; but May&apos;s release would certainly excite public interest,and strong dissatisfaction would be felt and expressed if he did in factproceed abroad soon afterwards. He should certainly be kept under close supervision by the Police.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that it was proposed to inform the United States Governmentin advance of May&apos;s impending release, and to provide the british authorities in the United States with suitable information and guidance to enable them to deal with any enquiries from the AmericarPress.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that Alan Nunn May should be released from prisonon the date when he would ordinarily be due for dischargeby reason of the remission which he had earned by good conduct and industry during his imprisonment.(2) Took note with approval of the arrangements proposed fordealing with any unfavourable comment which his releasemight arouse in the United States.Crimes of violence.Sale of ToyCoshes.6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (52) 432) on two points, arising from the recent increasein crimes of violence, connected with the sale and carrying of offensive weapons.The Home Secretary said that the suggestion had been made, inParliament and in the Press, that the sale of toy coshes should be prohibited by law. He had considered this suggestion, but had reached the conclusion that it would be difficult to frame satisfactorylegislation for this purpose. The National Chamber of Trade and national Chamber of Toy Retailers had recently made an appeal toshopkeepers to withdraw from sale toy models of lethal weapons,coshes, knuckle-dusters and the like; and there was already evidenceof some response to this appeal. He thought that a further responsecould be secured if he made a suitable statement in Parliamentcommending the action which the trade had already taken.
The Cabinet- M(1) Agreed that there were no sufficient grounds for proposinglegislation prohibiting the sale of toy models of lethalweapons, coshes, knuckle-dusters and the like; and invited the Home Secretary to make a statement in Parliamentsupporting the trade&apos;s appeal to shop-keepers to withdrawthese articles from sale.Carrying of The Home Secretary said that there was a case for legislationOffensive making it an offence to be found without lawful reason in possessionWeapons. of an offensive weapon in a public place. The provision in Section 4of the Public Order Act, 1936, which made it an offence to be inpossession of an offensive weapon at a public meeting or publicprocession, had been effective before the war in stopping membersof the British Union of Fascists from carrying weapons on thoseoccasions. It was the view of the police that a provision on thelines which he now proposed would be useful in checking the presenttendency of house-breakers and other criminals to carry weapons withthem. He suggested that, subject to the Cabinefs views, he mightdiscuss this proposal with his predecessor in office, with a view to seeing whether such legislation could be passed quickly through theHouse of Commons without controversy between the Parties.The Cabinet (2) Authorised the Home Secretary to take informal soundingsof Opposition leaders with a view to ascertaining whether legislation making it an offence to be found without law-ful reason in possession of an offensive weapon in a publicplace could be passed through Parliament withoutcontroversy between the Parties.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,16th December, 1952.
