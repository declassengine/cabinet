ft179 CC. 62 (52)Tanganyika. 1.   The Colonial Secretary said that the Tanganyika Constitu-Conaititutional tional Development Committee had now submitted recommendationsChanges. for the reform of the Tanganyikan constitution. They proposed thatunofficial representation in the Legislative Council should be dividedequally between the three main racial groups Africans, Asians and europeans but that the official majority in the Council should be preserved. He proposed to accept these recommendations; hehanded round a draft of a statement on the subject which he proposedto make in the House of Commons.The Cabinet Endorsed the Colonial Secretary^ decision to accept therecommendations of the Tanganyikan constitutional development Committee, and approved the terms of thestatement on this subject which he proposed to make in theHouse of Commons.2. The Prime Minister said that in the House of commons that afternoon he had to answer a Question by Sir Robert Cary, M.P.,asking that an official enquiry should be held into the conditions under which horses were being slaughtered in this country. an enquiry had already been made into this by a DepartmentalCommittee, under Lord Rosebery&apos;s Chairmanship, which had reported in March 1950. He had been advised to reply that effecthad been given to many of the recommendations made by that committee, though not to a recommendation that all government functions in relation to horse slaughter houses and knackers&apos; yardsshould be concentrated in one Department; that the Governmentwere now reviewing this particular recommendation; and that theywere also considering whether there were any aspects of this traffic which warranted further enquiry. He was not content, however, toleave the matter on that footing. Strong feeling about it had alreadybeen shown in the House of Commons and this would be enhanced by the report, published in The Times that morning, of an investiga-tion which a representative of the Horses and Ponies ProtectionAssociation had recently made into the conditions under whichhorses were now being slaughtered. He believed that a case hadbeen made out for a further enquiry; and he suggested that he should announce that afternoon the Government^ intention to arrange fora further official enquiry to be held.In discussion there was general agreement with the view expressed by the Prime Minister. The Minister of Food said therewas one thing which he could do while - the new enquiry was proceeding: he could make an order requiring any person whoproposed to slaughter a horse to inform the local authority in advance.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange, in consultation withthe other Ministers concerned, for the immediate appoint-ment of a further Committee of enquiry to consider and recommend what further, safeguards could be introduced to ensure the humane slaughtering of horses in thiscountry.(2) Authorised the Minister of Food to make, as soon aspracticable, an order requiring persons about to slaughterhorses to notify the local authority in advance.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would announce thedecisions noted in the foregoing conclusions in reply to a parliamentary Question that afternoon.Slaughter of horses.
o3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by .thePostmaster-General (C. (52) 203) covering the draft of his proposedParliamentary statement about the report of the. Committee, underthe Chairmanship of Lord Terrington, which had considered thequestion of recognition of the various staff- associations in the PostOffice.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was concerned about the effect which this statement might have&apos; on the traditionalpractice of the Treasury in basing recognition of staff associations inthe Civil Service generally upon the objective criterion of numbersrepresented. Merely by delaying a decision the Postmaster-general would appear to cast some doubt on the validity of that practice andto be yielding to pressure from the large unions.The Minister of Labour said that rejection of the TerringtonReport would be taken to imply that, in principle, the Governmentfavoured the creation of splinter unions; arid this would give seriousoffence to the Trades Union Congress at a time when the Governmentwere most anxious to enlist their support on matters of major importance such as wages policy. He therefore favoured the course which the Postmaster-General proposed to follow.The Cabinefs discussion turned mainly on the question whetherGovernment supporters in the House of Commons would accept thestatement proposed by the Postmaster-General, in view of the support which the Conservative Party had given, when in Opposition, to theclaims of the smaller Post Office unions. In this connection theCabinet were informed of the substance of correspondence which thePrime Minister had had with Mr. W. J. Brown, who urged that theGovernment should maintain their support for; the claims of thesmaller unions. It was pointed out; however, that the Party had not given any specific pledge on this question during the Election, and thatthe Government need not consider themselves committed by views expressed by individual members of the Party in the course ofParliamentary debates. The Minister of Labour and the Postmaster-General had recently discussed the matter, with interested membersof the Party and, while it was clear that they would not have beencontent with a proposal to defer a decision for so long as twelvemonths, there was good reason to believe that they would accept theproposed delay of six months. It would, however, be advisable fromthe point of view of conciliating Conservative opinion in the Houseof Commons to omit the third and fourth sentences in the proposed statement, which welcomed the existence of well-organised and responsible trades unions and deprecated the dual recognition ofrival unions. It was true that a difficult Parliamentary situation would arise if by the end of the year there had been no change in theposition; but the Postmaster-General intended in the interval to do his best to get the parties to compose their differences.The Cabinet concluded that, in view of the over-riding currentimportance of enlisting the support of the Trades Union congress in matters of major importance, it would be inexpedient at thepresent time to attempt to force a decision on the issues raised by theTerrington Report.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Postmaster-General should postpone untilthe early part of 1953 his final decision on the issues raised in the Report of the Terrington Committee on thequestion of recognition of the various staff associations inthe Post Office.(2) Approved, subject to the omission of the third and fourthsentences, the draft statement on this question appended to C. (52) 203; and invited the Postmaster-General toarrange for statements to be made in these terms in bothHouses of Parliament on 25th June.Recognition of post Office staff associations.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 60thConclusions,Minute 11.)
(3) Took note that the Postmaster-General would thereaftertake such steps as were open to him to persuade theparties in this dispute to compose their differences.4. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Governmentof the Irish Republic were making real efforts to improve then-balance of payments and he wished them to increase their dollar earnings by exporting 20 per cent, of their meat to the United States.This would accord with the Government^ policy to give first priority to measures designed to redress the adverse balance of payments.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Minister of Food said that he wished to obtain an under-taking from the Irish Republican Government that they would send to the United Kingdom not less than 90 per cent, of their total exports of meat. If 20 per cent, were sent elsewhere, he would haveto find a replacement; and there was little prospect of finding this inthe sterling area.(b) The export of Irish meat and livestock to the UnitedKingdom was a part of the traditional pattern of trade between thetwo countries; and there was considerable danger of losing theseessential imports in the future if the Irish were now encouraged to look for markets in the United States. Moreover, the action pro-posed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer would set a precedentwhich might be followed by other countries which now supplied us with essential food-stuffs.The Cabinet Agreed that in the forthcoming negotiations the Govern-ment of the Irish Republic should be pressed to supply tothe United Kingdom not less than 90 per cent, of their total exports of meat.5. The Prime Minister said that statements on their mission toKorea should be made simultaneously by the Minister of Defence inthe House of Lords and by the Minister of State in the House ofCommons. The Minister of Defence should have an opportunityfor consultation and discussion before making his statement, and both statements should therefore be made on 1st July. He wouldgive notice of this intention in reply to a Question in the commons that afternoon.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Defence and the Minister of state to make statements in Parliament on 1st July on theirmission to Korea.Bombing of The Prime Minister said that he was to be asked in the House of power Stations Commons that afternoon whether he had any statement to make on Yalu River, about the bombing attacks which had been delivered upon the power stations on the Yalu River. This action by United Nations air forces might give rise to the suspicion that a more aggressive policy wasbeing adopted as a result of the visit of the Minister of Defence. he therefore wished to make it clear that the decision to undertake this attack was within the competence of the United Nations commander and that the United Kingdom Government had not been consulted inadvance. He would stress the fact that this attack did not reflectany change of policy. It would be helpful if he could say that similar attacks had taken place in the past.

should take immediate steps to verify this, in consultation with theMinistry of Defence.The Cabinet (2) Took note of the general line which the Prime minister proposed to adopt in his statement in the House ofCommons on the bombing of power stations on the YaluRiver.6, The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (52) 191) recommending that the Government shouldresume the grant of immunities and privileges to the internationalstaffs and the national delegates at meetings of international organi-sations in this country. The grant of these privileges had been suspended by the previous Government in 1950 in the face of strongcriticisms by members of the Conservative Party in both Houses ofParliament.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that the Foreign Secretary, while he recognised the disinclinationof Parliament to extend the area of diplomatic privilege, thought itunreasonable that the Government should enjoy membership of aninternational organisation without granting it the privileges approvedunder international agreement. We had taken the lead, in inter-national discussion, in seeking to restrict these privileges as far aspossible; but we should not now decline to honour the agreements to which we had been parties. Moreover, it was illogical that weshould accord these privileges for the large number of organisations which had secured them before 1950 but should withhold them fromthe few which had secured them since. He therefore proposed that parliament should be asked to approve, by affirmative resolution,Orders in Council in respect of the international organisations listed in Annex III of C. (52) 191.In discussion it was recognised that it would be politicallyembarrassing for the Government to proceed now with proposalswhich, when in Opposition, they had forced the Labour Governmentto withdraw. On the other hand, it was arguable that their criticismsat that time had been directed to preventing any undue extension ofthe area of diplomatic privilege and that it would be consistent.to honour the commitments into which the Labour Party had enteredbut to avoid, so far as practicable, any further extension of theseprivileges to new organisations.The Cabinet (1) Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at ameeting in the following week.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor and the Attorney-General toconsider meanwhile whether the Government were com-mitted, by agreements to which they were parties, toaccording the prescribed privileges and immunities tp thej organisations listed in Annex III of C. (52) 19LCabinet Office, S.W. 1,24th June, 1952.Privileges ofInternationalOrganisations.
