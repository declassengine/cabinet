An admission that the weakness existed but that no measures had yet been, taken&quot;to remedy it would serve to fortify the arguments of the Opposition.It was the general view of the Cabinet that no&apos;reference should be .,made in .the forthcoming debates to the question of developingarrangements for. giving political advice to the Supreme commander in Korea.        ., .&apos; - .    -       &quot; I &apos; &quot;.;V-^^^^rThe-apiwintmiBrit &apos;6t&apos;a&apos;.British Commonwealth military officeras^Deputy Chief of Staff fo the Supreme Commander had beensuggested by the United States Government, and accepted by Canada,,-Australia and New Zealand.: South Africa had not yet given formal- agreement, but had raised no objection. This officer would be underthe orders of- the. Supreme Commander and would owe allegiance: and loyalty to him. Hecould not,.therefore, act as a direct link withthe British Chiefs of Staff and the United Kingdom Government.On the other hand,-the Supreme Commander was anxious to make&quot;this appointment, if, an officer could be made available, and would undoubtedly tend to seek his advice on matters on which the UnitedKingdom Government might be expected to hold strong views. Thisofficer could also - establish efficient liaison intelligence machinery,-through which it should be possible for the United Kingdom Govern-ment to obtain better and more authoritative information of develop--ments in Korea. The view of the Cabinet was that the balance ofadvantage4ay in announcing forthwith that a British Commonwealth^Military Officer would be made available for appointment as deputy chief of Staff to the Supreme Commander in Korea.The Cabinet -Agreed that the Prime Minister, the Minister of Defence. 7 :     andthe Minister of State, in their statements to Parliament.  &apos; that afternoon, should make no reference to the develop-&apos; .  &apos; &apos;    ment of arrangements for giving political advice to theSupreme Commander in Korea, but, should announce thata British Commonwealth Military Officer would-be madeavailable for appointment as Deputy Chief of Staff to ther.. &apos;1-&apos;;      Supreme Commander.-North Atlantici Treaty&quot; &apos; JOrganisation. \(Previous ..   ,&apos;,;7Reference:&apos;;C.C, (52) 20th&apos;/% Conclusions,;;-;Minute 3.). -:?-\Status ofMilitary h&apos; -.I Headquarters.:&apos;2. The Cabinet had&apos;before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (52). 213) inviting them to approve a draft Protocoldefining the status of International Military Headquarters established, under the : North Atlantic ; Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.), and extending to them;the same provisions on such matters as jurisdiction,property. and.tax immunity as were already contained in the agree-.mentoh the:status of international forces in another member&apos;s; country. The Protocol contained additional provisions, conferring on each Supreme Headquarters a juridical personality and providing forthe operation of Headquarter ,accounts and immunity for certain/classes of property, funds and documents. *     -irV.;i;--;In:4iscussi6ri&apos;it was Suggested,that, although the Protocol might/encounter opposition in Parliament, the criticism was likely to be less/than;that aroused by the Visiting Forces Bill, which had already/received a Second Heading in the House of Lords. -,.
The Cabinet         y -   . v ./ &apos;-&apos;&apos;   ;;&apos; Invited ;the Foreign Secretary to instruct the United King-&apos;     -.dbm Representative on the North Atlantic Council to accept,&apos;v;;-- .&apos;.on behalf of Her Majesty&apos;s Government, the draft Protocol-     /-/governing the status of International Military Headquarters/     established under N.A.T.O., subject to any drafting or other,,   ,f i ^ minor, amendments which might be found necessary.;-:./.&quot;!-&apos;.:3.&apos; The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Scotland (C. (52) 212) recommending (i) the publication in 1953 of a separate return of revenue from, and expenditure in; relation to, Scotland; and (ii) the appointment of a Royal Commissionto review,-withreference to the financial, economic, administrative and other1 considerations involved, the arrangements for exercisingthe functions of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in relation to Scotland.&quot;; ..The Secretary bf Stale for Scotland said that the committee appointed by the-previous Government, under the Chairmanship ofLord Catto, had concluded that it would be practicable to prepare\ a separate return.of Scottish revenue and expenditure; and he was anxious, to be able to announce; when that report was published later in the month,, that the Government would arrange for such a returnto be prepared and presented to Parliament in 1953. He also wished, to announce, at about the same time, the Governments intention toproceed, in accordance with their Election pledges, with the appoint-ment of a Royal Commission on Scotland, with the terms of referenceset out in his memorandum. &apos;..In discussion there was general agreement with these proposals.:     . The Cabinet-&apos;/ (1) Authorised the Secretary of State for Scotland to announce that the Government would prepare and present toParliament in . 1953 a return of Scottish revenue andexpenditure on the lines indicated in the report ofLord Catto&apos;s Committee.(2) Invited the Prime Minister to recommend to The Queen theappointment of a Royal Commission on Scotland, withthe terms of reference set put in C. (52) 212; and, subject&quot;to. Her Majesty&apos;s pleasure, agreed that the intention toappoint this Royal Commission should be announced on or shortly after the publication of the Catto Report., Civil List.(Previous- Reference:    -: c.t.(52)63rd .Conclusions,/-Minute 3.)4. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in the forthcoming debate on the report of the Select Committee on the Civil List theLabour Opposition would argue that the proposed ContingenciesMargin should not be under the sole control of the Treasurer toThe Queen but should be held by trustees. This arrangement wouldprohabiy be accepted by Her.Majesty&apos;s advisers; and, in order toavoid controversy between the Parties in the House of Commons, hethought it would be wise to adopt this alternative so long as it was/clear that the trustees would be under an obligation to make goodfrom, the- Contingencies Margin any deficits in other parts of theCivil List.
