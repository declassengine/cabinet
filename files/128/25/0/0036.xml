1.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Foreign!;Secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (52) 337 and 338)regarding the repayment of the armaments credits extended to turkey in 1938 and 1939.The Foreign Secretary said that the total sums received by theTurks had amounted to about  39,300,000. Before they defaultedin July 1951 they had repaid  8,900,000 of the capital and had paidinterest amounting to  7,700,000. In the course of the subsequent negotiations, the best offer made by the Turks for settlement had been 2^ million, whereas the United Kingdom Government had declined to settle for less than  16 million. The Turks argued that the debthad been contracted in the interests of common defence, and thatthey had in fact already repaid more than  16 million. There wouldbe an opportunity to raise the matter in the course of the currentconversations with the Turkish Prime Minister and Foreign Minister;and he invited the Cabinet to consider whether he should offer a settle-ment at a figure of  5 million or even less, or whether he should avoiddiscussion with the Turkish Prime Minister and let the negotiationsrun on. He believed that, unless a settlement was reached soon, no more would ever be paid. But if we stood out for too high a figurethe Turks might threaten to reduce their imports from the UnitedKingdom: we had at present a very favourable trade balance withthem.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he v/ould find itdifficult to accept a financial settlement on the lines proposed by theForeign Secretary. The Turks had made no effort to reach a reason-able settlement, and they had shown no disposition to honour thecondition made by the International Bank, who had recently given them a loan on the understanding that they would reach a fair settle-ment of their debt to the United Kingdom. If we now accepted asettlement at a figure of  5 million we should give a false impression of our financial position to the International Bank and to the UnitedStates and should encourage other debtor countries to expect equallygenerous treatment. He would prefer to continue negotiations onthe basis of waiving future interest payments. This was the basis on which he hoped to reach a settlement of the United States and canadian loans to the United Kingdom. He would also be preparedto offer to treat the interest so far paid by the Turks as capital. Onthis basis he would be prepared to accept a financial settlement at a figure of  12 million. If the Cabinet thought it necessary to be more generous, he hoped that any smaller offer would be made as an act ofpolicy and not represented as a fair financial settlement.In discussion attention was drawn to the broad political advantages, in the present international situation, of avoiding anycontinuing source of friction between this country and Turkey andin drawing Turkey into still closer partnership with the western powers. It was the general view of the Cabinet that it would be expedient for these reasons to try to dispose of this issue as an act of policy, even if this meant forgoing some part of what we couldjustly demand under a strictly financial settlement.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in the light of the cabinet&apos;s views, he would consider whether he could devise a methodof presenting a solution to the Turks which might satisfy them without endangering the position of the United Kingdom in financial negotia-tions with other countries. He would then join the Foreign secretary in exploring with the Turkish Ministers the possibility of arriving ata settlement. &apos;The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider further the terms of a possible settlement of the Turkisharmaments credits, and to consult with the foreign secretary.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of theExchequer to raise the matter with the Turkish ministers in the course of their visit.
North AtlanticTreatyOrganisation.Manoeuvres in mediterranean.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 76thConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The Foreign Secretary said that he had just heard that navalmanoeuvres by North Atlantic Forces were shortly to take place inthe Mediterranean. He had no details of these manoeuvres, but therewere areas of the Mediterranean in which operations by naval forces might carry serious political consequences, and he was anxious thatdetails of the exercise should be considered by the United KingdomGovernment before the plans were finally approved.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Defence to obtain details of the pro-posed naval manoeuvres by North Atlantic Forces in theMediterranean and to examine these in consultation with theForeign Secretary.Parliament. 3.   The Cabinet were informed of the provisional arrangementsBusiness in the for handling in the House of Commons the remaining business whichHouse of        had to be despatched before the end of the current session.Commons. Three days must be devoted to discussion of the work of the socialised industries. The first of these debates would be on the white paper on the Iron and Steel Industry; the second on Civil Aviation;and the third on Fuel and Power, with special reference to the RidleyReport on National Policy for the use of Fuel and Power Resources.It was now clear that, apart from the Transport Bill, fourGovernment Bills could not be completed before the session endedand would have to be abandoned: these were the British MuseumBill, the Currency and Bank-notes Bill, the Dentists Bill and thePoaching of Deer (Scotland) Bill.NationalService.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 75thConclusions,Minute 9.)4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Minister ofLabour (C. (52) 323) and the Minister of Agriculture (C. (52) 330) onthe line to be taken in a forthcoming debate in the House of commons on national service policy.The Minister of Labour in his memorandum set out the mainarguments against making any change of policy, either by shorteningthe period of service or by extending the practice of deferring the call-up of men engaged in agriculture or other occupations of special importance to the national economy. The Minister of Agriculture inhis memorandum called attention to the serious labour difficulties inagriculture and suggested a substantial extension of the practice of deferring the call-up of farm-workers.In discussion it was argued, in favour of the proposal put forward by the Minister of Agriculture, that it was becoming increasingly difficult to persuade farmers of the need to increase food productionwhen workers on whom they depended continued to be taken away from the farms for military service. Increased food productiondepended largely on the efficient use of machinery, and it was oftenthe young men who were the most skilled in using machinery. Underthe existing rules it was often impossible to obtain deferment for themen whose services on the farms were of the greatest value. Thus,the call-up of a stockman could at present be deferred only if he were employed as such full-time: but there were comparatively few farmson which a man was employed as a stockman all the year round. Itwas not suggested that farm-workers should be exempted from national service. It would suffice if all farm-workers were eligible fordeferment, whatever the size of the farm and whatever their job on it;so that each claim to deferment could be judged by the extent of the direct contribution which it would make to food production.On the other side it was argued that the relaxation proposed bythe Minister of Agriculture, for the sake of retaining only about 3,000
or 4,000 young men on the farms, would seriously prejudice theprinciple of universality of national service. The Government, if they made this concession to agriculture, would find it increasingly difficultto withhold it from other industries, e.g.t engineering firms engaged inthe export trade. There was a real risk of provoking a series of appli-cations which, if granted, would completely undermine the principleof universality.It was the general view of the Cabinet that it would be inexpe-dient to make any radical change in the existing arrangements forthe call-up of farm-workers. At the same time the Minister ofLabour, in the forthcoming debate in the House of Commons, should leave some loophole for modifying national service policy if circum-stances changed. If, for example, after the review of the defence programme some reduction in the size of the Armed Forces was foundto be justifiable, it might be possible to reduce the intake into theforces by delaying the call-up. The Minister should therefore takethe line in the debate that there was no scope for any major change in national service policy so long as our military commitments remained unchanged. Meanwhile the detailed arrangements for deferring the call-up of farm-workers could be reconsidered with a view to meetingthe criticism that men whose services were of special value to agri-culture were being called up while deferment was granted to others who were less essential.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that no major change should be made in nationalservice policy so long as military commitments remained unchanged, and invited the Minister of Labour to take that line in replying to the forthcoming debate in theHouse of Commons.(2) Invited the Minister of Labour and the Agriculture ministers to review the detailed arrangements for deferring the call-up of farm workers with a view to meeting the criticismsexpressed in the discussion.(3) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister of Defence would consider, in connection withthe current review of the defence programme, whether itwould be practicable to reduce the intake into the services in the coming year by delaying the call-up.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,15th October, 1952.
