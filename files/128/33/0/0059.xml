ContentsCommercial Policy: European Free Trade Association
Commercial The Cabinet had before them Stockholm telegrams Nos. 537, 538Policy. and 539 m which the Chancellor of the Exchequer reported the latestEuropean Free developments in the negotiations at the Stockholm Conference on trade the Draft Convention for the European Free Trade Association.  ItAssociation.     seemed probable that the negotiations on the Convention as a whole(Previous        would break down if we were not prepared to make some further reference :     concession on frozen fish fillets.   It appeared that the NorwegianC.C. (59) 58th Ministers had misled their Parliament into thinking that, even ifConclusions,    imports were to exceed the annual rate of 20,000 tons, the united minute 4.)      Kingdom would still be prepared to admit up to 20,000 tons a yearfree of duty and that only additional imports would be subject to payment of duty. The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Presidentof the Board of Trade now proposed that the limit of 20,000 tons ayear should be raised to 24,000, as proposed by the scandinavian countries, and that in the agreement for the voluntary restriction of exports there should be a change in the presentation (but not thesubstance) of the passage reserving our right to re-impose the tariffif this limit seemed likely to be exceeded. The agreement would thenbe to the effect that it would be open to the United Kingdom to&quot; modify &quot; the tariff reductions as necessary, but it had been made clear to the Norwegians that modification could include completere-imposition of the tariff. As regards tariffs and quotas on fresh fish,the Scandinavian countries would be content with a statement that wewere not contemplating any change.   We could also secure thenecessary condition to protect our position in the event of anextension of fishing limits. If the concessions mentioned above weremade, we could expect a satisfactory settlement of all the other outstanding isues on the Convention.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that the Swedes were now supporting the Norwegians in pressing for the limit on theimports of frozen fish fillets to be raised to 24,000 tons a year; theywere also linking this concession to satisfactory treatment for our exports of certain types of clothing.The Cabinet agreed that, in all the circumstances, there was no alternative but to accept the increased limit on imports of frozen fishand the revised version of the agreement proposed by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer; but this should be on the understanding (i) that it was clear to the Norwegians that modification of the tariff reductions could include full re-imposition of the tariff, not only on any excessimports above 24,000 tons but also on the whole of the imports up tothat limit; and (ii) that all our requirements about fishing limits were fully secured. The Cabinet noted with approval that it had beenfound possible to secure that on future tariff policy we were not going beyond a statement of our present intentions.The Cabinet Approved, subject to the points made in their discussion,the text of the revised agreement on the voluntary restriction of exports to the United Kingdom of frozen fish fillets, setout in Stockholm telegram No. 539.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,20th November, 1959.
