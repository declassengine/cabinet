1. The Foreign Secretary said that the Federal GermanGovernment had asked the Council of Western European Union(W.E.U.) to amend the Brussels Treaty so to allow them to undertake the joint production (with France, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands)of an anti-aircraft guided missile of American design (HAWK). Thiswas a defensive weapon and was not designed to carry a nuclearwarhead. This amendment of the Treaty might be justified to publicopinion in this country on the grounds that it would only allowGermany &quot;to manufacture defensive weapons and that Germanindustrial capacity should be used in the joint production of weaponsfor use by the members of the North Atlantic Alliance.- However, theactual amendment proposed was in terms which would permit theGermans themselves to manufacture any anti-aircraft guided missiles,and it might open the door to their developing and producing a wide range of rocket weapons. The proposal would be discussed at themeeting of the W.E.U. Council on 29th April. On balance it was probably expedient that our representative at that meeting.should not oppose the amendment. It might, however, be desirable to seek an assurance from the Federal German Government that it was not their intention to develop missile production of their own, though any suchassurance would not be of lasting value.In discussion the view was expressed that the proposed amendment might be ill received by public opinion in this country,particularly at a time when there was some expectation that theforthcoming international discussions might lead to some limitationof armaments in Europe. Moreover, it would be generally assumed that, once the Germans began to manufacture these defensiveweapons, they would develop a capacity to make rocket weapons ofall kinds. On the other hand, we had for some time been encouraging the Germans to participate in the joint production of weapons with us. It would not, in the long run, be possible to prevent them, withtheir ample technical and economic resources, from developing arocket industry, and there was much to be said for guiding this development into joint production with other members of the north atlantic Alliance.The Cabinet were informed that this proposal could be carried by a majority of two-thirds of the W.E.U. Council, and it would not therefore be possible for the United Kingdom alone to defeat it.There was, however, some reason to believe that the FrenchGovernment might put forward amendments designed to limit the size of the missiles which the Germans would be permitted toconstruct.Further discussion showed that it was the general view of theCabinet that we should not oppose the proposal that Germany shouldbe allowed to participate in the joint production of defensive anti-aircraft guided missiles. It would, however, be preferable that theTreaty should not be formally amended for this purpose if this couldbe avoided. The Federal German Government were already allowedto manufacture short-range guided missiles for anti-aircraft defence,and it might be possible to cover their participation in the joint production of the HAWK by means of an agreed interpretation of theTreaty. If that were not possible, the United Kingdom representativecould make it clear that we did not oppose the HAWK project butthat the exact terms of any amendment of the Treaty would need further consideration by Her Majesty&apos;s Government.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in instructing his representative at the Western European Union Council meeting on29th April, to be guided by the points made in their discussion.
Egypt.financial agreement.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 20thConclusions.Minute 4.)2. The Foreign Secretary said that the Egyptian Governmenthad now formally agreed to the establishment of a British Mission in cairo, for purposes connected with the implementation of the financial agreement, but the conditions prescribed for the Mission were by nomeans satisfactory. It was to be small in numbers and would have only limited diplomatic facilities and immunities, with no means of direct communication with the United Kingdom. We could rejectthis offer entirely; or we could seek an improved offer through theUnited Kingdom representative in Cairo; or we could accept it underprotest and try gradually to improve the status and facilities of theMission. The last of these courses would, in all the circumstances,be the best, since we did not want to give the Egyptians any excuse for denouncing the financial agreement.In discussion the following points were raised:  (a) It was not certain that the Egyptians were being deliberatelyobstructive: the unsatisfactory nature of their offer might be partly due to administrative incompetence.(b) Although the Egyptians were now free to draw on their sterling balances in London, they had not so far made any abnormalwithdrawals.The Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary to accept the facilities offered by the Egyptian Government for the establishment of aBritish Mission in Cairo but to seek to obtain an improve-ment in the status and facilities at present proposed for it.Nuclear The Foreign Secretary said that the United States GovernmentWeapons. 5een considering when to table in Congress their agreement withthe Federal German Government for the provision of nuclear weapons in Germany. This agreement, and similar agreements with,the Governments of Holland, Greece, Turkey and Belgium, had to lieQbefore Congress for 60 days before they took effect. Publication ofthe agreement with Germany might seem provocative to the Russiansat this time but, on balance, the United States Government were inclined to think that it should be tabled before the meeting ofForeign Ministers opened on 11th May. For, if this action was not taken by then, it might be inopportune to take it for some time ahead and the agreement might not have become operative before Congress -rose in the summer. The United States Government therefore feltthat the best procedure would be that the German agreement shouldbe laid before Congress at the same time as some of the otheragreements, and that it should be explained that it merely carried outdecisions taken by the North Atlantic Council in December 1957.It was thought that the Secretary-General of the North atlantic alliance would be ready to arrange for the issue of a public statement on these lines.In discussion it was recognised that the publication of these agreements could not be long delayed. This being so, it was preferable that the agreement with Germany should be represented as being oneof several reached in pursuance of the decision taken by the north atlantic Council in December 1957.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in instructing the UnitedKingdom representative on the North Atlantic Council,to be guided by the points made in their discussion.
Cotton.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 23rdConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The President of the Board of Trade said that it would not bepossible to include all the details of the Governments scheme to assistthe cotton industry in an explanatory memorandum to the Bill. he therefore proposed to publish, shortly before the Bill was presented,a White Paper which would set out the scheme in full.In discussion it was pointed out that the timing of the publicationof the White Paper would need to be carefully considered, in order toavoid any possibility of a debate on it in addition to the debate on theBill. It might therefore be best if the White Paper were published atthe same time as, or immediately before, the Bill was presented.The Cabinet (1) Took note that a White Paper would be presented on theGovernments scheme for assistance to the cotton industry.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to consider, inthe light of their discussion, the timing of the publicationof this White Paper.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,28th April, 1959.
