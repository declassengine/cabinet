* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET54860-13 b 2Civil Service.IH    (Previous&quot;    Reference:C.C. (58) 88thConclusions,Minute 3.)Pay of HigherStaff.*1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (59) 40) discussing therecommendations made in a report by the Standing AdvisoryCommittee which had been appointed in 1957, under thechairmanship of Lord Coleraine, to advise on the remuneration ofthe higher Civil Service. It was the task of this Committee to apply the principle, recommended by the Priestley Commission on the CivilService, that the pay of civil servants should be based on faircomparison with the current remuneration of staffs employed outsidethe Civil Service on broadly comparable work. -On that principle the Committee had now recommended that the salaries of higher staffin the Civil Service should be raised, with effect from 1st February,by amounts representing an increase of about one-sixth over the ratesrecommended by the Priestley Commission.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was satisfied thatthe Committee&apos;s recommendations were fully justified on merits. Inthe memorandum which he had circulated he had marshalled thearguments in favour of rejecting the recommendations, orimplementing them only in part or deferring their implementation.He had, however, come to the conclusion that it would be inadvisable to adopt either of those courses, and his advice to the Cabinet wasthat the Committee&apos;s recommendations should be accepted in full andintroduced with effect from 1st February.In deciding when such a decision should be announced account must be taken of two conflicting considerations. The Minister ofLabour favoured an early announcement, so as to take advantage ofthe current lull in wage claims. On the other hand, there was somefeeling in the House of Commons that a decision to increase CivilService salaries should not be announced before the Government had made known their intentions about a Pensions (Increase) Bill. TheChancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet that in his budget statement on 7th April he would announce his intention to introduce aPensions (Increase) Bill. He suggested that the decision on CivilService salaries might be announced immediately before Parliamentrose for the Easter recess.This decision was unlikely to have far-reaching repercussions on other salaries in the public service. Some consequential increases would probably have to be made in the salaries of the lower judiciary;and, in consequence of those increases, it might also become necessaryto consider some adjustment of the pensions of the higher judiciary.It was to be hoped that the decision would not provoke pressure for increases in the pay of senior officers in the Armed Forces.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet that the recommendations made by the Coleraine Committeeshould be adopted with effect from 1st February.Strong preference was, however, shown for deferring theannouncement of this decision until after it had been made known thatthe Government intended to introduce a Pensions (Increase) Bill.Government supporters who were pressing for this legislation, inParliament and in the country, would be seriously disturbed if, before it was promised, the Government announced their intention of granting substantial salary increases to serving members of the CivilService. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in deference to these views, he would be willing to postpone the announcementuntil 8th or 9th April, when it could follow the undertaking whichhe would include in his Budget statement about a Pensions (Increase)Bill. Meanwhile, however, he would like to take Lord Coleraineinto his confidence about the Governments decision and the date onwhich it would be announced.
On the question of repercussions the following points weremade:  (a) The Lord Chancellor said that the salaries of Official Refereesand Masters of the Supreme Court had in the past been related to civil Service salaries and would have to be increased by reason ofthe decision which the Cabinet were proposing to take. It wouldthen be difficult to avoid consequential adjustments in the salaries of County Court Judges and other members of the lower judiciary.These adjustments would, in turn, give rise to difficulty over thepensions of the higher judiciary, for they would have the effect thatsome members of the lower judiciary would become eligible for pensions at a higher rate than those of certain members of the higher judiciary in Scotland and Northern Ireland. There were, however,strong arguments for improving the pensions of High Court Judges,which had not been increased when their salaries were raised in 1954.The gap between the salary and the pension of a High Court Judgewas now so wide that it tended to discourage retirement, to the detriment of efficiency.(b) The Minister of Defence said that the pay of officers in the armed Forces was due to be reviewed in the spring of 1960. He saw no reason why adjustments in the pay of senior officers should bemade in advance of that review.(c) The proposed increase in the salaries of higher civil servantswould inevitably raise questions about the salaries of Ministers and members of Parliament. Some Ministers thought there would be advantage in an arrangement by which those salaries were placed insome fixed relation to the salaries of higher civil servants, so thatthey would go up automatically when Civil Service salaries were raised. It was, however, the general view of the Cabinet that it wouldbe inopportune to put forward at the present time any proposals for raising the salaries of Ministers or Members of Parliament.(d) In connexion with Pensions (Increase) legislation, TheColonial Secretary asked that consideration should again be givento the position of certain retired Colonial Governors who had notbeen covered by earlier Acts of this kind. Some of them were suffering serious financial hardship.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the increased rates of remuneration for the higher civil Service recommended in the report of the ColeraineCommittee should be introduced with effect from 1st February, 1959.(2) Agreed that no public announcement of this decision shouldbe made until the second week of April, so that it couldfollow the announcement about a Pensions (Increase) bill which the Chancellor of the Exchequer was proposing toinclude in his Budget statement on 7th April.(3) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to informLord Coleraine, in confidence, of the Cabinefs decision and of the date on which it would be announced.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider whatcorresponding adjustments should be made in the salaries of the lower judiciary; and whether any improvementshould be made in the pensions of the higher judiciary.(5) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to report these conclusions, for confirmation, at the Cabinet&apos;s next meeting at which thePrime Minister would be present.
Public Boards.Salaries ofMembers.Farm price review.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 8 th conclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (59) 44) about the farm price review for 1959-60. This memorandum indicated that there was little prospect of securing an agreed settlement with the National Farmers&apos;Unions (N.FUs.) on the basis, previously approved by the Cabinet,that the total value of the price guarantees in 1959-60 would remain at the same level as in 1958-59, after account had been taken of thebenefit derived by the industry from the new schemes for assistanceto small farmers, and that there would be no change in the guaranteed price for milk. The representatives of the Unions had sought anincrease of  14 millions in the total value of the guarantees (including an increase of i-d. a gallon on milk) and, although they might accepta smaller increase, possibly limited to  6 millions, a settlement which provided for no increase at all would need to be imposed. the agriculture Ministers felt that, in these circumstances and in view* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.*2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePostmaster-General (C. (59) 41) proposing increases in the salaries ofthe chairmen and members of the boards of the British broadcasting corporation (BBC), the Independent Television Authority (ITA) andthe Commonwealth Telecommunications Board (CTB).The Postmaster-General said that, when the salaries of membersof the boards of nationalised industries were raised in 1957, it hadbeen intended that corresponding adjustments should be made in the salaries of the chairmen and members of the BBC, ITA and CTB.This intention had in fact been communicated at the time to the chairmen of the BBC and the ITA. Before it could be carried intoeffect, however, the economic situation had deteriorated and, for this and other reasons explained in his memorandum, it had been decidedthat these salary adjustments should not then be made. circumstances had now improved and, for the reasons given in paragraph 4 of his memorandum, the Postmaster-General recommended that the salaries of the chairmen and members of these bodies should now be increasedby the amounts originally envisaged in 1957.The Cabinet agreed that these salaries should now be raised tothe figure proposed in the Appendix to C. (59) 41.Discussion then turned on the manner in which any announcement of this decision should be related to the forthcomingannouncement of increases in Civil Service salaries. Ministersrecognised that there was no logical relation between these twodecisions, but they thought it desirable to avoid the impression thata series of salary improvements was in progress. It would thereforebe preferable that there should be no general announcement coveringall these bodies. The appropriate action could be taken in respectof each body separately, as the necessary formal procedures were completed.The Cabinet (1) Approved the increases in the salaries of the chairmen and members of the British Broadcasting Corporation, theIndependent Television Authority and the CommonwealthTelecommunications Board set out in the Appendix toC. (59) 41.(2) Invited the Postmaster-General to take the necessary action,in respect of each of these bodies separately, to bring these increases into effect.
of the difficulties which the industry faced as a result of the adverse weather in the previous year, it would be advisable to concede anincrease of some  2 millions or  3 millions in the total value of the guarantees. This would still enable the Government to recover atleast half the cost of the new small farmer schemes and, by maintaining the principle of a reduction in the guaranteed prices for wheat, wool and eggs and leaving the guaranteed price for milkunchanged, would not endanger the Governments objectives inrespect of individual commodities.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the farmers&apos; claim was based mainly on the argument that the net income of the industry should be restored to the level of real income in 1948. But theGovernment were under no obligation to maintain the income of theindustry at any given level; and they could not afford to accept this argument. The reasons which had led the Cabinet to agree that thetotal of the guarantees should remain unchanged remained valid.Indeed, the price reductions envisaged by such a settlement for wheat,milk, wool and eggs were less than could properly be demanded and carried some risk that embarrassing surpluses of these commoditieswould, arise later in the year. It would therefore be unwise to abatethese reductions still further or to sacrifice the economic requirementsof agricultural policy to the presentational advantages of an agreed settlement. It would be no less unwise to aggravate the difficultieswhich our agricultural support policy already created in the context of the negotiations for the creation of a European Free Trade Area.The Minister of Agriculture said that, without dissenting from thesubstance of these arguments, he was impressed by the advantages of securing agreement with the farmers; and he believed that therewas a reasonable chance that the Government could achieve this objective if the level of the guarantees were increased by  2 millionsor  3 millions. Moreover, even if it became necessary to impose a settlement on this basis, the concession would deprive the N.F.Us.of any effective grounds on which to challenge the government&apos;s decision.In discussion it was suggested that it might be desirable in due course to re-examine the Governments agricultural policy in a freshendeavour to reduce the extent to which the farmers relied upon an exchequer subsidy. The existing policy was uneconomic; it wasdetrimental to the interests of the countries producing primary products and therefore to their ability to buy our exports; and itinhibited us from criticising the subsidies paid by other governments to their own industries. On the other hand a radical review of policy would inevitably be complex and protracted; and in the interim therewould be considerable advantages in securing an agreed settlement with the fanners. Even if the total level of the guarantees were increased by some  2 millions or  3 millions, the reductions in theprices of wheat, wool and eggs which would still be secured should enable the Government both to reply to any criticism by othermembers of the Commonwealth and to maintain that the outcome of the price review as a whole was in accordance with their policyof promoting a more economic pattern of agricultural production. If,however, the N.F.Us. were unwilling to agree to a settlement of thekind now proposed, it might be necessary for the Government tomake a determination on this basis.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Agriculture Ministers to seek to obtain theagreement of the National Farmers&apos; Unions to a settlementof the current farm price review whereby the total ofagricultural guarantees in 1959-60 would remain at thesame level as in 1958-59 after account had been taken of the benefit derived by the industry from the new schemes of assistance to small farmers.
agricultural policy.Small FarmersBill.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 10thConclusions,Minute 6.)4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Secretaryof State for Scotland and the Minister of Agriculture (C. (59) 45and 48) on the provision in the Agriculture (Small Farmers) Bill forthe withdrawal of the marginal agricultural production scheme inScotland.The Secretary of State for Scotland recalled that at their previous discussion the Cabinet had decided that an increase of  2 in the hillcow subsidy should be offered as part of the current farm price review, and that the Government should announce that they intendedto keep under review the effect of the gradual withdrawal of marginal production grants and would consider in due course whether it wasnecessary to introduce amending legislation. Notwithstanding this announcement the pressure for the retention of the grants in Scotlandhad continued and the danger of serious political embarrassment tothe Government therefore remained. The proposed increase in the hill cow subsidy had not, in fact, been put forward in the current negotiations on the farm price review, but he was satisfied that this concession would not in itself suffice to meet the demands of theScottish farmers. He therefore sought authority to announce thathe would be willing to receive representations from the ScottishNational Farmers&apos; Union about the position of those farmers whohad received marginal production grants and thereafter to consider what further action might be necessary. This might involveamending legislation to enable marginal assistance to be given for afurther period of three to five years, with power to renew the schemefor subsequent periods.The Minister of Agriculture said that, if the marginal productionscheme were retained in Scotland, it would be impossible to withholdthe same concession from England and Wales and from NorthernIreland. This would not only be open to financial and practicalobjections but would be a reversal of the Governments announcedpolicy of bringing the existing schemes to an end in accordance withthe principle of economic, rather than maximum, production. Hewould see no serious objection, however, to a more gradual withdrawalof the marginal production scheme in Scotland than was at present contemplated or to the grant of compensating increases in the subsidy for hill cows or calves.Discussion showed that there was general agreement that pressure for the indefinite continuation of the marginal agricultural productionscheme in Scotland should be resisted. There would, however, be advantage in arranging for the scheme to be withdrawn moregradually than had hitherto been proposed; and a concession of this(2) Authorised the Agriculture Ministers, in the event of failure to reach agreement on the basis of Conclusion (1) above,to concede an increase of  2 millions or, if necessary, 3 millions in the total level of the guarantees.(3) Invited the Agriculture Ministers to submit the issue again tothe Cabinet if the National Farmers&apos; Unions refused toagree to a settlement on the basis indicated inConclusion (2) above.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to. arrange for the ministerial Committee on the Farm. Price Review toconsider the distribution among individual commoditiesof the modified price reductions involved in a settlementbased on an increase of  2 millions or  3 millions in thetotal value of the guarantees.
kind, coupled with some adjustment in favour of Scottish farmers in the context of the farm price review, might suffice to allay the anxiety of the agricultural interests in Scotland.The Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland, in consultationwith the Minister of Agriculture:  (i) to arrange for a more gradual withdrawal of the marginal agricultural production scheme inScotland;(ii) to consider the subsidy increases which could most appropriately be offered, in relation to the currentfarm price review, to compensate for the withdrawalof the scheme;(iii) to consult the Home Secretary on the terms of theParliamentary statement announcing the Govern-ment&apos;s intentions.Cabinet Office, S.W. I,10th March, 1959.
