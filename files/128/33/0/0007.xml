1. The Foreign Secretary said that, as a result of recent discussions in Zurich between the Prime Ministers of Greece and turkey, new proposals for the future status of Cyprus had beenagreed between the two Governments. These appeared to providefor the establishment of an independent State of Cyprus, guaranteed by a quadripartite treaty between the United Kingdom, Greece,Turkey and Cyprus itself. The new State would have a GreekPresident and a Turkish Vice-President. Separate communalAssemblies would be instituted, supplemented by a joint Assemblyconsisting as to 75 per cent, of Greek-Cypriots and as to 25 per cent,of Turkish-Cypriots. A joint military headquarters would beestablished in the Island, with 950 Greek and 650 Turkish troops; andthe local government would be authorised to maintain 2,000 Cypriottroops recruited from the two communities in agreed proportions.The Greek and Turkish Foreign Ministers, who had broughtthese proposals to London on the previous day, had indicated thattheir Governments would be prepared to concede in full our ownstrategic requirements in Cyprus including the establishment ofmilitary bases in enclaves retained under British sovereignty. Itwould be the responsibility of the United Kingdom, Greece and turkey collectively to meet any external threat to the Island; but itwould be open to any one of the three Governments to act independently if either or both of the other parties were unable or unwilling to co-operate in resisting aggression or infiltration.In discussion it was suggested that in view of our responsibilityfor external defence we might need to have some voice in thearrangements for the internal administration of the new State,particularly as regards internal security. It might be appropriate thata British Commissioner should be attached to the Government of cyprus for this purpose. Moreover, it would be important to ensurethat it would be impossible for an independent Cyprus, under the newConstitution, to enter into a treaty relationship with an unfriendlyPower which might affect our defence interests or to agree, without our consent, to the establishment of a foreign base in the Island. the exact delimitation of our own bases would also need more detailed examination.In further discussion the Cabinet were informed that it had beensuggested by the Greek and Turkish Governments that, if their proposals were acceptable to the United Kingdom Government inprinciple, a conference of the three Governments should be convenedin London during the following week, to which Archbishop Makariosand Dr. Kutchuk, the leaders of the Greek- and Turkish-Cypriotcommunities, should be invited. It would be preferable that definitiveheads of agreement between the three Governments should have beeninitialled before the discussions were widened to include therepresentatives of the local Cypriot communities, who might otherwiseendeavour to bring pressure to bear on the Governments to modify the substance of the proposals. Any interim statement about ourcurrent negotiations with the Greek and Turkish Foreign ministers should take account of this consideration and should avoid, as faras possible, embarrassing the Greek and Turkish Governments inrelation to their respective communities in Cyprus. Certain sectionsof the Press had already adopted a critical attitude to an agreement,which they regarded as having been reached by Greece and Turkeywithout prior consultation with ourselves. There might thereforebe advantage in allowing it to be known that we ourselves had originally prompted the initiative which the two Governments hadtaken: that we welcomed an agreement which they accepted assatisfying their requirements; and that we were now discussing withthem the necessary provisions to ensure that essential British interests would be fully safeguarded. In addition, if it could be confirmed thatthe new proposals assured us of the strategic facilities which we had
publicly declared to be necessary, it would be reasonable to allowthis fact to be made known.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet would need to consider the full text of the new proposals jbefore disclosing their attitude in public or deciding whether it would &quot;be desirable to invite Archbishop Makarios and Dr. Kutchuk to take part in further discussions. But these proposals, if they proved to be compatible with the maintenance of our essential interests in Cyprus,might well constitute a significant advance towards a final settlementof the Island&apos;s future and a considerable diplomatic victory for theWestern Powers.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to circulate, for considerationby the Cabinet on the following day, the text of the new proposals of the Greek and Turkish Foreign governments for the future status of Cyprus.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to continue his discussions withthe Greek and Turkish Foreign Ministers in the light ofthe points made in their discussion.John Waters. 2.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Scotland (C. (59) 24) about the case of JohnWaters.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that the allegation wasthat John Waters had been assaulted by two policemen in Thursoon 7th December, 1957. It was not disputed that the boy had suffered slight injuries during an attempt by the police to chargehim with disorderly behaviour. But when the case had beenconsidered by the Crown Office, Crown Counsel had decided thatthere was insufficient evidence to justify criminal proceedings. Asa result of a subsequent intervention by Sir David Robertson, M.P.,the Lord Advocate had personally reviewed the case in the summer of 1958 and had reached the same conclusion. In the course of an adjournment debate on 3rd February, 1959, the Lord Advocate had confirmed his decision not to institute criminal proceedings and had also refused to disclose the reasons for this decision. As a resulta Motion had now been tabled in the House of Commons, with thesupport of a substantial number of members of both parties, calling upon the Government to set up a Select Committee to enquire intothe case and to advise the House whether the alleged assault had infact taken place and for what reasons it had been decided that noprosecution should be instituted.Several possible courses of action were now open to theGovernment. They could establish a formal enquiry into the wholecase under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921. Or theycould constitute a non-statutory enquiry with more limited scope,in order to re-establish the reputation of the police. Alternatively,they could leave the initiative with the aggrieved party, who mightbe permitted, with the Lord Advocated consent, to institute a privatecriminal prosecution or might prefer to launch a civil action for damages. There were, however, objections to each of these courses.In discussion there was general agreement that it would be undesirable for the Government to institute any form of enquirydesigned to establish whether the Lord Advocated decision to refrain from instituting criminal proceedings had been correct. Such anQenquiry would constitute a precedent damaging to the normaladministration of criminal justice. Moreover, it would be undesirable, and ultimately prejudicial to the liberty of the subject,that it should be supposed that the decision to prefer a criminal
charge could be taken on other than strictly legal grounds orinfluenced by political pressure. On the other hand, the Attorney-General frequently indicated, in relation to cases arising in Englandand Wales, the reasons for which he had decided to institute, or to refrain from instituting, criminal proceedings; and it might bedesirable that, as an initial step, the Lord Advocate should publiclystate that he had decided not to institute such proceedings in the caseof John Waters because the evidence was insufficient to justify thiscourse.It was unlikely, however, that a statement of this kind would now suffice to allay the growing public disquiet; and it was forconsideration what further action the Government should beprepared to take. An enquiry under the Tribunals of Inquiry(Evidence) Act, 1921, would have the advantage that witnesses couldbe required to attend and to give evidence on oath. On the otherhand, it would be liable, by calling in question the Lord Advocatedoriginal decision, to prejudice the impartial administration of criminal justice. Moreover, experience had shown that a formalenquiry often made it impossible subsequently to initiate legal proceedings. On the other hand, a purely disciplinary enquiry intothe conduct of the police on a particular occasion was open to the objection that the tribunal would have no power to require thepresence of witnesses or to obtain evidence on oath, and might,therefore, fail to satisfy public opinion. Moreover, the initiative ininstituting it would rest with the Chief Constable, not with theSecretary of State; and Chief Constables had been advised, on theauthority of the Secretary of State, that in cases where a criminal offence was alleged but the criminal authorities had decided not to institute proceedings, they should not bring a disciplinary chargeunless some separate disciplinary offence had been committed. Inthese circumstances the least disadvantageous course might be totake no action until it was known whether the parties concernedproposed to initiate a civil action for damages, which would, ineffect, constitute a public enquiry on a judicial basis. This coursewould have the additional advantage that the Government couldrightly claim that, if they established a formal enquiry before anycivil proceedings had been initiated, the plaintiffs case in the civilcourt might be prejudiced.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thecase should be handled with circumspection in view of the tendency of public opinion to react strongly against any action by the policewhich appeared to infringe the liberty of the subject. The wisestcourse would be for the Lord Advocate to make an early statement in Parliament, explaining that he had reached his original decisionto refrain from instituting criminal proceedings on the ground that insufficient evidence for this purpose was available; that there were serious objections to any suggestion that the Government shouldacquiesce in a reversal of this decision as the result of political pressure; that the remedy of civil proceedings remained availableto the aggrieved parties; and that&apos;it would be improper for theGovernment to prejudice the outcome of any such proceedings by prior enquiry. If, however, the pressure for an investigation was maintained the Secretary of State should indicate that theGovernment would be prepared to consider, after the result ofany civil action was known, the desirability of establishing an enquiry into the facts. In that event it would be necessary toemphasise that the enquiry would be directed to the propriety of theaction taken by the police, not to the validity of the Lord Advocateddecision to refrain from instituting criminal proceedings. The risk that any enquiry of this kind might substantiate the allegation ofassault and, therefore, call that decision in question would have to
be accepted.  It might, in any event, arise in connexion with a civilaction for damages.The Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland, in consultation (with the Attorney-General and the Lord Advocate, toto settle the wording of a statement or statements on thecase of John Waters which might be made, on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister, in the House of commons on 16th February.Parliament. 3.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Commercial 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the PrimePolicy. Minister (C. (59) 23) on the problem of protection for the horticulturalHorticulture.    industry in general and for cut flowers in particular.(Previous The Prime Minister said that two possible courses of actionReference:      were open to us.  We could concede an immediate increase of 33^-C.C. (59) 6th   per cent, in the tariff on cut flowers, together with some increase in conclusions,    the quota for Dutch bulbs. This should suffice to hold the positionMinute 3.)      for the time being and would enable the Government to give more detailed consideration to the scope and form of any wider enquiry into the whole issue of horticultural protection.  Alternatively, theapplication for an increase in the tariff on cut flowers could be rejected on the ground that an economic case for such an increasehad not been made out.  In that event, however, we should haverejected all the current applications for increases in the horticulturaltariff and the Government would find it difficult to maintain thatthe tariff was still the main instrument of horticultural protection.It would be advisable to announce forthwith that an enquiry wouldbe instituted into alternative remedies for the unsatisfactory positionof the industry.In discussion it was emphasised that there were objections tothe use of the tariff as a protective weapon when it could not beestablished that the difficulties of the domestic producers wereattributable to foreign competition. There was still no clear evidencethat the application for an increase in the tariff on cut flowers satisfiedthis criterion. Nevertheless, it was the general view of the Cabinetthat the most effective method of retaining the confidence of the horticultural industry without at the same time committing theGovernment publicly to a radical enquiry into its problems would beto sanction this particular application. In that event there wouldbe considerable advantage in meeting the request of the national farmers&apos; Unions in full by approving a 50 per cent, increase, whichwould probably attract little more criticism from the foreign countriesaffected than an increase of 33]- per cent. Dutch opinion should inanv case be partially mollified by the proposed increase of some 300,000 in the Dutch bulb quota.Before the tariff increase could become effective, it would benecessary for us to consult with the interested foreign countries, inconformity with our obligations under the General Agreement on tariffs and Trade. The consultations should now be arranged withthe minimum of delay.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the request of the National Farmers&apos; Unionsfor a 50 per cent, increase in the existing tariff on certaincut flowers should be granted; and that this should be accompanied by an enlargement of the Dutch bulb quota.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,12th February, 1959.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in consultationwith the Foreign Secretary and the Minister ofAgriculture:  (i) to arrange for the necessary consultation under theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to bearranged as rapidly as possible;(ii) to submit to the Prime Minister proposals regardingthe form and timing of a public announcement ofthe Governments decision.
