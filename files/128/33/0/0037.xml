Germany.ForeignO Ministers&apos;Meeting.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 36thConclusions.Minute 4.)*1. The Foreign Secretary made a report to the Cabinet on thelatest stages of the negotiations at the Geneva meeting of foreign ministers.The revised version of the Western proposals had been tabledon 16th June. The Soviet Minister had delayed for a time the presentation of his counter-proposals, but had finally brought themforward on 19th June. They had then coincided with a public speechby Mr. Khrushchev which had appeared, from the first reports, tobe markedly hostile in tone; and as a result the atmosphere at Genevahad not been favourable to a dispassionate discussion of the Sovietproposals. In those circumstances it had seemed expedient that thediscussion should be adjourned for a period, and the Foreign ministers had agreed on 20th June to go into recess until 13th July.No progress had been made at Geneva towards a long-termsettlement of the Berlin question. But the latest Soviet proposalssuggested that we might be able to obtain a moratorium, under whichthe existing position would be maintained for a further period. If we continued to insist on a long-term settlement, we might have to payable high price for it and we should have no assurance that the SovietGovernment would not repudiate it when it suited them to do so.Under a moratorium, on the other hand, the juridical issue wouldin effect be postponed for a period, and this respite might be securedat the cost of agreeing that representatives of East and West germany should meet to discuss the possibilities of political as well as economic co-operation. There was much to be said for seeking an interimsolution on these lines. If that.was our objective there was a realpossibility of compromise between the latest proposals of the western powers and of the Soviet Union. Our task, during the adjournment,would be to try to narrow still further the gap between the twopositions and to persuade the United States Government to sponsorsome compromise proposal. We should also seek to persuade the americans that there were advantages to be gained by holding ameeting of Heads of Governments later in the summer.The Prime Minister said that earlier in the preceding week it had seemed possible that the discussions at Geneva would end in acomplete breakdown. He would then have been disposed to suggestthat the Heads of Governments of the Western Powers should meetto review the serious situation which this would have produced. Inthe event, however, a complete breakdown had been averted: theSoviet proposals had not been wholly unconstructive and, indeed,there was now some prospect that a compromise solution might befound. A meeting of Heads of Governments of the Western Powersnow seemed both unnecessary and inappropriate. The period of the adjournment could be better used for the purpose of securing Anglo-American agreement on some compromise proposals and on a new approach to a Summit meeting of the four Heads of Governments.He himself believed that, if the Foreign Ministers could make further progress towards an interim settlement by adjustment of the latestSoviet proposals, a number of important points could be reserved for final decision at a Summit meeting e.g., the number of Western troops to be retained in Berlin; the duration of the interim settlement; themeans of ensuring that the position taken up by the two sides onthe juridical issue would not be prejudiced by the moratorium; andthe nature and status of the discussions to be undertaken during themoratorium by the representatives of East and West Germany.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) It would be convenient if the Foreign Secretary could circulate to the Cabinet a paper setting out the latest proposals of the Western
Powers and of the Soviet Government and indicating the main points of difference between the two sides.(b) Apart from the Berlin problem there were other topics whichcould usefully be discussed at a meeting of the four Heads of QGovernments. Such a meeting might, for example, decide theremaining questions which could not be settled at the geneva conference on Nuclear Tests. It might also discuss procedures foradvancing consideration of the problem of general disarmament.(c) Further steps might be taken to bring home to public opinion in this country the progress made in the Geneva discussions andthe contribution which the United Kingdom Government had made towards this.(cl) It would be convenient if debate on this subject in the Houseof Commons could be deferred until 9th July.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statements made by the Prime Minister andthe Foreign Secretary on the course of the negotiations at the Geneva meeting of Foreign Ministers, and of thepoints raised in the Cabinefs discussion.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to circulate a Note setting out,with comments, the latest proposals of the Western Powersand of the Soviet Government for a solution of the berlin question(3) Expressed their appreciation of the skill and patience whichthe Foreign Secretary had shown in the negotiations atthe Geneva meeting.Parliament. 2.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.MaidiveIslands.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 25thConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary (C. (59) 103) on the state of the negotiationswith the Government of the Maidive Islands in connexion with theestablishment of an air staging post at Gan.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the Maldivian Govern-ment had suspended the negotiations on 17th March, but they had now indicated that they were willing to resume them and proposedto send a delegation to London for that purpose towards the endof July. The construction of the airfield was meanwhile proceedingand would be completed early in 1960. The work was being carriedout with the full co-operation of the local inhabitants (the Suvadivans)who were now trying to assert their independence of the MaldivianGovernment. Although our legal title to establish an air stagingpost at Gan was soundly based, under the Protection Agreement of1953 and under the preliminary Lease Agreement of 1956, it was desirable that we should, if possible, conclude a detailed agreement on the use of Gan. We should not, however, appear unduly anxiousto conclude the negotiations. Even if the Maldivian Governmenteventually signed such an agreement, there would remain the problemof reconciling the dissident Suvadivans to the restoration of theauthority of the Maldivian Government.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Although our primary interest was to establish a stagingpost at Gan with the greatest security and length of tenure possible,we were also concerned to assert our right under the 1953 agreement to be responsible for the external relations of the MaldivianGovernment. This was necessary in order to prevent a foreign government, such as the United Arab Republic or even the soviet union, from establishing a staging post elsewhere in the Maldives.
atomic energy.(previous references :C.C. (58) 8thConclusions,Minute 8 andC.C. (57) 14thConclusions,Minute 5.)CivilProgramme.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Power (C. (59) 105) about the building of a nuclear power station at Dungeness.The Minister of Power said that a public enquiry had been heldinto this project and the inspectors who had held it recommended thatconsent should be given for the erection of a power station of 500 MW.capacity on this site. A decision to proceed with this project wouldbe criticised, both by those interested in amenities and natureconservancy, and by others who wished the nuclear power programme to be curtailed in the interests of the coal-mining industry. However,the capacity of the nuclear power stations already built or under construction, together with the station at Dungeness, would still beless than half of that to be provided under the programme approvedby the Cabinet. If the construction of new stations were nowcurtailed, the scientific and industrial staffs concerned with this programme would be dispersed, with grave economic consequencesincluding damage to our export prospects. He therefore recommended that consent should be given for the Dungenessproject.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that whenthe report of the public enquiry was published, it would reveal thatthe application by the Generating Board was partly based on theassumption that coal production would not be able to keep pace with the increasing demand for power. This assumption was likelyto be challenged, in view of the present difficulties of the coal industryand the large surplus of coal. Nevertheless, he was prepared tosupport the proposal to give consent for a nuclear power station at Dungeness. The Generating Board should, however, be warned that this decision should not be taken to imply that the Governmentwould be equally ready to give consent in other cases, since therewere many areas in which the construction of a nuclear power stationwould not be tolerable on amenity grounds.The Lord President said that Dungeness was a unique geologicalfeature, the scientific study of which would be adversely affected bythe construction of a nuclear power station. It was also a favouritearea for bird watchers. Nevertheless, on general grounds, he alsosupported the proposal to give consent for the project.(b) Although the dissident Suvadivans were at present more friendly, it would be inexpedient to encourage their desire for independence. For this might call into question our rights underthe 1953 Agreement, and might encourage the Maldivian Governmentto seek the protection of some other foreign Power. Nevertheless, inthe outcome of the negotiations with the Maldivian Government, weshould seek to protect the position of the Suvadivans.(c) It was important that we should obtain as long a lease aspossible of the airfield at Gan, and that we should secure some arrangement for its renewal.(d) It would be unwise to delay for too long the resumption ofthe negotiations. It should, however, be possible to indicate to theMaldivian Government that, while we could not resume discussions at the exact date they had suggested, we would be ready to do soat about the middle of September. Before the discussions were resumed, we should consider in greater detail exactly how they shouldbe handled.The Cabinet Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to invite theMaldivian Government to send representatives to resume negotiations in London in the middle of September.
In discussion it was explained that, although the capital costof the present type of nuclear power station was about three times asmuch as the capital cost of a conventional power station, the running costs of nuclear power stations, if capital costs were disregarded, were considerably less than those of conventional stations. There was every hope that, with the development of the programme, nuclear power would become increasingly economical. Although therewould be advantages in postponing the construction of further nuclear power stations until a more advanced and economical design could beproduced, these were outweighed by the importance of maintainingin being the scientific and industrial staffs now engaged on these projects.The Prime Minister said that, from the long-term point of viewof dur economy and our national prestige, it was desirable that weshould proceed steadily with the nuclear power programme on whichwe had embarked. Despite the criticisms which might be expected,consent for the Dungeness project should be given. This decision could conveniently be announced in the course of the debate in theHouse of Lords on 8th July on the fuel situation.The Cabinet Approved the proposal for the construction of a nuclear power station at Dungeness, and authorised the Ministerof Power to announce this decision in the debate in theHouse of Lords on 8th July.industrial disputes.(previous references:C.C. (59) 12thConclusions,Minute 9 and cm. (56) 12thConclusions,Minute 4.)Printing.5. The Minister of Labour said that the current dispute in the printing industry might prove to be the major industrial dispute ofthe year, since it involved about one million man-hours per week.The leader of one of the trade unions concerned in the dispute, whowas also Chairman of the Trades Union Congress, was trying tosecure from the Congress a declaration of support for the strike.The unions were not, however, in a strong position, since they had refused to submit the dispute to arbitration, and there was no immediate danger of the strike&apos;s spreading. Meanwhile, theemployers were showing a greater unanimity of purpose than hadbeen expected and there had been no move by either side to secureintervention by the Minister. He did not himself intend to take theinitiative and regarded it as preferable to await developments.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour.S. G. Brown, 6.   The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the firm of limited. S G. Brown, Ltd., had been bought by the Admiralty during the warin order to secure a satisfactory standard of efficiency. No indicationhad then been given that the firm was being taken over for only alimited period or that it would in due course be returned to its formerowner, Mrs. Brown. Sixty per cent, of the firm&apos;s output nowconsisted of commercial products, and the Admiralty were anxious tosell it in order to avoid the need to put further capital into it. Anumber of other companies had shown themselves interested in thepossibility of purchase, and it should be possible to secure asatisfactory price.In discussion it was pointed out that the proposal to sellS. G. Brown, Ltd. had aroused some disquiet on both sides of theHouse of Commons. Some Members were concerned that theGovernment should secure the best possible price for the company:others felt that its former owner should, on the analogy of land which the Government had bought and wished to dispose of, begiven specially favourable treatment and the opportunity to buy the
company back at a current valuation. In this case, however, theasset which the Government proposed to sell was different in kindfrom that which they had bought. Since the firm had been taken over, its staff had expanded by more than ten times and its works hadbeen moved to a new area. Moreover, it was desirable that the firm should be preserved as a going concern, and it was unlikelythat its former owner would be able to do this.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that astatement should be formulated setting out the conditions on whichthe Government were prepared to sell the company :in particular,its preservation as a going concern and security of employment forits staff. While the Government were not unmindful of the desirabilityof giving the former owner the opportunity to buy it back, they couldnot ignore the public need to secure a fair price and an assurance that the undertaking would be carried on. This statement could beused in the debate which was due to take place in the House ofCommons on 25th June, and thereafter the conditions of purchaseshould be communicated to the former owner of the company. If,as seemed unlikely, she wished to buy it back on these conditions, she should be given the opportunity to do so only by competitive tenderingand not on specially favourable terms.The Cabinet Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to submit to the PrimeMinister drafts of a statement of the conditions on which theGovernment were prepared to sell S. G. Brown, Ltd. andof a letter to the former owner of the company on the lines agreed in the Cabinefs discussion.Employment. 7.   The President of the Board of Trade said that it had become(Previous       clear, in the discussions on the reorganisation of the cotton industry,Reference:      that the existing statutory powers of controlling the distribution ofC.C.

There would minute 9.)      shortly be available a report on this subject by officials, which wouldDistribution     assist the Government to formulate a new policy to deal with this of Industry.     problem.   Meanwhile, however, the Opposition could be expectedto take the opportunity of the debate that day on the Report stage of the Cotton Bill to criticise the Government for not having founda solution of this problem and to announce a policy of their own.It might be helpful if the Government anticipated this by announcingthat they had considered the problem and proposed to seek newpowers to deal with it in the next Parliament.Discussion showed that the balance of opinion in the cabinet was against making such an announcement at the present stage.The latest figures showed a striking improvement in unemploymentin the areas which the Distribution of Industry Act, 1958, had been used to help, and in these circumstances it would be preferable forthe Government to take time to work out a new policy in some detail before announcing their plans for the future.The Cabinet Agreed that no announcement of a new policy to deal withspecial problems in the distribution of industry should bemade in the debate in the House of Commons on the report stage of the Cotton Bill.
