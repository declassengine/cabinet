Germany.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 16thConclusions,Minute 5.)*2. The Prime Minister and The Foreign Secretary reviewed thecourse of the conversations which they had held in Paris and in Bonnduring the preceding week in preparation for their visit to Washington.On the procedure for handling the forthcoming international legislation on the related problems of Germany, Berlin and european security, it now seemed likely that the French and german governments could be persuaded to accept the suggestion that ameeting of Foreign Minister should be followed by a meeting of Headsof Governments and that a firm date should be fixed for the lattermeeting. The German Government already recognised that foreign ministers were unlikely to be able to reach a settlement, and that their meeting would be more fruitful if a date had already been fixed for a subsequent meeting of Heads of Governments. The President of theFrench Republic had not yet assented to this course; but his adviserssaw its advantages, and he would probably fall in with it if it were accepted by the other Western Governments. It would be moredifficult to bring the United States Government round to this view.For they still argued that a meeting of Heads of Governments shouldbe conditional on satisfactory progress by a meeting of foreign ministers. This seemed to ignore the dangers of the situation. For,if the Foreign Ministers failed to make progress towards a settlement,it would become even more important and urgent that Heads of governments should try to find a solution. If a date were fixed now for a meeting of Heads of Governments, there was a good prospectIndonesia. 1.   The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that he had(Previous       communicated to the Dutch Government the assurance, which the reference:      Cabinet had approved at their earlier meeting, that we would supportC.C. (59) 12th them if the Indonesian Government resorted to force in order to conclusions,    prosecute their claim to Netherlands New Guinea.  This assuranceMinute 6.)      embodied a statement that &quot; Her Majesty&apos;s Government cannot enterinto a commitment to provide military support but they would do everything within their power to assist the Netherlands Governmentin other appropriate ways.&quot; The Dutch Government had asked thatthe word &quot; other &quot; should be omitted from this sentence; and it wouldbe desirable, in the interests of our general relations with them, thatwe should concede this point on the basis of a clear understanding thatthe amendment would not enlarge the extent of our commitment orimpose on us any obligation to provide military assistance.   the assurance would in any event remain a confidential one, and it was understood that the Dutch Government would make no public reference to it.In discussion there was general agreement that, if the word&quot; other &quot; were omitted, the text of the assurance would still not involve us in any obligation to provide the Dutch Government with military support, but would leave us free to provide such support if we decidedthat it would be appropriate to do so. In these circumstances the amendment could be accepted-.The Cabinet Agreed that the assurance to the Dutch Government aboutthe extent of the assistance which we should be prepared tomake available to them in the event of the Indonesian government resorting to force should be amended toindicate that, while Her Majesty Y Government could not enter into any commitment to provide military support, theywould do everything within their power to assist the dutch government in appropriate ways.
Cyprus. 3.  The Cabinet were informed that the Greek Government(Previous were proposing to arrange an elaborate ceremony for the reception ofReference: the leader of EOKA, Colonel Grivas, on his arrival in Athens. this c.C. (59) 12th was liable to be resented by public opinion in this country and conclusions. to impose some strain on Anglo-Greek relations, but there appearedMinute 8.)      to be no grounds on which we could intervene.The Cabinet Invited the Colonial Secretary, in consultation with theHome Secretary, to consider the terms in which theGovernment spokesmen should, if necessary, commentduring the forthcoming Parliamentary debate on Cyprus onthe reception accorded by the Greek Government to ColonelGrivas on his arrival in Athens.Diaries of 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeRoger Casement Secretary and the Commonwealth Secretary (C. (59) 53) on the diarieskept by Roger Casement.The Home Secretary said that, although these diaries had been inthe possession of the Home Office since 1925, successive HomeSecretaries had refused to state whether or not they existed or to allow Qaccess to them. Copies of the diaries had, however, been publishedrecently by a journalist who had obtained them in 1922; and it wasno longer realistic for the Government to deny their existence.  Hethat the Soviet Government would agree to refrain from takingunilateral action in the meantime. If, however, things were left todrift, there was a grave risk that the Soviet Government would con-clude a peace treaty with East Germany, and the Western powers might then be forced to ask for a meeting of Heads of Governments in circumstances in which they would be negotiating from weakness.On the substance of the problems to be discussed in theseinternational negotiations, the conversations in Paris and in Bonn hadon the whole been reassuring. Thus, in Paris, it had appeared thatwhen General de Gaulle spoke of the need to resist by force anyblockade of West Berlin, what he had in mind was a situation in whichthe Western Powers were denied physical access to Berlin not one inwhich control over that access was transferred to East german authorities. It had also appeared, in Bonn, that Dr. Adenauer wasreconciled to the prospect that Germany would remain divided for afurther period of years; and that he would not be unwilling to accepta settlement on that basis, provided that some amelioration of conditions in East Germany was secured and that hope of theultimate reunification of Germany was not finally extinguished.Suspicions had been aroused in Germany by the passage in the communique on the Moscow talks referring to the possibility of somelimitation of forces and weapons in an agreed area in Europe. TheGerman Government had inferred from this that British ministers were now disposed to consider favourably the possibility of some plan of disengagement in Europe. Similar misunderstandings had risenelsewhere; and it was for consideration whether steps should not betaken at an appropriate stage perhaps on the conclusion of theforthcoming discussions in Washington to clarify the position of theUnited Kingdom Government on this question.The Cabinet Took note of this report on the discussions which the PrimeMinister and Foreign Secretary had held with French andGerman Ministers during their recent visits to Paris andBonn.
international 5.   The   Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theDevelopment   Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (59) 50) on the proposal to establishAssociation.     a new International Development Association (I.D.A.) to financedevelopment projects in under-developed countries.The Economic Secretary, Treasury, said that the United StatesGovernment strongly favoured the establishment of a new international organisation for giving aid to under-developed countries on the basis of long-term loans at low rates of interest repayablewholly or partly in local currencies. This presented us with some difficulties. Our obligations we undertook to the new organisationmight conflict with our existing commitments to the commonwealth and would involve a drain on our resources. Moreover, large-scaleloans on generous terms might undermine the normal pattern of market lending and, if repayable in local currencies, would becomelittle more than disguised gifts. Nevertheless, it seemed certain thatthe United States Government would proceed with their proposal andthe balance of advantage appeared to lie in our being associated with it and sharing the control of its activities. While a decision on the initial capital of the Association and the scale of our contribution toit could be deferred until a later stage, the Chancellor of theExchequer had in mind figures of $2,000 millions and $280 millionsrespectively. For the moment, however, we need do no more thanagree in principle to contribute to the fund.Discussion showed some support for this proposal on the groundthat a co-ordinated plan for assistance to under-developed countriesmust form an integral part of the policy of the Western Powers.therefore proposed to make a statement in the House of Commonsindicating that they would be deposited in the Public Record Officeand made available to bona fide research workers and journalists.Access to the relevant Home Office files would not, however, be permitted.Discussion showed that there was general agreement that theexistence of the diaries should now be admitted. There were, however,certain objections to the proposal to permit limited access to them inthe Public Record Office. This might be held to constitute a breach of copyright; while permission to allow copies to be made might, inaddition, be regarded as involving publication of an obscene libel.Moreover, it would be difficult to devise and to administera satisfactory criterion by which bona fide research workers could be judged. These risks might be avoided if the diaries were transferredto casement&apos;s executors, as the owners of the copyright. But therewas no certainty that these individuals could now be traced.Alternatively, the diaries could be handed over to the Government ofthe Irish Republic. They, however, might well declare that the documents were forgeries; and the former controversy on this issuemight be revived. The least objectionable course might be to arrangefor the diaries to be deposited in the British Museum, subject to theconsent of the Trustees, or in the Public Record Office, with an indication that copyright was reserved to casement&apos;s executors,whoever they might be, and that any person seeking to copy or to publish them would do so at his own risk. The implications of thiscourse would, however, need further consideration.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the LordChancellor, the Commonwealth Secretary and the Attorney-General, to give further consideration to the future custody of Roger Casement&apos;s diaries in the light of the points madein their discussion.
Moreover, it would be to our advantage to increase the purchasingpower of these countries, since they were potential markets for our exports; and the practice of the International Bank for reconstruction and Development, to which it was proposed that the I.D.A. shouldbe affiliated, entitled us to hope that a substantial portion of the total capital of the fund might be invested in the Commonwealth. a contribution of the order proposed was not large in comparison withthe total of our investment overseas; and, whatever the disadvantages of this proposal, a project on these lines was preferable to thealternative of a similar organisation under the control of the united nations.On the other hand, the generous terms on which it was suggestedthat the IDA. should offer loans to under-developed countries mightreflect unfavourably on the more stringent terms on which we madeloans available to our own Colonies; and they might also make itdifficult to maintain the scheme of Commonwealth assistance loanswhich had been agreed at the Commonwealth Economic Conferenceat Montreal in the previous year. It might therefore be desirable, if we decided to join the I.D.A., to stipulate that the total amount of capital to be invested by the Association in the Commonwealth and colonies should not be less than our contribution to the fund, although therewas some danger that any attempt to impose conditions of this nature would restrict, rather than increase, the amount of the assistance whichthe Commonwealth might receive from the Association.In further discussion it was suggested that, before we could accept any commitment in relation to the I.D.A., we should need to besatisfied that our contribution would not place an undue burden onour resources, having regard to the expected decline in our balance ofpayments surplus in 1959 and to the results of the Governmentsmeasures to stimulate domestic demand. In any event it might bedesirable to seek to ensure that at least half the capital of theAssociation would be contributed by countries other than the UnitedStates; and it might be appropriate to take this opportunity toexamine the relation of the Association to the activities of otherAmerican foundations in the under-developed countries.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, during his forthcoming visit to Washington, he would inform president eisenhower that, while we regarded an expansion of trade as the most effective means of raising the standard of living in the under-developed countries, we were in general sympathy with the internationalapproach to the problems of those countries which was exemplified bythis project. He would indicate, however, that it raised a number of practical issues for the United Kingdom, and that we should need toconsider it in greater detail in the light of the other demands on our resources and the scale of our existing commitments. Before we could reach a final decision we must be satisfied that membership of theAssociation would not prejudice our ability to discharge the heavyobligations which we already carried.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for afurther study to be made of the advantages and disadvantages of United Kingdom membership of theproposed International Development Association on thelines indicated by the Prime Minister.(2) Agreed to consider further, in the light of the result of theenquiry under Conclusion (1) above, the attitude which theUnited Kingdom should adopt to this project.Shipping 6.

(59) 51) about the replacement of the Queen Mary andthe Queen Elizabeth.
Economic 7.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the survey, 1959.   Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (59) 49), to which was attached a draftof the Economic Survey, 1959 as approved by the Economic PolicyCommittee.In discussion it was suggested that paragraphs 42-46, although a correct factual description of the fall in employment during 1958, didnot adequately reflect the steps which the Government had taken to redress unemployment or demonstrate the manner in which theGovernments policy had developed from an initial attempt to remedymerely local unemployment to a more comprehensive endeavour to stimulate demand and output, both generally and particularly in areas the Minister of Transport said that these ships were approaching the end of their economic life. If the Cunard Steamship Company didnot replace them in the near future, they would be compelled virtuallyto close down their North Atlantic service. But they could not buildnew ships at a total cost of perhaps  60 millions without substantial assistance from the Government. There was a strong case for such assistance, in the light of the prestige of British shipping, the foreign currency earnings of the North Atlantic service and the support and encouragement which the shipbuilding industry would derive fromreplacement of the &quot; Queens.&quot; Moreover, it was- unrealistic to suppose that, without subsidising our own shipping, we couldcompete with the shipping of other nations which was subsidised by governments in terms not only of capital cost but also of operating costs. He therefore sought authority to inform the Company that theycould approach their shipbuilders, John Brown and Company, for thepurpose of drawing up detailed plans and estimates. It would benecessary for the Company to pay full regard both to moderndevelopments in ship construction and marine propulsion and to the design and performance of a ship which would be required to compete with supersonic jet aircraft across the North Atlantic. Subsequently,further consideration should be given to the costs involved and to the formulation of a scheme of assistance satisfactory both tothe Company and to the Government.In discussion there was general agreement that the demand forsurface transport across the Atlantic was likely to justify the replacement of the Queen Mary and, subsequently, the queen elizabeth, and that the principle of Exchequer assistance for thispurpose should be accepted. Pending more detailed examination ofthe project, however, any statement in Parliament should be limited toindicating that the Government were discussing the matter with the cunard Company.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposals in C. (59) 51.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport to inform the cunard company that, in order to ascertain whether a satisfactory scheme of Government assistance for the replacement ofthe Queen Mary and, subsequently, the Queen Elizabethcould be devised, they were authorised to approach theirshipbuilders, John Brown and Company, and to preparedetailed plans and estimates.(3) Invited the Minister of Transport, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to consider, in the light of theresult of the enquiries to be carried out under conclusion (2) above, the extent and form of Exchequerassistance for the replacement of the Queen Mary and the queen Elizabeth; and to circulate detailed proposals for.consideration by the Cabinet.
of high and continuing unemployment. The paragraphs might be revised, and possibly expanded, in order to remove this objection; butit would be important that, as amended, they should remain consistent with the general conclusion of the Survey that the economy stillprovided scope for further expansion of output and of employment.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Minister of Labour and the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, to reconsider paragraphs 42-46 of theEconomic Survey, .1959, on the lines indicated in their discussion.(2) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for theEconomic Survey, 1959, to be published on 1st April afteramendment in accordance with Conclusion (1) above,Education.voluntary schools.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 8thConclusions.Minute 2.)8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Education (C. (59) 52) on increased aid to voluntary schools.The Minister of Education said that, in accordance with the cabinets previous decision, he had held further negotiations with thedenominational interests concerned on the basis that:  (i) the maximum rate of grant on the categories of voluntaryschool building work now eligible for grant should beincreased from 50 per cent, to 75 per cent.; and that(ii) a maximum grant of 75 per cent, should be payable for theprovision of new secondary schools needed to matchexisting aided primary schools of the same denomination.The Church of England were now satisfied with these proposals and the Roman Catholic Church also endorsed them, although theyhad not abandoned their ultimate aim of securing grant on ailvoluntary school building. The Free Churches had, however, main-tained their t opposition, especially to the Governments secondproposal. On the other hand, there v/as reason to believe that theleaders of the Opposition remained in general agreement with theGovernments intentions, which could be fully justified on educationalgrounds. He therefore recommended that the necessary legislation should be introduced immediately after the Easter recess and passed into law as quickly as possible.In discussion it was suggested that, while the measures proposed should now be formally adopted as the Governments policy, furtherconsideration should be given to the timing of their publication. Inparticular, there could be no certainty that sufficient parliamentary time could be found for the enactment of a Bill introduced after Easter.Moreover, it would be prudent to envisage considerable criticism bythe Free Churches of the advantages which they would regard the roman Catholic Church as obtaining from the proposal to pay grant for new secondary schools to match aided primary schools of the samedenomination. On the other hand, there might be advantage inproceeding with a Bill from which the Opposition did not officiallydissent and in establishing the Governments proposals on a non-partisan basis. These considerations would need to be examined in greater detail.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of C. (59) 52.(2) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the LordChancellor, the Lord President, the Minister of education and the Chief Whip, to give further consideration to thebest means of proceeding with the proposals for increasedaid to voluntary schools.Z2 jzet
9. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theColonial Secretary (C. (59) 58) on the emergency in Nyasaland.The Colonial Secretary said that, in consultation with theCommonwealth Secretary, the Prime Minister of the Federation of rhodesia and Nyasaland and the Governors of Northern rhodesia and of Nyasaland, he had given further consideration to the proposalto publish a White Paper on the emergency in Nyasaland and to institute an enquiry into the. origins of the disturbances.A first draft of a White Paper had been prepared;. but on furtherreflection he now thought it might be preferable, from the point ofview of public presentation, if the information which it contained wasmade public in the form of a despatch from the Governor ofthe territory rather than in a document prepared by the UnitedKingdom Government.In addition, it would be desirable to appoint a Commission ofEnquiry, which should be restricted to a factual investigation into the causes of the recent disturbances. The Commission should be non-political rather than Parliamentary in character, and should consist ofa senior United Kingdom Judge as chairman, and two other members,one of v/hom might be a former Colonial Governor. The commission were bound to make some reference to the suspicions of Federationwhich were held by the majority of Africans in Nyasaland; and itwould therefore be useful if, in announcing their appointment, theGovernment could simultaneously announce their intention to appoint a wider Commission to consider the working of Federation and tomake recommendations for its future.In discussion it was agreed that a despatch from the Governor of nyasaland would be a more appropriate means of publishing theavailable information about the events which had precipitated theemergency. It would have the additional advantage of demonstratingthat there were no grounds for the allegation that the Governorhimself had been doubtful of the need to declare a state of emergency and had been unduly influenced by the Prime Minister of theFederation. The despatch should, if possible, be published on23rd March.As regards the proposed enquiry, it was open to question whethera former Colonial Governor would be accepted as a wholly impartialmember of a Commission of this nature, and alternative possibilitiesshould be explored. Consideration should also be given to themethods of investigation which the Commission should employ. Thecircumstances in the territory, particularly the danger of reprisal andintimidation, would make it inappropriate to adopt a strictly judicialprocedure, whereby witnesses would be compelled to attend andwould be required to give evidence on oath. The terms of reference of the Commission should be drafted with these considerations in mind and the Commission should, if possible, be invited to adopt a procedure analogous to that of an ordinary Departmental Committee.There would be advantage in synchronising the public announcementof this enquiry with the announcement of the Government^ intentionto appoint a wider enquiry into the future of the Federation; but thelatter project might initially encounter some opposition from theGovernment of the Federation and the announcement of the appoint-ment of the more limited investigation into the origin of the recent disturbances should not be delayed on that account.In further discussion concern was expressed about the possible consequences of the political pressure in this country for Nyasalandto be given the right to secede from the Federation. If this demandwere conceded Northern Rhodesia would claim a similar right, and southern Rhodesia would then be liable to gravitate into the orbit ofthe Union of South Africa. The Federation would dissolve and the
Governments attempt to create a multi-racial partnership in central africa would fail. It was desirable that these issues should beremoved from Party political controversy and that the future of theFederation should be the subject of an independent enquiry. TheMinister of State for Colonial Affairs, who was at present visitingCentral Africa, should seek to convince the Government of theFederation of the wisdom of this course; and, if necessary, theCommonwealth Secretary might himself visit the Federation to reinforce these representations.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Colonial Secretary to arrange for the publicationon 23rd March of a despatch from the Governor of nyasaland reporting on the circumstances in which a stateof emergency had been declared in Nyasaland.(2) Agreed that a Commission of Enquiry into the origins of therecent disturbances in Nyasaland should be constituted onthe lines indicated in their discussion.(3) Invited the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with theColonial Secretary, to consider the terms of reference forthis Commission of Enquiry.(4) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation with theColonial Secretary, to arrange for the Minister of State for colonial Affairs to represent to the Government of theFederation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland the reasons forwhich the United Kingdom Government thought itdesirable that the future of the Federation shouldsubsequently be the subject of an independent enquiry.Cabinet Office, SWA,17th March, 1959.
