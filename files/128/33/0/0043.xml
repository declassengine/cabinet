Federation of 1. The Cabinet had before them a copy of the report of the rhodesia and Commission of Enquiry under Mr. Justice Devlin (C. (59) 124) intoNyasaland. the recent disturbances in Nyasaland, and the draft of a despatch(Previous       from the Governor commenting on the report.Reference Prime Minister said that, as agreed by the Cabinet at their conclusions, previous meeting, arrangements had been made to publish the report,Minute 2.) &apos; together with the Governors preliminary comments, after the debate on the Central African Federation on 22nd July. The report fullyvindicated the action of the Governor in declaring a state ofemergency, and showed that he had ample grounds for apprehending(violence; that he was not unduly influenced by the report of a&quot;murder plot&quot;; and that he had acted on his own decision,uninfluenced by the Government of the Federation. The report was, however, sceptical of the existence of a &quot; murder plot&quot; andcritical of the extent to which force had been used by police and troops after the declaration of the emergency. In the current climateof opinion this latter point was one on which the Government might find themselves vulnerable.Discussion showed that it was the united opinion of the Cabinetthat the action of the Nyasaland Government in declaring a stateof emergency had been fully justified and that their subsequentexecutive action had been soundly conceived. They should thereforereceive full support from the United Kingdom Government bothon the merits of the case and because of the effect which failure tosupport them would have on the government and development ofother African territories. This need not imply that the UnitedKingdom Government necessarily approved the executive action taken by subordinates in every particular instance, although thecircumstances in which violence had to be checked or anticipatedmight often have left no alternative to the drastic methods employed.In discussion of the draft of the Governors despatch thefollowing were the main points made:i (a) The Governor was justified in questioning the distinctiondrawn by the Devlin Commission between a &quot; murder plot&quot; (the organised character of which might perhaps have been somewhatover-emphasised in the White Paper) and the adoption by theCongress of a policy of violence involving the murder of Europeans.This distinction was unlikely to be endorsed by legal or public opinion in this country.(b) The despatch might refer to the opinion expressed to theGovernor by the Commissioner of Police that the information abouta plan for the mass murder of Europeans and Asians &quot; was correctand must be accepted seriously.&quot;(c) Greater emphasis might be placed on the complicity ofof Dr. Banda in the &quot; murder plot &quot; and on the inflammatory natureof his speeches.(d) Generally, the length and detail of the Governor^ commentsmight distract attention from the main issues, on which he had a fully adequate reply to the criticisms of the Devlin Commission, andso reduce its impact.In further discussion the Cabinet were informed that theOpposition were expected to ask for a debate on the Commission^report in the following week. The Government spokesmen might take the line, in supporting the action of the Nyasaland Government,that they had done no more than the situation demanded and wouldhave been open to much stronger criticism if they had not takenfirm action and widespread outbreaks of violence had occurred. Itcould be argued that, in a situation in which authority had to bereasserted, strong action at the outset was not only the most effective,SECRET55460-5 b 2
but in the long run the most humane, policy; and a comparisonmight be drawn with the Mau Mau insurrection in Kenya andpossibly with the Indian Mutiny. Emphasis might also be placedon the inherent difficulties and dangers of the transitional period between paternal Colonial government and the emergence of a territory into independence. At the same time, it would be preferable not to appear to be too hostile to the Commission^ report, since this might cast doubt on its main conclusion vindicating the decisionto declare an emergency. The criticisms made by the Commissionstemmed at least in part from the difference between their ownassessment of the character of the African Congress leaders and thatformed by the Nyasaland Government.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the United Kingdom Government should give full support to the decision of the Nyasaland Governmentto declare a state of emergency and to the general lineof their subsequent executive action.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary (i) to arrange for the Governor of Nyasaland to give further consideration, in the light of the suggestions made in their discussion, to the draft of his despatch commenting on the report of the DevlinCommission;(ii) to take account, in the forthcoming debate on thereport, of the further points made in . their discussion.Kenya. 2.  The Cabinet had before them the report of the Committee ofHola Detention Enquiry into the disciplinary charges against Mr. A. G. Sullivan,Camp. who had been in charge of the hold detention camp at the time of(Previous death of eleven Mau Mau detainees, and against his assistantReference- Mr. A- C. Coutts, together with a proposed exchange of despatchesC C (59) 42nd between the Colonial Secretary and the Governor of Kenya on conclusions improvements in the administration of the detention camps, on a minute 3.) &apos; reorganisation of Ministerial responsibility for the camps and on certain changes in personnel in the Prison Service.The Prime Minister said that, as a result of the hold incident,responsibility for the detention camps, which had hitherto beenshared between the Minister for African Affairs and the Ministerfor Internal Security and Defence, was now to be concentrated inthe hands of a single Minister who would be responsible not only for the rehabilitation of detainees but also for the planning and management of the camps. Mr. J. H. Lewis, the Commissioner ofPrisons, had been granted permission to retire and Mr. Sullivan,against whom the Committee of Enquiry had found that the charges were established, was to be required to do so. The charges against mr.. Coutts had not been established.Discussion showed that there was general agreement withthese arrangements. There remained, however, the position ofMr. W. M. Campbell, an Assistant Commissioner of the prison service, who had been sent to hold with two more senior officials on the day following the incident to make a preliminary report tothe Governor pending a more detailed investigation by the police.On the basis of Mr. Campbell&apos;s report that it was &quot; the opinion ofall with whom we spoke that the compelling exercise was in no wayconnected with the cause of death of the detainees, theGovernment of Kenya had issued a statement attributing thedeaths to drinking water. Mr. campbell&apos;s statement had subsequently been controverted in evidence before the Committee ofEnquiry, which would be available in the Library of the House of
Cabinet Office, S.W.I.20th July, 1959.Commons. The Government had stated in a recent debate on the incident that they would, if necessary, consider further disciplinaryproceedings after the completion of those against Mr. Sullivan andMr. Coutts. Was there not, therefore, a case for an enquiry intothe inaccuracy of Mr. campbell&apos;s report? In reply it was pointedout that his report had been an informal one, made after a hurriedvisit, and such medical evidence as was available at the time did notappear to be inconsistent with the view that the deaths wereconnected with drinking water. The Governor was strongly opposedto any action against Mr. Campbell and a further formal enquirymight have damaging effects on the morale of the Kenya prison service. It might therefore suffice if some statement were made onbehalf of the United Kingdom Government expressing regret atthe inadequacy of Mr. campbell&apos;s preliminary report.Summing up this part of the discussion the Prime Minister saidthat the balance of opinion in the Cabinet did not appear to be infavour of taking disciplinary proceedings against Mr. Campbell butthat further consideration should be given to the possibility of astatement on the lines suggested.The Cabinet (1) Took note with approval of the arrangements made for there organisation of responsibility for the Kenya detentioncamps and the changes in personnel in the Prison Service.(2) Took note with approval of the despatches on the subject which were to be exchanged between the colonial secretary and the Governor.(3) Invited the Colonial Secretary to give further consideration,in consultation with the Lord Chancellor and in the lightof their discussion, to the desirability of a statement onthe report of Mr. W. M. Campbell.
