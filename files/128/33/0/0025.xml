Z2 2&apos;:jrs3CentralAmerica.Supply ofArms.(previous reference:2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (59) 71) on the supply of arms to Cuba and theDominican Republic.The Foreign Secretary said that, in view of the unsettledconditions in this area, the United States Government had decided toC.C (59) 10th suspend the supply of arms to the area for the time being and hadMinuteS14)S&apos; as&apos;ced all friendly supplying countries to do likewise. He proposedthat we should follow the same general policy but that, like the UnitedStates, we should be prepared to contemplate some unimportantexceptions. It would not, he thought, be inconsistent with thegeneral policy if v/e released to Cuba the five aircraft (SeaFuries) which had been ordered by their previous Government andsupplied no more than four unarmed patrol vessels whichthe Dominican Government were anixous to order from us. He was ready to discuss with the President of the Board of Trade what line should be taken about the supply of spare parts for British aircraftalready bought by these countries and about the delivery of sportingammunition to Cuba.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the supply of arms to countries in central america should be suspended for the time being, subject tothe particular exceptions noted in paragraph 12 (ii) ofC. (59)71.Maidive 1.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the islands. Commonwealth Secretary (C. (59) 63) on the state of the negotiationswith the Government of the Maidive Islands for facilities for theconstruction and operation of a military airport at Gan.The Commonwealth Secretary said that this memorandum hadbeen circulated, at the Prime Minister^ request, so that the cabinet might be aware of the situation. He hoped that the MaldivianGovernment would now be prepared to send a delegation to london to negotiate a firm agreement; and there was some reason to hope that,if we offered a larger annual rent for the airfield, a satisfactory settlement might be reached.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Lack of a firm agreement with the Maldivian government might now delay the completion of the airport at Gan; for theconstruction of the airport buildings could not be begun until the waywas clear to move the inhabitants of a neighbouring village to anotherisland.(b) If a Maldivian delegation was to come to London, it was desirable that its members should not be exposed en route to influenceshostile to the United Kingdom. They should also be kept underappropriate supervision while in London.(c) Facilities for Press correspondents to visit the MaidiveIslands should be delayed for as long as possible.The Cabinet Took note of this report on the state of the negotiations withthe Maldivian Government and invited the commonwealth secretary to give special attention to the points noted inparagraphs (b) and (c) above.
(2) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would discuss with thePresident of the Board of Trade whether any furtherexceptions could properly be made to this general policy,particularly in respect of sporting ammunition and spare parts for aircraft.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for the United StatesGovernment to be kept informed of the extent to which we continued to export arms to these countries.ObscenePublicationsBill.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 85thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Prime Minister invited the Cabinet to consider a difficulty which had arisen over Clause 2 (6) of the obscene publications Bill. Under this Clause it would be a defence against a charge of obscenity to prove that publication of the matter inquestion was &quot; justified as being for the public good on the groundthat it was in the interests of science, literature, art or learning, or ofother objects of general concern.&quot; Against the advice of theGovernment, the sponsors of the Bill had carried in Committee an amendment providing that &quot; expert evidence as to the literary, artistic,scientific or other merits of the matter should be admissible in any proceedings under the Bill.&quot; On the advice of the Law Officersa Government amendment had been put down to remove this part ofthe sub-section on the Report Stage, which was to be taken in theHouse of Commons on the following day. The Cabinet were invitedto consider whether it would be expedient, on political grounds, topress this amendment if it became apparent that it was contrary to thewishes of the House.The Attorney-General said that the words which it was proposedto delete were unnecessary since, under the earlier part of thesub-section as now drafted, expert evidence would unquestionably beheld to be relevant. They were also objectionable since they would limit the discretion of the courts to decide what evidence should becalled. The Government had already made a number of substantial concessions on other parts of the Bill and he would prefer that this amendment should be pressed.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that Mr. Roy Jenkins,M.P., the principal sponsor of the Bill, was now willing to agree that,if the Government would concede the retention of these words, hewould no longer press that prosecutions under the Bill should be made subject to the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions and would accept the definition of obscenity in Clause 1 (1) as drafted by the LawOfficers. There was general agreement in the Cabinet that it wouldbe politically inadvisable to press the Governments amendment to clause 2 (6) if the sponsors of the Bill and the interests they represented regarded it as virtually depriving the Bill of value. Butfurther consideration should be given to the possibility of drafting analternative amendment which would meet the sponsors to the extentof making it clear on the face of the Bill that expert evidence would beadmissible.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that everyeffort should be made to devise and agree with the sponsors an amendment on these lines. If this could not be done before the report stage of the Bill in the House of Commons, an undertaking should begiven that further thought would be given to this question before theCommittee Stage in the House of Lords.The Cabinet Invited the Attorney-General, in consultation with the HomeSecretary, to give further consideration to the possibility of drafting a compromise amendment to Clause 2 (6) ofthe Obscene Publications Bill on the lines indicated in their discussion.
Pensions.(previous references:C.C. (59) 18thConclusions,Minute 3 andC.C. (59) 15thConclusions,Minute 1.)higher judiciary.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (59) 68) on the pensions of membersof the higher judiciary.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the pensions of thehigher judiciary had remained substantially unchanged since the earlynineteenth century and, if the Cabinet so desired, he would be readyto agree that they should now be increased by a moderate amount. Inthat event he would also be ready to contemplate some increase in theexisting pensions of members of the higher judiciary who had alreadyretired, on the lines proposed for other members of the public services in the Pensions (Increase) Bill. The amount of such increases would, however, appear disproportionately large in the context of that bill and he would therefore prefer that they should be dealt with inseparate legislation. Special consideration would need to be givenlater to the position of Lord Simonds, who had been Lord Chancellorfrom 1951 to 1954, when he had returned to his work as a Lord ofAppeal.The Lord Chancellor and The Secretary of State for Scotlandsupported these proposals. They hoped that it would be possible to announce the Governments intention to promote legislation to giveeffect to them in the following session of Parliament.Discussion showed that there was general agreement with theseproposals. It was agreed that, in working out the details, confidential discussions could be held with the Lord President of the Court of session. The terms of any announcement would need carefulconsideration. Further thought should be given to the possibility of introducing, simultaneously with a higher rate of pension, some provision for a compulsory retiring age for members of the higher judiciary.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State forScotland, to prepare detailed proposals for legislation toincrease the future pensions of existing members of thehigher judiciary and the present pensions of those who hadalready retired.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to submit, for theapproval of the Prime Minister, a draft of a statementannouncing the Governments intentions in this matter.commercial policy.(previous references:C.C. (59) 7thConclusions,Minute 4 and cc. (58) 70thConclusions,Minute 3.)liberalisation of dollar imports.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (59) 70) proposing a measure of liberalisation of dollar imports.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that the UnitedKingdom Government had undertaken at the Montreal conference to introduce some such measures of liberalisation in the course of 1959if world trade were expanding and we were free from domesticinflation. These conditions had been realised, and it was expected thatwe should now redeem this pledge. He recognised that there wouldbe political difficulties in doing so, because of the impact on publicopinion of recent restrictive measures taken by the United States.The recent actions of the Canadian Government had also beenunhelpful. In general, however, throughout the post-war period theeconomic policy of the United States had worked greatly to our advantage and we should be better able to counter the pressures foran increase in protectionism in the United States if we now introduced
some measure of liberalisation in our dollar trade. This would enable us to continue to urge upon the United States Administration theimportance of expanding and freeing world trade and it would reducethe danger of American action that could be seriously damaging to ourown trade. These considerations were more important in the longterm than the effect which his proposals might have on the balance ofpayments in the short term. The action which he proposed would beof assistance to us in the forthcoming discussions with Commonwealthofficials, in the session of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT) which opened in the following month and in theInternational Monetary Fund. At these meetings it would be notedthat, while some European currencies were no longer weaker than the dollar, we had liberalised trade with Europe to a greater extent (95 percent.) than with the United States (73 per cent.). The cost of ouradditional imports from the United States and Canada would be smallin relation to our total trade and was not likely to exceed  17 millions.If, as envisaged, comparable measures were also taken to liberalisedollar imports into the Colonies, the total effect on our balance ofpayments would probably be little more than  20 millions a year.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet that some such measures of liberalisation of dollar imports should be undertaken before long. Doubts were, however, expressed on the extent to which such action would arrest any tendency towardsprotectionism in the United States, and it was suggested that a furtherpositive attempt should be made to promote American understanding and adoption of economic policies compatible with the leadingposition of the United States in world affairs. It was also suggestedthat there should be further examination of the effect which theproposed measures of liberalisation would have on our balance ofpayments. Moreover, the timing of any such measures should be most carefully considered. To introduce them at an early date might be advantageous in relation to the forthcoming international negotia-tions; on the other hand, there was considerable public criticism ofrecent restrictive United States actions, and the arrangements for theAmerican wool tariff quota which had just been announced would betaken as a further example of action detrimental to British industry.An announcement of our intention to liberalise dollar imports mightexacerbate anti-American feeling in this country, unless it could be accompanied by some tangible evidence that the United States were adopting a more helpful attitude. Despite expressions of goodwillfrom the United States authorities, there could be no certainty that effective practical steps would be taken which would remove the unfavourable impression caused by their recent decisions.The Cabinet then turned to discussion of the effect thatliberalisation of dollar imports would have on the Colonies. It was thought that in general the measures proposed would be acceptable toColonial Governments, though some adjustments might be needed on points of detail, in particular to make satisfactory provision for theWest Indies bearing in mind the importance of their trade in citrusproducts and in rum. Liberalisation should favourably influence theattitude of the United States in GATT, where we would depend on american support for the amendment of certain provisions of theCommon Market treaties that were detrimental to the economic interests of the Colonies.Summing up the discussion, The Prime Minister suggested that further consideration should be given to both the economic and thepolitical factors involved in a decision to liberalise dollar imports. in considering the effect on our balance of payments it would be helpfulfor the Cabinet to have figures showing the extent to which tariff protection was available for the goods in respect of which quotaswould be withdrawn. The political aspects of the problem werecomplex in that, if we did not encourage the United States Administra-tion in their desire to maintain a liberal trade policy, there would be
India.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 16thConclusions,Minute 4.)Indus Waters.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary (C. (59) 72) about the dispute between theGovernments of India and Pakistan over the waters of the Indus.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the International bank for Reconstruction and Development had for some years been trying to effect a settlement of this dispute and now proposed to put a compromise plan before the two Governments on the understandingthat if it were not accepted their good offices would be withdrawn. Theplan was sound in itself and was likely to be accepted by both Indiaand Pakistan. The Bank had invited the United Kingdom, canada and Australia to contribute, towards the cost of the scheme, 25 millions in grants to Pakistan over the next ten to twelve years.Of this sum  15 millions might be regarded as the United kingdom share, although rising costs would almost certainly involve usultimately in a substantially higher commitment. If, however, we failed to support the Bank&apos;s plan, it would probably collapse andthere would then be a serious state of friction between India and pakistan. The Commonwealth Secretary therefore proposed, with theconcurrence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that we should agreeto contribute  15 millions provided that the plan was accepted by india and Pakistan and that Canada and Australia were also willingto make contributions of the order of  6 millions and  4 millionsrespectively.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (59) 72.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,23rd April, 1959.an added danger that their efforts might be frustrated in Congress. Onthe other hand, we should avoid steps which might strengthen anti-American feeling in this country and it would be advantageous fromthat point of view if we could secure that any measures of liberalisationon our part were accompanied by an American gesture that would offer some advantage to British trade interests.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at a subsequent meeting.
