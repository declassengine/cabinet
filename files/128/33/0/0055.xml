Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business.        the House of Commons in the following week, after the conclusionof the Debate on the Address on 3rd November.Procedure. jne Home Secretary said that the Government would be pressed to make more Parliamentary time available for discussion of private members&apos; Motions, and he thought it would be expedient to make some modest concession on this point. The Prime Minister suggestedin this connexion that thought might be given to the possibility thatStanding Committees of the House of Commons might meet in theafternoons on Wednesdays, so as to reduce the burden of morningwork which was making it increasingly difficult for Members to followany other occupation. The Home Secretary said that he was considering various proposals for changes in Parliamentary procedure and he hoped to submit his recommendations on these forconsideration by the Cabinet before Christmas, with a view to tablingResolutions for discussion in the House of Commons in February.Foreign affairs.Germany.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 54thConclusions,Minute 2.)Supply ofArms:central america.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 54thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Cabinet were informed that the French government now seemed to be willing that a meeting of Heads of western governments should be held in Paris about the middle of December,and it was likely that agreement would be reached on this plan. TheFrench were proposing, however, that the Summit meeting should be delayed until April, in the hope that Mr. Khrushchev would have paidhis visit to France before then. It might be possible to exert pressure on them to agree to an earlier date for the Summit meeting.The Foreign Secretary said that, in pursuance of the Cabinet&apos;decision of 20th October he had discussed with the CubanAmbassador the proposal that his Government should exchange anumber of Sea Fury aircraft for Hunter jet aircraft. In the light ofthat discussion, and of the decision of the United States Governmentto supply helicopters and transport aircraft to Cuba, he thought itwould be difficult to withhold sanction for this proposed exchange of aircraft. But, before inviting the Cabinet to take a final decision, he proposed to explain our difficulties to the United States Governmentin terms which would make it plain that we had little option but toauthorise the exchange. In the light of the American reaction tothis explanation, he would bring the matter before the Cabinet again at their next meeting.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.legislative programme:1959-60.(previous references:C.C. (59) 54thConclusions,Minute 5 andC.C. (59) 50thConclusions,Minute 4.)Betting and gaming Bill.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (59) 160) covering a draft of the Betting and GamingBill.The Home Secretary said that the draft Bill followed closely therecommendations of the Royal Commission on Betting, Lotteries and gaming. The first part of the Bill would permit the opening of&quot; betting shops &quot;, which would be operated either by bookmakers or their agents, under licence from the Justices, or by the racecourse betting Control Board, which would be given a statutory monopoly of betting at totalisator odds. The second part of the Bill wouldlegalise gaming, subject to certain conditions designed to prevent its being carried on for commercial profit. The third part would legalisethe carrying on of amusements for prizes at fetes and other non-commercial entertainments and, subject to conditions, atcommercial entertainments.
In discussion the following points were made (a) It would be the function of the local Justices to ensure thatan excessive number of &quot; betting shops &quot; was not established.(b) The Government might be criticised for legalising &quot; bettingshops &quot; and then making the rules for their conduct so strict as to discourage resort to them. The rules proposed in the Bill had,however, been recommended by the Royal Commission.(c) The Bill did not affect the practice of collecting bets at, e.g.,factories and taking them to a bookmaker, provided that the betswere taken to a registered bookmaker or a licensed betting office.There were sound arguments against making this practice illegal or subject to licensing; but the question of controlling it could, ifnecessary, be considered during the passage of the Bill.(d) Under the Bill as it stood, gaming would be permitted inclubs, subject to compliance with the conditions requiring that all theplayers must have an equal chance of winning and that the moneystaked was all paid out as winnings. It would be necessary to allowclubs to make a charge for joining the game but it should be possibleto prevent abuse by inserting in the Bill a limit on the sum whichmight be so charged and, possibly, on the number of guests whom a member might introduce. Nevertheless, a provision which allowedgaming in all types of clubs, even subject to conditions which prevented its being carried on for commercial profit, was likely to attract strong opposition. On the other hand, proposals were beingconsidered for legislation in a later session to amend the licensing law,especially in its application to clubs; these would encounter opposition from the clubs and it would be inexpedient to provoke that oppositionprematurely by including in the present Bill unduly stringentconditions on gaming in clubs or a provision subjecting them toinspection. The aim should therefore be to apply to gaming in clubsconditions as near as possible to those to be applied to gamingelsewhere without making them so strict as to arouse opposition fromthe clubs.(e) The Bill as drafted contained an absolute prohibition ongaming machines. This was likely to be very unpopular and therewas much to be said for omitting it, although it would be necessaryto give further consideration to the effect of the omission on otherparts of the Bill.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theBill could be presented as a measure designed to relieve the policeof the duty of enforcing law which was out of touch withcontemporary public opinion and therefore, in practice,unenforceable. In general, it would be preferable to make the bill as liberal as possible and to insert more restrictive provisions duringits passage through Parliament than to introduce it in a more restrictive form and be forced to make concessions. On this basis,gaming should be allowed in clubs subject to reasonable safeguards against abuse, and the provision prohibiting gaming machines shouldbe reconsidered.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the LordChancellor and the Attorney-General, to give furtherconsideration (i) to the extent to which clubs should be exempted from the conditions applicable to gamingelsewhere; and (ii) to the provision of the Bill regardinggaming machines.(2) Subject to the further consideration referred to inConclusion (1), approved the draft Betting and GamingBill annexed to C. (59) 160 and authorised its introduction in the House of Commons.
Civil Aviation.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 19thConclusions,Minute 3.)European air traffic Control.commercial policy.(previous references:C.C. (59) 52ndConclusions,Minute 2 andC.C. (59) 46thConclusions,Minute 1.)relaxation of import restrictions.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (59) 159) proposing a further relaxation of restrictions on imports.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that in July theCabinet had agreed in principle to a progressive relaxation of theremaining restrictions on imports (with the exception of a number of hard-core items) but had considered that it would be premature tomake a further move in this direction at that time. The economic policy Committee had considered this question again and recommended that a further move should now be made as soon aspossible. Import restrictions could no longer be justified on balanceof payments grounds. Indeed our balance of payments position was sufficiently strong to enable the short-term loan which we had obtainedfrom the Export-Import Bank in 1957 to be repaid well before thedate when it became due. There were growing pressures on the UnitedStates Government to adopt less liberal attitudes on both aid andtrade; and it was clearly in our interests, by removing restrictions onour imports, to encourage them to avoid restrictions which would seriously affect our exports. It was accordingly proposed to remove the restrictions on imports (from any country save those in the Sino-Soviet bloc and Japan) on the goods set out in Annex A to his memorandum, but this included three items at least to which theCabinet would wish to give further consideration. The estimated costof the net additional imports into the United Kingdom if all these restrictions were removed was  53 millions a year, but to this shouldbe added a further  10 millions on account of imports bought by united Kingdom oil companies for use abroad.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Aviation (C. (59) 162) on a proposal by the Common Marketcountries to establish an international authority, &quot; euro control&quot;, tocontrol air traffic movement at heights above 20,000 ft.The Minister of A aviation said that the Common Market countries had made it clear that they would welcome the participation of theUnited Kingdom in the establishment of the proposed authority. Theproposal was sound in itself; and, although important military, legal and financial issues remained to be settled, there would be considerable advantages, both practical and political, in our accepting the invitation. He therefore proposed that our representatives at ameeting of the Six which was to be held on 31st October shouldcontinue to take the line that we were generally interested inco-operating in the project, subject to our reserving our position onthe outstanding issues.Discussion showed that there was general support for thisproposal. It was further agreed that we should express at the outseta positive desire to participate in &quot; euro control &quot;.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposal in C. (59) 162.(2) Invited the Minister of Aviation to bring before them in due course any proposals which might emerge from theseinternational discussions.
Discussion showed that the Cabinet agreed that, in the interestsof our export trade, we should fulfil our obligation to. removerestrictions on imports as far as possible. It was however pointed outthat the balance of payments might well become less favourable overthe next year and an additional import bill of  60 millions or/moremight be a considerable embarrassment. On the other hand, the potential danger to our export earnings might be much greater if we did not. make a substantial move towards removing restrictionson imports as soon as possible.The Cabinet then considered the items included in Annex A ofC. (59) 159, and the following points were raised :  (a) It had been suggested that the inclusion of paper manufacturesmight affect adversely the interests of the forestry industry, especiallyin Scotland. The Cabinet were, however, assured that the industry would be affected mainly by competition from imported pulp, whichwas already free from restriction. The present proposal would not seriously add to its difficulties, and there would be less criticism ifthis step were taken now rather than later.(b) Textiles and clothing were the largest item, and freeingimports of them would be unwelcome to the industries concerned.But our increasingly valuable export trade in these goods to the UnitedStates would suffer unless the restrictions were removed. Britishclothing and textile makers ought to be able to compete successfullywith American products. It was the general view of the Cabinet that,on balance, this item should be included.(c) To free canned pigmeat from restrictions would lead thecanning industry in the United Kingdom to press for the removal of restrictions on imports of pigmeat generally. This would causes considerable difficulties for our pig producers and bacon curers. Itwas agreed that it would be preferable to maintain for the time beingthe restriction on the import of all pigmeat, including canned pigmeat.(d) The removal of restrictions on liquid milk would not inpractice increase imports because the Milk Marketing Board&apos;scontracts prohibited the purchase of milk except from our dairy trade.But to include milk in the list would draw attention to the restrictivenature of these contracts, and it was therefore preferable that this itemshould be omitted.(e) It was likely that, in the light of discussions between theNational Farmers&apos; Union and Dutch interests, flower bulbs could beadded to the list.(/) Other Commonwealth Governments were expecting the earlyremoval of our import restrictions on a wide range of goods. the canadians in particular would be pleased at this step, though theywould probably press for the early establishment of a quota of, say,10,000 tons of Canadian bacon. It was the general view of theCabinet that this would need further careful consideration.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were evidently in agreement that, in view of the strength ofour balance of payments position, we should remove as soon aspossible the import restrictions on the goods set out in Annex A ofC. (59) 159, with the exception of pigmeat and liquid milk, but withthe possible addition of flower bulbs. When other commonwealth governments had been informed of this decision, an announcement should be made in Parliament, if possible before the end of the currentmeeting of the parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.The Cabinet Agreed that import restrictions on the goods included in annex A of C. (59) 159, with the exception of pigmeat andliquid milk, and with the possible addition of flower bulbs,should be removed as soon as possible.
commercial policy.european free trade association.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 45thConclusions,Minute 5.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (59) 163) about the tariff on quick-frozen fish in relation to the negotiations for a European Free trade association (E.F.T.A.).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the norwegian government has asked that frozen fish fillets should be given&quot; industrial free trade &quot; treatment in the E.F.T.A. This would mean that the tariff of 10 per cent, would be removed over ten years. Theeffect of such a concession, without any safeguards, on our fishing industry would be severe, and it was generally agreed&apos; that it couldnot be granted. But if we were to reject the Norwegian requestentirely, the prospects of establishing the E.F.T.A. would be seriouslyjeopardised. This would be a grave set-back to our economic aims inEurope. In these circumstances it seemed desirable that we shouldexplore the possibility of an agreement with the scandinavian countries under which we should remove the tariff on condition thatthese countries agreed voluntarily to limit their exports of quick-frozenfish to us. It would also be helpful if it could be understood that thisagreement would be abrogated if, as a result of the next world conference on the Law of the Sea, the other members of the E.F.T.A.extended their fishing limits. A compromise on these lines had beententatively mentioned, but the Norwegian Government had not so fartaken it up. The present volume of Scandinavian exports of quick-frozen fish to this country was small in relation to our total fishsupplies, but the quick-freezing industry might grow rapidly and theproposed safeguard of a voluntary marketing arrangement would therefore be valuable. The Norwegians were less likely to accept thecondition that the concession would be abrogated if scandinavian countries were in the future to extend their fishing limits.The Minister of Agriculture said that the fishing industry was seriously concerned about the possibility that tariff protection wouldbe removed. An increase in imports of quick-frozen fish mightdamage the development of the new fish-freezing industry in thiscountry and might also affect the price level of fish generally.Nevertheless, in the wider interests of the national economy, he would agree that the conditional concession should be explored. It was mostimportant that we should be able to abrogate the arrangement if the scandinavian countries later extended their fishing limits.The Foreign Secretary said that the negotiations for theE.F.T.A. ought to be concluded as quickly as possible. As time went on, the United States and the European Common Marketcountries would increasingly oppose the project. It was unlikely thatthe Norwegians would accept the arrangement proposed if theyhad to subscribe to an express condition that it would be abrogatedif they later extended their fishing limits; and our purpose should bemet sufficiently if we reserved the right to re-open the arrangement inthat event. On a point of procedure it might be helpful to enlist theassistance of the Swedes in persuading the Norwegians that the offer was a reasonable one.In discussion the Cabinet recognised that the proposed concession, coming as it did after the concession to Denmark on the bacon tariff, would meet with considerable criticism. Its effect wouldbe specially unfortunate in Scotland, since concessions had alreadybeen made in the industrial negotiations in respect of timber products.Nevertheless the economic disadvantages of a concession on quick-frozen fish were far outweighed by the advantages which ourmanufacturing industries would gain from the E.F.T.A.The Cabinet were informed that the South African Governmentwould take the view that the proposed concession damaged their
interests, and would seek a renegotiation of their preference or someother compensation. Several of the other commonwealth governments were increasingly concerned about the effect of theproposed E.F.T.A. on their commerce, and it was important that weshould lose no opportunity for consultation with them on matters which affected their interests.The Prime Minister, summing up, said that it was the general view of the Cabinet that a conditional concession on quick-frozen lishshould be explored, and that a proposal on these lines should be madeinitially to the Swedes. We should not ask the Norwegians to agreethat the arrangement would be abrogated if other countries extendedtheir fishing limits, but we should make it clear that we reserved our right to renegotiate the arrangement in that event. Instructions shouldbe sent to the United Kingdom delegation in Stockholm as soon aspossible.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that a conditional concession on quick-frozen fishshould be offered to the Scandinavian countries.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for instructions to be sent to the United Kingdom delegation in Stockholm on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister.Egypt.Suez canal company.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 52ndConclusions,Minute 1.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (59) 161) on the liability ofshareholders in the Suez Canal Company to pay United Kingdomincome tax on payments received by way of compensation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that, under the law asit stood, these payments had appeared to be liable to UnitedKingdom income tax. At their meeting on 18th September theCabinet had invited him to consider, in consultation with the Attorney-General, whether the present case could be distinguished from thaton which this view of the law was based. He had now to report thathe and the Attorney were satisfied that it could not be so distinguished.Shareholders could therefore be relieved of their liability only by an extra-statutory concession or by legislation. Pie was satisfied that,especially as a proportion of the 400 private British shareholders hadbought their shares after the question of compensation had arisen,neither of these courses could be justified; and he proposed to informthe Chairman of the Stock Exchange, who had made representations to him in favour of relieving the shareholders, that he could notintervene. The reasons for the decision would be made clear to thepublic and to the Governments supporters in Parliament.The Cabinet-Approved the proposal in C. (59) 161.Trinidad. 8.   The Colonial Secretary said that the Governor of Trinidadwould shortly be retiring, and he was proposing to recommend to the queen that he should be succeeded by Mr. Solomon Hochoy, a west indian of Chinese origin who was now serving as Secretary of thelocal Government. This would be the first time that a local officerhad been appointed Governor of a Colony. He was however confident that the appointment would be welcomed throughout the Caribbean.
9. The Prime Minister said that he was proposing to appoint asmall Cabinet Committee, under the Chairmanship of the Chancellorof the Exchequer, to consider questions of policy relating to wages,prices and related matters.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would welcome theappointment of such a Committee.The Cabinet-Took note that the Prime Minister would appoint a CabinetCommittee on wages policy.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,29th October, 1959.Wages Policy.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 50thConclusions,Minute 8.)It might also help to avert a breakdown in the current negotiations onthe future of constitutional development in Trinidad. Therepresentatives of the Island had been urging, in these negotiations,that the Governor of the Colony should in future be appointed on theadvice of West Indian Ministers; and he believed that they mightwithdraw this suggestion on learning that Mr. Hochoy was to be thenext Governor.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement by the colonial secretary.
