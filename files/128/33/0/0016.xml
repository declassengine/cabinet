Egypt.financial agreement.(previous reference:C.C. (59)11Conclusions.Minute 1.)2. The Cabinet discussed the forthcoming debate in the Houseof Commons on the Anglo-Egyptian financial agreement. TheGovernment were liable to be criticised about the inadequacy of the lump sum payment by the Egyptian Government in compensationn for Egyptianised property and damage to sequestrated property, sincethe value of these properties, although not precisely known and certainly less than the claims which had been advanced, was likelyto be significantly greater than the  27-],- millions which the egyptian government had agreed to pay. There might therefore be advantage in indicating, during the debate, that the Government would beprepared to consider, in appropriate cases, some supplementarypayment from the Exchequer. Such a statement should be so worded,however, as to avoid conveying the impression that the Governmentwould be prepared to ensure that all claims, regardless of their amount and nature, v/ould be satisfied in full, since this would reduce the incentive to owners of sequestrated property to dispose of it on thebest possible terms and might also make the Egyptian Governmentless co-operative in returning the assets concerned.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to submit to thePrime Minister a draft statement, on the lines indicated intheir discussion, about the possibility of supplementingfrom the Exchequer the compensation to be paid to individual claimants under the Anglo-Egyptian financial agreement.Federation of rhodesia andNyasalaad.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 14thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Colonial Secretary said that in the light of the increasingParliamentary pressure for an enquiry into the origin of the recent disturbances in Nyasaland, it was for consideration whether theGovernment should now publish the information which theypossessed, indicating that the dissident elements had organised a deliberate campaign of violence against Europeans, Indians andmoderate Africans in the territory. The publication of the evidence which was now available might suffice to silence the criticism that the alleged plot was fictitious and had been invented in order to providethe white community, particularly in Southern Rhodesia, with an excuse to take repressive action against the black peoples. But itmight be necessary to concede, in addition, some form of enquiry into the disturbances. The decision on this point should await thereport of the Minister of State for Colonial Affairs, who was at presentvisiting East Africa and would discuss the situation with the governors of Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia and with the PrimeMinister of the Federation. But, if any enquiry was instituted, itwould be necessary to consider carefully both its composition and its scope.Discussion showed that there was general agreement that itwould be desirable to publish as much information as was consistent with security about the organised rising in Nyasaland, in order to demonstrate that the Governor had been fully justified in declaringa state of emergency. Any subsequent enquiry should be of a semi-judicial character and should be conducted either by a small body of Privy Councillors or by some person of acknowledgedindependence and authority. It should be confined to the originsand circumstances of the disturbances and should not extend to54860-1B 2Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.
questions of the relationship between Southern Rhodesia and nyasaland or the constitutional future of the Federation as a whole.All the evidence indicated that the riots in Nyasaland had not, in fact,been provoked by dissatisfaction with the rate of constitutional progress in the territory or fears for its future status but had derivedfrom the racial emotions which had been stimulated by the recentPan-African congress at Accra. The future of the Federationinvolved many complex problems which might need to form thesubject of a separate and more extensive enquiry, possibly by a RoyalCommission, in preparation for the constitutional discussions whichwere due to be held in 1960.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Colonial Secretary (i) To circulate a draft White Paper on the evidence of an organised threat to the European community andothers in Nyasaland, on the lines agreed in their discussion.(ii) To arrange for the Minister of State for colonial affairs to discuss the situation in Nyasaland withthe Governors of Nyasaland and northern rhodesia and with the Prime Minister of theFederation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in relationto a possible enquiry into the events leading up tothe declaration of a state of emergency.(2) Agreed to resume at a subsequent meeting their considerationof the form and scope of such an enquiry.India. 4.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that, in the lightFinancial of the serious depletion of the Indian Governments reserves of foreignAssistance. exchange, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Developmenthad sponsored in the previous year an arrangement whereby certain countries undertook to co-operate in supporting the Indian economy.We had contributed some  38 millions to this enterprise and had indicated that we would be prepared to consider providing, in concert with other countries, further assistance in the subsequent year,beginning on 1st April, 1959. Discussions on this subject were now about to begin and it would be appropriate that we should honourour commitment by offering to contribute a sum within the range of 15 millions to  25 millions. Having regard, however, to the many other demands on our resources and to the fact that we should alsobe expected to participate in the financing of a loan by theInternational Bank to India in connection with the Indus watersscheme, our contribution should, if possible, be rather less than theupper limit of  25 millions.In discussion there was general agreement that it was to our advantage to afford the Indian Government assistance on as generousa scale as our circumstances permitted.The Cabinet-Agreed that the United Kingdom should contribute a sumwithin the range of  15 millions to  25 millions to theinternational project for the support of the Indian economy which was being sponsored by the International Bank for reconstruction and Development.
Germany.(previous references:C.C. (59) 14thConclusions,Minute 1 andC.C. (58) 87thConclusions,Minute 1.)Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SE &quot;RET*5. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the foreign secretary (C. (59) 46 and 47) on the problems of Germany, Berlin and european security and on the procedure to be adopted in theforthcoming international negotiations on these issues.The Prime Minister said that the Soviet Government had made it clear, in their Note of 1st March, that they would prefer that thesequestions should be discussed at a conference of Heads of governments; but they had indicated that, if the Western powers were not yet ready for such a conference, they would be content thata meeting of Foreign Ministers should be summoned &quot; to. considerthe problems of a peace treaty and the question of West Berlin.&quot;The United States Government had put forward a draft reply whichwas somewhat grudging in tone. It accepted the suggestion of ameeting of Foreign Ministers but, as regards a conference of Headsof Governments, it did not go beyond admitting that progress madeby the Foreign Ministers &quot; could open up prospects &quot; for such aconference. This attitude appeared to take insufficient advantage ofthe opportunity for effective negotiation on German issues which hadbeen disclosed as a result of the recent discussions which he and theForeign Secretary had held with the Soviet leaders in Moscow. Hehad therefore conveyed to the United States Government his own view that, whatever progress might be achieved by a meeting ofForeign Ministers, the final and effective negotiation on the complex of German problems could take place only at a meeting of Heads of governments; and that we should therefore make a definite proposalto the Soviet Government that the meeting of Foreign Ministers on11th May should be followed by a conference of Heads of governments at the end of July or early in August. He had madea similar proposal to the French Government during his recent visit to Paris and he proposed to repeat it to the West German government during his forthcoming visit to Bonn. The French and german governments had both agreed that, if a meeting of Foreign Ministersfailed to reach agreement, the need for a conference of Heads of governments would be increased; and there was reason to hope thatthey would endorse the procedure which we now had in mind. Itmight be more difficult to persuade the United States Governmentof the wisdom of our proposals or to convince them that they did not represent a concession to Soviet intransigence. In that event, it wouldbe desirable that the United States reply to the Soviet Note shouldnot be despatched until he had had an opportunity of personaldiscussion with President Eisenhower. If the United StatesGovernment should decline to defer their reply, we must reserve theright to send a separate reply of our own, which might divergesignificantly from theirs.The Prime Minister said that he had been encouraged to find thatthe French Government recognised that there could be no questionof allowing a third war to develop on the limited issue of the control by the East German Government of access by the Western Powersto the Western sector of Berlin. They would prefer that the problemof Berlin should be dealt with on the basis of the existing rights ofthe Western Governments as occupying Powers an approach whichimplied that the Western position in Berlin would remain substantially unchanged, subject to such administrative adjustments as might benecessary to take account of any peace treaty which the SovietGovernment might conclude with the Government of East Germany.He believed, however, that they might be brought to accept the factthat the Western Powers could not expect indefinitely to base their case for occupation of the Western sectors of Berlin on their rights as the victors in war and that it might be more realistic to negotiate
a new settlement on Berlin whereby the rights of the Western powers would rest on a new settlement guaranteed by the Powers concerned,and possibly by the United Nations. An arrangement of this kind would involve certain risks, since it would imply that the western powers were prepared to abandon their existing rights in relation to berlin. On the other hand, they had themselves concluded with theGovernment of West Germany, under the Bonn Conventions, an understanding which was in effect the equivalent of a peace treaty;and they were not, therefore, on strong ground in resisting the claim of the Soviet leaders that the Soviet Government were entitled toreach a similar understanding with the Government of East Germanyand to require us to accept some consequential modification of theadministrative arrangements relating to Berlin. A new agreementregulating the status of Berlin might therefore prove to be the mostrealistic course. It would imply that all the Powers concerned wereprepared to make a fresh start in relation to their rights in the city;and it would be correspondingly more difficult for the Soviet Union,having signed and guaranteed a treaty to this effect, to infringe its provisions without risk of a general war.For these reasons our immediate objective should be to negotiate a settlement on Berlin, based on some modification of the Soviet&quot; free city &quot; proposal and designed to assure the continued freedomof West Berlin. It might be necessary to describe such a settlement as interim in the sense that it would need to be adjusted in the eventof the ultimate reunification of Germany. But it would be implicit in a settlement of this kind that the West admitted the division ofGermany as a fact which was likely to endure for a long period ahead.It was probably to our own advantage that Germany should remaindivided; and the French Government were equally convinced of thefolly of precipitating a general war for the sake of a reunification ofGerman territory. On the other hand, public opinion in west germany was sensitive on this issue; and it would be important soto frame an interim settlement that it did not appear to imply that all hope of eventual reunification must be abandoned. For this purposevarious possible forms and methods of federal relationship betweenWest and East Germany might be considered, provided that theattributes of full sovereignty were withheld from any all-German body in the creation of which free elections had not played a part. other possibilities of enlarging relations and dealings between the two territories might also be explored.In discussion there was general support for the policy which thePrime Minister had outlined. The Soviet Government had shown themselves more ready to modify their attitude to the german problem than public opinion yet realised; and we should now seek to extract the maximum of advantage from the fact that they had abandoned their earlier insistence on a settlement by a definite date and were prepared to negotiate a new arrangement over a reasonable period of time. In the light of their less uncompromising attitude,it would now be wise to seek to settle the problem of Berlin as rapidly as possible. The various stages of negotiation should not be undulyprotracted, particularly if the final settlement could be reached only at a meeting of Heads of Governments; and our initial proposals should represent a realistic approach to the problem rather thanmerely the first stage in a process of extended bargaining. It wouldbe unwise to seek to negotiate the settlement through the agency ofthe United Nations Organisation, where we could not rely onobtaining adequate support for our own proposals. But, once thesettlement had been agreed, there would be advantage in associatingthe Organisation with it and arranging for the United Nations to actas guarantors of the city of Berlin.
Public opinion in this country was not fully alive to the dangers of the present situation; and it would be necessary to consider howit might best be prepared for the new approach to the problem whichthe Government now contemplated. It might also be desirable totake certain discreet steps, within the limits of existing financial provision, to ensure that preparations for civil defence, particularlyevacuation and communications, were more actively put in hand.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposals in C. (59) 46 and 47.(2) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with theMinisters concerned, to review the existing arrangementsfor civil defence.Cabinet Office, S.11th March,W.1,1959.
