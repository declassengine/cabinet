Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.EuropeanEconomicCommunity.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (59) 106) proposing that formal diplomatic relations should be established between the United Kingdom and the european economic Community (E.E.C.).The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that, in view of theeconomic impact on this country of the trade and economic policies ofthe E.E.C., some formal relations between the United Kingdom andthe Community were inevitable. In the present state of thenegotiations for a European Trade Association this was a suitable time to establish those formal relations. The delegations of the othercountries in the Stockholm group had supported this course and, withthe exception of Denmark which already had formal relations with theCommunity, were recommending their Governments to follow it. an informal approach had been made to the Community and, if theirresponse was satisfactory, he recommended that diplomatic relations should be formally established. In that event legislation would berequired in due course to provide for appropriate privileges and immunities for the E.E.C. representatives in London.Germany. *1.  The Cabinet were informed of the consultations which were^Foreign being held with the United States Administration on the line to beMinisters&apos; taken by the Western Powers when the Foreign Ministers resumedMeeting. on 13th July their negotiations on the problem of Berlin.  They had(Previous before them copies of telegrams which had passed between LondonReference: and Washington (Foreign Office telegrams to Washington Nos. 2807,C.C. (59) 37th 2808, 2811 and 2881, and Washington telegrams Nos. 1465, 1474Conclusions. and 1485).The Prime Minister said that, in pursuance of the Cabinet^discussion on 23rd June, he and the Foreign Secretary had sought toset before the United States Administration the advantages of seekingan interim settlement of the Berlin question by which the existing position would be maintained for a further period. If the foreign ministers could provide the framework for such a settlement, theycould reserve for decision at a meeting of Heads of Governments such questions as the duration of the moratorium, the level of Westerntroops to be retained in Berlin and the form of the proposedconsultations between representatives of East and West Germany. TheUnited States Government had promised to send us their considered views on these proposals later in the week. But their initial reactionhad not been unfavourable. They evidently recognised that the tactical position of the Western Powers in respect of Berlin was weak,and they seemed to be prepared to consider the possibility of seekingan interim settlement on the basis of a moratorium. On the otherhand, public opinion in the United States would not welcome anyapparent concessions over Berlin and it would on that account bemore difficult for them to follow a realistic policy.The Foreign Secretary said that in France and Germany alsothere were circles in which a realistic approach to this problem would,if it were advocated by the United Kingdom Government, berepresented as a policy of appeasement; and it was thereforepreferable that any compromise proposals should be put forward bythe United States Government.The Cabinet Took note of these statements by the Prime Minister and theForeign Secretary.
The Cabinet-Approved the proposal to establish formal diplomatic relations with the European Economic Community. rCivii 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeDefence Secretary (C. (59) 107) on evacuation policy.Evacuation m,    tt        r,                             . ,    ,         ,      ,.Policy. The Home Secretary said that Members of Parliament were showing a moderate amount of interest in the Governmentsevacuation plans, and it might be difficult for him to avoid making apublic statement on any alteration of the existing plans, the scheme&apos;for the evacuation of 12 million people in the priority classes from thelarger centres of population, which had been put to the localauthorities in 1956, was no longer practicable. The reception areas inthe eastern half of England could no longer be used because of the airfields and missile sites which would be primary targets of attack.There were, however, difficulties in planning for a more limitedscheme of evacuation. There would undoubtedly be complaint fromareas which had been heavily attacked in the last war but would notbe included in a new scheme. Moreover, if missile sites were established in the west of the country, any scheme based on reception areas there would have to be abandoned in a few years&apos; time. On theother hand, a planned evacuation scheme might well save many livesin an emergency. Moreover, an admission that the Government wereabandoning planned evacuation would call into question the value ofall civil defence arrangements, would undermine the credibility of the deterrent, and would weaken our position in the North atlantic treaty Organisation. On balance, the best course might be to ask thelocal authority associations to discuss a modified scheme for theevacuation of about 6\ million people in the priority classes from certain large centres of population to reception areas mainly in the westcountry. These discussions would not take place until the autumn,and details of the modified plan would not be disclosed before then.But he would be glad to have authority to make a general statement in Parliament, on the lines of the draft in Annex B to C. (59) 107, if that became necessary. He also suggested that an interim evacuationplan might be prepared, in secret and without consultation with thelocal authority associations, for use if an emergency arose before the modified plan had been worked out in detail.In discussion it was argued that the modified scheme for theevacuation of about 6\ million people would not in the event be anymore practicable than the existing scheme. It was doubtful,whethera Government would be able to start such an evacuation scheme intime for it to be effective; and, if it were started, it was likelyto encourage a general unorganised evacuation of the cities. TheGovernments objective should rather be to educate people to understand that their best course in an emergency would be to seek the best protection they could get in the place where they lived. This,however, would take time, and meanwhile it might be desirable, evenif only to maintain public morale, to prepare a modified scheme of evacuation. But the preparation of a modified plan ought to take intoaccount the realities of the situation that as many people as possiblewould try to leave the large centres of population, with inevitablechaos to the transport system.The Prime Minister said that the Government should try to avoidmaking any statement on evacuation policy in the near future. If astatement had to be made it should be in very general terms, and^should say only that the Government proposed to review the question Uin consultation with the local authority associations later in the year.It might well be that the Governments long-term aim should be to try-to bring the public to realise that the best course in an emergency was for as many people as possible to stay in the area where they lived.But it would be premature to begin this process at the present time.The Cabinet would need to consider again in due course how
Industrial 5.   The Minister of Labour informed the Cabinet that one of the disputes. leaders of the trade unions concerned in the printing dispute had nowPrinting. threatened to withdraw labour employed by the Stationery Office.(Previous        There was no issue in dispute with the Stationery Office, and this reference:      threat was probably an attempt to force the Government to interveneC.C. (59) 37th in the main dispute in the industry. If, however, the Stationery OfficeConclusions,    now sought to transfer to their own printing establishments workMinute 5.)      normally carried out by contractors or made temporary arrangementsfor using duplicating in place of printing, there might be hostilereactions from the unions.  While the withdrawal of printing andwarehouse labour from the Stationery Office would not immediatelythreaten the essential machinery of government, it could lead toa difficult position within a relatively short time.Meanwhile the effect of the main dispute on the production of printing ink was becoming rapidly more serious and might prevent the printing of the national newspapers before the end of the week. TheMinister had therefore sent an informal invitation to the unions andthe employers concerned with this part of the dispute to meet his chief industrial Commissioner, with a view to negotiating a continuance of work until the main dispute had been settled. Theemployers had accepted his invitation but the unions had declined it.It would be inexpedient for him to meet the employers alone. He had,however, renewed his invitation on a more formal basis; and, if theunions maintained their refusal, he proposed to safeguard theGovernments position by a public statement of the facts.The Home Secretary said that the Ministerial Committee on emergencies were keeping the situation under review. In view ofcertain recent incidents it might be desirable at some stage to make astatement on the law relating to peaceful picketing and the duty of thepolice to enforce it, but the Committee did not consider that the timefor this had yet come.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of these statements by the HomeSecretary and the Minister of Labour.(2) Invited the Home Secretary and the Minister of Labour tokeep them informed of developments in the dispute in the printing industry.Education.^Teachers&apos;Salaries.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 36thConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Education (C. (59) 104) on teachers&apos; salaries.The Minister of Education suggested that the provisional agreement of the Burnham Committee that the proposed new basicsa^ry scale of  520- 1,000 should operate for not less than 2\ yearsf&quot;-om October 1959, went a considerable way to meet the objection that a minimum above  510 would have an inflationary effect andconstituted a new factor in the situation which would justify thethe existing evacuation scheme could best be modified, having regard0 to what was likely to happen in reality in an emergency.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that a statement on evacuation policy should be avoided lor as long as possible.(2) Took note that, if a statement had to be made, the HomeSecretary would submit for the Prime Ministers approvala revised version of the draft annexed to C (59) 107.(3) Agreed to resume their consideration of evacuation policy ona later occasion.
Government in reversing their earlier decision not to approve a scalewith a minimum above that figure. The Local Authorities panel of the Committee had, since the war, shown a reasonable willingness to resist demands for pay increases during the currency of earlierOsettlements intended to last for three years. In the circumstances theMinister proposed that, when the Burnham Committee submittedtheir formal recommendation to him, he should notify his approval inthe terms of the draft letter annexed to his memorandum, layingespecial emphasis on the period for which it was to operate.In discussion it was pointed out that the 2-J-year period of theproposed settlement was in fact less than the period normallyadopted for Burnham awards and therefore did little to mitigate the inflationary character of the proposal. Nevertheless, while thereversal of the Governments earlier decision might be considered a sign of weakness, the objection to a prolonged controversy with the teaching profession and their employers was such that it would be preferable to regard the period of operation which had been proposed spontaneously by the Committee themselves and not, as onthe previous occasion, adopted by the Minister as the basis on whichhe would approve the award as a new factor justifying theGovernment in withdrawing their objection to a minimum of  520. on balance, therefore, it was agreed that a basic scale of  520-  1,000should be approved if it was formally recommended by theCommittee. While the precise terms of the letter of approval shouldnot be settled until the recommendation was received, the minister might note that the Committee had met his concern that their proposals should not be inflationary in their effect by recommending that the new scale should remain in force for at least 1\ years from october 1959 and say that on that basis he would not press hisobjection to the proposed minimum.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that a new basic salary scale for teachers of 520-  1,000, to remain in force for not less than 2\ years from October 1959, should be approved if it were formallyrecommended by the Burnham Committee.(2) Invited the Minister of Education, in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, to give furtherconsideration to the terms in which his approval should begiven.Commercial 7.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet that policy. the Economic Policy Committee had approved a proposal to increase(Previous the quota for Polish butter by 5,000 tons and that for Hungarian and reference: Bulgarian butter by 1,000 tons. Even with these increases butterC.C. (59) 30th supplies this year were likely to be about 20,000 tons lower than lastConclusions, year, but these increases would help to moderate the rise in butterMinute 6.) prices. Since this was a once-for-all measure and without prejudiceButter. to the level of the normal quotas from these countries, and sinceadditional supplies of Danish butter were not available, thenegotiations for a European Trade Association would not be affected.Nor would there be any ground for complaint from New Zealand,since her butter exports were commanding a higher price than at anytime since September 1956. There might, however, be objections from canada, and it might be necessary to consider in due course some relaxation of the restrictions on the import of Canadian butter.The Cabinet  0Approved the proposal to increase the quotas for the import of butter from Poland, Hungary and Bulgaria.el:tct
