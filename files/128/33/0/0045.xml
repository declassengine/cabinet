G. F. Podola. 2. The Cabinet were informed that further Questions were tobe asked in Parliament about the circumstances in which GuenterFritz Podola had been arrested in connexion with the murder of adetective-sergeant in the Metropolitan Police. It was suspected incertain quarters that unnecessary force might have been used ineffecting his arrest or that he might have been roughly handled while in Police custody. Podola had now, however, been charged withmurder; and the Director of Public Prosecutions wished to put thecircumstances of the arrest in evidence to the court of first instance.It was therefore desirable that Ministers should say as little as possiblein Parliament about the facts before the criminal proceedings hadbeen opened.0National Health 3. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the memorandumService. Dy ^g Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of HealthOpticians&apos; Fees (C. (59) 126) on the fees to be paid to opticians for dispensing National(Previous        Health Service lenses in private frames (hybrid dispensing).Reference: ,c.c. (59) 44th The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that two of the elements in conclusions, the package agreement reached with the opticians had been to theinute &apos; opticians&apos; advantage in conceding a greater increase in sight-testingfees than could strictly be justified on the facts as ascertained and in maintaining the dispensing fees when a reduction would have been justified on the facts. Failure to insist on the third element areduction in the hybrid dispensing fees could not be defended,especially when it was recognised that only one-fifth of the aggregatereduction, estimated at  250,000 a year, would fall on the dispensingopticians.In discussion there was general agreement that there was a stronglogical and economic case for insisting on a reduction in the hybriddispensing fee. Failure to do so would, moreover, materially weakensuch control as the Government were able to exercise over negotiations on remuneration in the public services. On the other hand, while theagreement could strictly be regarded as a package deal, what theopticians had accepted was, not that a reduction in the hybriddispensing fee was justifiable in principle, but only that theGovernment reserved the right, in default of agreement, to imposeit administratively. They had no strong union organisation andno right of recourse to arbitration, and insistence on the letter ofthe agreement would certainly provoke a campaign of criticism.In these circumstances it was suggested that it might be preferable to defer the operation of the reduction until 1st January, 1960, andto communicate no decision to the opticians in the meantime. Fromthe point of view of the Exchequer this compromise would be acceptable, although the passage of time would make it difficult torepresent the reduction as a part Of the package agreement.Discussion showed that this course was preferred by the Cabinet toany of the alternatives open to them.Parliament. 1.  The Cabinet again discussed the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.It was now proposed that Parliament should re-assemble afterthe summer recess, and be prorogued, on 22nd October; and thatthe new session should be opened on 27th October.
4SECIRETThe Cabinet -(1) Agreed in principle that a 20 per cent, reduction in the hybrid r\dispensing fee should be introduced with effect from w1st January, 1960.(2) Invited the Minister of Health and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland to refrain for the time being fromannouncing this decision or communicating it to theopticians.Employment. 4.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theDistribution     President of the Board of Trade (C. (59) 129) covering a report by of Industry.     officials on distribution of industry policy.Reference: The President of the Board of Trade said that the types ofC.C. (59) 37th unemployment which seemed likely to occur over the next few yearsConclusions, were those arising from the remoteness of certain small areas, orMinute 7.) $is decline of a major industry through technical changes, or theeffect of a European free trade area on the pattern of industrial production. This called for a more flexible policy for the distributionof industry. The Ministers concerned had held a preliminary examination of certain proposals put forward by officials. He nowsought approval for the heads of legislation designed to rationaliseand improve the existing provisions for assisting industry. In placeof the concept of development areas he recommended that powers should be available for use in selected areas throughout Great Britainwhere there was a high rate of unemployment or a clear andimminent threat of it. The existing power to build factories forrenting on favourable terms should be retained, and there shouldalso be power to make capital grants to firms building or extendingtheir factories of an amount equivalent to the capitalisation of the rent subsidy on Board of Trade factories in the same locality. Firmssetting up new enterprises in the selected areas might also be eligiblefor capital grants in respect of plant and machinery. In addition toa number of less important forms of assistance, he proposed that theexisting power to restrict industrial building by means of industrialdevelopment certificates should be retained and incorporated in anamended form in the new legislation.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The selection of areas in which assistance to industry couldbe given under the proposed new policy should be left entirely tothe administrative discretion of Ministers.(b) It was suggested that it would be helpful to Scotland and to wales, if there could be two categories of inducements. On the otherhand, it would be invidious to have to discriminate between areasrequiring less or more assistance. There would inevitably be pressure for every area to be promoted to the higher category. It was thegeneral view of the Cabinet that there should be a single list.(c) The proposed power to make capital grants to firms buildingnew factories would be valuable in inducing large concerns to go to areas with high unemployment. The Chancellor of the exchequer said that he would need to give further consideration to the scale ofsuch capital grants: the present proposals seemed unnecessarily g,generous. It was also suggested that it might be better to specify a Umaximum percentage, rather than rely on a formula related to thesubsidy element in the present method of fixing rents for government factories. If a maximum percentage were specified in the legislation,it would still be open to the Government to indicate that they proposedto be guided by that formula in their administration of the policy.
5. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the negotiations at Stockholm for a European Trade Association had been broughtto a reasonably successful conclusion. It had been agreed that, apartfrom the inclusion of canned and processed fish in the arrangementsfor industrial products, the problem of fish would have to be left for further consideration by the Governments concerned, but that.c. (59) 40th this need not hold up the Convention for an industrial freeConclusions.) trade area. It had been decided that the Government of Finlandshould be kept in touch with the development of the Association, sothat they could consider in due course an appropriate form of association with the project. In the course of the negotiations, hehad outlined the advantages of an economic advisory body to broadenthe basis of consultation and to give industrial and labour interestsa sense of participation in the project. The other delegations had undertaken to consider this suggestion. He proposed that statements on the outcome of the negotiations should be made in both houses of Parliament that afternoon.The Cabinet (1) Took note of this statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.commercial policy.EuropeanTradeAssociation.(previous reference:(d) Although the suggested capital grant in respect of plant and machinery would be particularly valuable as an incentive in Scotland,it would entail discrimination between firms within the same industry.It might be preferable to reserve this as a means of affordingassistance to all firms in a particular industry without regard to theirlocation. If the proposal for grants in respect of plant and machinerywere not pursued, it would be possible to contemplate a more generousmeasure of assistance for building.(e) The new legislation should remain in operation for a limited period of seven years. It was desirable that Parliament should review the efficacy of the new system after a period.(/) The system of industrial development certificates shouldcontinue to be applied fairly stringently, as at present. The new legislation should not include any obligation to give reasons for refusing a certificate, nor should there be a right of appeal.(g) The proposed measures would probably have the effect of reducing the value of the incentives at present available to encourageindustry to go to Northern Ireland, and it was likely that theGovernment of Northern Ireland would press for increased assistance.(h) The Secretary of State for Scotland said that, in view ofthe physical difficulties, particularly as regards transport costs, inthe way of attracting industry to Scotland, further thought wouldhave to be given to the possibility of finding other means of dealingwith the problem of persistent high unemployment in many parts ofScotland.The Cabinet Authorised the President of the Board of Trade to arrangefor legislation to be prepared in accordance with theproposals set out in paragraph 17 of C. (59) 129, subject tothe points noted in paragraphs (a) to (/) above.
liberalisation of dollar imports.(previous reference :C.C. (59) 31stConclusions,Minute 5.)The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C. (59) 128) on the liberalisation of dollar imports and our obligations under the International Monetary Fund.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in view of the satisfactory condition of the balance of payments, we had no validreason for avoiding our international obligation to dismantle import restrictions as rapidly as possible. Since sterling was now convertibleon current account, discriminatory restrictions against imports from dollar countries were no longer justified. Unless we soon tookfurther steps to reduce these restrictions, the United StatesGovernment might be less able to resist domestic pressure to reduce their outflow of dollars. This could be much more damaging to usthan a further stage in the liberalisation of our imports. He wouldlike to be able to announce the removal of certain import restrictions in the next few weeks, but in any event it was most important thatthis should be done before the meeting of the International monetary fund in September. At that meeting proposals would be made for moving from the post-war transitional provisions of the Fund to thepermanent provisions (Article VIII). This would provide strongerinternational commitments which would help us to protect our exports from restrictions applied by other countries. We should be prepared at the September meeting to co-operate in authorising a concertedmove to the permanent provisions during the first half of 1960.It would be possible to select non-controversial items for earlyliberalisation amounting to about  20 millions per annum. Thiswould leave about  60 millions of annual imports still subject to import restrictions, which we would have to dismantle gradually,in addition to certain hardcore items which we could hope to continueto protect even under the permanent provisions.The Prime Minister said that all reasonable steps should betaken to avoid the growth of restrictionist pressures in the UnitedStates. But Ministers should examine in detail what defensive measures would be available if the permanent provisions of theInternational Monetary Fund became effective. Careful thought should also be given to the timing of the next stage in the liberalisation of dollar imports. We had constantly to keep in mind the extremelyvolatile nature of our external financial position.The Cabinet (2) Agreed to resume discussion of this question at their next meeting.ChannelTunnel.(previous reference :C.C. (57) 57thConclusions,Minute 8.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Transport (C. (59) 123) on the Channel Tunnel project. Thisshowed that the project seemed feasible from the geophysical and engineering points of view and had a reasonable prospect of payingits way. The Government might therefore be expected before theend of the year to indicate their attitude towards it. It raised anumber of problems economic, political, defence, financial andadministrative and the Minister proposed that officials of theDepartments concerned should study these questions in order thatthe Cabinet might be in a position to reach a decision in the autumn.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (59) 123.
