Germany. 2.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the(Previous       Foreign Secretary (C. (59) 81) on the proposal that the Brussels TreatyReferences:     should be so amended as to enable Germany to undertake the jointC.C. (59) 28th   production of anti-aircraft missiles.Conclusions,Minute 2 and The Foreign Secretary said that at the meeting of the Council ofC.C. (59) 26th   the Western European Union on 29th April the French had favouredConclusions,    an amendment which would do no more than modify the dimensionsMinute 1.)      Up to which the Treaty already allowed Germany to manufactureGuided Missiles, anti-aircraft missiles so as to enable them to take a share in the joint production of the HAWK missile.  He was disposed to favour thiscourse,  especially  if  the  permitted  dimensions  were  enlargedsufficiently to enable Germany to co-operate in the joint productionof the British missile SUPER BLOODHOUND. Such an amendmentcould be justified to public opinion on the basis that these were strictlydefensive weapons, and that it was to the advantage of the north atlantic Alliance as a whole that this use should be made ofGermany&apos;s industrial capacity.In discussion there was general support for the views expressedby the Foreign Secretary.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in paragraph 11 of C. (59) 81.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theHome Secretary (C. (59) 80) reporting the conclusions of a ministerial committee which had been appointed to consider whether any improvement could be made in the rates of retirement pensions or national assistance.The Home Secretary said that the Committee had considered thepossibility of a further increase in the basic rate of retirement pension,but had come to the conclusion that there was at the present time noacceptable method of meeting the cost. Any such increase wouldhave to be extended to other National Insurance benefits and to warpensions and the total cost, on the basis of an increase of 10s. Od.would amount to not less than  210 millions in the first full year andwould rise in every year thereafter. This cost could not be met whollyfrom the Exchequer and, if it were shared between the Exchequerand the contributors, it would involve an increase of Is. 9d. a week in the contribution of both employers and employees.On the other hand, there was a sound case for increasing boththe current scale rates of national assistance and the limits belowwhich various types of income were disregarded for the purpose ofassessing the applicants need. The real value of the scale rates had remained almost unchanged since 1948 and that of the disregards hadbeen substantially diminished. An increase of 5s. Od. for a single person and 9s. Od. for a married couple would provide help for thosewho needed it most. This, together with increases in the&quot; disregards,&quot; could be presented as a measure of social reform toimprove the standard of living of the poorest section of thecommunity.SECRET55170-5 b 2Old AgePensionsand national assistance.Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.It was agreed that special efforts should be made to complete the preparation of the Cotton Industry Bill with a view to its being published, together with the White Paper, before Parliament rose forthe Whitsun recess.
The Minister of Pensions said that, in his view, this plan toimprove national assistance was the least disadvantageous of the alternatives open to the Government. It was, however, important that the plan should be adopted as a whole, since the national assistance Board, without whose recommendation the scale ratescould not be increased, held strongly that any such increase shouldbe accompanied by an improvement in the disregards. In addition,some changes in terminology and administrative procedures mightbe introduced, with a view to alleviating the stigma which was thought to attach to national assistance.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was seriouslyconcerned about the cost of this plan. The first forecasts ofGovernment expenditure in 1960-61 showed an unprecedentedincrease, and it seemed likely that the Government would be facedwith a difficult task, later in the year, in reducing the Estimates tomanageable proportions. He was therefore reluctant to agree thatas much as  32 millions should be added now by a new decision ofpolicy.In discussion there was general agreement that no further increase could now be made in the basic rate of retirement pension.The plan for improving national assistance might bring theGovernment little political credit. There was, however, some publicuneasiness about the position of the poorest of the retirement pensioners, who would receive no benefit from the recent incometax concessions or from the forthcoming Pensions (Increase) Bill.The proposals now before the Cabinet would be regarded as goingsome way to meet this. Moreover, so far as concerned the effect onthe Exchequer, it was probable that the National Assistance board would in any event recommend some improvements before the endof the year.If the plan was to be made politically attractive, some changesin terminology and in payment arrangements should be further considered. It was, however, important that such changes shouldnot accentuate the alleged stigma on recipients of national assistancewho were not pensioners.In further discussion attention was drawn to the difficulty of finding time in the present session for the legislation which theseproposals would involve. It was suggested that the increase in thescale rates might be effected at once by regulations and that theGovernment might announce their intention of introducing legislation to improve the disregards in the next session. Alternatively, it mightbe possible to pass in the current session a simple Billempowering the Minister of Pensions to determine the future levels of all disregards by statutory instrument subject to negative resolution.This would not only save Parliamentary time: it would also reducethe danger of pressure to increase the disregards beyond the level which the Government thought right.Summing up the discussion, The Prime Minister said that thegeneral feeling of the Cabinet was evidently in favour of the full plan to improve national assistance proposed in C. (59) 80. Furtherconsideration should be given to the best method of giving effect tothe plan in particular, to the form and timing of the legislation and statutory instruments which would be required. The possibility of changes in terminology and administrative procedures relating to national assistance should also be further examined.The Cabinet (i) Decided not to proceed with the proposal for an increasein the basic rate of retirement pension.(2) Agreed to accept proposals by the National Assistance board for increasing the scale rates of national assistance andadjusting the disregards on the lines indicated in C. (59) 80.
government expenditure.TreasuryControl.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 18thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (59) 77) outlining the form and scopeof the enquiry which he proposed to institute into the principles and practice governing the control of public expenditure.Discussion showed that some Ministers were doubtful whetherit was necessary to initiate such an enquiry, which would occupy aconsiderable time, in the concluding stages of the present Parliament.As against this, it was argued that a reply to the report of the SelectCommittee on Estimates was overdue, and that a reply which didnot envisage any further enquiry into this subject was unlikely to be acceptable to Government supporters in the House of Commons.Moreover, among other sections of informed opinion, there was somefeeling that the existing practices and procedures for controllingpublic expenditure ought to be brought under review.The Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to submit, for theapproval of the Prime Minister, detailed proposals on thegeneral lines suggested in C. (59) 77 for an enquiry into theprinciples and practice governing the control of government expenditure.Transport. 5.  The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of rural Bus Transport (C. (59) 84) proposing the appointment of a Committee to services.        consider the future of rural bus services.In discussion it was recognised that there was growing pressure for Government action designed to arrest the decline of public transport in rural areas. The Budget concession on excise duty forbuses did not discriminate in favour of services in rural areas; and difficulties in the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill would be eased by an early announcement that1 a Committee was to beappointed to consider other methods of dealing with this problem.On the other hand, there was a real risk that a Committee might makeembarrassing recommendations involving direct Government support for rural bus services; and this point should be borne in mind in determining the composition of any Committee.The Cabinet were also informed that, although this problem was specially acute in certain parts of Scotland, there were no circumstances which warranted the appointment of a separateCommittee for Scotland.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that a Committee should be appointed to consider thefuture of rural bus services throughout Great Britain, andthat an early announcement should be made of thethe Governments intention to appoint such a Committee.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland to settle the composition and terms ofreference of this Committee in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer.(3) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the ministerial committee on Pensions to consider further the form ofthe legislation and regulations required to give effect tosuch proposals.(4) Invited the Minister of Pensions to consider what changescould be made in terminology and administrativeprocedures with a view to alleviating the stigma thought to attach to national assistance.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, with the failurePolicy. of the negotiations for a Free Trade Area there was a serious danger(Previous that, unless the other European countries could work out some.-.References: common commercial policy, each would eventually be constrainedUC.C.

There was therefore advantageMinute 1) &apos; to us in co-operating in the Swedish initiative for a European Trade&apos;     , Association (E.T.A.).European Trade . . ... ,     ,   . ,     ,Association. The   Ministers   directly   concerned    had   examined   therecommendations of officials on the Swedish proposals and certain concessions which we might have to make on agriculture and fishin this connection. They had reached the conclusion that the proposedE.T.A. was not only a means of preventing other European countries from acceding to the Common Market; it was also the best meansof eventually achieving an all-European Free Trade Area. In anycase, the project offered considerable advantages for United kingdom industry as a whole. It was therefore recommended that if theSwedish Government, after sounding the other countries concerned,proposed the establishment of a working party of officials to pursue this project, we should agree to participate in it. We should not be committed to a final decision in principle until a Ministerial meeting was held in, say, June. But it was likely that we should eventuallyhave to make certain concessions on agriculture and fish. The mostimportant concession would be to remove the tariff on bacon, in theinterests of securing Danish participation.It would be important that the limited effects of these concessionsshould be clearly explained to the industries affected. They must also be brought to understand that the project was in the best interestsof our economy as a whole. The project would also have some smalldisadvantages for Canada, as regards certain industrial products, andfor New Zealand, as regards blue cheese, and it would also benecessary to meet the apprehensions of these and other commonwealth countries by full consultation and explanation. Ageneral indication of our attitude to the Swedish proposals hadalready been given to the Commonwealth officials now meeting inLondon.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) While it should be possible to justify the project to commonwealth countries and to secure their acquiescence in the concessions which we might have to make, it would also be necessaryto show that the ETA. was a preferable alternative to some closer association between the Commonwealth and Europe. There was considerable public interest in the possibility of such an association,and it would have to be explained that it would, in practice, be difficultto reconcile the commercial interests of the Commonwealth with thoseof Western Europe.(b) The immediate Swedish proposals were limited to a free trade area for industrial goods, and the inclusion of Denmark in theE.T.A. was not therefore essential. But, in view of the tradition ofScandinavian unity, it was doubtful whether Sweden and Norwaywould be prepared to join in the ETA. if we were not prepared to. make such concessions on agriculture as proved necessary for thepurpose of gaining Denmark&apos;s adhesion. We must therefore decide what concessions on agriculture we would be prepared in due course to consider. If it were necessary to offer these concessions, and ifSweden and Norway thought them reasonable, there was a good chance that they would join the ETA. even if Denmark rejected the (jconcessions as insufficient and refused to join.(c) It would be easier to justify a concession on bacon if thistook the form of a duty-free quota instead of the removal of thetariff. But a duty-free quota would not meet the requirements of theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, unless we gave a
The Cabinet-Agreed that the Swedish proposals for a European trade association should be pursued on the lines indicated by thePrime Minister.Education.  .       7.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda on teachers&apos;(Previous     salaries by the Minister of Education (C. (59) 82) and the ChancellorReferences:   of the Exchequer (C.

Recommendations by theConclusions,  Burnham Committee required his approval, and he had informed the minute 2.)     local authority representatives that he would not be able to approveTeachers&apos;      the increase of  15 millions involved if an offer of a minimum of salaries.       520 and a maximum of  1,000 (offer &quot; C &quot; of the Annex to C. (59) 82)were made at the Committee&apos;s meeting at the end of April.  At that meeting a smaller offer (&quot; A&quot;) with a minimum of  500 and amaximum of  975 had been put forward and rejected by the teachers.The local authority representatives now considered that, while theycould put forward at the Committee&apos;s next meeting on 13th May a compromise offer &quot; B,&quot; it might eventually be necessary for them tomake offer &quot; C &quot; in order to reach a settlement.  They would need to know his views before the next meeting of the Committee. He feltthat there was much to commend offer &quot; C.&quot; It involved increases indifferential payments that were fully justified, and there was a strong case for the proposed maximum of  1,000 per annum. The proposedcorresponding concession to other countries, including members ofthe Common Market, which we would not wish to do. Removalof the tariff would not seriously affect our pig producers, since their real protection was the price support system. Although removal ofthe tariff would lead to a reduction in bacon prices, it was not thoughtthat there would be a significant increase in Danish imports at theexpense of home production. Moreover there was a further safeguardfor our producers in the possibility of a reduction in the quota forPolish bacon. The main effect of the removal of the tariff on baconwould fall on the Exchequer, in the form of both increased pricesupport and loss of revenue.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theindustrial strength on which our economy was based would best be preserved by pursuing the Swedish proposals for the ETA. It wouldbe right for us to join in v/orking out these proposals if, as was expected, Sweden were to propose a working party of officials forthat purpose. Initially, the project should be regarded as one confined to industrial products, and we should not reveal what concessions we might be prepared to make on agriculture and fish until we were asked. But it seemed inevitable that our prospective partners would eventually ask us to offer some such concessions, and we should inthat event accept the need to make them. It had to be accepted that,although the concessions were reasonable in themselves, they would meet with considerable opposition from sections of the industries concerned. When it was clear that the negotiations for the E.T.A.would continue, we should take the interests concerned, andparticularly the leaders of the agricultural industry, into our confidence. For this purpose he would himself be prepared to see theChairman of the National Farmers&apos; Union. The Governments of theCommon Market countries should also be informed, slightly inadvance, of the establishment of the proposed working party. As the project developed, it would be important that we should maintainthe closest consultations with all the United Kingdom interests concerned and with the other Commonwealth Governments.
minimum of  520 a year would represent an increase of 9\ per cent,and, while the cost of living was expected to rise by only about 1\ percent, during the three-year period from October 1956 to October 1959rwage increases generally seemed likely to amount during the samlperiod to at least 11 per cent. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, whilesympathetic to the differentials and maximum salary scales proposed under offer &quot; C,&quot; had indicated that he would be unwilling to accept a figure of  520 a year at the minimum of the scale. But, apart from the expected opposition of the teachers themselves, the local authorities might not agree to a minimum of less than  520 and it seemedquestionable whether, on this relatively small difference, theGovernment should accept the responsibility for a breakdown of thenegotiations. The adverse effects on the education drive and on the recruitment of teachers might be more serious than the financial burden involved.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that on general considerations of wages policy he could not agree that the minimum of the basic scale should be raised to  520. This would represent afurther increase of 4 per cent., following last year&apos;s interim award of5 per cent., at a time when there seemed to be a reasonable prospectof keeping the rate of wage increases generally to about 2 per cent.He thought that, for the reasons given in paragraph 1 of C. (59) 85,the local authority representatives should be induced to accept aminimum of  510 a year and, if it were agreed that the Governmentshould not go beyond this figure, he would be prepared to acceptproposals comparable to the remainder of those included in offer&quot; C.&quot;Discussion showed that the Cabinet were impressed by the effect which these negotiations might have on the course of industrial wage claims in the current year. On grounds of general economic policy itwas important that large increases in industrial wages should be avoided. And the percentage increase represented by a minimum of 520 for the basic scale of teachers would have serious repercussions on industrial wages especially if it were justified mainly on cost-of-living grounds. There was therefore general support for the view thatthe local authorities should be encouraged to put forward theirsuggested compromise offer &quot; B &quot; at the next meeting of the burnham committee in the knowledge that, as regards differentials and themaximum of the basic scale, the Government would, if necessary, beprepared to accept increases up to the level of offer &quot; C.&quot; They shouldnot, however, be encouraged to think that a minimum scale greaterthan  510 a year could be approved.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Education to inform the localauthorities&apos; panel of the Burnham Committee that, ifnecessary, he would be prepared to approve proposals madeon the basis of offer &quot; C &quot; in the Annex to C. (59) 82, exceptthat, as regards the minimum of the basic scale, he wouldnot be able to accept a figure higher than  510.
