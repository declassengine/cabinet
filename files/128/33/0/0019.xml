prime *1.   The Home Secretary said that, as a result of the PrimeMinisters Visit Ministers representations, President Eisenhower had now agreed inA^nlUnn^ principle to attend a meeting of Heads of Governments, although he remained unwilling as yet to envisage a definite date for theconference. It would now be possible for the Western Powers to reply in similar terms to the outstanding Note from the SovietGovernment, and the texts of the replies would be discussed in theNorth Atlantic Council on the following day.Washington,(previous reference :C.C. (59) 17thConclusions.Minute 2.)The Cabinet Took note, with approval of this statement.Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the week after the Easter recess.Civil Aviation.Jet Aircraft.(previous reference :C.C. (58) 87thConclusions,Minute 7.)3. The Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation said that agreement had now been reached with the Soviet authorities on the inauguration, in the early summer, of a regular air service between london Airport and Moscow on a basis which should ensure thatthe noise level of the Soviet TU 104 jet aircraft would be acceptable.Federation of rhodesia and nyasaland.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 18thConclusions,Minute 5.)04. The Minister of State for Colonial Affairs made a report tothe Cabinet on his recent visit to the Federation of Rhodesia and nyasaland. The despatch from the Governor of Nyasaland whichhad been published that day as a White Paper provided convincing evidence that, if the Governor had not declared a state of emergency,a grave threat to the community would have developed. While theGovernor had acted on his own initiative and not under pressure fromthe Federal Government, the security forces which the latter had made available had in fact proved indispensable. Law and order were now being steadily restored in the territory; and the conditions in the detention camps, although improvised, were as satisfactory as could resonably be expected. Moreover, the Southern rhodesia government had now agreed to release Mr. Guy Clutton Brock, theEuropean missionary, from detention; to withdraw until after Easterthe Preventive Detention Bill; and to amend it on more liberal linesbefore its reintroduction. Nevertheless, the Africans in Nyasalandremained unalterably opposed to the conception of Federation; and itwas therefore desirable that an independent enquiry into.the futureof the Federation, which might take the form of a Royal Commission,should be established in the near future in preparation for theconstitutional discussions which were due to take place in 1960.The Federal Government were unlikely to welcome a review of this nature; but his impression, as a result of discussion with the federal prime Minister, was that it should be possible eventually to persuade them to accept it.The Home Secretary said that, in the light of the situationrevealed by the White Paper, the Government should now announce their intention to hold a limited factual enquiry into the origins of therecent disturbances in Nyasaland. In view of the close connexionswhich the Church of Scotland maintained with Nyasaland it was for
consideration whether a representative of the General assembly should be associated with this enquiry. On balance, however, hethought that the later and wider review of the future of the Federationmight provide a more appropriate occasion for the Church ofScotland to take part in discussion of the affairs of NyasalandQMeanwhile, consultation with the Opposition leaders had indicated that they would be willing to dispense with Parliamentaryrepresentation on the initial enquiry provided that Parliament wasassociated with the subsequent Royal Commission. It was thereforeunfortunate that the Prime Minister of the Federation had indicated,in a telegram which had been despatched after the departure of theMinister of State for Colonial Affairs from Rhodesia, that, while hehad not finally rejected the proposal that a Royal Commission shouldbe appointed to consider the future of the Federation, he was apprehensive of any enquiry which would not only be liable to review the policies which the Federal Government had pursued in recentyears but might also make, recommendations for the future whichwould have unpredictable consequences.In discussion it was agreed that it would be difficult to promotean enquiry into the future of the Federation without the consent ofthe Federal Government. Nevertheless, we should be entitled, ifnecessary, to establish such an enquiry in relation to northern rhodesia and Nyasaland without the agreement of the federal authorities. Public opinion in this country would not accept the perpetuation of Federation in the absence of a review of the kind proposed; and, if the issues involved were not to become a matter of party political controversy, it was desirable that the Governmentshould announce their intention to establish a Royal Commissionsimultaneously with the announcement of the more limited enquiry into the origins of the recent disturbances in Nyasaland and toindicate that Parliament would be in some way associated with thework of the Commission. The Prime Minister of the federation should therefore be informed that while, in deference to his represen-tations, the Government would adopt as cautious an approach aspossible to the problem, they would be compelled to announce their intentions, in general terms, in the course of the Parliamentary debateswhich were to take place on the following days. He should also be assured that the details of the proposed Royal Commission would be worked out with him subsequently, if necessary by personaldiscussion.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Colonial Secretary to announce in the House ofCommons on the following day the composition and termsof reference of an independent enquiry into the originsof the recent disturbances in Nyasaland.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary, in consultation with theCommonwealth Secretary, to give further considerationto the desirability of associating a representative of theChurch of Scotland with this enquiry.(3)Hnvited the Home Secretary, in consultation with theCommonwealth Secretary and the Colonial Secretary, toinform the Prime Minister of the Federation of rhodesia and Nyasaland of the reasons for which the Governmentwould find it necessary, during the forthcomingParliamentary debates, to indicate in general terms their intention to establish a subsequent enquiry into the futureof the Federation with which the United kingdom parliament might be associated in an appropriate manner.cabinet Office, S.W. 1,24th March, 1959.
