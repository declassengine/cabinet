Egypt-financial negotiations.(previous reference :C.C. (59) 6thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet thatthe deadlock with the Egyptian Government about the interpretation of the provisional Anglo-Egyptian financial agreement in relation tocertain categories of land remained unresolved. Mr. Black, thePresident of the International Bank, who had been mediating in thedispute, was now inclined to accept the Egyptian contention that much of the land which we regarded as having been sequestrated,including the Smouha estate, was agricultural land which had beenEgyptianised and that its owners should therefore be compensated,not by the return of their property, but by payment from the lump sum of  27-i- millions to be paid by the Egyptian Government underthe agreement. Mr. Black was prepared, however, to make a further attempt to negotiate some understanding on this point between theEgyptian Government and ourselves; but he believed that, unless we were prepared to sign the agreement in the very near future, theEgyptian Government might entirely retract their provisionalendorsement of it. President Nasser was expected to make animportant political speech on 21st February, and there was reasonto suppose that, unless he believed that we were prepared to sign the agreement without further delay, he might denounce its provisions and nationalise the British assets which had been sequestrated. Inthese circumstances it seemed advisable that Mr. Black should returnto Cairo as soon as possible and should be allowed, as he had proposed, to issue forthwith a statement indicating that he intendedto seek to resolve the outstanding issues between the Egyptians and ourselves as a preliminary to signature of the agreement. This wouldbe an indication that we were prepared, in the last resort, to sign theagreement as it stood and to leave the issues relating to compensationfor different categories of land to be settled at a later stage in theleast disadvantageous manner possible. If we consented to Mr.Black&apos;s acting on these lines, we should also take steps to ensure thatour willingness to sign the agreement did not appear to be the resultof any threatening statements which President Nasser might makein his forthcoming speech. For this purpose it would be advisable to announce, before 21st February, that a United Kingdom minister was ready to visit Cairo and to sign the agreement when Mr. Blackhad completed his negotiations.In discussion there was general agreement with these proposals.The Government would be open to criticism if they signed theagreement without securing any concession from the egyptian government as regards its interpretation in relation to land; andit was desirable that Mr. Black should, if possible, secure that, forthe purposes of the agreement, agricultural land should be regardedas at least excluding built-up land. On the other hand, the generaladvantages of the agreement, particularly as regards the restorationof trade between the two countries and the resumption of operations in Egypt by the Shell Oil Company, were not inconsiderable and itwould be unwise to sacrifice these advantages by allowing theagreement to break down on a particular issue of interpretation.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for mr. Black, the President of the International Bank, to renew his efforts to negotiate with the egyptian government a settlement of the dispute over theinterpretation of the provisional Anglo-Egyptianagreement in relation to certain categories of land, onthe understanding that he should be authorised, in thelast resort, to indicate that the United KingdomGovernment were willing to sign the agreement as it stood.
(2) Invited the Chancellor the Exchequer to inform Mr. Blackthat the Government accepted his proposal to indicatepublicly, before leaving for Cairo, that the purpose ofhis mission was to resolve the outstanding issues as a preliminary to signature of the agreement.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, to arrange for a public statement to be made,at about the same time as the statement to be made byMr. Black under Conclusion (2) above, that a UnitedKingdom Minister would be prepared to visit Cairo afterMr. Black&apos;s final discussion with the egyptian government in order to sign the Anglo-Egyptian financial agreement.Cyprus.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 10thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Prime Minister said that, during the discussions in theinter-Governmental Conference on Cyprus on the previous day,Archbishop Makarios had adopted a critical attitude towards theproposals of the Governments of the United Kingdom, Greece and turkey for the future of the Island. His reservations had related,however, not to our own retention of strategic bases in the Islandunder British sovereignty but to certain aspects of the constitutionalprovisions which had been agreed by the Greek and turkish governments at Zurich. As a result of representations by theForeign Secretary and the Greek and Turkish Foreign Ministers, hehad now withdrawn his objections and had indicated his acceptanceof the documents presented to the Conference and the declarationsof the three Ministers as the foundation for the final settlement ofthe problem of Cyprus. The agreed documents would therefore be signed that afternoon.In discussion the Cabinet expressed their satisfaction at thesuccessful outcome of the Conference and paid tribute to the skill and patience with which the Foreign Secretary and the colonial secretary had made it possible for the Governments and peoplesconcerned to look forward to a brighter future for Cyprus. Themeans by which a settlement had been reached confirmed the validity of the view, which the Government had consistently maintained, thata solution could only be found by agreement between theGovernments of Greece, Turkey and the United Kingdom and theCypriot communities. The fact that Archbishop Makarios hadacquiesced in our retention of strategic facilities in the Island shouldconstitute a sufficient reply to any criticism that the Government hadsacrificed essential British interests in their anxiety to reach asettlement.In further discussion it was agreed that it would be desirablethat, subject to the concurrence of the Greek and Turkish PrimeMinisters, a statement about the outcome of the Conference shouldbe made by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons later that day. If it was necessary to comment on the understanding expressedby the Greek and Turkish Foreign Ministers that Cyprus mightremain in some form of association with the Commonwealth, it wouldbe appropriate to indicate that, although this question concernedother Commonwealth Governments, we should be prepared toconsider sympathetically any request from the Government of Cyprus,when constituted in due course, to remain associated with theCommonwealth. It would be advisable, however, to refrain fromundertaking, at this stage, any commitment as regards financialassistance to the Republic of Cyprus.
Parliament. 3.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Mr. Speaker. The Cabinet were informed that Mr. Speaker proposed to announce in the House of Commons that afternoon that he did not intend to seek re-election at the end of the present Parliament.BroadcastingDevelopment.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 65thConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePostmaster-General (C. (59) 34) proposing the appointment of anindependent committee to enquire into the future of the british broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and the Independent television authority (ITA) together with certain other current problems of broadcasting policy.The Postmaster-General said that there was growing pressure for the introduction of a third television programme and for anincrease in the permitted total of television hours in each week. any announcement that the Government could not at present agree to either of these developments would attract strong criticism; but itwould be difficult to defer such an announcement unless theGovernment were prepared to appoint an independent committee toconsider these questions. Moreover, other problems of broadcasting and television policy were likely soon to become a source of political embarrassment; and, since it would in any event be necessary before long to institute an enquiry into the future of the BBC and the ITA,whose statutory basis expired in 1962 and 1964 respectively, thebalance of advantage appeared to lie in appointing forthwith acommittee which could enquire into all the major problems of broadcasting policy.In discussion the advantages of an early enquiry were recognised.There was reason to think that it would be welcomed by both the bbc and the ITA; and, although its composition and terms ofreference would be determined by the present Government, it couldnot be expected to report until after the General Election. On theother hand, the issues involved were politically sensitive and it mightbe undesirable that they should be brought prominently before thepublic in the period preceding the Election. Moreover, while theterms of reference would need to be so drafted as to make it clearthat the continuation of independent television was not in question,the enquiry should embrace all the considerations which would need to be reviewed before the renewal of the BBCs Charter and of the television Act; and to institute such an enquiry so soon after the inception of independent television might be regarded as implying that the Government were in fact in doubt about its continuation.A further objection to an early enquiry was that it was likely to leadto increased pressure for additional Exchequer assistance to the BBC.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theproposal raised complex political issues, which should be further considered by the Ministers principally concerned.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the LordChancellor, the Lord President, the Chancellor of the DuchyThe Cabinet Took note with approval that the Prime Minister would announce in the House of Commons that day the successful outcome of the inter-Governmental Conference on thefuture of Cyprus.
of Lancaster, the Postmaster-General, the Chief Whip andthe Financial Secretary, Treasury, to give furtherconsideration to the proposal to appoint a committee ofenquiry into future broadcasting policy, and to report tothe Cabinet in due course.national insurance.UnemploymentBenefit.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 6thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Pensions and National Insurance (C. (59) 30) onunemployment benefit for workers on short time.The Minister of Pensions and National Insurance said that unemployment benefit was not paid to a man who had workedduring the week in question to &quot; the full normal extent.&quot; In 1948the then Minister had made Regulations dealing with this matterand had given assurances to the National Insurance AdvisoryCommittee that those Regulations merely codified existing case law.In particular, they were not intended to alter the practice wherebya man who had been on short time was entitled to receiveunemployment benefit in respect of the balance of a normal week.These Regulations fell to be construed, in the last resort, by theNational Insurance Commissioner. Recent decisions of theCommissioner suggested that he was inclined to interpret them tothe effect that, where a man had been on short time for a year, short-time working had become for him &quot;the full normal extent&quot; of aweek&apos;s work; and in that event he would no longer be entitled toreceive unemployment benefit. A Tribunal of Commissioners was due to consider that day two cases involving this principle. If theirruling necessitated the withdrawal of benefit in all such cases, itwould be advisable to issue amending Regulations which would ensure, with immediate effect, that benefit would not be withdrawn.In discussion there was general agreement that, despite theeconomic arguments against any action which might encourageprolonged short-time working, political considerations stronglyfavoured these proposals.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (59) 30.Cotton.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 3rdConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (C. (59) 29) on the question ofassistance to the cotton industry.The President of the Board of Trade said that, in agreement withthe Ministers primarily concerned, he had reached the conclusion that action by the Government in support of the cotton industry shouldtake the form of assistance to the industry itself rather than to thecotton textile areas. There was already considerable diversificationof industry in those areas; and their present and prospective level ofunemployment was considerably lower than that of several other areas. The form and scope of assistance to the textile industry could not, however, be decided in detail until the industry&apos;s own proposals were available. It was for consideration whether it wouldthen be desirable to appoint some independent person to assist in examining those proposals.In discussion there was general agreement that Exchequerassistance to the industry should be primarily related to expenditureon modernisation of equipment, and that compensation in respect of redundancy, whether of men or machines, should remain the
OH 7.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theDistribution.    Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (59) 21) on the position of Shell-MexMonopolies.    and British Petroleum (B.P.) Limited under the Restrictive trade practices Act, 1956.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the agreement underwhich Shell-Mex and B.P. Limited (a joint marketing and distributingagency for the Shell, B.P. and Eagle Groups) was established in 1931would in due course come before the Restrictive Practices Court.The company had been advised that the agreement would almost certainly fail to satisfy the Court and that, in that event, the combinewould have to be dissolved. Internationally this would be liable toencourage Governments in the Middle East to take action againstjoint oil-producing companies; while domestically it would causes considerable dislocation, with consequent loss of business to non-British competitors, and would involve a wasteful duplication of facilities. The Economic Policy Committee had therefore recommended that the Governments main objective should be toavoid a situation in which the existing agreement came before the restrictive Practices Court and was publicly condemned. It wouldbe unwise to seek to achieve this by amendment of the restrictive trade Practices Act; and the companies should be encouraged towork out, in the interval before their agreement came before theCourt, a scheme which would remove their marketing activities fromthe scope of the Act.Discussion showed that there was general agreement with these recommendations, especially since the company could be reasonablycertain that their agreement would not come before the Court for at least twelve months. It would be advisable, however, to examineat the same time the technical possibility of so amending the Act asto render it inoperative in relation to agreements of the kind inquestion, in case a suitable opportunity for fresh legislation occurred at a later date.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in C. (59) 21.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in consultationwith the Minister of Power and the Attorney-General,i to examine the technical possibility of amending the restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1956, on the lines indicated in their discussion.responsibility of the industry. It might be desirable, however, thatthe Governments assistance should be made conditional on anundertaking by the industry to ensure adequate compensation for those operatives who would become redundant as a result of there organisation proposals. It would also be necessary to warn theindustry that only a limited level of assistance could be expected from the Government.The Cabinet (1) Took note of C. (59) 29.(2) Invited the President of the Board&apos;oT^Frade to circulate assoon as possible detailed proposals for special action bythe Government to assist the cotton textile industry.
Commonwealth      8.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordImmigrants.     Chancellor (C. (59) 7) on Commonwealth immigrants.(previous reference: The Lord Chancellor said that the Committee on ColonialC.C. (58) 69th Immigrants had given further consideration to the desirability of QConclusions, promoting legislation to empower the Home Secretary to deport anyMinute 3.) British subject or citizen of the Irish Republic who was recommended for deportation by a Court upon conviction of an offence for whicha sentence of imprisonment could be imposed or of an offence relatingto prostitution. There was genuine public concern over the criminalactivities of a small proportion of the coloured immigrants arriving in this country; and the Government might be criticised if they failedto take the necessary powers to deport these undesirable elements.The majority of the members of the Committee were therefore infavour of legislation. On the other hand, the flow of colouredimmigrants to the United Kingdom had recently been much reduced and the racial tension of the previous year appeared to have declined.He therefore shared the view of the minority of the members of theCommittee that legislation on the lines proposed was at presentunnecessary and was not likely to be well received by public opinion.The Home Secretary said that it was essential that this legislation should eventually be enacted. It would, however, be contentious;and in view of the many other demands on the legislative programme,he would not wish to press for its introduction during the current session. Consultations with other Commonwealth and colonial governments on the form and scope of such a Bill should, however,be continued.In discussion there was general agreement that it would be impracticable to promote such legislation during the current Session.If attempts were made to amend the Street Offences Bill in order to empower the Home Secretary to deport Colonial immigrants whowere living on immoral earnings in this country, they should be resisted on the ground that that Bill was not an appropriate vehiclefor the introduction of a power to deport British citizens, especially since the exercise of that power would not extend to other, and more serious, offences.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that legislation to empower the Home Secretary to deport undesirable immigrants from the commonwealth should not be introduced during the current Session.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary and the colonial secretary, in consultation with the Home Secretary, toascertain the views of Commonwealth and colonial governments on the form and scope of legislation forthis purpose which might be promoted in a later Session.Employment.(previous reference :C.C. (59) 1stConclusions,Minute 4.)9. The Minister of Labour said that, in the absence of amending legislation (to which there would be political objection) theDevelopment Areas (Treasury Advisory) Committee could not beexpected to make any greater contribution than at present to theexpansion of industry in areas of high unemployment. He had therefore considered, in consultation with the Ministers concerned,alternative means of providing inducements to firms to establishnew enterprises in such areas. It would be possible, for example,for the Government to encourage and assist local authorities to buildadvance factories in these areas. This proposal was being urgentlyexamined. In addition, the Board of Trade already had statutory powers to build factories; and although these powers had hitherto been exercised only in North-East Lancashire, Dundee, Greenock
primeministers visit to moscow.10. The Prime Minister said that during the visit which he andthe Foreign Secretary were shortly to make to Moscow, he expectedto discuss with the Soviet leaders the problems of Berlin,disarmament, and trade and cultural relations between this countryand the Soviet Union. This visit was intended to be in the natureof a reconnaissance, not a negotiation; and he did not contemplatereaching any agreement with the Soviet Government. In particular,he would be concerned, in discussing Berlin and the related issues ofthe future of Germany and European security, to do no more thantry to estimate the views and intentions of the Soviet leaders; andand West South Wales, it was now proposed that they should beused also in Liverpool, Merseyside and possibly in other areas.Finally, an increasing amount of evidence was available to demonstrate the discouraging effect of the existing policy wherebyfirms occupying Government factories and wishing to have themenlarged were required to undertake to buy any extension, togetherwith the original building, over a fixed period. Firms would be more likely to extend their factories if they were required merely to payan economic rent for the additional capacity.In discussion there was general agreement with these proposals.In cases where specialised buildings were involved, however, it mightbe necessary to adhere to the policy of requiring a firm, as a conditionof having its premises enlarged, to buy both the original building and the extension.In further discussion it was suggested that the need for the concessions now proposed demonstrated the difficulty of inducingfirms to establish branch enterprises in areas of high unemploymentduring a period of industrial depression. They were more likely to favour such expansion in conditions of prosperity; and it was forconsideration, therefore, whether the Governments policy for thedistribution of industry should be radically reviewed in order toensure that at the next favourable opportunity a more comprehensiveattempt might be made to arrest the increasing centralisation ofindustrial activity and to promote the maintenance of production andemployment in the remoter areas which were traditionally associatedwith persistent unemployment.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the powers of the Board of Trade to buildfactories should be exercised in Liverpool, Merseyside andpossibly other areas.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to arrange forthe early announcement of this decision.(3) Agreed that, subject to further examination in the case of specialised buildings, firms wishing to have extensionsbuilt to existing Government factories should be allowedto lease, and should not be required to buy, the additional capacity.(4) Invited the Minister of Labour, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the other ministers concerned, to arrange for further consideration to begiven to the proposal that local authorities should been abled to build factories in areas of high unemployment.(5) Invited the Home Secretary to consider by what means theGovernment might best re-examine their policy for thedistribution of industry.
he would adhere closely to the position which the Western powers had publicly adopted on these subjects. On the question of disarmament he would seek to explore the possibility of concludingan agreement with the Soviet Union, particularly as regards nuclear tests and surprise attack. He was satisfied that it would be premature 0to expect to conclude an early trade agreement with the soviet union; but his visit might persuade the Soviet Government to receive a trade mission at a later date.Facilities for communication between London and Moscowwere limited, and neither he nor the Foreign Secretary could expect to be kept fully informed of the detail of current Government business during their absence. The Home Secretary would take charge of theGovernment and would also be available for consultation by ForeignOffice Ministers.The Home Secretary expressed to the Prime Minister the cabinet&apos;s good wishes for the success of his mission.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,19th February, 1959.
