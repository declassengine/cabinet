TrusteeInvestment.(previous reference:CM. (55) 24thConclusions,Minute 5.)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (59) 184) covering a draft of a White Paper announcingproposals for legislation to extend the range of trustee investment.The Home Secretary said that for some years past there had been increasing pressure from trustees for some relaxation of the rulesrequiring trust funds to be invested in fixed-interest securities.Trustees of new trusts were now often given, and those of existingtrusts increasingly obtained, powers to invest in a wider range of securities. The Home Secretary&apos;s proposals, which had beenprepared in consultation with the Lord Chancellor and theChancellor of the Exchequer, were designed to enable trustees ofexisting trusts to adopt a pattern of investment similar to that whichmight be followed by any prudent investor at the present time. their effect would be that at least half of the trust monies would still haveto be invested in fixed-interest securities or others which conformedto the principles of the present Trustee List, but that the other halfmight, if the trustees so wished, be invested in equities of certainUnited Kingdom companies and similar investments, There wouldbe safeguards designed to ensure marketability and spread of investment and the additional safeguard that no investment might bemade except on suitable professional advice.In discussion it was suggested that these proposals might causean appreciable movement away from gilt-edged securities and somake it more difficult for the Government to fund the national debt.On the other hand it was recognised that there was considerable pressure for an extension of the present Trustee List and that therewas no other practicable method of protecting the beneficiaries of allbut the most recent trusts from the effects of inflation. Practicalpossibilities and ordinary market forces were, moreover, likely toensure that any movement away from gilt-edged securities was spreadover a considerable period. On balance, therefore, it was agreedthat the Government should proceed with legislation to give effectto the proposed scheme and that the White Paper should be published at an early date.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (59) 184 for an extension ofthe range of trustee investment and authorised theChancellor of the Exchequer to present to Parliament a white Paper in the terms of the draft annexed to that memorandum.Non-Industrial 2. The Home Secretary said that a Private Member&apos;s Bill givingEmployment, power to regulate conditions in offices had recently obtained a(Previous .

The Governments attitudeOffices. towards the Bill would now need to be reviewed; and the opportunity should be taken to reconsider, in the light of recent developments, thewhole remaining area of the reports of the Gowers Committee onShop Hours, and Health, Welfare and Safety in Non-industrial employment.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with other) Ministers concerned, to reconsider the attitude of theGovernment towards the Offices Bill and to review the needfor action on related problems arising from the reports ofthe Gowers Committee; and to bring these questions beforethem again in due course.
commercial policy.Anglo-PolishTrade Talks.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 63rdConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (C. (59) 190) on further developments in the Anglo-Polish trade negotiations.The President of the Board of Trade said that the Polisi (&quot; .)Government, after considering our decision to reduce their bacon ^quota to 20,000 tons in the first six months of 1960, had nowproposed that, instead of negotiating a new trade agreement for 1960,the existing arrangements should be maintained for the first sixmonths of that year and a new agreement negotiated in the spring,when more would be known of the various factors affecting the supplyof bacon in the United Kingdom. The Poles were willing to acceptthe reduction in their bacon quota for the first half of 1960.In discussion it was recognised that the proposal would resultin some reduction of the trade with Poland for which we had hoped.It was possible that this development might affect our trade relationswith other countries of the Soviet bloc. It was, however, agreed thaton balance the Polish proposal should be accepted.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (59) 190.aircraft industry.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 52ndConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Aviation (C. (59) 185) on the future of the aircraft industry.The Minister of Aviation said that it was in the national interest that a substantial aircraft industry should be maintained in the UnitedKingdom. The serious difficulties with which the industry was facedwere due to the prospective decline in defence orders, both at homeand for export, and to the disappointing sales prospects of a numberof current civil types. The design and development of new types was increasingly costly, in terms both of money and of technical resources.Overseas customers usually would not place firm orders until the new types were in production, and this meant that a large investment was put at risk. The United States aircraft industry had the great advantage that their civil production was still based on a substantialmilitary programme. In this country we could not continue tosupport our aircraft industry by placing orders for military aircraft which were not needed; but if the industry could be helped over itspresent difficulties in some other way, its prospects in the longer termwere promising, in view of the likely expansion in world air traffic.The Government had already announced that they would beprepared to support the production of civil aircraft by an industryreorganised on a more rational basis. It had been envisaged that thissupport would extend to some part of the aeronautical research programme, which at present cost about  25 millions a year, of which 10 millions was charged to the Civil Account, and to thedevelopment and production of civil projects of a revolutionary oradvanced type. From discussions with the aircraft firms it was now clear that the Government would have to go further if the future ofthe industry was to be assured. Additional Government assistance on civil aircraft and aero-engine projects would be necessary for anumber of years at an average rate of about  15 millions a year.This estimate was based on the desirability of providing increasedassistance for the development and tooling-up of promising civilprojects, even if there were no firm requirement from any of theaircraft corporations, at an average rate of  10 millions a year; ofassistance of  2 or  3 millions a year to underwrite the productionof civil aircraft in advance of firm orders; and of assistance of about 3 millions a year towards the initial costs which the aircraftcorporations incurred in introducing new aircraft into commercialservice.
The Governments financial assistance should be directed togroups of firms with sufficient resources to undertake new projectswith reasonable prospects of success. The Government would notbe justified in supporting more than two main airframe groups andtwo main aero-engine groups. The need for a radical rationalisation of the industry was now generally accepted. A merger of the hawker siddeley and de Havilland companies had been arranged; and it was desirable that the other main airframe group should be based uponthe Vickers, English Electric and, perhaps, Bristol companies. Inorder to achieve this reorganisation, it would be necessary to givethe industry more definite indications of the - nature of theGovernment assistance which the main groups of firms could expect.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, if additionalGovernment assistance were provided for these purposes, it was likely to exceed the estimated average rate of  15 millions. Theoriginal estimates of the assistance required by Vickers in respect ofthe heavy losses they would incur on certain of their current projectshad now been greatly increased. While it would be right to continueto support the industry, and to reorganise it on the lines suggestedby the Minister of Aviation, it was difficult to know what assurancescould properly be given without considering more carefully what theGovernment^ financial commitment would be having regard to the projects which were likely to be developed. Moreover, the claim ofthe aircraft industry for increased assistance had to be balancedagainst claims advanced by other industries, including shipping, on similar grounds of national interest.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat a substantial British aircraft industry should be maintained, andthat additional Government assistance would be necessary for thispurpose. It was also agreed that a rationalisation of the industry into two main airframe and two main aero-engine groups was very desirable. It was, however, difficult to decide what scale of financialassistance would be justified, and what form this should take, withoutconsidering what projects a reorganised industry might undertakewith reasonable prospects of success. The sales prospects for new types were highly uncertain. The aircraft industry in the UnitedStates might well try to safeguard their markets by developing their participation in overseas air-lines.The Cabinet were informed that Vickers believed that they could secure a firm order from a Canadian air-line for a number ofV.C.ll&apos;s, a new aircraft which they were developing to replace theViscount. But they would not undertake production of the new aircraft on the basis of this order alone unless they could obtain some assurance of additional financial assistance from the Government.It was also understood that Vickers might be able to secure a largeorder for Vanguard aircraft if some special credit assistance wereforthcoming.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet agreed that the aircraft industry should be maintained and reorganised on the basis of two main airframe and two main aero-engine groups, and theycongratulated the Minister of Aviation on the progress he had made so far. The maintenance of a reorganised industry might necessitateadditional Government support, and further progress with there organisation of the industry would not be possible until some assurance could be given, in fairly specific terms, of the government&apos;s policy in this matter. But it did not seem possible to determine whatthe scale of Government assistance should be except in relation to current and likely future projects, and in particular the projectsabout which Vickers were at present in considerable difficulties. TheMinisters concerned should therefore give further thought to thesequestions and should submit their recommendations for hisconsideration in the following week.
The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of aviation, in consultation with the Paymaster-General andthe President of the Board of Trade, to give furtherconsideration to the question of financial assistance to theaircraft industry and to make recommendations to the PrimeMinister in the following week.Atomic Energy. 5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the nuclear Minister of Transport (C. (59) 187) on the development of nuclearMerchant Ship, propulsion for merchant ships.The Minister of Transport said that the committee under thechairmanship of the Civil Lord, Admiralty, had reaffirmed the irrecommendation that tenders should be invited for both a boilingwater reactor and an organic liquid-moderated reactor in a65,000-tons deadweight tanker, and that the Atomic energy authority should continue intensive study of the latter reactor system in order to be better able to decide which system would be preferableby the time the tenders were received. The purpose of the tenderswould be to obtain more reliable estimates of costs and more information about safety features and the scope for development,but they would involve no Government commitment at this stage tobuild a nuclear ship. These recommendations were supported byshipowners and shipbuilders. Five firms would be invited to tenderand they would expect some payment towards the cost of tendering.If the Government contributed half the cost, the Exchequer liabilitymight be about  250,000. It was possible that a third system, knownas the steam-cooled heavy water reactor, might be suitable for marinepropulsion, and the Atomic Energy Authority should undertakefurther study of this system also.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that in view of competition from other countries, including Germany, it was important to obtainbuilding and operating experience of a nuclear ship as soon aspossible. Since it was already known that neither the boiling waterreactor system nor the organic liquid-moderated reactor system wouldbe economic, he doubted whether it was necessary to awaitexamination of the tenders before deciding in principle to build a nuclear ship. It would be preferable to let it be known now that, ifthe tenders showed that it would be feasible, a ship would be builtwith one or other of the two systems.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Atomic Energy authority would prefer that the Government should not undertake a firm commitment at the present time to build a nuclear ship. If such a commitment had to be undertaken now, it would be preferable to use the pressurised water reactor system which had been proved inoperation by other countries.In discussion the following points were raised:  (a) In addition to the systems mentioned, a gas-cooled reactorsystem had been developed commercially and it was thought thatthis might be applicable to marine propulsion. The Minister ofTransport undertook to enquire further into this point.(b) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he wished to reserve the possibility of recovering, through royalties, the whole r-,part of any Government contribution towards the cost of tenderingThe Cabinet Approved the proposals put forward in C. (59) 187.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 47thConclusions,Minute 5.)
Road Traffic.previousf   ference:V.C. (59) 62ndConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Transport (C. (59) 189) seeking authority to preparelegislation giving him special powers to relieve the road traffic congestion in central London.The Minister of Transport said that urgent action was necessaryfor this purpose and he sought authority to proceed at once with thepreparation of legislation. The Bill would empower him to make grants in respect of certain road improvements in Greater Londonand to modify or dispense with the existing statutory procedures which had to be complied with before new controls on traffic andparking could be introduced. These powers might&apos;be limited to an initial period of five years and would be set out in some detail in theBill with the intention that, if successful, they might later be extendedto the appropriate authorities in other urban areas. The Bill wouldalso provide for civilian traffic wardens and a system of summarystandard fines for parking and lighting offences, which had alreadybeen approved in principle by the Home Affairs Committee; and forsome new method of financing the construction of off-street parkingplaces and garages.Discussion showed that there was general support in the cabinet for the purposes of the proposed legislation. Some of the Minister^proposals were, however, far-reaching and politically important; andit would be useful if the policy issues which these involved could be examined more fully before a draft Bill came before the legislation committee.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Minister of Transport undertook to discuss his proposals with representatives of the local authorities in London and to makeit clear that they would not prejudge the recommendations of theRoyal Commission on London Government.(b) The Chancellor of the Exchequer reserved his position onthe proposals relating to Exchequer grant on road improvements andto the financing of off-street parking.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Transport to circulate a memorandum setting out in more detail the more important andcontroversial proposals of the plan outlined in C. (59) 189,for early consideration by the Home Affairs committee or the Cabinet.(2) Authorised the Minister of Transport to proceed meanwhileto have the other elements of his plan reduced to statutoryform.Cabinet Office, S.W.
