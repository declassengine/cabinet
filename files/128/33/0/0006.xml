The Cabinet were informed that Mr. Black, the Presidentof the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, was still in communication with the Egyptian Government about the disputed interpretation of the provisional Anglo-Egyptian financial agreement. We could not exclude the possibility that certain features of the agreement might need to be re-negotiated.Pensions.(previous reference :C.C. (59) 5thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, after consideringthe implications of introducing legislation to amend the Pensions(Increase) Act, 1956, he was doubtful whether it would be feasible to enact in the current session a complicated Bill which would entailconsultation in advance with local authorities and other interested parties. Before deciding on the course which he wished torecommend to the Cabinet he would need to consider this aspect of the question in greater detail with the Leader of the House.The Cabinet- Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.Commercial 3.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePolicy. Minister of Agriculture (C. (59) 18) discussing both the implicationsHorticulture. 0f an increase in the tariff on cut flowers and the problem of the(Previous protection of the horticultural industry in general.Reference *C.C. (59) 4th The Minister of Agriculture said that, on further consideration,Conclusions, he believed that an increase of one-third in the existing tariff on cutMinute 5.) flowers would suffice to afford material relief to the growers. Butthe difficulties which had arisen in this case illustrated the inadequacy of the tariff as a means of protecting horticulture; and it would therefore be desirable to examine alternative methods of assisting the industry. Such methods included minimum price schemes; a tariff varying with market prices; an extension of the periods inwhich the higher tariff rates applied; and a system of guaranteed prices. None of these, however, was wholly satisfactory; and the wide and unpredictable fluctuations in the supply of horticulturalproducts, combined with their variety and perishable nature, made it very difficult to devise a method which would be free fromobjection.In discussion it was agreed that the economic case for anincrease in the tariff on cut flowers was open to serious question.The statistics appended to C. (59) 18 made it clear that in 1958 boththe value and the volume of the imports in question had declinedby comparison with 1957 while domestic production had increased.There were therefore no grounds for inferring that the decline in theprofitability of the domestic industry was due to excessivecompetition from imported flowers. Moreover, an increase in thetariff could easily be justified in relation to the General agreement on Tariffs and Trade; and it was open to the additional politicalobjection that it would be regarded by the Government of theNetherlands, who were our supporters in the current negotiationsfor the creation of a European Free Trade Area, as a rebuff to Dutchinterests.On the other hand, there were strong political arguments infavour of some concession to the cut flower industry; and an increasein the tariff, which would not affect the cost of living or undulyincrease the market price, appeared to be the least objectionableform which such a concession could take. The unfavourable impact on Dutch opinion might be mitigated if, at the same time, we granted a moderate increase in the import quota for Dutch bulbs.
The decision on this particular issue, was, however, linked withthe decision of policy on the wider question of the method by whichprotection should be afforded to the horticultural industry in future.For example, it would be possible to combine the announcement ofan increase in the tariff on cut flowers with a statement that theGovernment no longer regarded the tariff as the most suitable meansof horticultural protection and were therefore proposing to institutean independent enquiry into alternative means of assisting theindustry. On the other hand, it would be embarrassing to concedean increase in the tariff on cut flowers on any hypothesis other thanthat the tariff remained the Governments chief instrument ofhorticultural protection; and it might therefore be desirable to postpone for a time the announcement of any wider enquiry.Moreover, in the light of the difficulties inherent in each of thealternative methods of protection outlined in C. (59) 18, it would bedesirable that, before any enquiry was publicly announced, furtherconsideration should be given to its terms of reference and to themanner in which it would best be conducted. If, however, any public statement about an enquiry was to be deferred, it would be essentialthat the increase in the tariff on cut flowers should be announcedforthwith and should take effect as rapidly as possible.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.4.  The Cabinet had before them (i) a memorandum by the Prime Minister (C. (59) 16)summarising the main issues involved in the choice between theBritannic 3 and the Handley Page 111 as a strategic air freighter;(ii) a memorandum by the Minister of Supply (C. (59) 17)proposing that in the short term the military requirement for an air freighter should be met by a modification of the Britannia andthat in the long term a new aircraft should be designed capable offulfilling a civil, as well as a military, freighting role.The Minister of Defence said that he could not support theproposals in C. (59) 17. The military requirement for an air freighterwould not arise until about 1963; and it would therefore be unnecessary to adapt the Britannia for freighting purposes in the intervening period, especially since the modified aircraft would be unable to accommodate the items of Army equipment which wouldbe in service by the mid-1960s. On the other hand, the requirementwhich would be actual by 1963 would not be satisfied by a new aircraft which could not be available until 1965 and might well be delayed even longer. The choice therefore lay between the HandleyPage 111 and the Britannic 3. The former was preferable from the purely military point of view. The Britannic 3 was inferior inperformance, especially in terms of its pay load at maximum range;but it could be regarded as militarily acceptable if the arguments in its favour from the point of view of social and economic policy inNorthern Ireland were regarded as overriding.The Minister of Supply said that the proposals in C. (59) 17 hadbeen devised in an attempt to overcome the difficulties inherent in both the Handley Page 111 and the Britannic 3 and to encourage the production of a new aircraft specifically adaptable to the needsof the expanding market for civil air freighters. The HandleyPage 111 offered no possibility of civil application. Moreover, theHandley Page Company had no long-term future in the aircraft industry and to place with them the order for a strategic air freighterwould be inconsistent with the Governments policy of promoting a gradual rationalisation of the industry. The Britannic 3, thoughcheaper than the Handley Page 111 and likely to become availablesooner, had the disadvantage that it would become obsolescentDefence.(previous reference:C.C.

relatively quickly. Nevertheless, if the choice lay between theBritannic 3 and the Handley Page 111, the former had the strongerclaim to consideration. It was capable of application to civil use;and its manufacture would help to maintain employment at ShortBrothers and Harland Limited. The company were in a precariousfinancial position and, in the absence of new orders, would be compelled to discharge labour in 1960 on a scale which, in the lightof the severe unemployment already existing in Northern Ireland,would be liable to have very serious implications.In further discussion it was suggested that the proposals inC. (59) 17 should not be lightly set aside. The market,for civil airfreighters was likely to expand rapidly; and it would be to our advantage to develop an aircraft which was capable of civil, as well&apos;as military, application. Moreover, the research and development which had already been carried out by the firms likely to tender forthe new aircraft should ensure that it would be available by about1965. On the other hand, there could be no certainty that it would prove possible to design an aircraft capable of satisfying both themilitary requirement for a long-range freighter and the civilrequirement for a freighter which would operate mainly on shortor medium-range routes. Moreover, the project would be liable tobe more expensive than present estimates suggested; and, apart fromthe initial modification of a number of Britannias, it offered no prospect of ensuring continuing production at Shorts.Further discussion showed that the Cabinet favoured an order for the Britannic 3 as combining the minimum of militarydisadvantage with the maximum of assistance to Shorts and to the economy of Northern Ireland. In view of the possible developmentof the association between Shorts and Bristol Aircraft Limited,however, it would be important to ensure that the order would be executed, as far as possible, in Northern Ireland. It would alsobe necessary to give further consideration to the proposal made byShorts that the cost of development should be amortised over 30aircraft, on the assumption that they would attract orders for 20civil freighters in addition to the Governments order for 10 military aircraft of this type. Although the Britannic 3 should retain some advantage in price over the H.P. 111 even if the proposal were adopted, it might be unwise to encourage the firm to assume theadditional financial liability entailed in speculative production forthe civil market.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State forAir and the Minister of Supply to arrange for an order for Britannic 3 aircraft to be placed with Short Brotherson the understanding that production would be concentrated to the maximum extent possible in NorthernIreland.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State forAir and the Minister of Supply:  (i) to determine the size of the order to be placed under conclusion (1) above;(ii) to consider to what extent the amortisation ofdevelopment costs for the purposes of this order should assume speculative production of theBritannic 3 for civil purposes.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,10th February, 1959.
