to Moscow.(previous reference :C.C. (59) 13thConclusions,Minute 2.)Prime        ^        *1.   The Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary made a!k,i&quot;*&apos;!!&apos;.LVisit rePort to the Cabinet on the discussions which they had held withthe Soviet Leaders during their visit to the Soviet Union.The discussions had opened in a cordial atmosphere andMr. Khrushchev&apos;s attitude in the initial stages had been friendly,though he had given no indication of flexibility on the Berlinquestion. But on 24th February he had made a public speech, inconnexion with the elections which were in progress, in which hehad reaffirmed the intransigent stand on Berlin which had been takenin the recent Soviet Notes and had expressed stiff criticism of theattitude of the Western Powers. The Prime Minister had, therefore,thought it necessary to make it plain to Mr. Khrushchev, when thediscussions were resumed on the following day, that the western governments were not prepared to accept any unilateral modificationof the rights which they enjoyed in Berlin by virtue of their status as occupying Powers and that, if the Soviet Government persisted inthis course without attempting to achieve a settlement by negotiation,a very dangerous situation would arise. Mr. Khrushchev had reactedsharply to this statement. He had indicated that the Soviet union would not be dissuaded from their policy by threats of war and hehad delivered an intemperate attack upon what he regarded as theaggressive intentions of the Western Allies. He had also said thathe would be unable to carry out his earlier intention to accompany the British Ministers to Kiev, and that Mr. Mikoyan would similarly be  unable to meet them at Leningrad. Subsequently, however, he hadreverted to a more conciliatory attitude. Mr. Mikoyan andMr. Gromyko had both appeared at Leningrad, and had broughta message from Mr. Khrushchev indicating that he was looking forward to further discussions of substance when the party returnedto Moscow. In these final stages of the visit discussions were resumed in the original atmosphere of cordiality. Mr. Khrushchev,while maintaining his intention to conclude a peace treaty withEast Germany, had indicated that he was ready to seek in negotiationa solution of the problem of West Berlin, which would not prejudice the vital interests of either the Soviet Union or the Western Allies,and he had no longer insisted that such a solution must be found before27th May. He had seemed to be ready to make some concessions to the Western point of view. For example, he had indicated thatthe Soviet Government would be ready to guarantee the status of west Berlin as a free city and to send a token force of Soviet troops to join Western troops in guaranteeing Western access to it.Moreover, they would not seek to insist that the Western powers should recognise the East German Government de jure and wouldbe content that any necessary contacts with it should be maintainedthrough a third party. They might also be willing to acquiesce in anarrangement whereby the Federal Government and the East GermanGovernment would remain associated with the North Atlantic treaty organisation and the Warsaw Pact respectively. Mr. Khrushchevhad agreed that questions of this kind would need to form the subjectof further negotiation. He would have preferred that they shouldbe settled as part of a comprehensive discussion of all majoroutstanding issues at a meeting of Heads of Governments to be heldtowards the end of April. But he had indicated that, if the western powers still regarded a meeting of Foreign Ministers as an essential preliminary, the Soviet Union would be prepared to accept such ameeting with an agenda confined to the two questions of a peace treaty with Germany and the status of West Berlin.The most significant result of these discussions was the fact thatthe atmosphere of crisis which had been developing in relation tothe date of 27th May had been reduced.  The Soviet GovernmentPreviously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET
were now prepared to adjust the timetable, within limits, to therequirements of further negotiations. On the long-term future ofGermany, they remained unwilling to discuss the possibility ofreunification which, they insisted, was a matter to be settled betweenthe two Germanies. It was evident that they favoured the indefinitepartition of the country, though they were prepared to contemplatesome kind of confederation of the two parts. But the discussions had confirmed that, although they were concerned to avoid a major war, which they recognised would be as disastrous for themselves as for the Western Powers, they v/ere resolved to go forward withtheir policy of concluding a peace treaty with East Germany.In these circumstances it was important that, while publiclymaintaining the solidarity of the Western position, we should seek to convince our Allies of the wisdom of making a realistic response to the Soviet willingness to negotiate. If the Western Powers werenot prepared to go some way to meet the Soviet Union, they would face, in the near future, either a major diplomatic defeat as the resultof adopting an aggressive policy which, in the event, they would be unable to sustain, or the risk of a major war as the result of followingthat policy to its logical conclusion. Our Allies might be reluctant to recognise the need for a more constructive approach towards theproblem of Berlin and might be liable to criticise us for appearing to be ready to yield to Soviet intransigence. Nevertheless, it wouldbe prudent that we should recognise the Soviet determination to regularise the division of Germany, with some consequentialadjustment in the status of Berlin, and should seek to extract themaximum advantage from the willingness of the Soviet leaders to negotiate that adjustment. The implications of this policy would need further consideration; but the course which we should adoptwould need to be finally approved by the Cabinet during the following week in the light of the forthcoming conversations with theGovernments of France and Federal Germany and before discussions were opened with the United States Government.In discussion the Cabinet expressed their appreciation of theskill and forbearance with which the Prime Minister and the foreign secretary had conducted the discussions with the Soviet leaders indifficult circumstances and in the face of considerable provocation.Effectively, the leadership of the Western world now rested with theUnited Kingdom Government; and the initiative which we had secured should be followed up with the minimum of delay. In viewof the disturbing reports which had recently been received from washington about the increasing hostility of the United StatesGovernment towards the Soviet Union, it was for consideration whether the Prime Minister^ visit to Washington should take priority over his visits to Paris and Bonn in an endeavour to ensure that,before the United States were irretrievably committed to a policyof solving the problem of Berlin by force, more moderate counselsmight prevail. On the other hand, it had now been made clear thatthe Soviet Union would no longer seek to force a decision on this problem by 27th May; and there was, therefore, less risk that theUnited States Government would take such drastic action within thenext few weeks as to nullify the tactical advantage which had been secured by the Prime Ministers visit to Moscow. It might be preferable, therefore, that the Prime Minister should adhere to his original intention to inform General de Gaulle and Dr. Adenauer ofthe results of his discussions with Mr. Khrushchev before proceeding to Washington to concert policy with President Eisenhower. It wouldbe dangerous to give the French and German leaders any grounds for supposing that we were seeking to reach a private understanding with the United States without their participation; and the PrimeMinister^ position during his visit to Washington might well be strengthened if he had first informed himself of the attitude of theFrench and German Governments towards the situation as it had now been disclosed.
Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to bethe House of Commons in the following week.taken inFederation of rhodesia and nyasaland.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 13thConclusions.Minute 1.)3. The Cabinet were informed of the latest developments inthe disturbances in the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.Although it might become necessary to declare a state of emergency in Northern Rhodesia, the Prime Minister of the Federation was confident that the authorities could control the situation and thatit would not be necessary to ask the United Kingdom Governmentfor assistance. If, however, reinforcements proved to be necessary,we could transfer an infantry battalion from Kenya to Nyasaland.The time required for this operation could be reduced by two daysif the aircraft allocated for the purpose were moved to Kenyaforthwith; and, in view of the uncertainty of the situation, it mightbe desirable to take this precaution.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Defence to arrange for the transfer to kenya of the aircraft which would be required if it became necessary to despatch reinforcements to the Federation of rhodesia and Nyasaland.A further consideration was that time was needed for the Cabinetto review their own policy and to discuss how best to persuade theUnited States Government of the advantages of a more flexibleattitude. In the United States both the public and the administration would view with suspicion any proposals which might suggest a weakening of our resolution; and it would be necessary to convince them that, if the problem of Berlin could be solved on the lines whichhad emerged during the discussions with Mr. Khrushchev, thesubstance of the Western position would be preserved. In particular,the rights of the Allies in relation to the Western sectors of Berlinwould be maintained; the Western Powers could perhaps avoidentering into direct relations with the East German Government;and the position of Western Germany would remain unchanged.A settlement on these lines would imply the continuing partition ofGermany and would therefore need to be presented with care to public opinion in Germany. But it could also be represented asinvolving no sacrifice of principle by the Western Powers; and, by removing an immediate threat to peace, it might prepare the way for a solution of the other major issues on which the Governmentsof the free world and the Soviet Union were at present divided.The Cabinet -(1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to circulate a record of thediscussions held with the Soviet leaders in Moscow, and memoranda on the questions of policy and procedure which would need to be discussed with the United StatesGovernment during the forthcoming visit of the PrimeMinister and the Foreign Secretary to Washington.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of these problems at ameeting on 11th March.
territorial waters.(previous references:C.C. (59) 4thConclusions,Minute 6, andC.C. (58) 86thConclusions,Minute 3.)IcelandicFisheryLimits.4. The Foreign Secretary said that, in accordance with thenormal pattern of seasonal fishing, the British fishing fleet had recently been moved under naval protection from the east coast of Iceland to two havens on the south and west coasts. These areas were already crowded with Icelandic fishing vessels and there was some risk that incidents might occur. Steps had been taken, however,both by the British Trawlers Federation and by the Commodore ofour Fisheries Protection Squadron, to ensure that our own vesselsrefrained from provocative behaviour; and the Icelandic Governmenthad been invited to put forward any suggestions of their own to preserve orderly fishing.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,4th March, 1959.
