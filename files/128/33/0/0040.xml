Association.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 39thConclusions,Minute 1.)The Danish delegation had not accepted our offer to remove the bacon tariff in three annual stages beginning on 1st July, 1960,but had pressed strongly for it to be withdrawn as to half on 1st July,1960, and as to the remaining half on 1st July, 1961. They were evidently under instructions to insist that the withdrawal of the tariffshould be in not more than two stages, and there was no doubt thatthis was a matter to which they attached great importance.As regards the assurance, the Danes were unwilling to accepta statement of our intention not to adopt policies likely to denyDanish producers the opportunity to maintain their trade in our market or to share in any increase in our market if this was expressed to be &quot; subject to &quot; the Governments obligations to home producers.They took the view that this formula would be construed by Danishagricultural interests as a worthless assurance. It might be possibleto overcome this difficulty if we were to use some such phrase as&quot; within the framework of these obligations.&quot; Alternatively, wecould say that the Government had obligations to home producers,particularly those arising from the .1947 and 1957 Agriculture Acts,&quot; by which they were bound.&quot;The Cabinet first discussed the wording of the assurance. Itwas the general view that it was essential to make it clear that theGovernment were bound by their obligations to home producers.If this were done, it would be justifiable to give the Danes a generalassurance of the sort they wanted. It was accordingly agreed thatthe assurance should be offered in the following terms: &quot; TheUnited Kingdom Ministers referred to their obligations to homeproducers and particularly to those arising from the 1947 and 1957Agriculture Acts, by which they are bound. The United KingdomGovernment, recognising the traditional nature of the trade relationsbetween Denmark and the United Kingdom, did not intend to adoptpolicies likely to deny Danish producers the opportunity to maintain their market in the United Kingdom for commodities of concern tothem or to share in any increase in the United Kingdom market for those products.&quot; Although this formula would be represented to the Danes as a concession, it was in fact preferable to the wordingwhich the Cabinet had previously authorised.It was pointed out that the form of words which had alreadybeen offered to the Danes in the negotiations, in response to their request for an undertaking that a removal of the bacon tariff wouldnot be frustrated by subsidies, appeared to go further than the&apos;general assurance which the Cabinet had now approved. As it stood the undertaking did not sufficiently reserve the Governmentsfull right to determine pig production policy. After discussion, itwas agreed that it would be necessary to induce the Danes to accepta revised form of undertaking in the following terms i &quot; UnitedKingdom Ministers reserved their right to determine annually the guaranteed prices for pigs, with due regard inter alia to changes in costs. But they agreed to recommend that subsidy policy should notbe used with a view to rendering nugatory the opportunity given toDanish producers in the United Kingdom market under thisagreement.&quot;As regards the bacon tariff, while it would be preferable forthis to be removed in three stages, the difference between this and commercial The Paymaster-General said that he and the Minister ofPolicy. Agriculture had now held further negotiations with the DanishEuropean Trade delegation, in the course of which they had offered the concessions which had been authorised by the Cabinet on the previous day.There were two points on which it had not yet been possible to reach agreement-the period over which the bacon tariff would be withdrawn, and the form of the assurance to the Danes about their share of the United Kingdom market for agricultural products.
a removal in two stages was not of decisive importance from thepoint of view of its presentation to opinion in this country. On theother hand, a longer period would be useful in meeting the justifiableapprehensions of the bacon-curing industry. It was the general viewof the Cabinet that, on balance, the negotiations should not beallowed to fail on this point alone. We should still try to obtainDanish agreement to the removal of the bacon tariff in three stages;but we could in the last resort agree to its removal in two stagesif it were possible to secure Danish agreement to the revised forms ofthe general assurance and the undertaking not to frustrate theremoval of the bacon tariff.The Cabinet next considered the question of relaxing therestrictions on the import of Canadian bacon. They were informedthat it was likely that considerable advantage would be taken ofany relaxation, since the Canadian authorities had now lowered their support price. As a result, the complete removal of all quantitative restrictions might lead to imports of Canadian bacon at a level whichwould be damaging to domestic interests. It would therefore be preferable for any relaxation to take the form of a dollar quota of,say, 10,000 tons. While a quota might be regarded as inappropriatein our present financial circumstances, it ought nevertheless to besufficient to hold the position for the time being. The canadian government could be told that we would consider a more extensiverelaxation of the restrictions in the light of further experience. Itshould also be made clear to the Canadian Government that any relaxation would in any case be conditional on the successful conclusion of the negotiations at Stockholm for a European trade association.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Agriculture and the Paymaster-General, in their further negotiations with the Danishdelegation, to secure agreement to the revised forms ofa general assurance and an undertaking as regards baconwhich had been approved in the discussion.(2) Authorised the Minister of Agriculture and the Paymaster-General, if necessary and provided that agreement were reached on the revised forms of the assurance andundertaking referred to in Conclusion (1), to offer toremove the bacon tariff in two annual stages beginningon 1st July, 1960.(3) Invited the Minister of Agriculture and the Paymaster-General to report the result of their further negotiations to the Prime Minister and the Lord Privy Seal, with aview to deciding whether any announcement should bemade to Parliament.(4) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to arrange, if thenegotiations with the Danish delegation were successful,for the Canadian Government to be informed that a quota for dollar bacon of 10,000 tons would be authorisedif an agreement for a European Trade Association weresigned,Cabinet Office, S.W.1,8th July, 1959.
