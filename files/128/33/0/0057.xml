Kenya. 2.   The Colonial Secretary said that he now had reasonable(Previous grounds for hoping for a steady improvement in conditions in Kenya,Reference: and the new Governor was anxious to bring the state of emergency toC.C.

It would still be necessary to keep in detention the hard coreConclusions, of Mau Mau and other terrorists who could not yet be released. for minute 2.) this purpose a special Bill would be introduced into the KenyaSecurity Legislative Council to maintain the necessary controls over some ofPowers and the terrorists at present detained and a number of listed fugitives stillthe Act of at large. Subject to this, the Governor was prepared to relinquishGrace. his present emergency powers of detention and restriction.   At thesame time he would also relinquish other emergency powers, including those to prescribe publications, to impose emergency communallabour and to control the movement of the Kikuyu.In order to provide the necessary safeguards against the risks which this new policy would involve, legislation would also beintroduced in Kenya under which the Governor, after giving duepublic notice, would be enabled to take such measures for thepreservation of public security as appeared to be required by the exigencies of the situation. In present circumstances the governor would introduce under this legislation only those security measuresneeded to maintain stricter controls than existed in permanent lawover public meetings and over the registration of political associations.Although the Governor would be able under the new legislation toassume powers to detain without trial and to enforce communallabour, he would not do so unless the situation were to deteriorateto such an extent as to make this justifiable and then only after givingdue public notice.In addition to the revocation of the emergency and theintroduction of this new legislation, the Governor would announcehis intention, by the use of the prerogative, to release fromimprisonment about 2,500 people who had committed offencesconnected with the emergency. About 120 of these who had been convicted of serious crimes would remain in detention but wouldbecome eligible for rehabilitation and for eventual release. Sixloyalist Africans who had been convicted of offences against people in detention would similarly be released under this act of grace.All these measures were being announced by the governor of Kenya that day. It was understood that the Attorney-Generalof Kenya had decided, in view of the new measures, not to institutefurther proceedings in respect of offences already committed whichwere connected with the emergency.These decisions were to be announced in a statement to be madein both Houses of Parliament that afternoon. A draft of this statement was circulated at the Cabinefs meeting. In discussion ofit various amendments were suggested and approved.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Colonial Secretary&apos;sstatement on the relaxation of emergency powers, and thedeclaration of an amnesty, in Kenya.(2) Approved, subject to the amendments agreed upon in their discussion, the terms of the announcement on these measures which was to be made in both Houses ofParliament that afternoon.Parliament 1.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.
Federation of rhodesia and nyasaland.(previous references:C.C. (59) 43rdConclusions,Minute 1 andC.C. (59) 42ndConclusions,Minute 2.)advisory commission.3. The Commonwealth Secretary recalled that it had beenagreed with the Governments of the Federation of Rhodesia and nyasaland and of its constituent territories that the Central AfricanAdvisory Commission should include members representing the local governments not less in number than those representing the UnitedKingdom and the Commonwealth. The six Privy Counsellors whowere to be included among the United Kingdom representatives hadnot yet been selected; but it was hoped that all the remainingmembers, including five native African members, would within a short time have agreed to serve.In discussion it was agreed that, as soon as the remainingmembership had been finally settled, a further invitation should besent to the Leader of the Opposition, asking him to suggest the names of Privy Counsellors from the Labour Party who might be appointedto the Commission. There was some chance that the opposition would now be prepared to co-operate; but they might well object thatthe native membership was not representative, and that the terms ofreference were too narrow. The African members had in fact beenchosen with a view to their being acceptable, not only to those whom they would represent, but also to the Opposition; but it would alsobe possible to point out that the Commission would be empoweredto receive evidence from anyone who wished to submit it. As regardsthe terms of reference, the Government could argue that, since theCommission was in preparation for the review provided by the 1953Act, it was inevitable that it should work within the limits of thatAct; but it would not be possible in practice to prevent witnesses fromputting forward in evidence the case for alternatives to federation.It was suggested that it would be helpful if native African opinion,which was now inclined to favour Labour Party participation in theCommission, could be encouraged to make these views known.It was the general view of the Cabinet that, if the Oppositionrefused to participate in this enquiry, the Government, should nevertheless proceed with it. In that event it would be necessary togive further consideration to the way in which the Privy Counsellorswho were to be nominated by the Leader of the Opposition shouldbe chosen.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would invite the leader of the Opposition to suggest the names of three of the privy Counsellors for appointment to the Central AfricanAdvisory Commission as soon as all the other proposedmembers had agreed to serve.(2) Agreed that, if the Opposition refused to participate in thework of the Commission, the Government should nevertheless proceed with this project.United Nations. 4 The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ForeignFrench Nuclear Secretary (C. (59) 166) on the current debate in the General AssemblyTests. of the United Nations about the nuclear test which the French(Previous       Government proposed to carry out in the Sahara.Reference: jy7e Foreign Secretary said that eighteen Afro-Asian countriesC.C. (59) 56th had now tabled a resolution in extreme terms calling on the FrenchConclusions, Government to refrain from carrying out this test. The Latin-Minute 3.) American countries were proposing a number of amendments whichwould make this resolution considerably more moderate. Meanwhile,in accordance with the Cabinets earlier decision, the United kingdom representative had tabled an alternative resolution which requestedFrance to take full account of the views expressed in the debate and expressed the hope that France would associate herself with thearrangements which might be worked out to achieve the suspension of nuclear weapons tests under effective international control. Itwas likely that voting on these resolutions would take place later that
government expenditure.(previous references:C.C. (59) 47thConclusions,Minute 6 andC.C. (59) 41stConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (59) 165) on estimates of government expenditure for the year 1960-61.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that forecasts ofGovernment expenditure for 1960-61 were in total 7 per cent, higherthan the estimate of expenditure in the current year, as comparedwith a 5 per cent, increase of the current over the preceding year.While the increases contemplated for 1960-61 were in large partattributable to policy decisions for which there had been a widedemand among the Governments supporters, it must be recognisedthat the 7 per cent, aggregate increase in expenditure compared withan estimated increase of only 4 per cent, in the gross national product.Moreover it would not be matched by an increase in revenue sufficientto allow the Government to pursue their policy of reducing taxation.When the Cabinet had considered the previous forecast, they had asked all Ministers in charge of Departments to scrutinise their estimates with a view to reducing expenditure wherever possible.This later forecast made the need for this the greater. It wasspecially desirable that Estimates should be critically scrutinisedbefore they were submitted to the Treasury, in order that thedifficulties of effecting reductions at a late stage, when there was insufficient time to consider the problems involved, might be avoided.day, but it was inevitable that the Afro-Asian resolution, either in itsoriginal form or with some amendments, would be put to the vote) before the United Kingdom resolution.   It was therefore necessaryto instruct our representative how to vote on the Afro-Asianresolution. He must plainly have regard to the attitude of othercountries. It was likely that Canada, and perhaps Norway and denmark, would abstain from voting on the Afro-Asian resolution.The United States Government had so far failed to give any definitelead, but it was likely that they would vote against the resolution inits original form. Italy and Belgium, and probably the other partnersof France in the Economic Commission for Europe, would alsovote against that resolution, and so would Portugal.&apos; In thesecircumstances, it would cause deep resentment in France if we wereto fail to vote against the Afro-Asian resolution in its original form.On the other hand if that resolution were, by amendments, madeconsiderably more moderate, it might be possible to persuade Francethat it was in her best interests for her friends and allies to abstain from voting on it.Discussion showed that there was general agreement that, if the afro-Asian resolution were put to a vote in its extreme form, it wason balance preferable for the United Kingdom representative to vote against it. In that event, it would be important that, when he explained the United Kingdom position, he should emphasise our understanding of the anxieties which had been aroused in african countries. It was also the general view of the Cabinet that, if a considerably more moderate form of the Afro-Asian resolution were put to a vote, the best course would be to arrange for countriesfriendly to French interests to abstain from voting on it. If we couldsucceed in ensuring that some of France&apos;s partners in the economic commission for Europe abstained, we could then expect that we might also be able to abstain without arousing appreciable resentmentin France.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to instruct the UnitedKingdom representative at the United Nations in the senseindicated by their discussion.
In discussion it was recognised that it was not yet possible to be certain that the economy of the country had demonstrated its capacity to expand without the re-emergence of inflationary pressures, itwould be necessary to keep a close watch on price-levels and on expenditure on imports. The expansion of production which was now in progress might well continue for a further twelve months,with a further reduction in unemployment. On the other hand, insome industries, technological progress might result in increasing productivity with a decreasing labour force which would tend tomaintain the general level of unemployment.In further discussion attention was drawn to the estimated increase of  27 millions in the cost of the National Health Service,which already amounted to about 18 per cent, of all Government-supply expenditure on the civil side. The methods of financing theService had already been examined by Ministers earlier in the year,and the conclusion had then been reached that the only practicablemeans of securing a major reduction in its cost would be to increasethe weekly contribution. This would in any case be necessary ifthere were to be any question of abolishing or reducing the charges,but it would make more difficult any increase in retirement pensionsand the consequent increase in National Insurance contributions.Summing up the discussion the Prime Minister said that theinformation available appeared to give no ground at present for anychange in the Governmenfs general economic policy. It would,however, be necessary to keep the the position under review and todo everything possible to reduce the estimates of expenditure for1960-61. The possibility of modifying the financial structure of theNational Health Service should be further examined in relation to proposals for an increase in retirement and other pensions.The Cabinet (1) Took note of C. (59) 165.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would call on all departmental Ministers to scrutinise their Estimates witha view to reducing expenditure wherever possible.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for themethods of financing the National Health Service to befurther considered.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,10th November, 1959.
