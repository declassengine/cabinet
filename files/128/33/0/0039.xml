Commercial 1.   jjie Paymaster-General said that, when the Cabinet had0 Policy. agreed that the Swedish proposals for a European Trade Association(Previous       (E.T.A.)  should  be  pursued,  they  had  recognised  that  someReferences:     concessions in the United Kingdom market would have to be offeredC.C. (59) 38th   to Denmark. On the previous day he and the Minister of AgricultureConclusions,    had resumed negotiations with a Danish delegation on the basis of minute 7 and  instructions approved by the Prime Minister and the MinistersC.C. (59) 30th   directly concerned.   This delegation had made it plain that their conclusions,    Government now wished to find a means by which Denmark couldMinute 6.)      join the proposed ETA.  But the project was.unwelcome to publicEuropean Trade opinion in Denmark, to the agricultural interests and to theAssociation.    Opposition parties and, in order to win a sufficient measure of support for it, the Danish Government wouid need to be able to show thatthey had secured some substantial concessions. We had so far offered to remove the tariff on Danish bacon by five equal annual instalmentsbeginning on 1st July, i960.   We had confirmed the undertaking given in 1956 that Denmark would have a right to supply a guaranteedproportion of our imports if at any time we were to regulate importsof foreign bacon by quotas; and we had also undertaken not to use our subsidy policy in such a way as to deprive the Danes of the opportunities in our market which they might hope to secure as aresult of the progressive removal of the tariff.   In addition to a concession on blue-veined cheese, we had now offered to remove thetariff on canned cream and to increase the quota for processed milk.The Danes wanted the tariff on bacon to be removed forthwith-; they proposed that the tariff on luncheon meat should be removed; andthey also asked for some general assurance that we would not prevent them from obtaining a fair share in our market for agricultural products.   If we were to reach agreement with them, we should probably have to make some further concession on the phasing ofthe withdrawal of the bacon tariff, to offer to remove the tariff onluncheon meat, and to make a statement of our intention to recognisethat Danish producers should have the opportunity of keeping their share in our market.The Cabinet first considered the possibility of accelerating thewithdrawal of the bacon tariff. The bacon industry in this country would point to the fact that the ETA. project envisaged a period often years for the withdrawal of tariffs on industrial products. Onthe other hand, the real protection for United Kingdom pig producerslay in the guaranteed price, which would be maintained. It wouldbe the bacon curing industry, rather than pig producers, which wouldbe adversely affected by the removal of the tariff, if that led to anincrease in imports of Danish bacon. It was, however, by no means certain that there would be an appreciable increase in such imports.Bearing in mind the importance of making an offer to the Daneswhich would be regarded as fair by the other Scandinavian countries,it would be advisable to offer to remove the bacon tariff progressivelyover a shorter period than five years. The best course might be tooffer to remove the tariff in three annual stages, but not necessarilyby equal instalments, beginning or. 1st July, 1960.The Commonwealth Secretary said that there would be criticism from the Canadian Government if we undertook to remove the tariff on Danish bacon, while retaining the existing restrictions on theimport of Canadian bacon.0 As regards luncheon meat, it was the general view of the Cabinetthat we should offer the progressive removal of the tariff on luncheonmeat in step with the removal of the tariff on bacon. the disadvantage of this for Irish producers could be accepted, since our trade agreement with the Irish Republic was very favourable to them.
The Minister of Agriculture said that, as regards a generalassurance, the Danish delegation had asked for an undertaking thatthe United Kingdom would conduct its policies in such a way as tofacilitate increased trade in the agricultural products in whichDenmark had an export interest. A wide assurance of this sort wouldnot be acceptable. It would be necessary to make it clear that there could be no undertaking about the outcome of future agriculturalprice reviews. But, if this were made clear, it might still be possibleto find a form of words which would go some way to meet the wishes of the Danish delegation.In further discussion it was suggested that it might be preferable to avoid giving any such assurance at this stage to the Danes, since we might need to make a general statement of the same character in subsequent negotiations, either with the other members of the stockholm group, or possibly in later negotiations between the stockholm group and the countries of the European common market. It was argued, on the other hand, that a separateundertaking to the Danes could be justified on account of the special importance of agriculture to Denmark&apos;s economy. After further discussion it was agreed that the Danish delegation might be offered a statement of intention in the following form: &quot; The UnitedKingdom Ministers stated that they could not give any undertakingabout the outcome of future agricultural price reviews. Subject tothis and to the obligations of the United Kingdom Government totheir home producers, which the Danish Ministers recognised, theUnited Kingdom Ministers said that, in view of their traditional trade relations with Denmark, they did not intend to adopt policies likelyto deny Danish producers the opportunity to maintain their trade inthe United Kingdom market for commodities of primary concern to them or to share in any increase in the United Kingdom market for these products.&quot;The Prime Minister said that it might be that, as a result of thefurther concessions which the Cabinet had now authorised, thenegotiations with the Danish delegation would result in an agreement.This would not become effective unless the subsequent negotiations in Stockholm led to the establishment of an ETA. If agreement were reached with the Danish delegation, it was inevitable that itsdetails would become public. It would in that event be expedient that the Government should deploy the whole of their case for making these concessions in order to obtain the advantages of the ETA. Itshould be. made clear that any agreement with the Danes was conditional on the outcome of the negotiations for an ETA.Although there would be criticism from the interests affected, it was better that the limited nature of the concessions should be understoodrather than that there should be more general apprehensions affectingthe whole of the agricultural industry. If, on the other hand, thepresent negotiations with the Danes were to fail, it would still benecessary for the Government to disclose, and to justify, the concessions which had been offered. The Paymaster-General and theMinister of Agriculture, in consultation with the Lord President andthe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, should therefore take allpossible steps to ensure that the Governments case was fullypresented to the Governments supporters in the House of commons and to the public.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Agriculture and the Paymaster-General to offer, in their resumed negotiations with the danish delegation, the further concessions which hadbeen approved in the Cabinets discussion.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Commonwealth Secretary and the Minister ofAgriculture, to consider urgently the question of relaxing the restrictions on the import of Canadian bacon.
Parliament. 2.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.Shipping 3,   xhe Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerindustry. of Transport (C. (59) 110) on the replacement of the Cunard linersCunard Liners. Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 17thConclusions.Minute 6.)The Minister of Transport said that the Chairman of the cunard company had now had discussions with the shipbuilding firm ofJohn Brown and Company and as a result had provided some furtherinformation about a possible replacement for the Queen Mary. Theinformation was not very satisfactory for example, it did notconclusively establish a case for a replacement ship of the same size-and it would not be possible to work out satisfactory financial arrangements on the basis of the project put forward by the cunard company. There was increasing anxiety about the future prospects of the shipbuilding industry, and there would undoubtedly becompeting pressure from a number of shipbuilding areas for the contract. In these circumstances the Government might be well-advised to seek independent advice on the project; and he suggestedthat a small committee might be appointed for this purpose, consistingperhaps of a prominent industrialist, a retired shipowner, and a lawyeror a chartered accountant.In discussion some doubt was expressed about the expediency of this course. In the end, it would be for the Government to decideboth where a replacement ship should be built and what arrangements should be made for Exchequer assistance. The appointment of acommittee might stimulate pressure in Parliament from therepresentatives of the various shipbuilding areas. It might be preferable to inform the Chairman of the Cunard Company that theGovernment would need further time to consider his proposals. Onthe other hand, there were technical matters, particularly the questionof the size of the replacement ship, and perhaps alternative arrangements for ownership, on which independent advice would be helpful.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it wasevidently the general view of the Cabinet that an independent committee should not be appointed at once. This was a step thatmight be taken just before the summer recess, when a statement mightbe made to the effect that the Government agreed in principle thatthis Transatlantic service should be maintained, but that, in view ofthe important financial and economic considerations involved, theGovernment were proposing to seek independent advice on certain aspects of the problem.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Transport, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister of Labour, theMinister of Power and the First Lord of the Admiralty, to(3) Invited the Minister of Agriculture and the Paymaster-0 General, in consultation with the Chancellor of theExchequer, the Lord President and the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, to make all necessary arrangementsfor the presentation of the Governments case for offeringagricultural concessions to Denmark.
give further consideration to the scope of an independent enquiry into the project for the replacement of the Cunardliners Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth, and to circulate a memorandum to the Cabinet for discussion before the endof July.North 4.   The Foreign Secretary said that the United States andAtlantic French Governments had not been able to agree on arrangementsAlliance        for maintaining in France the stockpiles of nuclear weapons which(Previous       were necessary for the effective employment of nine squadrons ofReference :      United States strike aircraft which were stationed there as part of theC.C. (57) 85th   forces of the North Atlantic Alliance.    The  Supreme  AlliedConclusions,    Commander, Europe, had therefore proposed, with the approval of minute 5.)      the United States Government, that three of these squadrons, withRedeployment  nuc&apos;ear capability, should be moved from France to the Unitedof United States Kingdom, and that four reconnaissance squadrons, without nuclearAir Squadrons  caPability, should also be moved to the United Kingdom fromGermany, where they would be replaced by other United Statessquadrons from France with nuclear capability.  If we refused this request it would further damage the North Atlantic Alliance, whichhad already been shaken by the French attitude.   The deployment of seven additional United States squadrons in the United kingdom would be of substantial economic benefit to this country. The UnitedStates Government had confirmed that the existing arrangements for joint consultation between the United States and United kingdom governments over the use of bases in the United Kingdom in anemergency would apply to these additional squadrons.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in general agreementwith the proposed move of these United States squadrons to thiscountry. It should, however, be made clear that they would besubject to the arrangements for joint consultation which alreadyapplied to all United States aircraft in the United Kingdom; and anofficial statement to this effect should be issued by the Ministry ofDefence as soon as the move was announced by the North atlantic council. This statement could also indicate that the detailed arrangements for the move were being made between the Royal AirForce and the United States authorities.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for the north atlantic Council to be informed that the United Kingdomagreed that seven additional United States air squadronsshould be stationed in this country as part of the forcesof the Alliance.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence to arrange for an official statement to be issued by his Department, on the lines indicated in discussion, as soon as an announcement wasmade by the North Atlantic Council.industrial disputes..Printing.(previous reference :C.C. (59) 38thConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Minister of Labour said that he was continuing to try to effect a settlement of that part of the dispute in the printingindustry which affected the supply of printing ink. It was possible,but by no means certain, that the national and London eveningnewspapers, which had been expected to have to cease production onthe following day, might be able to continue production until theend of the week.In the main dispute in the printing industry neither the employersnor the unions appeared willing as yet to make any concession, andthey would be unlikely to do so until the effect of financial pressurebegan to be felt. Meanwhile, he did not propose to intervene further.
Cabinet Office, S.W. I,7th July, 1959.In discussion it was agreed that the steps already taken on behalfof the Government should be sufficient to avoid any charge ofindifference to the effects of this dispute. It was, however, unfortunate that the public should be so little aware of the issues underlying thedispute and of the substantial difference between wages and earnings in the industry, and in particular among the printing staff of newspapers.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour.
