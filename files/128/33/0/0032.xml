.    . CM. 32 (59)Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the two weeks after the end of the whitsun recess.Soviet Union. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the circumstances in whichMrs. Dmitrieva. Mrs. Nina Dmitrieva, the wife of an Assistant Naval Attache at theSoviet Embassy in London, was seeking political asylum in thiscountry. From discussions with her and with officials of the SovietEmbassy it had emerged that she had been- influenced more bymatrimonial difficulties than by political motives. She was, however,determined not to return to the Soviet Union; and her action indissociating herself from the Soviet Embassy would render her liableto heavy penalties there. In these circumstances the Cabinet agreedthat, if she made a definite request for political asylum in this country,it would be difficult to refuse it. And it might be expedient, in orderto reduce the risk of continuing publicity, to extend to her the sort of facilities for assisting her to maintain herself in this country whichwere normally reserved for persons who defected for political reasonsfrom countries within the Soviet bloc. On the other hand, with aview to avoiding damage to Anglo-Soviet relations, there might be advantage in making it clear, in any public statement, that her decisionto remain in this country had been taken mainly for personal reasons.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs to concert with the Home Secretary the terms of any public statement on the grant of political asylum in this country toMrs. Dmitrieva.Anglo-Soviet 3.  The Cabinet took note of the outcome of the negotiationsTrade. which the President of the Board of Trade had conducted in Moscow(Previous for an expansion of Anglo-Soviet trade. The agreement reached was reference: likely to lead to a modest increase in trade which would be ofC.C. (59) 23rd advantage to both countries.  It had been reasonably well receivedConclusions, by public opinion in the United Kingdom, and was not likely toMmute 3.) provoke serious criticism in Allied countries.Germany.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 28thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Cabinet reviewed the course of the discussions on germany at the Geneva meeting of Foreign Ministers. Thepreliminary procedural arguments had been somewhat protracted,and in the formal opening statements there had seemed to be littlecommon ground between the views of the Soviet Union and those ofthe Western Allies. This stage of the proceedings had now, however,been completed; and it was to be hoped that, when the conference was resumed at the end of the week, more recourse would be had to private and informal meetings, which offered a better prospect ofmaking progress.In discussion attention was drawn to the risk that a difficultpolitical situation might arise in this country if it were thought thatthe chances of a settlement on Berlin were being prejudiced by toorigid an insistence on progress towards the reunification of Germany.A substantial number of people in this country would prefer thatGermany should continue to be divided, at any rate for some years tocome. The strength of this opinion should not be overlooked.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.
Education.voluntary schools.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 31stConclusions,Minute 4.)*5. The Cabinet resumed their discussion on the proposed newrate of grant for building work on voluntary schools.The sole question now at issue was whether it would be more advantageous politically to proceed with legislation in the current session or to issue a statement that the Government intended tointroduce legislation in the next Session. Discussion showed that thebalance of opinion in the Cabinet was in favour of the former course.There was reason to think that the Bill would be acceptable to theGovernments supporters in Parliament and that it would receivesubstantial support from the other two political parties. widespread and damaging religious controversy was less likely if theGovernments proposals were passed quickly into law than if theissue continued to remain open. Moreover, delay would give an impression of indecision on the part of the Government; and this,while it would do little to mitigate the opposition of the FreeChurches, might lead the Roman Catholic Church, who wereprepared to accept the present proposals, to press for a more extensivescheme of assistance to voluntary schools.It was, however, desirable that a further attempt should be madeto bring the Free Churches to acquiesce in the proposals. It couldbe demonstrated to them that the dual system of education was to bemaintained but not extended. It should be made clear that thepayment of grant on new secondary schools would be limited tothose strictly required for the education of children who were atpresent in denominational primary schools. Much of the opposition might be assuaged if it were understood that the new grant wouldnot be payable on secondary schools provided to match furtherdenominational primary schools built at some time in the future.In further discussion it was pointed out that time could probablybe found for the passage of the Bill during the current Session,although in certain circumstances this might involve abandoningsome Bills which were to be introduced in the House of Lords. Itwould therefore be preferable to make no announcement of theGovernments intention to proceed with the Education Bill (whichwas ready for introduction) during the present Session until more was known of the progress of the Parliamentary programme.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that legislation should be introduced during the current Session to extend the system of grants for the building of denominational schools.(2) Agreed that for the time being no announcement on thissubject should be made.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation with theLord Privy Seal and the Chief Whip, would decide thedate on which the Bill should be introduced.Klaus Fuchs. 6.  The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (59) 89) on the impending release of Klaus Fuchs, whowould complete in June the sentence of imprisonment imposed on him in 1950 for offences under the Official Secrets Acts.The Home Secretary said that Fuchs had indicated that, after his release from prison, he would wish to join his father in Leipzig.There was no effective way of preventing him from doing this: he wasno longer in possession of any secret information which would be useful to an enemy: and it was proposed to give him such facilities as were necessary to enable him to travel to East Germany.  It was
CM. 32 (59)recommended that a statement to this effect should be made, in replyto a Parliamentary Question, in the terms of the draft annexed toC. (59) 89.The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that this might giverise to critical comment in some circles in the United States. It wasnot, however, likely to provoke any formal protest from the UnitedStates Government, who had already been warned that Fuchs might go to East Germany and understood that we: had no effective meansof preventing him from doing so. It might however be preferableif the proposed statement followed the line that, as Fuchs had been deprived of his British nationality, it would not be for the UnitedKingdom Government to determine where he should live after hisdischarge from prison.The Cabinet Took note of C. (59) 89; and authorised the Home Secretaryto arrange for an announcement to be made in the terms ofthe draft annexed to the memorandum, subject to theamendment proposed by the Minister of State for ForeignAffairs.Coal.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 47thConclusions,Minute 4.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Power (C. (59) 90) on the problems facing the coal industry.The Minister of Power said that, although the total demand forfuel in the United Kingdom had not fallen in 1958, despite the lower level of industrial activity, the demand for coal had fallen on accountof the increasing use of oil. The percentage of coal consumed, inrelation to total fuel requirements, had dropped from 93 per cent, in1938 to 80 per cent, in 1958 and the percentage of oil had risen from per cent, to 19 per cent. In the light of this increasing use of oil the National Coal Board &quot;were revising their estimate of the futuredemand for coal. Their provisional assessment, after allowing for a recovery in industrial activity and for increasing demands frompower stations, was that demand in 1965 would be about 210 million tons, including coal for export, and that over the next year or so itwould probably not exceed 200 million tons. It was estimated that about 208 million tons would be produced in 1959, and this would entail a substantial addition to the high level of undistributed stocks.The National Union of Mineworkers, with the support of theOpposition, favoured the adoption of protectionist measures,including a tax on fuel oil. The Chairman of the Coal Board, whohad hitherto considered that the coal industry should make itselfcompetitive with other fuels, had now suggested that, in order to stimulate demand, the price of East Midland small coals for sale inthe south of England and the price of Durham gas coals should bereduced by 5s. Od. a ton. He proposed, however, that this should be offset by increasing the price of coals for sale in Scotland by 5s. 9d. aton; or that, if this were not acceptable, the market for coal should be safeguarded by procuring an agreement with the oil companies to restrict any increase in the use of fuel oil for a period of two years.A tax on oil would weaken the competitive efficiency of Britishindustry, and would damage the overseas position of the oil companies. Indeed, any restriction on the increasing use of oil fuelwould have serious repercussions, both on our foreign relations,especially with the countries of the Middle East, and on our balanceof payments. . * wi o        \If the policy of freedom of choice for the consumer were continued, the coal industry must contract.- This would entail aphased programme for closing pits and discontinuing opencast
production.   On the other hand, new power - stations were beingdesigned for coal burning, and the programme for building nuclear power stations was being examined in order to increase generating^demand for coal as far as possible. UThere was room for a comprehensive revision of the existingprice structure. But the particular proposals made by the Chairmanof the Coal Board were commercially unsound and too discriminatory.The Minister therefore proposed to inform the Chairman that theGovernment could not accept these proposals or the suggestion of restrictions on the use of oil, and that it was not possible to considerthe long-term problems of the coal industry until the Board had completed their reappraisal.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Further consideration should be given to the cost ofcancelling contracts for opencast mining on sites where operations hadnot actually been started.(b) Coal was our main raw material. There were obviousstrategic dangers in becoming unduly dependent on imported oil. Thepossibility of some form of protection for the coal industry ought not,therefore, to be completely excluded.(c) It was important to press on with scientific research into theuse of coal and the development of coal derivatives, including oil.(d) In view of the continuing increase in stocks, it might be right,as part of a comprehensive review, to reduce coal prices, even though this involved some immediate loss to the Coal Board, if this wouldstimulate a continuing demand.Summing up the discussion, The Prime Minister said that, in thespecial circumstances of the coal industry, the Governments fuel policy ought not to be based on too rigid an application of a policyof freedom of choice. It should rather be determined by practical considerations. The longer term problems of the industry should be examined by the Economic Policy Committee as soon as the coal board had completed their review of future demand and theprogramme for the rationalisation of the industry which this wouldinvolve. The Chairman of the Board should be informed that thediscriminatory price changes which he had suggested were not acceptable in advance of comprehensive proposals for improving thecoal price structure, and that the alternative proposal for a limitation on the home demand for oil was not practicable. Meanwhile,opencast mining operations should be ended as soon as was possiblehaving regard to the cost of cancelling existing contracts.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of Power to inform the Chairman of theNational Coal Board that the proposals described inparagraph 6 of C. (59) 90 were unacceptable.(2) Invited the Minister of Power to consider the possibility thatthe run-down of the opencast programme might be accelerated by cancelling some contracts for sites on whichoperations had not been begun.(3) Invited the Minister of Power to circulate in due course amemorandum on the longer-term problems of the coalindustry, for consideration by the Economic PolicyCommittee.0
