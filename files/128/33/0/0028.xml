2. The Foreign Secretary made a report to the Cabinet on themeeting which the Foreign Ministers of the Western Powers had heldin Paris during the previous week in preparation for the widerinternational negotiations on Germany which were to open in geneva on 11th May. Agreement had been reached on the initial positionto be taken up by the Western Powers at the outset of the Genevameeting. This would be a more flexible negotiating position than we had maintained in 1955, and its formulation was such as to leave it open to us to put forward, as the negotiations proceeded, the ideaswhich we had canvassed in earlier discussions with our Allies. Itwas not to be expected that this initial position would be accepted bythe Soviet Government; but no attempt had yet been made to identify the concessions which the Western Powers might be willing to makein order to reach an agreed settlement. On this the delegations atGeneva would be influenced by the development of the negotiations,in the course of which there would be opportunities for them to seekfurther instructions from their Governments.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.3. The Foreign Secretary said that there was some tendency to criticise our acceptance of the Egyptian Governments conditions forthe establishment of a British mission in Cairo. He proposed to counter this by pointing out that the mission would be able to makea start in carrying out the agreement and that we might expect itsfacilities to be improved as its business expanded. He would,however, impress on Mr. Black, the Chairman of the international bank, our dissatisfaction with the arrangements made by the egyptian government. Mr. Black had influence with the Egyptian Governmentand might be able to secure some improved facilities for the mission.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.4. The Foreign Secretary said that, if Communist pressure onIraq increased, it might result in civil war and a breakdown ofgovernment. Anti-Communist countries in the Middle East might then be tempted to intervene; and in that event the Soviet Unionmight feel bound to take some counter-action, probably in Persia.He was therefore keeping in close touch with those of our Allies whowere closely concerned, especially the United States, with the aim ofsecuring that other countries would refrain from intervening in Iraq.The Cabinet were informed that our oil supplies would not be seriously threatened unless Kuwait were affected. The Ruler of Kuwait was apprehensive about the situation in Iraq and had askedfor an assurance of our help in case of need. This had been given;and it should enable us more effectively to concert plans for the germany.(previous references:C.C. (59) 26thConclusions,Minute 1 andC.C.

These had beenunusually detailed and suggested that there had been some disclosure of official information. He had asked the Secretary of the Cabinetto enquire into this. Meanwhile, he reminded his colleagues of theneed to take all practicable precautions to prevent the premature disclosure of Government decisions.
protection of Kuwait and of our oil interests there. There was every reason to hope that we would have full United States co-operation inthe protection of Western interests in the Persian Gulf in the event of serious trouble in the Middle East.The Cabinet agreed that, if there were a breakdown ofgovernment in Iraq, it would be important to show that all possibleprecautions had been taken to safeguard British interests in theMiddle East.The Cabinet Approved the general policy outlined by the foreign secretary for preventing the situation in Iraq fromdeveloping into a wider conflict.aircraft industry.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 87thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (C. (59) 79) on the question of Government financial support for a British type of aircraft to replace the Dakota.The Prime Minister said that a decision to give financial support to an aircraft of this kind would involve a departure from theGovernments declared policy of concentrating their financial support for the aircraft industry on research and major new technical projects.It was therefore appropriate that this question should be decided bythe Cabinet. If the Cabinet agreed that financial support shouldbe given to a British replacement for the Dakota, it would then benecessary to decide which type, or types, should be supported and by what means the support should be given.The Minister of Supply said that, on reflection, he felt increasingdoubts about the expediency of providing Government support for either of these aircraft. A Dakota replacement was not needed byBritish European Airways for some years to come and he would infact be subsidising the Corporation if his Department bought aircraft for use in their Scottish services, as envisaged by the Civil AviationPolicy Committee. Moreover, it was clear that this would lead tofurther requests for financial assistance in the introduction of othernew types. He was unwilling to accept the argument that a domesticorder was an essential prerequisite for the successful entry of a new type of aircraft into the export market: the Folland Gnat had been sold abroad without a preliminary home order, and there was good reason to believe that Trans-Canada Airlines would buy the aircraft which was to succeed the Viscount, whether or not it was ordered byBritish European Airways. He also thought it would be invidiousfor the Government to choose between the competing types of whichthere might be three, if the De Havilland 123 was to be considered inaddition to the Avro 748 and the Handley Page Dart Herald.The Minister of Power said that, on the basis of proposals whichhad previously been put to them about the possible need forGovernment assistance in the development of aircraft for which therewas no home demand, the Civil Aviation Policy Committee had agreed in principle that financial support should be made available, as necessary and on a selective basis, for the development of a british aircraft to replace the Dakota. The Committee had felt that thiswould be a development of existing policy rather than a radicaldeparture from it. On the question whether one or more typesshould be supported, the consensus of opinion at the last meeting of theCommittee had been that support should be given to the Dart Heraldand also, if necessary, to the Avro 748 on the understanding that theexpenditure involved (a total of about  2 millions) would be recoveredin the event of successful export sales. He considered that, on all theinformation available, the Committee&apos;s views were reasonable.
Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,5th May, 1959.In discussion the Cabinet reviewed the arguments relating tothe principle of Government support for replacement aircraft.Although orders for new types of military aircraft were declining,the aircraft industry would continue to be of national importance on defence grounds for some time to come. It would also be ofimportance for economic reasons and for national prestige. Its maincompetitor, the American aircraft industry, benefited from the size of the United States domestic market, including large military orders.We should look critically at suggestions put forward by aircraftmanufacturers that home orders were an essential prerequisite forexport sales. But it might not be practicable&apos;or desirable to expect that as a general rule overseas operators would be willing to face the initial difficulties and costs of introducing new types into service.The New Zealand authorities, for example, had said that they would consider buying the Dart Herald only if a United Kingdom agencyhad placed an order for this type.The Dakota replacement market might possibly be left to theFokker Friendship, which had British engines and some Britishcomponents. But there was a danger that, in the absence of a continuing export market for new British airframes, our aero-engineindustry would lose its present favourable position and might not beable to survive in isolation.Summing up this part of the discussion, the Prime Minister saidthat the balance of argument appeared to lie in favour of accepting the principle that where necessary, and on a selective basis,Government support might be given to the development of replacement aircraft. But financial assistance of this kind shouldbe given only when the returns expected in any particular casejustified it as a reasonable risk. It should not be regarded as ageneral commitment on the part of the Government to assist in thedevelopment of all new types of aircraft. Moreover, before decidingthat Government support should be given in this particular case theCabinet should consider the method by which it would be provided and the type, or types, of aircraft to which it should be given. Forthis purpose it would be helpful if, when their discussion was resumed,they had further information on the arrangements envisaged toprovide Government support for the Dart Herald and the Avro 748.The Cabinet (1) Agreed to resume their discussion on the following day.(2) Invited the Minister of Supply and the Minister of transport and Civil Aviation to provide the Cabinet with furtherinformation on the methods by which government assistance could be given to the Dart Herald and theAvro 748.
