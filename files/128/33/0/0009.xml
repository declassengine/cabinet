Cyprus.(previous reference :C.C. (59) 7thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Cabinet had before them a note by the foreign secretary (C. (59) 25) to which was appended an unofficial translation of the original French text of the agreement on Cyprus reached bythe Greek and Turkish Prime Ministers at Zurich.The Foreign Secretary said that this agreement comprised fourdocuments the first defining the &quot; basic structure &quot; of the proposed new Republic of Cyprus; the second containing a Treaty of guarantee between the Republic and the United Kingdom, greece and Turkey; the third containing a Treaty of Alliance between theRepublic and Greece and Turkey; the fourth comprising a&quot; Gentleman&apos;s Agreement&quot; between the Greek and Turkish PrimeMinisters on certain specific issues. These texts should be considered from three points of view the continuing commitment which theyentailed so far as concerned the United Kingdom; the extent towhich they safeguarded our own interests in Cyprus; and their implications as regards the transfer of sovereignty from the UnitedKingdom to the new Republic.The United Kingdom CommitmentUnder Article 2 of the Treaty of Guarantee we should berequired, jointly with Greece and Turkey, to recognise and guarantee the independence, territorial integrity and security of the republic of Cyprus and &quot; the state of affairs prescribed by the fundamentalarticles of its constitution.&quot; Under Article 3 we should undertaketo consult with Greece and Turkey on the action to be taken if anyof the provisions of the Treaty was infringed but should beauthorised, if it proved impossible to reach agreement with the other two Governments, to take independent action &quot; with the sole aim of re-establishing the state of affairs laid down by the present Treaty.&quot;It would appear to follow from these provisions that we should beaccepting a commitment to guarantee a Greco-Turkish agreement(on the fundamental articles of the Constitution) which we had hadno part in shaping. Moreover, a right to intervene in order tore-establish the &quot; state of affairs &quot; prescribed by the Treaty mightbe embarrassing if we had no control over the Government of theRepublic and no assurance that they would in fact be able to implement the Constitution in a satisfactory manner or to maintainlaw and order. On the other hand, the Treaty represented an honestand courageous attempt to establish a balance between the conflictingGreek and Turkish interests in Cyprus; and it gave us the right though it imposed on us no obligation-to take independent action if we had reason to believe that this balance was in danger of beingdisturbed. In addition it bound us to safeguard the security of theRepublic against external attack.The United Kingdom Interest in CyprusWe should seek to ensure that our strategic interests in Cypruswould be safeguarded by incorporation in the Treaty of Guarantee particularly since the Treaty was itself to be entrenched in theConstitution of the Republic and could not therefore be amended by any legislative act of the new State. Our requirements could be indicated in general terms to the Greek and Turkish foreign ministers as follows:  (i) We should need to retain certain substantial areas under british sovereignty as permanent military bases.(ii) We should need to retain control over other isolated sitesthroughout the Island. It might appear anomalous to insist thatthese small areas should remain under British sovereignty; and thealternative course of arranging for them to be held on lease was opento the objection that it was difficult to specify a satisfactory period for such a lease. It might therefore be preferable to rest on the fact
that our right to occupy and use those sites would be specificallyprovided in the Treaty and would therefore be coterminous with it.(iii) We should need facilities for access to the areas mentionedin paragraphs (i) and (ii) above, for transit between them, for thesupply of stores and services and so forth. The guarantee of these facilities might be similarly incorporated in the text of the Treaty.(iv) We should need the right to use the airfield at Nicosia.It might be difficult to insist that the main airfield in the island shouldbe retained under British sovereignty; but it would be essential toensure that we and, if necessary, Greece and Turkey would beauthorised to use the airfield, without restriction, for both civil andmilitary purposes.(v) We should need a satisfactory assurance that, if our strategic requirements changed, we should be enabled to acquire alternativesites in any part of the Island.The Transfer of SovereigntyThe agreement between the Greek and Turkish Governmentsenvisaged that the Republic of Cyprus should be established not later than three months after the signature of the Treaties. But manyadministrative issues would need to be resolved before the new Statecould come into being; and, although there would be a psychologicaladvantage in fixing a definite and early date for the transfer of power,it should be accepted that any date provisionally selected at this stagemight need to be reconsidered in the light of developments.The more important problems which would have to be solvedin the interim were as follows:  (vi) Would the Republic of Cyprus be a member of theCommonwealth and of the sterling area? It would not satisfy the criterion for full membership of the Commonwealth; and it mightbe more appropriate that its status should resemble that of the recently reconstituted State of Singapore. On the other hand, the psychological impact of the political settlement would be enhancedif we could welcome the suggestion by the Governments of greece and Turkey that Cyprus should remain within the. Commonwealth.Further consideration would need to be given to the wording of any public statement on this subject which might be made when theterms of the political settlement were published.In the short term Cyprus would probably be a liability ratherthan an asset to the sterling area; but the balance of advantage would probably lie in allowing it to remain a member.(vii) The Republic would continue to require financial andeconomic support for some time. Its revenue might suffice to financenormal civil expenditure; but its development programmes wouldrequire external support. We should avoid accepting an indefinitecommitment in this respect and should perhaps seek to arrange forthe annual grants which we had hitherto made to the Governmentto be progressively reduced over a stated period.(viii) The agreement reached between the Greek and turkish governments appeared to make no provision for the Cypriots,numbering about 10,000, who were of neither Greek nor Turkishnationality. It was, however, accepted by the Foreign Ministers of greece and Turkey that suitable provisions should be adopted inorder to safeguard the rights of these individuals.(ix) Many other issues, including the important question of ourcivil aviation rights in Cyprus, would need to be examined in greater detail before the new State could effectively come into existence.In addition, the &quot; Gentleman&apos;s Agreement&quot; between the PrimeMinisters of Greece and Turkey envisaged that &quot; immediately afterthe signature of the Treaties &quot; all the emergency measures at presentin force in Cyprus. should be lifted and a general amnesty shouldbe proclaimed. The timing of any relaxation of the emergency measures would need further consideration, and any amnesty wouldbe dependent upon a corresponding willingness on the part of the
terrorist organisations in Cyprus to suspend their activities and to surrender their arms.In further discussion it was agreed that our objective should now be to concert with the Greek and Turkish Governments as rapidly as possible the text of a statement of intention to give effectto the agreement reached by the two Governments, of which our strategic requirements in Cyprus would be deemed to be an integral part. This statement of intention might be initialled by representatives of the three Governments on 16th February.Thereafter it should be initialled by leading representativesof the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities, who shouldbe invited to visit London on 18th February for this purpose.Archbishop Makarios had already been informed of the scope ofthe agreement between the Greek and Turkish Governments andwas said to have endorsed it. It might be generally expected thathe would now be allowed to return to Cyprus. There were obviousrisks in this course. On the other hand, there was no evident reason why the ban against his return should be maintained when he hadinitialled the statement of intention, and there might be certain advantages in requiring him, in effect, to defend to the Greek cypriot community his acceptance of an agreement which should terminatehis efforts to promote the union of Cyprus with Greece.It would be preferable to defer publication of the variousagreements involved until they had been formally accepted by thethree Governments and by the representatives of the Greek and turkish communities in Cyprus. Appropriate guidance should therefore be given to the Press during the next few days. It might also be desirable to consider transferring to 19th February theParliamentary debate on foreign affairs which had been arranged for 18th February, in order that Government spokesmen might take that opportunity to make a considered statement about the successful outcome of the Governments policy towards Cyprus.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to continue his discussions with the Greek and Turkish Foreign Ministers on thelines indicated in their discussion, with the objective of enabling the three Governments to initial on16th February a statement of intention to give effect tothe proposals for the future of Cyprus which had beenprepared by the Greek and Turkish Governments, andto the reservation to the United Kingdom Governmentof such strategic facilities in the Island as they might regard as essential.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence to prepare, for the purposeof the action to be taken under Conclusion (1) above, astatement of essential strategic requirements in Cyprus.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to concert with the Greek and turkish Foreign Ministers appropriate arrangements forthe detailed examination of the administrative issues which would need to be resolved before the Republic of cyprus could come into being.(4) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation withthe Foreign Secretary, to consider the wording of apossible public statement about the association betweenthe future Republic of Cyprus and the Commonwealth.(5) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to arrangefor appropriate guidance to be given to the Press on thelines indicated in their discussion.(6) Invited the Home Secretary to consider whether it would bedesirable for arrangements to be made to enable cyprus to be discussed during the Parliamentary debate onforeign affairs in the following week.
2. Secretary of State for Scotland said that, in pursuanceof the Cabinefs decision on the previous day, statements on the caseof John Waters, to be made by the Lord Advocate and himself inthe House of Commons, had been drafted. But he was very doubtfulwhether the increasing public disquiet over the case would be allayedif the Government could do no more than suggest that, initially, theaggrieved parties should seek redress by a civil action for damages.The draft statements were circulated to the Cabinet.In discussion there was general agreement that it would benecessary for the Government to respond to the growing pressure for a formal enquiry into the case. Criminal proceedings could notbe instituted without calling in question the Lord Advocated original decision that the evidence did not justify a prosecution; and public confidence in the impartial administration of justice would be shakenif it was supposed that the prosecuting authorities allowed themselvesto be influenced, in a matter of this kind, by political considerations.Alternatively, it would be possible to set up an enquiry into thecircumstances in which the available evidence had originally beensubmitted to the Lord Advocate and to arrange for a review of theexisting arrangements whereby the Chief Constables in scotland were instructed to refrain from initiating disciplinary action in caseswhere it had been decided not to institute criminal proceedings.But an investigation limited to considerations of this nature wouldnot suffice to establish the facts of the case in question. Nor would the tribunal be empowered to require evidence to be given on oath.If the issues involved were to be adequately examined it would benecessary to institute a formal enquiry under the Tribunals of Inquiry(Evidence) Act, 1921. This course was open to the possible objection that an enquiry of this kind, like any other public investigation ofthe facts, might call in question the Lord Advocated original decision.Moreover, it might constitute an undesirable precedent in the caseof other individuals who might suppose that they had some grievanceagainst the authorities but should properly be required to seekredress in the civil courts. Nevertheless the balance of advantagenow appeared to lie in conceding a formal enquiry. The terms ofreference should be so drafted as to require the tribunal to establish the facts of the case; but it was for consideration whether thetribunal should also be invited to comment on the adequacy of theexisting arrangements in Scotland for enabling a disciplinary enquiry to be instituted in cases similar to that now in question. The factthat any public examination of this subject might adversely affectthe morale of the police might be regarded as outweighed by thepolitical considerations involved.In further discussion it was agreed that it might be appropriate for the Government^ decision in the present case to be announced in Parliament by the Prime Minister.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that an enquiry into the case of John Waters shouldbe instituted under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence)Act, 1921.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with the attorney-General and the Lord Advocate, to submit tothe Prime Minister that day draft terms of reference forthis enquiry.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,13th February, 1959. ,John Waters.(previous reference :C.C.
