South-east asia treaty organisation.(previous reference:CM. (56) 17thConclusions,Minute 1.)Laos.1. The Foreign Secretary said that, despite an attempt by theSoviet representative to veto the proceedings, the Security Councilof the United Nations had now appointed a sub-committee toprepare for the Council a factual report on the situation in Laos,In these circumstances it would be premature for the South-east asia Treaty Organisation (SEATO) to intervene, but its membersof SEATO should be encouraged to keep a close watch on thesituation. He had instructed the United Kingdom Commissioner-General in Singapore to go to Laos and to make a report on thelatest developments.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.Germany.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 49thConclusions.)Assets in the united kingdom.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof State for Foreign Affairs (C. (59) 139) on the disposal of german assets confiscated under war-time legislation and remaining in theUnited Kingdom.The Foreign Secretary said that the residue of confiscatedGerman assets had been thought in 1957 to be so small as to be not worth distributing to United Kingdom creditors. Power had therefore been taken to pay the proceeds then available to the NaziVictims Relief Trust, and it had been provided at the same time that any further residue, which had been expected to be small, shouldbe payable to the Exchequer. In the event, the estimates made in1957 had proved wrong and it was now known that further german assets of not less than  1 million in value remained to be disposed of.In addition to this sum, further sums which might amount to 100,000 were expected to become available in future years. TheForeign Secretary suggested that in the existing internationalcircumstances it would be preferable to defer a decision on thedisposal of these known and future assets.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed with this view. Hewould have been prepared to forgo payment of the known assets intothe Exchequer if it had been proposed to make a further distribution to United Kingdom creditors, but if the question were to bere considered at a later date he would prefer to reserve his position.The Cabinet Agreed to resume at a later date their discussion of thedisposal of German assets in the United Kingdom.Cyprus.(previous references:C.C. (59) 44thConclusions,Minute 4 andC.C. (59) 17thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the colonial secretary (C. (59) 145) on the form of legislation to give effect to the cyprus settlement and on the question of elections in Cyprus.The Colonial Secretary said that it would be inexpedient to setout the constitution prepared by the Joint Constitutional Committeein full, either in legislation or in an Order in Council; for it wouldbe unwelcome to opinion in Cyprus, and the United KingdomGovernment ought not to appear to accept responsibility for thedetails of the constitution. On the other hand, if a Bill were introducedwhich, as in the case of Burma, provided only that from a date tobe appointed by Order in Council Cyprus should become anindependent country it would be more difficult to ensure that thenew constitution accorded with the provisions of the Basic articles and met our own strategic requirements. Both he and the Governor
of Cyprus therefore preferred a middle course, namely, that theBill should provide for such constitution for the Republic of Cyprusas might be specified by Order in Council to be brought into operation by the Order, the constitution being identified as the draft preparedby the Joint Constitutional Committee but not set out in full. If,however, the Cypriot authorities pressed strongly for legislation onthe Burma model, he would not himself regard that as a point whichshould be allowed to endanger implementation of the settlement.Meanwhile, both the Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders wishedelections in preparation for the new constitution to begin in November.This would entail an Order in Council, and the Colonial secretary proposed that the Governor should be authorised to begin thenecessary technical consultations with the Cypriot leaders and thatdrafting of the necessary Order should proceed. It would have tobe made clear that the officers elected under the new constitutioncould not -undertake their duties until the constitution itself had come into operation.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in agreement withthese proposals. It was pointed out that, to enable the newconstitution to be brought into operation within the stipulatedperiod, the Bill should receive the Royal Assent not later than18th February, 1960; and it should therefore be introduced in timefor the Second Reading to take place before Parliament rose for the christmas recess.In further discussion the Cabinet were informed that twoTurkish Cypriot policemen had recently been murdered in the Islandby Turkish terrorists. For their own safety, 12 other Turkish Cypriotpolicemen who had co-operated with the British authorities werebeing brought with their families to the United Kingdom, wherearrangements would be made to settle them.The Cabinet -(1) Approved the proposals in C. (59) 145.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to expedite the preparationof the necessary legislation.Aden.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 53rdConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the colonial secretary (C.P.C. (59) 12) on the future of Aden Colony andProtectorate.The Colonial Secretary said that pressure was building up,comparatively slowly in the Aden Protectorate Federation but more strongly in the Colony, for the merger of the Colony and the protectorate and for their ultimate independence. If the retentionof our military base in Aden was essential for our future strategicpurposes and this must for the time being be assumed to be so it would be preferable that the Colony should remain separate fromthe Federation. It was therefore desirable that no statement shouldbe made indicating that we supported their union in any form. Onthe other hand, a declaration in the reverse sense might serve onlyto strengthen local demands for union. The Colonial Secretarytherefore proposed, with the agreement of the Governor of Aden,that no statement on the future of the Colony and the Protectorateshould be made for some time to come. The Governor might,however, be authorised to indicate in confidence that we should not stand in the way of proposals for administrative measures forco-operation in such matters as health, education and com-munications.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the proposals put forward inC.P.C. (59) 12.
The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement by the Chancellorof the Exchequer.6. The Prime Minister drew the attention of the Cabinet tothe recently published report of the Committee on the Rating ofCharities and Kindred Bodies. Apparently the Committee&apos;srecommendations, if implemented, would mean that voluntary schools would be deprived of their present exemption from rating,except that if they were occupied by charities they would be eligiblefor the 50 per cent, relief recommended for charities generally. Thiswould cause considerable apprehension that an additional financial burden would be thrown on the voluntary schools. It was important to make it clear that the Government did not intend that this shouldhappen.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that, inthe statement he had issued concurrently with the publication of thereport, he had been careful to avoid committing the Government to accepting any of the recommendations of the Committee and topoint out that some of them, including that to which the PrimeMinister had drawn attention, would require legislation.In discussion it was recognised that if effect were given to thisrecommendation the Church authorities responsible for voluntary schools would not in fact suffer but that the new rate burden would fall on the local education authorities. There was, nevertheless, a danger that acceptance of the recommendation might disturb thecarefully adjusted financial relationship between the Government,the local education authorities and the Churches. It was therefore desirable that a further statement should be prepared, for use inreply to questions, to the effect that the Government had no intentionof allowing this balance to be disturbed or any additional rate burdento fall on the Churches.Education.(previous references:C.C. (59) 38thConclusions,Minute 6 andC.C. (59) 32ndConclusions,Minute 5.)voluntary schools.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government, inconsultation with the Lord President and the Minister ofEducation, to prepare a statement on the lines agreed intheir discussion.General 7.   The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that he had askedElection.        the Queen to grant a Dissolution of the present Parliament on18th September, and that the Queen had graciously consented.Employment 5.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the MinistersDistribution    concerned had now given further consideration to a number of,     of Industry.     points which had been outstanding following the Cabinefs earlier(Previous       discussion of proposals for new legislation designed to rationaliseReference:      and improve the existing provisions for the distribution of industry.C.C. (59) 45th   These points had included the method of selecting areas in which conclusions,    assistance to industry would be given, the scale of capital grants to minute 4.)      firms building new factories; and the extent to which other formsof assistance might be made available to firms at the administrativediscretion of Ministers.   As a result, apart from the need to give further consideration to the extent to which-an independent advisorycommittee should scrutinise applications for assistance, the Presidentof the Board of Trade could now arrange for the drafting of thenecessary legislation with a view to a Bill being ready for introductionat the beginning of the next session.
Parliament would accordingly be prorogued and dissolved on that day, and polling in a General Election would take place on 8th October. The new Parliament would be summoned on20th October and would be formally opened, but not by the Queenin person, on 27th October. A public announcement about these arrangements would be issued forthwith.In accordance with precedent, an Election Business Committeeof Ministers, under the chairmanship of the Lord Chancellor, wouldbe appointed to supervise the work of advising Government candidatesabout the replies which they should return to policy enquiries. ACommittee of Ministers under the chairmanship of the HomeSecretary would also be appointed to prepare the Queen&apos;s Speech on prorogation of Parliament.The Prime Minister said that, for the period of the Election, the rule which normally precluded Ministers from contributing articlesto the Press would be waived. Ministers would be free during thatperiod to accede to requests by the Conservative Central Office thatthey should contribute articles for the Press, but they should not accept payment for them.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement by the PrimeMinister.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,9th September, 1959.
