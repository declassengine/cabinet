Shipping 1.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theindustry. Minister of Transport (C. (59) 142) on the replacement of the CunardCunard Liners, liners Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth.(previous reference :C.C. (59) 39thConclusions.Minute 3.)The Minister of Transport recalled that the Cabinet had invited him, in consultation with the other Ministers concerned, togive further consideration to the scope of an independent enquiry intothe project for the replacement of the &quot; Queen &quot; liners. He nowproposed the appointment of a small independent committee, whosefunction would be to advise the Government, on the assumptionthat the &quot; Queen &quot; liners would be replaced, about such questions asthe type of ship best suited for the purpose, how they should be built and operated, and how this should be financed. He proposedto announce the appointment of the committee without unduepublicity during the recess.In discussion there was general agreement with this proposal.The Government would, however, be expected to indicate whetherthey had decided in principle to replace the &quot; Queen &quot; liners. It was important not to be committed at this stage to replace them by shipsowned and operated by the Cunard Company, and theannouncement should therefore be to the effect that the government intended to support our traditional supremacy in the weeklytransatlantic service, through replacement of the &quot; Queen&quot; linerswhen this became necessary.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) The terms of reference of the proposed committee ofenquiry should not enable the committee to advise where the replacement ships were to be built.(b) It would be preferable that the committee should beinvited to &quot; advise&quot; rather than &quot; report to&quot; the Minister ofTransport.The Cabinet-Approved, subject to the points made in discussion, theproposals in C. (59) 142 for an independent enquiry intothe replacement of the Cunard liners Queen Mary andQueen Elizabeth.India.Indus Waters.(previous reference :C.C. (59) 25thConclusions,Minute 6.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary (C. (59) 138) about the scheme proposedby the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development forthe settlement of the Indus waters problem.The Commonwealth Secretary recalled that on 23rd April theCabinet had agreed that the United Kingdom should be prepared inprinciple to contribute $42 millions towards the International Bank&apos;scheme, provided that it was accepted by India and Pakistan, and provided that Canada and Australia were willing to makecontributions of $16-8 millions and $11-2 millions respectively.Canada and Australia had agreed to this, and New Zealand had also been prepared to contribute $2-8 millions. After consultationwith the Indian and Pakistan Governments, the President of theInternational Bank (Mr. Black) thought that there was now a good chance that a settlement would be reached on the basis of the scheme.But, partly on account of certain minor amendments that had beenmade to the scheme, he had now asked that the United Kingdom,Canada and Australia should contribute an extra $30 millions between
them to its cost. If, as had been hoped, the West German Governmenthad been prepared to make a contribution, the request for additionalsupport from the Commonwealth might not have been necessary.But the German offer of a contribution of $30 millions had so far been made specifically for the relief of the amount which India 0would be called upon to contribute. A contribution on this basis, aswell as being open to other objections, might call into question thebasis of settlement between India and Pakistan, and Mr. Blackproposed to inform the German Government that their offer wasnot acceptable in this form.In default of an unconditional contribution from Germany, theUnited Kingdom were therefore now being asked to agree tocontribute $58 - 4 millions, and the Canadian, Australian and NewZealand Governments $23-2 millions, $15-6 millions and $2-8millions respectively. The importance of a settlement of the Induswaters problem was so great that we should be ready to provide theincreased contribution. The reply to Mr. Black should make it clearthat our contribution, both as to its size and as to its being available in free foreign exchange for competitive internationaltender, was conditional on other contributors giving similarassurances.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he agreed that,although it now seemed likely that our contribution would have tobe considerably greater, we should not draw back from participating in the International Bank&apos;s bold and imaginative scheme. but mr. Black should be urged to continue to try to obtain an unconditional contribution from the German Government, on theunderstanding that, if this became available, the increased contributions from Commonwealth countries would if possible bereduced. He understood that the International Bank were considering the establishment of a permanent supervisory body inconnexion with the scheme; it was important that the UnitedKingdom should be associated with this, so that we could help tocontrol the rate of expenditure.In discussion it was suggested that the United States Congressmight press for the United States contribution to the scheme to be tied to American exports. We should encourage Mr. Black to withstand this pressure as far as possible. It would be less onerousto accept a general understanding that only the countriescontributing to the scheme would be allowed to tender for contractsunder it.The Prime Minister said that if the scheme came to fruition itwould be an outstanding example of the generous assistance whichthe Western nations extended to the uncommitted countries. It was important that the project should be properly presented in the context of the economic interdependence of the free world. Itsinauguration could perhaps be marked by some significantinternational ceremony. It would be useful to discuss the questionhow the scheme should be presented with representatives of theInternational Bank.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in C. (59) 138.(2) Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Presidentof the Board of Trade, to arrange for a reply to be sentto the President of the International Bank, inaccordance with the Cabinefs discussion.(3) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister ofState for Foreign Affairs, to consider how the scheme might be presented to world opinion to the best advantage.
commercial policy.Butter.(previous references :C.C. (59) 47thConclusions,Minute 7, andC.C. (59) 38thConclusions,Minute 7.)3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, owing toreduced production in this country and a decline in supplies available from Europe, the price of butter had already risen andwas likely to be higher still in the autumn. There was aconsiderable stock of butter in Canada, and about 10,000 tons mightbe available if the existing restrictions on the import of dollarbutter were removed. It was unlikely that the removal of these restrictions would lead to the import of United States butter since,unless this were specially manufactured, it would not conform toour food standards. It was in any case increasingly difficult tojustify these import restrictions. Liberalisation in present circum-stances would probably be accepted by New Zealand, since their interests lay in ensuring that the price of butter did not rise so high asto induce consumers to buy margarine instead. The economic policy Committee had accordingly recommended the liberalisation ofimports of dollar butter.In discussion it was suggested that, if all restrictions on theimport of dollar butter were removed, it would be difficult toreimpose them even in the event of a future glut. If there were an appreciable decline in butter prices, it was likely that New Zealandwould press us to restrict imports of butter from other countries,including Canada. It might therefore be better to open a limitedquota, or even a temporary quota. On the other hand, there wouldbe strong Canadian objections if a quota were opened on atemporary basis. Indeed, in view of the fact that the quotas on imports of European butter had been removed, it was likely that the canadians would be critical of any measure short of completeliberalisation. It was pointed out that butter production in Canada,as in all other countries from which we imported butter except NewZealand and Denmark, was subsidised. If necessary, restrictions on imports could always be reimposed to prevent the dumping ofsubsidised butter.The Prime Minister said that it was the general view of theCabinet that the purchase of Canadian butter should now be permitted by removing all restrictions on the import of dollar butter.But, in order to enable restrictions to be reimposed in the event of aglut, the Canadian Government should be explicitly warned that,because their butter production was subsidised, we reserved the rightto restrict imports at any time in the future.The Cabinet Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, the President of the Boardof Trade and the Minister of Agriculture, to arrange for a message to the Canadian Government to be prepared onthe lines indicated by the Prime Minister, and to submit itto him for his approval.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,29th July, 1959.
