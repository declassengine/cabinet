Middle East.Iraq :Supply ofArms.(previous reference :C.C. (59) 22ndConclusions.Minute 3.)1. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the request for thesupply of certain heavy weapons to Iraq.The Foreign Secretary recalled that, while a limited number of guns could be supplied at once, deliveries of the Centurion tanks andCanberra aircraft for which Iraq had asked could not begin until the later part of 1960. We could not ensure, by a promise to supplythese arms, that Iraq, would not fall under Communist domination;but we could be sure that, if we refused to supply them, Iraq would obtain the arms they need from the Soviet bloc. Turkey, Iran andJordan were in favour of our agreeing to supply them and the UnitedStates, Canada and Pakistan would raise no objection. An offer ofarms to Iraq might provoke some criticism at home; but the moreimportant problem was the effect which it might have on Egypt.President Nasser was intensifying his anti-British propaganda and appeared to be delaying the fulfilment of his obligations under theAnglo-Egyptian agreement. He would certainly resent a British offer of arms to Iraq, but it seemed unlikely that he would on that accountrepudiate the financial agreement. On the other hand it seemedequally unlikely that, if we refrained from making the offer, he would on that account be more co-operative in fulfilling the agreement.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat, on a balance of all the considerations, we should not decline to supply the Iraqi Government with the arms for which they had asked. We had little prospect of establishing cordial relations with egypt, and it was no disadvantage to us that the traditionalantagonism between Iraq and Egypt should continue. Acceptanceof the Iraqi orders would have certain positive advantages for us:for it would enable the manufacturers of Canberras to maintainproduction; it might help to deter the Iraqi Government fromwithdrawing their sterling balances; and it might be of some service in strengthening the position of the Iraq Petroleum Company in Iraq.It would be inexpedient to attempt to make the acceptance of these orders conditional upon Iraq&apos;s continuing independence fromCommunist control or the improvement of her commercial relationswith the United Kingdom. Nor would it be wise to attempt to conceal the fact that the offer had been made, for it could not bekept secret for long.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that her majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Bagdad should be instructed to informthe Prime Minister of Iraq that the United Kingdom wished tomaintain good relations with Iraq, both political and commercial.The armed forces of Iraq had been built up on the supply of british equipment and the continuation of that supply was a naturalconsequence of the long association between the two countries. Wewere therefore ready in principle to accept the orders for heavyweapons which the Iraqi Government wished to place, althoughdeliveries of some of the items could not be made for some considerable time. We would therefore be ready to give the necessaryexport facilities, if satisfactory arrangements for payment were made.This offer was made in the confidence that the Government of Iraqwould retain their independence of Communist control and would ensure continued oil supplies and improved trading relations withthe United Kingdom. No public statement should be made until a reply was received. The Egyptian Government should be informedbefore any arms were delivered against new orders.C.C. 24 (59)
The Cabinet Agreed that Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Bagdad shouldbe instructed to make a communication to the Governmentof Iraq on the lines indicated by. the Prime Minister insumming up the Cabinefs discussion.Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,21st April, 1959.
