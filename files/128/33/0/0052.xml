Egypt. 1.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the(Previous Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (59) 149) on the liability ofReference: shareholders of the Suez Finance Company to United Kingdom incomeC.C. (59) 4lst tax on payments received by way of compensation.Conclusions,Minute 6.) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Suez FinanceSuez Canal Company was in process of receiving from the Egyptian GovernmentCompensation, compensation in instalments which they were distributing to theirshareholders. He was advised that, under the law as it stood, these payments were liable to United Kingdom income tax. strong representations had been made to him that this&apos; was inequitable. Thecompensation was less than the full value of the expropriated assets,and had the Company been resident in the United Kingdom thedistribution to shareholders would not have been liable to tax. On theother hand, the payment of compensation was not essentially different from the distribution of accumulated profits, which in the case of anoverseas company, under the present law, was undoubtedly subjectto tax. It would not be proper to waive the tax liability by administrative action, since the subject was not free from controversy,and a concession could therefore be made only by legislation. Therewere considerable objections to this, since a concession could not belimited to the shareholders of this particular company, and thelegislation would be controversial, would need to be retrospective andwould be contrary to the recommendations of the Royal Commissionon Taxation and Income.In discussion it was suggested that, since the Suez Canalcompensation was being paid, at least in part, in the form of sharesrather than of cash, this case might be distinguishable from the case(Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Reid&apos;s Trustees) on which thepresent view of the law was based. The best course might thereforebe to arrange for the shareholders&apos; liability to tax to be tested in theCourts, the Board of Inland Revenue paying the costs of the action.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Attorney-General, to give further consideration to theliability of the shareholders of the Suez Finance company to United Kingdom income tax on compensation paid tothem.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of C. (59) 149 at a later meeting.CoHiEiercialPolicy.(previous references:C.C. (59) 48thConclusions,Minute 3 andC.C. (59) 46thConclusions,Minute 1.)Horticulture.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theParliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture (C. (59) 151) on thepowers of the proposed statutory Market Authority for covent garden.The Minister of Agriculture said that the Horticulture Bill, whichwas to be introduced in the next session of Parliament, would establish a new statutory Market Authority for Covent Garden. TheAuthority&apos;s functions would include the provision, of a new market,which was urgently needed from the points of view of both planning and traffic, and he was satisfied that for this purpose they must havepower to buy land compulsorily. The Home Affairs Committee had,however, felt some doubt about conferring this power on a new statutory authority. On further consideration, therefore, inconsultation with the Minister of Housing and Local Government, he now proposed that, instead of conferring a general power on theAuthority, the Bill should bring it within the definition of statutoryundertaker in the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947. The effect55950-3b 2
of this would be that the Authority would have compulsory poweronly in respect of land designated for the purpose by amendment ofthe London Development Plan: the designation would need to be confirmed by the Minister of Housing and any exercise of the compulsory purchase power would require the authority of theMinister of Agriculture. The power would lapse if the designatedland were not acquired within 12 years. These arrangements wouldgive the Market Authority sufficient power to enable it to discharge its functions and at the same time embodied ample safeguards.The Cabinet agreed that this procedure should be adopted andthat the Bill should be drafted in time for introduction at the beginningof the next session of Parliament.The Cabinet Approved the proposal in C. (59) 151.Aircraft 3.   jne Minister of Supply said that it might be desirable to industry.        make a general statement in the near future about the Governments(Previous       policy for the aircraft industry.  This might include a proposal toReferences:     establish a joint consultative committee of representatives from theC.C.

He had originally proposed to place a study contract with a group of firms for a long-range supersonic transport which would travel at about twice the speed of sound. Itwas now understood that the Americans were considering thedevelopment of a considerably faster aircraft. It was therefore desirable that British manufacturers should study the practicabilityand economics of developing aircraft capable of these faster speeds,and should have freedom to explore the possibility of commercialco-operation with American or French manufacturers. He therefore proposed (as described in C.A. (59) 36) to place three contracts forfeasibility studies of the technical, economic and financial problems of developing supersonic transport aircraft of different speeds. Onecontract, for the airframe, might be given to a combination of the hawker-Siddeley group and the Bristol Aeroplane Company; and contracts for the engines might be given to Rolls Royce and to Bristol-Siddeley. The studies would take about six months to complete andwould cost about  300,000. As commercial contacts with the americans progressed, it would be useful for an approach also to bemade to the United States Government about the possibility ofco-operation.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) It was doubtful whether the appointment of a new committeewould be well received at the present time. On the other hand, itwould be useful to draw attention to the considerable government assistance which was already being given to the aircraft industry, andto stress the efforts which British operators were making to achieveinternational agreement on lower fares.(b) Other manufacturers besides Hawker-Siddeley and Bristolhad experience of supersonic development work, and their exclusion from the proposed contracts might give rise to criticism. On theother hand, the other large firms in the industry were already fullyengaged on major development projects, and were probably not anxious to divert any resources to supersonic design studies at thisstage. The best course might be to announce the governments intention to place design study contracts, without disclosing details forthe time being.(c) The resources necessary to develop supersonic transport aircraft were so large that there was a reasonable prospect that the
SECjRET5Cabinet Office, S.W.1,18th September, 1959.United States Government and aircraft industry might be preparedto co-operate with us in this field. Further technical studies were clearly needed before we could talk in practical terms to the americans; but an approach to the United States administration should certainly be made at an early stage.Summing up, The Prime Minister said that the appointment of a consultative committee would not be appropriate at the present time.But a statement of the Governments policy for the aircraft industry should be drafted by the Minister of Supply, in consultation with theother Ministers concerned, and submitted to -the Chairman of theElection Business Committee. The Cabinet agreed in principle thatthere should be design study contracts on the lines proposed by theMinister of Supply, but it would be preferable to defer placing these contracts with the firms concerned for the time being.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Supply, in consultation with the other ministers concerned, to submit to the Chairman of theElection Business Committee a statement of theGovernments policy for the aircraft industry.(2) Agreed that an announcement should be made of theGovernments intention to place design study contracts for a supersonic transport aircraft, but that details of these contracts should not be announced for the time being.
