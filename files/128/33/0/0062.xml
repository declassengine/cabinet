Education.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 51stConclusions,Minute 6.)2. The Minister of Education said that he would be publishingon the following day a report prepared by his Central AdvisoryCouncil under the Chairmanship of Sir Geoffrey Crowther, which contained a number of far-reaching recommendations, including the raising of the school-leaving age to 16 and compulsory part-timeeducation up to the age of 18 in county colleges. these recommendations would not, in the main, require fresh legislation;but they would be very costly and the Government would need timefor thought and consultation before reaching conclusions upon them.Until then it was important that Ministers should avoid committing themselves publicly to support of any of these recommendations.In discussion it was pointed out that this report would alsoprovoke speculation about the need for further expansion of thefacilities for university education and about the effect of universityrequirements on school curricula. The Government must soondefine their attitude towards those aspects of this problem.The Cabinet (1) Took note of this statement by the Minister of Education.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would consider whetherspecial arrangements should be made to enable ministers to discuss the implications which some of therecommendations in this report might have on university education.Road Traffic.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 76thConclusions,Minute 6.)03. The Minister of Transport said that in a debate in the Houseof Commons that afternoon he was likely to be pressed to continue and to extend to other areas systems of traffic control similar to the&quot; Pink Zone &quot; scheme which he had introduced as a temporary measure in central London. This would require legislation for which no provision had been made in the legislative programme for thecurrent session. If, however, Parliamentary time could be found it would be very useful to have legislation enabling him to introducemeasures of traffic control in limited areas and possibly for a limited time.In discussion it was recognised that it might well become necessary to find time during the current session for such a Bill, whichmight deal also with the appointment of civilian traffic wardens andpossibly with a system of standard penalties for parking offences,payable without recourse to the courts. In the forthcoming debate thepossibility of early legislation should not be excluded.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Transport to say, in the debate in the House of Commons that day, that legislation on thissubject might be undertaken in the current session ofParliament.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Cabinet were also informed that Parliament would be adjourned for the Christmas recess on 17th December and wouldreassemble on 26th January.
DisarmamentGenevaConferenceon nuclear tests.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 23rdConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Foreign Secretary made a brief report to the Cabineton the state of the negotiations at the Geneva conference on nuclear tests. Scientists of the three countries had been discussing thetechnical possibility of detecting tests conducted in large holes *underground. The American scientists had not been persuaded thatvany practicable system of inspection would be effective for controlling underground tests. On the other hand, there were indications that on the political side the United States delegation were now more anxious to find a means of concluding an international agreement for the control of nuclear tests. On balance, there now seemed a better prospect of progress in these negotiations.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Law of the Sea.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 61stConclusions,Minute 7.)5. The Lord Chancellor said that the Ministerial Committee onthe Law of the Sea had considered whether an attempt should bemade to reach a modus vivencli with Iceland in regard to fishing byBritish trawlers within twelve miles of her coast, pending the outcome of the 1960 Conference on the Law of the Sea. The Government of iceland had suggested that talks should be held during theforthcoming Ministerial meeting of the North Atlantic Council inParis, and had proposed as a basis for discussion that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment should withdraw naval protection within twelve miles of the coast of Iceland; that British trawlers should cease fishingwithin that limit; that the Iceland Government would not arrestBritish trawlers for past violations of their fishery regulations withinthe twelve-mile limit; that British trawlers should be free to sailwithin the twelve-mile zone and use Iceland ports; and that both governments should be uncommitted with regard to their position at the forthcoming Conference. The Ministerial committee recommended that, while the matter could usefully be discussedinformally during the forthcoming meeting of the North atlantic council, it would be inadvisable to make any agreement with theGovernment of Iceland involving the cessation of fishery rightswithin the twelve-mile zone, even on a temporary basis and withoutprejudice to our future position, since such an agreement would leadother countries to believe that we were prepared to accept a twelve-mile fishery limit generally.The Cabinet-(1) Endorsed the recommendations of the Ministerial Committeeon the Law of the Sea.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to be guided by these considerations in his forthcoming informal discussions inParis with the Foreign Minister of Iceland.Pensions.(previous references:C.C. (59) 56thConclusions,Minute 4 andC.C. (59) 30thConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordChancellor (C. (59) 182) on an Opposition motion seeking leaveunder the Ten-Minute Rule to introduce a Bill to increase the rateof benefits under the National Insurance Acts.The Lord Chancellor said that the Legislation Committee had considered how this motion should be handled. The alternativeswere to arrange for Government supporters to vote against it or to acquiesce in the motion but block the Bill at a later stage.In discussion it was suggested that public opinion was influencedmainly by Parliamentary proceedings which culminated in a vote,and that this suggested that it might be safe to allow the motion to0
C.C, 62 (59)be passed and to rely on blocking the Bill. On the other hand, itwas important that there should be no public misapprehension aboutthe significance of the Government&apos;s acquiescing in the motion. Asubstantial increase in the rate of retirement pension would have serious economic effects; and there was much to be said for bringingout the economic dangers of the proposal in the debate on the motion and defeating it.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that thebalance of opinion in the Cabinet was in favour of arranging forGovernment supporters to vote against the.motion. It would be preferable that the Governments case should be presented by areliable Private Member briefed by the Minister of Pensions, but ifthis could not be arranged it should be presented by a government spokesman.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Pensions and the Chief Whip toarrange for Government supporters to vote against the motion seeking leave to introduce a Bill to increase national insurance benefits.Civil Aviation. 7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the(Previous Minister of Aviation (C. (59) 181) on the affairs of Scottish AviationReferences:       Limited.The Minister of Aviation said that the Defence Committeehad decided that the needs of the Army for a light liaison aircraft could be better met by the Beaver, an aircraft built by de Havilland&apos;sin Canada, than by the development of the- Pegasus by ScottishAviation Limited. The choice of the Pegasus would not haveincreased significantly the chances of survival of Scottish AviationLimited, for it would have endangered the continuance of theircontract for the repair of Canadian military aircraft. The canadian government should, however, be pressed to agree that, inconsideration of the decision to buy the Beaver aircraft, their repaircontracts with Scottish Aviation should be continued for as long aspossible. There was no possibility in sight that any other aircraftfirm would be prepared to take over Scottish Aviation, but it mightbe possible to place an additional order for twin Pioneer aircraft forthe Royal Air Force so as to give the firm some further time in which to explore the possibility of switching their labour and other resources to some other form of production.Discussion showed that there was general support in the cabinet for the view expressed by the Minister of Aviation. The cabinet were also informed that there was a justifiable military requirement for a further order for four twin-engine Pioneers. There might, inaddition, prove to be a military requirement for an additionalpurchase of Pioneers, and this possibility would be examined.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that theMinister of Defence should seek an agreement with the canadian government under which an order for Beavers would be linked with a firm undertaking that the Canadian contract with ScottishAviation for repair work would be continued. The Secretary ofState for Air should seek Treasury approval for the purchase of fourtwin-engine Pioneers, with a view to announcing this ordersimultaneously with a final decision regarding the Beaver aircraft.Meanwhile, the Minister of Aviation should give further study to thefuture of the aircraft industry in Scotland, and should do everything possible to avoid the threatened closure of the Rolls Royce factory at East Kilbride.C.C.

6se tee::The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Defence to seek an agreement withthe Canadian Government under which an order forBeaver aircraft would be linked with a firm undertaking that the Canadian contract with Scottish Aviation forrepair work would be continued.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Air to seek treasury approval for the purchase of four twin-engine Pioneeraircraft.(3) Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with theMinister of Aviation and the Secretary of State for Air,to co-ordinate the announcement of aircraft ordersaffecting Scottish Aviation.(4) Invited the Minister of Aviation to keep under review theposition of the aircraft industry in Scotland, and to makea report in due course to the Distribution of IndustryCommittee.8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (59) 183) on the interception of telephone conversationsby the police.The Home Secretary said that it was, in his view, essential to theefficiency of criminal investigation that the police should be free to listen to telephone conversations with the consent of one or other of the parties to the conversation. This was clearly distinguishablefrom interception without the knowledge of either party, for whichthe special authority of the Secretary of State would continue to berequired. It was, however, at least doubtful whether material so obtained by the police in the course of criminal investigation oughtto be disclosed before a professional disciplinary tribunal concernedwith wholly different matters. He was satisfied that the Governmentshould not seek to prevent this by claiming Crown privilege becausethe evidence now in question was, of its nature, not confidential andthe consenting party to the telephone conversation could not be prevented by a claim of Crown privilege from giving similar evidence to the tribunal. He therefore proposed, after consultation with theLord Chancellor and the Law Officers, that the powers of professionaldisciplinary tribunals to issue subpoenas should be limited in two ways: leave of a Judge or Master of the High Court might be madea pre-requisite to the subpoena and the person on whom it was servedmight be given the right to object to the Court on the ground that itsissue was contrary to public policy. This proposal would have theadvantage of taking the decision in these cases out of the hands ofthe Executive.In discussion it was pointed out that the professional disciplinarytribunals had a socially important function which should not beimpeded unduly. It should also be borne in mind that on someoccasions police evidence obtained under subpoena might favour the defendant before the tribunal. If the Home Secretary&apos;s proposal were adopted, he might give general advice to the police to lodge an objection to the issue of a subpoena by a tribunal either in all casesor unless there were definite reason to the contrary. A possible alternative might be to exempt, the police from subpoena by a tribunal, leaving it open to them to give evidence if they thought fit; but to confer this discretion on the police would be undesirablein itself and unlikely to be acceptable to public opinion.In further discussion it was pointed out that the proposal beforeCthe Cabinet, while giving the police the right to object to a subpoenaby a tribunal, would not give the same right to the defendant in whoseinterest it might be that police evidence obtained in another contextshould not be produced. To give this right to the defendant mightInterception oiCommisnica-tioms,.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 61stConclusions,Minute 2.)
Fuel Policy.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 32ndConclusions,Minute 7.)9. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Power (C. (59) 180) on fuel policy.The Minister of Power said that the policy for fuel and power should continue to be based on competition and freedom of choice forthe consumer; but the strict application of this policy had to be modified in certain respects to take account of social and strategic considerations. In the interests of our international trade in oil, andof the efficiency of industry generally, tax or other restrictions on oilconsumption ought to be avoided. But this would inevitably mean a continuing contraction in the coal industry, with a reduction in thelabour force and the closure of pits. The social disturbance of a rapid contraction of the coal industry had been avoided for the timebeing through the policy of stockpiling coal on a massive scale. Butthis, in turn, had financial and other disadvantages. The economic policy Committee had taken the view that it would be undesirable to increase coal stocks above their present level, and had suggestedthat he should examine the possibility of increasing demand byrelating coal prices more closely to the costs of production in different areas and by reducing prices of coal for export. He would also consider the possibility of spreading the programme for buildingnuclear power stations over a longer period, but in the short termthis would not have a large effect on demand for coal.In discussion the following points were raised:  (a) The financial advantage to the coal industry of restrictingoil supplies in this country would be far outweighed by the damage to our interests in overseas oil markets. But the possibility of a tax on oil must, formally, be reserved for consideration by the Chancellorof the Exchequer.(b) It was right, in the national interest, to refrain fromprotecting the coal industry from economic competition; at the samebe regarded as in the interests of justice and would make the proposalmore widely acceptable. On the other hand, the Court would be considering only the admissibility of the police evidence and would hardly be in a position to take account of an objection lodged by the defendant. It would, moreover, be a far-reaching innovation in english law to give one party to an action the right to limit the rightof the other party to produce whatever evidence it chose.A further alternative, that the Courts might be instructed torefuse leave to the tribunal to issue a subpoena if the evidence inquestion had been obtained for a purpose other than that with whichthe tribunal was concerned, could not be accepted since it would preclude the production under subpoena of evidence favourable tothe defendant.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that theCabinet appeared generally to favour the proposal in paragraph 4of the Home Secretary&apos;s memorandum, but further consideration should be given to the possibility of giving the defendant before thetribunal the right to object to the issue of a subpoena in thecircumstances contemplated.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the LordChancellor, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the attorney-General and the Lord Advocate, to give furtherconsideration in the light of their discussion to the proposal in paragraph 4 of C. (59) 183, and to bring the matter again before them at an early date.
time it was desirable to help the industry to become more efficient,for example, by assisting research into new uses of coal, and perhapsby encouraging the acceleration of electrification in rural areas.(c) In view of the importance of sustaining the scientific anc^technical effort which was being devoted to the development oynuclear energy, the Atomic Energy Authority should be associatedwith the review of the programme for building nuclear power stations.(d) Fluctuations in the demand for coal were a major factoraffecting the reorganisation and modernisation of the railways, andthe British Transport Commission needed realistic and up-to-dateforecasts about the level and pattern of future demand.(e) Although it was estimated that the demand for coal mightbe fractionally higher in 1965 than it was at present, the longer-termprospects were that coal would become an increasingly difficult anduneconomic source of power. Constant attention would have to bepaid to the problems of redundancy in the areas most severely affected by the continuing contraction of the industry.The Cabinet Approved the policy for fuel set out in C. (59) 180, subjectto the points raised in their discussion.commercial policy.(previous references:C.C. (59) 59thConclusions andC.C. (59) 46thConclusions,Minute 1.)Horticulture.10. The Minister of Agriculture said that the Government had undertaken to give to horticulture a measure of support comparable with that given to agriculture generally, and to continue to use thetariff as the main instrument of horticultural protection. Severaltariff applications, including one for the tomato industry, were atpresent under consideration. The horticulture industry had beendisappointed in the past with the findings of the Tariff AdvisoryCommittee and, notwithstanding the Governments undertaking, itwas doubtful whether the tariff was in many cases the appropriateform of protection. Some alternative method, such as minimum priceschemes on the lines at present being considered for apples and pears,might be preferable.It would be best if some increase in tariff protection could begiven to the tomato industry, as this would go some way to fulfil theGovernments undertaking. It was likely that the industry wouldthen still express dissatisfaction with the degree of protection, andthis would provide an opportunity to suggest that some alternative method of support should be examined. With a view to followingthis course of action, he therefore proposed that officials of theDepartments concerned should now work out a minimum pricescheme for tomatoes.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in general agreementwith this proposal.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Agriculture, in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of theBoard of Trade, to arrange for officials of the Departmentsconcerned to examine the possibility of a minimum pricescheme for tomatoes.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,10th December, 1959.
