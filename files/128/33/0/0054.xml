The Cabinet were informed that the United states administration had proposed an early meeting of Heads of western governments to prepare for resumed negotiations with the SovietGovernment on the problem of Berlin. They contemplated that thispreparatory meeting might be held in Paris at the end of October,and that the Summit meeting might take place early in December.The Prime Minister had informed President Eisenhower that theseproposals were acceptable to him. The French Government had shown signs of reluctance to fall in with the suggestions and their final views were still awaited.united nations.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 57thConclusions,Minute 3.)Tibet.3. The Foreign Secretary said that the United KingdomGovernment had supported the proposal that the situation in Tibetshould be considered by the General Assembly of the United Nations.The resolution which had been tabled would, however, call for respect for the fundamental human rights of the Tibetan people and would imply that the United Nations were seeking to intervene in theinternal affairs of the country. As a Colonial Power we had alwaysmaintained that the United Nations was not competent to passresolutions about human rights in any particular country, and itwould be more difficult for us to maintain this principle in future ifwe supported this resolution. Therefore, despite our sympathy withthe present plight of the Tibetan people, it would be preferable thatthe United Kingdom representative should abstain from voting onthis resolution. There was some risk that our abstention would be misunderstood by public opinion, but our representative could explainin the debate the technical reasons why we could not support theresolution. India was also likely to abstain, in order to avoidantagonising China to such an extent as to encourage her to drawcloser to the Soviet Union.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat, on balance, it would be preferable to abstain from voting on this resolution.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to instruct the United kingdom representative at the United Nations to abstain from voting on the resolution on Tibet.Central 4.   The Foreign Secretary said that, in view of the tense situationAmerica. jn the Caribbean in the summer, the United Kingdom and UnitedSupply of Arms.

The Prime Minister said that, at this first meeting of the new cabinet, he would like to express his gratitude for the services of thetwo Cabinet calleagues who had left the Government Mr. Lennox-Boyd and Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd. He also wished to welcome the two new members of the Cabinet Mr. Heath and Mr. Marples. complex and difficult problems lay ahead, but he was confident that the new cabinet would tackle these in the same spirit of co-operation whichhad characterised the work of the previous Administration.
lead to a general resumption of deliveries of arms to Caribbeancountries, including Dominica. The recent decision of the UnitedStates Government to agree to the sale of transport aircraft andunarmed ships could be defended as consistent with the embargo onthe ground that these were civilian items. On balance, it was Oprobably in our interest to try to maintain the embargo for the timebeing. He proposed to explain the position to the Cuban ambassador and to point out that, if the United Kingdom Government were toagree to the proposed exchange of aircraft, this would lead to the resumption of deliveries of arms to Dominica.In discussion it was argued that a refusal to accede to the Cubanrequest might lead to reprisals against our export trade. Moreover,there was no assurance that other European countries would continueto observe the embargo, or that Cuba would not have recourse to supplies from countries behind the Iron Curtain. A refusal toauthorise the exchange of the aircraft would be easier to justify if theexistence of the embargo were publicly known. Since, however, the cuban Government had not yet made formal representations about this matter, the best course would be for the Foreign Secretary to saythat he would need some days to consider the request. In that event,in order to avoid prejudicing the final decision, it would be preferable for the time being not to make public the existence of the embargo.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider the representations which the Cuban Ambassador might make about theproposed exchange of military aircraft, and to bring thematter forward for further discussion by the Cabinet at alater meeting.legislative programme:1959-60.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 50thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (59) 154) on the legislative Programme for the 1959-60session.The Home Secretary said that the programme of legislation forthe coming session ought, if possible, to be less onerous than that ofrecent session. The eight Bills which were to constitute the main elements of the programme (paragraph 2 of the memorandum),together with the &quot; essential&quot; Bills and such of the &quot; contingent&quot;Bills as became necessary, would occupy most of the parliamentary time available. There was, however, a strong case for the enactmentduring the session of a number of other Bills, mentioned inparagraph 3 of the memorandum, and he proposed that these shouldalso be formally included in the programme. Other desirable bills would not necessarily be excluded if time could be found for them.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Charities Bill, which would be suitable for introduction in the House of Lords, should remain in the programme although itmight not be possible in the event to complete its passage through parliament before the end of the session.(b) If the Charities Bill went forward, there was a good case for including also the Trustee Investments Bill, if the proposals to extend the range of trustee investments were finally approved and time couldbe found for the Bill.(c) Bills to deal with the constitution of the Atomic energy authority and with the licensing of air services and airline operatorsshould be included in the programme.(d) It might be necessary to include also the Reserve and auxiliary Forces Bill and the Trunk Roads (Acquisition of Land)Bill.
The Queen&apos;s 6.  The Cabinet had before them a note by the Home SecretarySpeech on the (q (59) 155) covering a draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the OpeningOpening of of Parliament, and a note by the Minister of Aviation (C. (59) 156)Parliament. proposing an amendment to the draft.In discussion various amendments of the draft Speech were approved.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would submit for theapproval of The Queen a draft of the Speech on the Openingof Parliament, revised on the lines agreed in their discussion.jstematjOEEa!jLaDourOrganisation.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 31stConclusions,Minute 3.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Labour and the Minister of Transport (C. (59) 153) proposing thatthe International Labour Organisation^ Convention No. 108, onSeafarers&apos; National Identity Documents, should be ratified; thatConvention No. 109, on Wages, Hours of Work on Board Ship andManning, should not be ratified but that the related recommendations should be accepted; and that four Recommendations concerning the health, safety and conditions of engagement of seamen should beaccepted.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in C. (59) 153.(2) Authorised the Minister of Labour to arrange for a white paper announcing these decisions to be presented toParliament.british transport commission.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 41stConclusions,Minute 8.)8. The Minister of Transport informed the Cabinet of thedecision of the British Transport Commission to increase all passenger fares on British Railways and some on London Transport from 1st November and to make certain concessions on the fares foroff-peak travel in the London area.In discussion it was suggested that the revenue from the changesin fares now announced would not be sufficient to meet theCommission^ needs and that they would probably find it necessary(e) A good case could be made for the inclusion of theAgricultural Research Council (Superannuation) Bill and theFlooding (Scotland) Bill.(/) Of the &quot; contingent&quot; Bills in List A. 2, the National coal board (Borrowing Powers), International Development Association,Steel Loans and Free Trade Area (Miscellaneous Provisions) bills would probably be required. A Bill to deal with the effect of theRules Publication Act, 1893, might also be necessary and should beadded to List A. 2.(g) The Land Drainage Bill would be controversial and timecould not be found for it in the coming session. The Home AffairsCommittee should consider whether the Government should commit themselves to introducing it in the following session.(h) It was unlikely that time could be found for the MatrimonialProceedings in Magistrates&apos; Courts, Land Powers (Defence) andCrown Estate Bills.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (59) 154 subject to the points noted in paragraphs (a) to (h) above.
to make further increases, possibly accompanied by further concessions, at a later date.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of Transport.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,20th October, 1959.
