The Cabinet also had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Health (C. (59) 126)on the fees to be paid to opticians for dispensing National health service lenses in private frames (hybrid dispensing).SECRET55460-6 b 21. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord privy Seal (C. (59) 125) on the financial structure of the national health Service and the supply of drugs to the private patients ofgeneral practitioners.The Lord Privy Seal said that, at the request of the PrimeMinister, a Committee of Ministers had reviewed the financial structure of the Health Service in order to determine whether its totalcost could be reduced or whether any change could be made, to thebenefit of the Exchequer, in its distribution between contributions,charges and public funds. The Committee had concluded that short of excising parts of the Service, which could not be justified on merits,major economies could not be expected over the next few years; onthe contrary, the cost of the Service must be expected to continue torise. Nor was this an opportune time for a radical revision of thefinancial structure of the Service: in particular, the abolition of thecharges, at an estimated cost of  27^ millions a year, could only bejustified if it were accompanied by a compensating increase of about7d. in the weekly contributions. A recent recommendation of theHinchliffe Committee on the Cost of Prescribing had, however, giventhe Government the opportunity to announce that they were willingto try to reach an agreement with the doctors under which theywould, for a trial period of two years, voluntarily limit the quantity of drugs prescribed and that at the end of the trial period theGovernment would consider abolishing the prescription charge.Discussion showed that there was general agreement with theCommittee&apos;s conclusions. The development of preventive medicineand increased capital investment in the hospital service, which had become urgently necessary, could be expected in time to reduce thecost of the Service but neither of these factors could operate quickly.Changes in the methods of meeting the gross cost in particular, thetransfer of that part of it now met from charges to the weeklycontributions should be considered in due course. Meanwhile, theGovernment could continue to rely on their undertaking to consider,in the circumstances referred to, the abolition of the prescriptioncharge.The Lord Privy Seal said that among Government supportersopinion was divided on the expediency of allowing the private patients of general practitioners to obtain drugs on National health service terms. This concession would cost the Exchequer anadditional  2 millions a year. The Committee had not felt able torecommend that it should be made at the present time.Discussion showed that there was general agreement with this conclusion. If pressure for the concession increased, the government might undertake to consider it at the same time as they consideredthe abolition of the prescription charge; but, as it might be useful tomake the concession in the negotiations on the remuneration of doctors which would follow the report of the Royal Commission,it would be preferable to say only, and without setting a date for the review, that the Government would consider the concession if it wereshown that the present position was endangering the existence ofprivate practice or preventing any substantial number of people fromavailing themselves of it.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in C. (59) 125.
The Minister of Health said that the question of revised fees foropticians under the National Health Service had been resolved by apackage agreement. The first two parts of this agreement anincrease in sight-testing fees and the maintenance of existingdispensing fees had been favourable to the opticians and had beenin force since the end of 1958. The third part a reduction in the feefor hybrid dispensing was the only one unfavourable to the opticiansand was a question on which the Wages Policy Committee had been unable to agree. The Ministers own view was that, partly in justice to the dispensing opticians and more especially in order to avoidprovoking a campaign of criticism against the Government, it was desirable not to insist on a reduction in the hybrid dispensing fee.Discussion showed that opinion in the Cabinet was divided onthis issue. On the one hand, there was a strong logical and economiccase for insisting on the reduction. The package agreement had been based on a factual investigation and the facts themselves, even afterconcessions had been made on their interpretation, would havejustified a reduction in the fee for dispensing National Health Servicespectacles. This fee had been maintained (and the sight-testing feeincreased) on the understanding that the hybrid dispensing fee wouldbe reduced by 20 per cent. If, therefore, having given effect to thefirst two parts of the agreement, the Government failed to insist onthe third, their position would be weakened for the future not onlyin relation to the opticians but in negotiations on remunerationgenerally.On the other hand, the dispensing opticians, who received no benefit even from the first two parts of the package agreement, werein a minority on the opticians&apos; side of the Whitley Council and had,when the agreement was reached, been outvoted by the ophthalmicopticians, who received the benefit of the increased sight-testing fee.For the dispensing opticians, therefore, the proposed reduction would represent a reduction in the remuneration they were at presentreceiving. Therefore, in fairness to them, as well as on grounds ofpolitical expediency, there was a good case for not enforcing thewhole of the agreement. To the extent that the consumer was prepared to pay, a reduction in the hybrid dispensing fee could be passed on to him, but this might increase the cost to the exchequer by inducing more patients to take National Health Service frames.The Prime Minister said that the arguments seemed evenly balanced and should be considered further at a later meeting whenthe Chancellor of the Exchequer was present.The Cabinet (2) Agreed to resume their discussion of C. (59) 126 at a later meeting.agricultural policy.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 41stConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Agriculture (C. (59) 116) and the Chancellor of the Exchequer(C. (59) 127) on the assurances to be given to the farming industry as regards pig production and the removal of tariffs on commoditiesnot covered by guaranteed prices.The Minister of Agriculture said that pig producers in the UnitedKingdom had been seriously alarmed by the undertaking which wehad given in the bilateral negotiations with Denmark to withdraw the bacon tariff if the negotiations at Stockholm led to the establishment
of a European Trade Association. There was a real danger that,following the price policy adopted in recent Annual Reviews, theagreement with Denmark would cause a further decline in pig production. The pig breeding herd had fallen by 16 per cent, in thelast year and ought not to be further reduced. The national farmers&apos; Union (N.F.U.) had asked for a specific assurance that atthe next Review action would be taken to reverse the Governmentspig production policy of recent years and to provide the necessary financial incentives for that purpose. It was clear that, apart fromany alteration in price which would automatically follow changesin the cost of feedingstuffs, it would be undesirable to reduce pigprices at the next Review. He therefore wished to announce, in thecourse of a debate in the House of Commons that afternoon, thatthe Government did not want any further decline in pig breedingand that the guaranteed price of pigs would not be reduced at theAnnual Review in 1960.The agreement with Denmark had also led the farming industryto fear that the Government would if necessary withdraw othertariffs, for example, in the course of any negotiations that might takeplace with the European Economic Community (E.E.C.) for a widerEuropean free trade area. The N.F.U. were also seeking reassuranceon this point. It would be helpful if the Government could announce that, where tariffs were the primary method of support for agriculturalor horticultural products, these would not be withdrawn unlesschanged circumstances made the tariff no longer necessary or unlessbroadly equivalent support were provided to replace the tariff.The Financial Secretary, Treasury, said that an immediateassurance that pig prices would not be reduced at the next Reviewmight stimulate production to an undesirable extent, at considerablecost to the Exchequer. Moreover, an announcement in the terms proposed by the Minister of Agriculture might lead the Danes tobelieve that we had gone back on our undertaking not to frustrate the removal of the tariff by the use of our subsidy policy. It wouldbe preferable to repeat the assurance which had already been given that, in fixing the guaranteed price, no account would be taken of theeffect on the Exchequer of removing the bacon tariff. A generalassurance about removal of tariffs would be potentially a serious embarrassment in any subsequent negotiations between the stockholm Group and the E.E.C. It would be easier to decide how to reply to the representations of the N.F.U. on this point when theresult of the current negotiations in Stockholm was known.In discussion it was pointed out that an assurance that we didnot want any further decline in pig breeding would imply that theGovernments pig production policy would be reversed. This might give the Danes the impression that we had misled them in the recentbilateral negotiations. In that event the discussions at Stockholm,on which the long-term strength of our whole economy might depend,could be seriously prejudiced. The confidence of pig producers was based not so much on an assurance of the Governments generalintentions as on the actual price decisions at the Review. Anannouncement that the price would not be reduced next year oughttherefore to be a sufficient reassurance by itself.On the other hand it was argued that the confidence of pigproducers had been shaken by the undertaking to remove the bacontariff. In the negotiations with Denmark, United Kingdom ministers had specifically reserved their right to determine annually the guaranteed price for pigs. It would indeed be possible, having regardto cost and other considerations, to increase pig prices at the nextReview. The level of the pig breeding herd was lower than desirable,and might not recover unless the confidence of producers wererestored.   In these circumstances it would not be unreasonable to
Diaries of 3.   The Home Secretary said that, since the Cabinets discussionRoger on 17th March, he had given further consideration to the disposalCasement.      0f Roger Casements diaries, in consultation with the Lord Chancellor,(Previous        the Commonwealth Secretary and the Attorney-General.  In the reference:      result they had all concluded that the best course would be to transferC.C. (59) 17th   the diaries to the Public Record Office and to allow access to themConclusions,    there by persons who proved to the satisfaction of the Home OfficeMinute 4.)       that they needed to see them for purposes of historical research, orhad made a serious study of Casements life, or were qualified toexpress an informed opinion on the authenticity of the diaries.  Itwould be made clear that any person proposing to publish the diaries,in whole or in part, would do so at his own risk, having regard to thelaw of copyright and of obscenity. the Cabinet Agreed that the diaries of Roger Casement should betransferred to the Public Record Office on the basis proposedby the Home Secretary.make it clear to producers that, in the Governments view, the present level of production should be maintained.   Provided that it was also made clear that production should only be maintained at a levek&quot;)which was efficient, such an assurance ought not to be taken by the danes to imply that pig production policy was to be reversed.After further discussion it was agreed that the Minister ofAgriculture should give an assurance in the following terms in thecourse of the debate that afternoon:  &quot; I want farmers to be quite clear about the governments intention. We want to maintain pig production on an efficient basis.For that purpose, as was done in the case of the price of fat cattle for1957-58, I can now say that we have decided that in the AnnualPrice Review next year the standard price for pigs will not be reduced,except of course for any adjustment which would follow automaticallyfrom changes in feed costs.&quot;The Prime Minister said that if any assurance were to be given on tariffs generally it should be in specific terms. Consideration ofthis question should be postponed until the Chancellor of theExchequer had returned from Stockholm and the prospects for theestablishment of a European Trade Association and the possibilityof subsequent negotiations with the E.E.C. could be more clearlyassessed. Meanwhile, nothing should be said on this point either in the debate that day or in reply to the N.F.U.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Agriculture, in the debate in theHouse of Commons that afternoon, to give an assuranceon pig production in the terms approved in their discussion.(2) Agreed to resume at their next meeting their considerationof the question of an assurance to the farming industry on tariffs generally.
Parliament. 5.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Parliament would be adjourned for the summer recess on30th July. It would be announced, before the recess, that parliament would reassemble on 29th October and be prorogued on the same day; and that the new session would be opened on 3rd November.0    Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,21st July, 1959.Legislative 4.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Lord programme:    prjVy Seal (C. (59) 121) on the legislative programme for the 1959-601959-60.        session of Parliament.The Lord Privy Seal said that, at a period in the life of a parliament when at the most only part of a session remained beforeDissolution, it was impossible to construct a programme of future legislation in the normal way. Nevertheless, if the Government wereto be in a position to introduce any legislation in the next session,preliminary work on drafting needed to be done and for this purpose the Future Legislation Committee, on the working assumption of asession of normal length, had prepared lists of Bills (annexed toC. (59) 121) to which they proposed that drafting priority should begiven. Drafting of some of these Bills was already in progress and,if the Cabinet approved the Committee&apos;s proposals, preparation ofthose in the higher categories should be expedited. The &quot; essential &quot;Bills in List A. 1 and the &quot; main programme Bills&quot; in List B. 1,together with such of the &quot; contingent &quot; Bills in List A. 2 as became necessary and possibly some of the &quot; other programme Bills &quot; in list B. 2 could be expected to keep Parliament fully occupied and,if it were finally decided to introduce them, would constitute a reasonably attractive programme.In discussion there was general agreement with these proposals,subject to the following points:  (a) The International Headquarters and Defence OrganisationsBill might be promoted from List C to List B. 2. It was expected tobe ready for introduction at the beginning of the session.(b) A Bill to enable wages to be paid by cheque, which couldbe drafted in a short time, might be included in List B. 2.(c) A Bill to control caravans and caravan sites, at present in list C, would almost certainly be necessary and should be promotedto List B. 2.(d) Ministers who were not members of the Cabinet should begiven the opportunity to put the case for promotion of their Billsfrom lower to higher categories.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Privy Seal, as Chairman of the future legislation Committee, to give Ministers who were not members of the Cabinet the opportunity to seek the promotion of their Bills from lower to higher categoriesin the Annex to C. (59) 121.(2) Subject to any further proposals made in accordance with conclusion (1) and to the points raised in their discussion,approved the proposals in C. (59) 121.
