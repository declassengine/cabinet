National 2.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theAssistance. Minister of Pensions and National Insurance (C. (59) 93) covering(Previous drafts of a White Paper, and of a statement to be made orally in reference: Parliament, announcing increases in the rates of national assistanceC.C. (59) 30th and adjustments of the limits below which various types of incomeConclusions, may be disregarded in assessing an applicants need.Mlllute3-) The Minister of National Insurance said that these documentshad been prepared on the assumption that the proposed changes would be formally recommended by the National Assistance Board,which was meeting for that purpose on 10th June. In that event hewould make the proposed announcement, present the White paper and lay the regulations on 15th June; and the legislation would beintroduced on the following day. It should then be possible to pass the Bill before the summer recess and to bring all the changes intooperation early in September.The CabinetS discussion turned mainly on the terms of theproposed announcement. Some doubt was expressed about the expediency of stating that persons in need were &quot; entitled as of rightto assistance &quot;; and after discussion it was agreed that it would be preferable to say, in this part of the statement, that &quot; in our societyto-day assistance when in need, according to the provision made byParliament, is the acknowledged right of the citizen.&quot; Some minorchanges in the wording of the proposed statement were also approved.the view was also expressed that, if any stigma was thought to attach to the receipt of national assistance, changes in the terminologyof its administration would not suffice to remove it. Past experiencesuggested that any new terminology would soon come to carry thesame connotations as the old. Nevertheless it was agreed that theseproposed changes should be made as a concession to popularsentiment.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals made by the Minister of national insurance in C. (59) 93 for giving effect to the changesin national assistance which the National assistance board were expected to recommend.(2) Authorised the Minister of National Insurance to presentin due course a White Paper in the terms of the draft annexed to C. (59) 93, and to make an announcement ofthe Governments decision in the terms of the draft statement annexed to C. (59) 93, subject to the amendments approved in their discussion.Pensions. 3,   The Cabinet considered whether an early announcementHigher should be made of the Governments intention to increase the judiciary. pensions of members of the higher judiciary. They were informed(Previous that this question had not in fact been raised in the debate in the reference: House of Commons on the Second Reading of the Pensions (Increase)C.C. (59) 25th Bill, but that it was likely to be raised when that Bill was underConclusions, discussion in the House of Lords. They therefore agreed that, in minute 4.) moving the Second Reading of the Bill in the Lords, the LordChancellor should take the opportunity of announcing that theGovernment had decided to increase the pensions of members of the parliament. 1.   The Cabinet discussed the business to be taken in the House0 of Commons in the following week.
higher judiciary and that, although the legislation necessary for thatpurpose could not be enacted in the current session, they intendedto introduce it at the earliest subsequent opportunity. The Cabinetfurther agreed that, if the question were raised earlier during theCommittee Stage of the Bill in the Commons, this statement mightbe made then by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury.The Cabinet -Invited the Lord Chancellor to settle, in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, the terms of a statement to be made, either on the Second Reading of the Pensions(Increase) Bill in the House of Lords or on the committee stage in the House of Commons if the matter were raisedthen, announcing the Governments decision to introduce legislation in a subsequent session to increase the pensions of members of the higher judiciary.Kenya.(previous reference :C.C. (58) 85thConclusions,Minute 6.)HolaDetentionCamp.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of State for Colonial Affairs (C. (59) 92) on the eventsleading up lo the death by violence on 3rd March of 11 Mau Mauprisoners detained in the hold Camp in Kenya.The Minister of State for Colonial Affairs said that on that date85 prisoners had been taken out of the camp under escort to workon digging a trench. On their refusal to work they had been beatenby warders, with the result that 11 had been killed and 23 seriously injured. As part of the process of rehabilitating the prisoners in thiscamp, a senior superintendent in the Kenya Prison Service,Mr. Cowan, had drawn up a plan which &quot; assumed that the party of detainees would obey the order to go to work but, should theyrefuse to work, they would be manhandled to the site of work and forced to carry out the task.&quot; This plan had been approved by the kenya Minister of Defence, without reference to the Governor, butit had not been seen by Mr. Sullivan, the Camp Commandant whowas to be responsible for putting the plan into effect. The use of force to compel detainees to work was illegal, but the Kenya government maintained that Mr. Cowan&apos;s plan must be read inconjunction with the Prison Standing Orders and Ordinances, which made it clear that men could not be forcibly made to work by beatingthem. There was no evidence that the oral instructions given byMr. Cowan to Mr. Sullivan contemplated the beating of the detainees.Moreover, Mr. Sullivan had disobeyed his instructions in failing toinform the detainees in advance that they were to be put to work andin taking them to the site of work in a single large party instead ofa number of small groups. It was also open to question whether theorders on the use of force which he had given to the warders incharge of the party were within the law. A senior examiningmagistrate had conducted a full enquiry into the incident and had found that some of the force used was illegal. But the survivingdetainees had refused to give evidence and the magistrate, whosefindings had subsequently been accepted by the Attorney-Generalof Kenya, had concluded that there was not sufficient evidence tojustify the prosecution of Mr. Sullivan or any of the prison officersunder his orders. The Kenya Government had instituted disciplinaryproceedings against Mr. Sullivan and his assistant, the findings ofwhich would be published as soon as they became available towardsthe end of the present month. A strong independent committee had also been appointed to advise on the future administration of the detention camps; and the Kenya Government were considering whether an enquiry should also be held into the incidence of scurvyin the camps, which the medical evidence suggested might have contributed to the deaths of the 11 detainees.   Meanwhile, the
Education.(previous references :C.C. (59) 32ndConclusions,Minute 5 andC.C. (59) 30thConclusions,Minute 7.)Teachers&apos;Salaries.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Education (C. (59) 94) on teachers&apos; salaries.The Minister of Education said that, with the authority of thePrime Minister, he had advised the Local Authorities Panel of the burnham Committee that, while the Government would be preparedto accept an increase of  15 millions in the teachers&apos; salary bill, theywere unable to approve a basic salary scale with a higher minimumthan  510. The Panel had none the less made a final offer of a basicscale with a minimum of  520 rising to  1,000.  This had beenOpposition had tabled a Motion of Censure on the Government, andit was known that it was their intention, when this was debated, topress especially the argument that the Kenya Government had authorised the use of illegal force.In discussion it was recognised that a distinction must be drawn between the responsibility of Mr. Sullivan and his subordinates andthat of the senior officers of the Kenya Prison Service and the Kenya government itself.On the first point, discussion showed that the preponderantopinion in the Cabinet was that the available evidence was insufficient to justify the institution of criminal proceedings against individuals,and that no further enquiry instituted by the United KingdomGovernment was likely to secure enough evidence for that purpose.But it was clear that Mr. Sullivan had been present at the killing ofthe detainees and further evidence bearing on his responsibility fortheir death might emerge from the disciplinary proceedings against him, which were to begin that day. No final decision on the positionof Mr. Sullivan and his subordinates could therefore be taken untilthe result of the disciplinary proceedings was known. The opposition had been unwilling to defer their Censure Motion on that accountbecause these proceedings were, in accordance with regular practice,to be conducted in private.On the second point, it was recognised that action taken againstsubordinate officers of the Kenya Prison Service would not in any event suffice to allay the public anxiety which this incident hadaroused in this country. The general feeling of the Cabinet was thaton the considerations then before them the Government would notbe able to defend the action of the Kenya Government but shouldconcede that the Cowan plan ought never to have been formulatedor approved. It was therefore for consideration whether the UnitedKingdom Government should assert its authority over theGovernment of Kenya or, alternatively, should institute some formof enquiry into the whole conduct of the Kenya Government inrelation to the detention camps. In addition to the primary issue ofthe use of force on these detainees, such an enquiry might also cover the incidence of scurvy in the camp and the unfounded statement issued by the Kenya Government immediately after the events on 3rd March that the deaths of the detainees were attributable to thedrinking of contaminated water.The Prime Minister said that he would prefer to postpone furtherconsideration of these aspects of the matter until he had been ableto discuss them with the Colonial Secretary after his return to thiscountry.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that debate on the Censure Motion tabled by theOpposition in the House of Commons should be deferred until 15th June.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a later meeting afterthe Colonial Secretary&apos;s return to the United Kingdom.
rejected by the teachers; and, as a deadlock had now been reached,he had offered to go to the meeting of the Burnham Committee whichwas to be held on the following day. He proposed, at that meeting,to make the statement set out in the Annex to C. (59) 94. Thisdeployed the general arguments of national economic policy whichhad moved the Government to take the view that the increase inthe basic minimum should not go beyond  510. To rest theGovernments case at this stage on the educational reasons fordiscriminating against the minimum of the scale in favour of aproportionately higher maximum and improved differentials mightbe inadvisable, since, by tradition, the Minister did not intervene inthe proceedings of the Burnham Committee on matters of detail.It would, however, be appropriate to use these educational argumentsif, as was possible, the teachers were to claim that their case for aminimum of  520 was supported by the increase in national productivity. It was possible that the pressures to which the teacherswere being subjected might lead them to accept a settlementsatisfactory to the Government: if so, it might be desirable not to expose the Governments case in too detailed or provocative a manner.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, by convention, the awards of the Burnham Committee were made at three-yearly intervals. Since the last major settlement in October 1956, the costof living had increased by 7 per cent, and national productivity by per cent. Teachers had already received an interim increase of5 per cent, in January 1959. Taking this into account, basic minimaof  510 or  520 would represent increases of 1\ per cent, or % percent., respectively, over the 1956 levels. Moreover, the average increase in remuneration represented by an addition of  15 millions to the total salary bill was no less than 11 per cent. On this basis the offer which the Government were prepared to approve was farfrom ungenerous: indeed, public emphasis on the figure of 11 percent, might prejudice the Governments general wages policy, as might undue reliance on arguments resting on national productivity.The draft statement should be amended to take account of these points; and consideration might perhaps be given to the possibilityof deploying the educational, rather than the economic, arguments for a minimum of  510.In discussion it was agreed that the draft statement should be amended in the sense suggested. There would, in particular, be advantage if the paragraph dealing with productivity considerations were omitted, and the preceding paragraph strengthened as necessary.This would remove a possible source of difficulty with the teachers,who might otherwise be favourably disposed to agree to a settlement.The Cabinet -Invited the Minister of Education, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to revise the statement whichhe proposed to make at the meeting of the burnham committee on the following day on the lines agreed in discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,4th June, 1959.
