Germany.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 20thConclusions,Minute 2.)WashingtonMeeting of north atlantic council.*2. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet of the courseof the discussions, at the Washington meeting of the North atlantic council, about the policy to be followed by the Western Powers in theforthcoming international negotiations on the problem of Berlin.Three points of difference had emerged in those discussions:  First, there was the question whether the Western Powers should put forward a new phased plan for the reunification of Germany, orcontinue to argue in favour of the proposals put forward in 1955. Anew plan had been worked out by officials, but the GermanGovernment had not yet defined their attitude towards it. TheForeign Secretary thought there would be tactical advantage inputting forward new proposals, even though there was no earlyprospect of the reunification of Germany; and he would continue topress that view in the course of the further preparations for theforthcoming meeting of Foreign Ministers.Secondly, agreement had not yet been reached on the expediency of putting forward proposals for a limitation of forces and weapons in an agreed area in Europe. The misunderstandings to which thissuggestion had originally given rise had been largely removed; andthe German Government seemed to be prepared to consider thesuggestion, provided that the area was not defined by reference to national frontiers and that the plan was put forward in connexion withsome political initiative for easing international tension.Thirdly, the Council had not resolved the question whether this opportunity should be taken to negotiate a new international agreement on the status of West Berlin. Those Governments whopreferred the alternative course of standing on existing rights hadbeen assured that it would be possible to put forward proposals for anew agreement without abandoning the existing rights. They nowunderstood that the new proposals could be expressed as beingwithout prejudice to existing rights, but the German Governmentwere still apprehensive about such an approach, and were not atpresent in a mood to support constructive proposals.The Foreign Secretary said that officials of the four governments would resume their consultations in London on 13th April, in preparation for a Ministerial meeting in Paris on 29th April. Inthose consultations we should continue to press for a greater measureof flexibility in the Western position; and we should, in particular,urge the German Government to adopt a more constructive attitudetowards the forthcoming negotiations. In this we could look forsome support from the United States Government.In discussion reference was made to the speech made by theGerman Chancellor on 8th April, in which he had alleged thatAnglo-German relations were being impaired by a spirit of hostility to Germany which was being shown in certain sections of the british press. It was agreed that there was little foundation for thiscomplaint.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.
3. The Foreign Secretary recalled that the Defence Committeehad recently agreed (D. (59) 4th Meeting, Minute 2) that, subject tothe satisfactory outcome of consultations with the Governments ofthe United States, Canada, Turkey, Iran and Pakistan, the iraqi government should be informed that we were willing to meet their request for the supply of certain heavy weapons (notably Centuriontanks and Canberra aircraft). This decision had been reached in thehope that an offer to supply these arms would strengthen the positionof the Iraqi Prime Minister (General qassim&apos;s) and help to prevent thegrowth of Communist influence in Iraq. The Governments consultedhad all agreed that the arms should be supplied. Turkey, in particular,was strongly in favour of this gesture; and Iran (whose position wouldbe seriously affected if Iraq came under Communist domination) had also agreed. Recent developments, however, made it more doubtfulwhether the offer should be made. General qassim&apos;s seemed to befalling increasingly under Communist influence. And, although the iraqi Army was still in general control, the abortive revolution inMosul had weakened the moderate influences in Iraq. If the offerwere made, it would inevitably become public knowledge. In viewof the trend of events in Iraq this would provoke a strong reaction from the Egyptian Government, and would also be likely to arousepublic criticism in this country.These new orders for heavy weapons could not in any case bemet for about eighteen months. He was therefore disposed toauthorise H.M. Ambassador in Baghdad to suggest to GeneralQassim that, in these circumstances, it would be in the interests ofboth Governments to postpone a decision on these new orders for thetime being. Meanwhile, certain other categories of arms, such asammunition and spare parts for weapons which Iraq had alreadyobtained from us, would continue to be supplied.Discussion showed that there was general agreement that, in allthe circumstances, it would be preferable to postpone the decision about the supply of heavy arms to Iraq, and, if possible, to secure theconcurrence of General qassim&apos;s to that course.The Cabinet were also informed that the discussions which werein progress between representatives of the Iraq Petroleum company and the Iraqi Government concerned a revision of the terms of thecompany&apos;s loan to Iraq and the possibility of the construction of anew pipeline which would provide for the transit of Iraqi oil without going through Syria. There was as yet no indication that the iraqi government were contemplating the nationalisation of the Company.The Cabinet Agreed that it would be expedient to postpone for the timebeing a decision to meet the request of the Iraqi Governmentfor the supply of heavy weapons.middle east.Iraq.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 20thConclusions,Minute 3.)Supplyof Arms.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (59) 62) outlining a scheme for assisting the cotton textile industry by means of Government grants for the elimination of redundant capacity and for re-equipment and modernisation.The Prime Minister said that a preliminary discussion by theMinisters concerned had shown that there was general agreement thatthe President of the Board of Trade should put forward a scheme, onthe lines of that set out in the memorandum, at the meeting whichhe was to have with representatives of the industry on 13th April.The scheme did not cover the question of redundant labour. Itwould be necessary for the industry itself to work out, in agreementCotton.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 11thConclusions,Minute 6.)
3SCRZ75with the Trades Unions concerned, the principles of a plan for providing compensation to redundant workers and to find the money for such compensation. It would also be necessary to set up an agency to supervise and operate the whole scheme. These functionscould best be discharged by the Cotton Board. Grants forre-equipment and modernisation would be subject to a number of conditions, but it would be unwise to prescribe any elaborate systemof technical scrutiny of the projects which firms would submit.Instead, it might be better to set up an advisory body which mightform part of, or work in close conjunction with, the proposed Agency.Representatives of the appropriate Research Associations might serve on this advisory body, which would be concerned with the technicaladvancement of the industry.The points in the scheme which had not been finally decidedwere the rates of the proposed Government grants and the characterof the legislation necessary to establish this scheme. The industry had asked for a Government grant of 80 per cent, of the cost of eliminatingredundant capacity (the total cost of which they estimated would be 30 millions), and 50 per cent, of the cost of re-equipment (which theyestimated would be  80 millions spread over a period of five years).The President of the Board of Trade believed that the co-operationof the industry could be secured if the Government grant forredundancy were 66f per cent., and for re-equipment 25 per cent.;but the Chancellor of the Exchequer had been reluctant to offer morethan 50 per cent, for redundancy and 20 per cent, for re-equipment.The industry had also asked for a measure of retrospection in the caseof re-equipment grants for the weaving industry and for special loanfacilities, but there was general agreement that these requests shouldbe refused. The industry&apos;s estimates of the cost of redundancy andre-equipment were almost certainly inflated; and the percentage grantsmight not in the end cost the Exchequer as much as was at present estimated. If there were a good prospect of obtaining an agreed settlement with the industry, there was much to be said for offeringGovernment grants at the higher percentages.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that payment ofGovernment grants totalling  30- 40 millions to meet the difficultiesof a single industry might be a dangerous precedent. This appliedparticularly to the grants for re-equipment and modernisation, since these might be thought to imply that the Government assumed someresponsibility for the size and efficiency of the industry in the future.The total sum involved was large and the industry would in additionbe getting the benefit of investment allowances on account of their expenditure for re-equipment. He feared that, in the process of negotiation, it might not be possible to secure the co-operation of theindustry even at the higher figures recommended by the Presidentof the Board of Trade. It was most important to avoid any increasebeyond that. But if it were necessary, in order to secure theco-operation of the industry, to offer Government grants of 66f percent, for redundancy and 25 per cent, for re-equipment, he would beprepared to agree to these figures.The Cabinet then considered what would be the best method of negotiation with the industry. The President of the Board of trade said that he proposed to take informal soundings of the Chairmanof the Cotton Board (Lord Rochdale) before the formal negotiationswith the industry began. He might recommend the Government tomake a firm offer of the maximum figures at the beginning of the negotiation. As regards that part of the offer which was related toredundancy, it might be wiser and more economical to offer, not a percentage figure, but a maximum sum of  20 millions, saying thatthis should be sufficient to provide two-thirds of the redundancy costof each unit.
In discussion there was support for the view that the initialGovernment offer should leave some room for negotiation. It was,however, recognised that on this point Lord Rochdale&apos;s advice wouldbe specially valuable.The Cabinet (1) Approved the scheme proposed in C. (59) 62, on the basis that the Government grant for redundancy should be notmore than  20 millions, and for re-equipment not morethan 25 per cent, of the total cost.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to take informal soundings of the Chairman of the Cotton Board and thereafter to conduct negotiations with the representativesof the cotton industry in the light of the cabinets discussion; and to keep the Prime Minister and theChancellor of the Exchequer informed of the progressof those discussions.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,9th April, 1959.
