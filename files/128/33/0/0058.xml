Supply of 1   xhe Foreign Secretary said that since the Cabinet&apos;s meeting a**&quot;s&apos; on 5tjj November he had made further representations to the United(Previous States Government regarding the Cuban request for authority to reference: exchange a number of Sea Fury aircraft for Hunter jet aircraft. HeC.C. (59) 56th was still awaiting a reply to these representations: but, when it was conclusions, received, it might be necessary to take a prompt decision on the CubanMmute 7.) request. The considerations either way were fairly evenly balanced,Central and there would be no great difficulty in justifying either a favourableAmerica. or an unfavourable decision to Parliament and to public opinion inthis country. In these circumstances the Cabinet might be willing toagree that, if a decision had to be taken before their next meeting, itmight be left to him and the Prime Minister to take it.The Cabinet Agreed that, if time did not permit further reference to theCabinet, the Prime Minister and the Foreign secretary should determine on their behalf whether authority shouldbe given for the export of a number of Hunter aircraft toCuba.Parliament 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Police- 3.   The Home Secretary said that there was to be a debate in theHouse of Commons on the following day on an Opposition Motionrelating to an action (Garratt v. Eastmond) which had been brought against a constable of the Metropolitan Police for alleged assault andwrongful arrest. The case had been settled for  300 without anyadmission of liability. In accordance with well-established precedents,the cost of the constable&apos;s defence and of the settlement had been met from public funds. The Home Secretary proposed to take the line that this has been an ordinary case before the courts, in which it wouldbe improper for him to intervene. On the question of discipline, theCommissioner of Police had withdrawn the constable concerned fromduties in which he was likely to have contact with the public but had decided not to take disciplinary action against him. This decision was one for the Commissioner, in which the Home Secretary couldnot intervene.The Home Secretary went on to say that he had been for sometime considering the institution of a general enquiry into the police,including their relations with the public, their pay and conditions ofservice and the powers and duties of police authorities. There was evidence of public disquiet at some aspects of police administration,and there was reason to think that both the Police Federation and theAssociation of Chief Constables would welcome such an enquiry.The debate on the following day would provide him with a convenient opportunity to announce his intention of discussing the institution ofsuch an enquiry with the Opposition and the Governments supporters in Parliament. It would not of course be appropriate to give any detailed indication of the scope of such an enquiry before these discussions had taken place, or to give a definite commitment to setit up.In discussion it was recognised that there had in recent years been a change in the relations between the police and the public,which made some form of enquiry desirable. Apprehension was,however, expressed that in a comprehensive enquiry on the lines contemplated by the Home Secretary the emphasis would concentrateunduly on pay and conditions of service, so that the public would remain less than satisfied on the wider issues.   On the other hand,
renewed claims must be expected in any event and there was a good case for a review of pay and conditions, though this might perhaps be made the subject of a separate enquiry.Summing up the discussion, The Prime Minister said that theCabinet were in agreement with the line which the Home secretary proposed to take in this debate. They were also prepared to contemplate some kind of general enquiry into the police which would cover their relations with the public and the functions of the police authorities. It would be preferable to avoid any undertaking that this enquiry should cover pay and conditions although, if he were pressed, the Home Secretary might say that he did not necessarilyexclude the possibility of some enquiry into those matters.The Cabinet (1) Took note with approval of the line to be taken by the HomeSecretary in the debate on the case of Garratt v.Eastmond.(2) Authorised the Home Secretary, after further consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretaryof State for Scotland, to indicate that the Governmentwere considering the possibility of a general enquiry intothe police, on the lines indicated by the Prime minister in summing up the Cabinefs discussion.4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C. (59) 167 and 168) covering a draft of theConvention for the European Free Trade Association (E.F.T.A.) and explaining the points which remained to be settled at the forthcoming meeting in Stockholm of Ministers from the countries concerned.In the Cabinefs discussion of the outstanding points the followingviews were expressed :  (i) Majority Voting. There was general agreement that it wouldbe preferable that majority decisions of the E.F.T.A. Council should require only four affirmative votes.(ii) Fish. We had offered to remove the 10 per cent, tariff onfrozen fish fillets over a ten-year period, subject to our retaining theright to withdraw the tariff reduction if imports from the scandinavian countries exceeded 20,000 tons a year, and the right to reconsider the concession in the event of a fundamental change in the conditions of competition (which we interpreted to cover any international agreement for an extension of fishing limits). This offer had not yetbeen accepted by the Norwegian Government. It was possible thatthey would press us at the Stockholm meeting to increase the limit of quantity to 25,000 tons a year, or to withdraw or modify thecondition protecting our position in the event of an extension of fishing limits. It was also likely that the Norwegians would repeattheir request to us for an undertaking not to increase the tariff onfresh fish.The Minister of Agriculture said that he thought it important that we should maintain our position on all these points. We had undertaken to make a statement at the Stockholm meeting that itwas not our present intention to increase the tariff on fresh fish or tointroduce a quota. To go beyond this, and to give a definiteundertaking that we would not do so, would not only be highlyunwelcome to the fishing industry, but would set a precedent for similar undertakings on horticultural tariffs in any subsequent negotiations with the European Economic Community (E.E.C.). Toincrease the quantity of frozen fish imports beyond 20,000 tons would revive anxieties in the fishing industry which had to someCommercialPolicy.European FreeTradeAssociation.(previous reference:C.C.

61G1 ff&quot;1   v4 IT55. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (59) 169) about pigmeat imports.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the canadian government were pressing for a substantial import quota for pigmeat,in order to dispose of some of their stocks of surplus frozen pork.They had rejected our previous offer of a quota of 10,000 tonsconditional on the establishment of the European Free trade association (E.F.T.A.). The bacon tariff concession which we had offered to Denmark in the preliminary negotiations for the E.F.T.A.,and the recent further step in the relaxation of restrictions on imports,provided the Canadian Government with strong arguments. Theirhope was to regain their traditional position as an exporter of pigmeatextent been allayed. Moreover, we had been informed by NorwegianMinisters that they were interested not so much in the quantity as inthe value of this concession as a precedent in subsequent negotiations with they might have with E.E.C. countries.It was the general view of the Cabinet that we should try not togo beyond the concessions which we were already prepared to make on fish. If, in the course of the negotiations in Stockholm, theChancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Tradethought that some modification of this position might be desirable,they should seek further instructions from the Cabinet.(iii) Site. The other countries concerned were likely to considerthat the headquarters of the Association should be established inParis. Apart from the practical arguments in its favour the choice of Paris would show that the Association supported the organisation for European Economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.) and were not seeking to keep apart from the European Economic Community.On the other side it was argued that it might seem curious if this association, which was originally designed as a counterpoise to theE.E.C., were established in Paris. In any event it was possible thatthe E.E.C. might move their headquarters to Brussels. It was also suggested that too close an association with the headquarters ofO.E.E.C. might be undesirable on security grounds.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat we should seek a postponement of the final decision about the site of the headquarters of the Association until the Convention hadbeen ratified. Meanwhile, any necessary preparatory work couldbe carried out on a temporary basis in Stockholm or London, or indeed in Paris. But it was recognised that, if all the other countries concerned were resolved that the permanent headquarters should beestablished in Paris, it would not be expedient for us to dissent.(iv) Origin Questions. The Cabinet took note that there were certain commodities for which origin rules were not yet settled, andthey agreed that the delegation should be authorised to reach the bestbargain they could on these matters bearing in mind the particular interests of the cotton industry.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Presidentof the Board of Trade, in the forthcoming negotiations at stockholm, to maintain the present offer on fish and to seek further instructions from the Cabinet if they thoughtthat any additional concession on fish should beconsidered.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1) above, approved therecommendations put forward in C. (59) 168.
to this country and in due course to market here between 50,000 and100,000 tons of pigmeat a year, mostly in the form of bacon. Therewould be some advantage in accepting supplies of Canadian frozenpork at the present time; but the prospect of growing imports of canadian bacon would seriously alarm the producers and curers inthis country, unless they could rely on a compensating reduction inthe supplies from other countries. Moreover, an increase in baconimports would be likely to add substantially to the burden of the deficiency payments on the Exchequer. It had also to be borne inmind that, even after the Canadian Government had introduced anew system of deficiency payments, it was likely that there would bean element of subsidy in exports of Canadian pigmeat. A com-compensating reduction in bacon imports could be secured by reducingthe Polish quota, beginning in 1960. But this would be contraryto our present policy of developing trade with Eastern Europe,which was particularly important at a time when our exports to thecountries of the European Economic Community might decline.Such a reduction would also have political disadvantages so far as concerned our relations with Poland.The Minister of Agriculture said that he recognised the force ofthe Canadian arguments. He would be ready to agree that a quota of 25,000 tons of North American frozen pork, which would inpractice be taken up by Canada alone, should be established, andthat future arrangements should be discussed next year. But thiswas dependent on and complementary to reducing the quotas forpigmeat from East European countries. For this purpose the quota for Polish bacon and ham should be reduced from 48,500 tons in thepresent year to a minimum of 30,000 tons in 1960. 20,000 tons ofthis amount could be supplied in the first six months, and thepossibility of an increase for the remainder of 1960 could be reviewedlater.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in agreement that itwould not be possible to admit any considerable quantity of pigmeatfrom Canada without reducing supplies from East european countries. It was the view of the Cabinet that, while it was not tobe expected that restrictions on agricultural imports could be relaxedin the same way as those of other imports, there was a good case for increasing imports of Canadian bacon and reducing imports of Polishbacon, if this change in the pattern of supply could be effectedgradually.The Prime Minister said that the establishment of a quota of25,000 tons of frozen pork should be represented to the canadian government as a considerable concession, particularly in view of the continuing element of subsidy. It should be explained to the canadians that to remove the restrictions on the import of theirbacon would entail adjusting the pattern of our supplies, and thatthis could only be done gradually. In order to effect this, we should try to negotiate a quota with Poland limited to six months, for whichperiod the quantity might be 20,000 tons; and we should make itclear that it was likely that this amount would have to be reduced in the succeeding six months.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that a quota of 25,000 tons of North American frozenpork should be established, and that future arrangementsfor imports of North American pigmeat should be left for later discussion, on the lines indicated by the PrimeMinister in summing up the discussion.(2) Agreed that, in the forthcoming negotiations with Poland,the aim should be to limit the quota for pigmeat to oneof 20,000 tons for the first six months of 1960, and to makeit clear that quotas for subsequent periods were likely tobe smaller.
Company Law. 7 The President of the Board of Trade said that he proposedto make an early announcement to Parliament that he would set up an independent enquiry into the working of the legislation whichregulated the creation, operation and dissolution of companies(namely, the Companies Act, the Prevention of Fraud (Investment)Act, and the Business Names Act). The review would take abouteighteen months to complete. After consultation with the LordChancellor, he had it in mind to recommend that Lord Jenkins shouldbe invited to be the Chairman.In addition to this review, there were certain related matters inwhich the Government were already taking action. The treasury were preparing revised legislation to deal with Building Societies andwere studying whether steps could be taken to protect the interestsof those from whom companies, partnerships or individuals soliciteddeposits. There was also the question whether the Stock Exchangeshould review its existing system of checks and scrutiny oncompanies. The statement on the review of company legislation should refer to these related matters.The Cabinet Invited the President of the Board of Trade to circulate tothe Cabinet the draft of his proposed statement on thesematters.Bank Notes. 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (59) 171) about the introductionof bank notes of a new design.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that it had beenpublicly announced in July 1956 that The Queen had grantedpermission for the preparation of new designs for a series of banknotes incorporating her portrait. The Governor of the Bank ofEngland proposed that the range of denominations should also beextended by the introduction of a  2 note in 1960 and there introduction of a  10 note at a later stage. This wider range wouldbe convenient to the public, would save considerable time and effort in banks and similar institutions, and would secure some saving tothe Exchequer by reducing the number of notes printed each year.The new 10s.,  1 and  2 notes would be of the same size and a littlesmaller than the present  1 note; the new  5 and  10 notes would bethe same size as the present  1 note. Distinctive colours would beused for the different denominations. The new series would beintroduced with a new  1 note early in 1960, the new  2 note would follow in the middle of that year, the new 10s. note in 1961, and the 5 and  10 notes as soon as possible thereafter.Discussion showed that the Cabinet approved these proposalsso far as they concerned the designs and sizes of the existingdenominations, and that they were also in favour of the reintroduction of a  10 note. Doubts were expressed about the proposal tointroduce a  2 note, on the ground that this innovation was unnecessary, might be unpopular, and might appear to emphasise thefall in the value of money. It was suggested that it would be preferable to encourage greater use of the  5 note, and to reintroducethe  10 note at an earlier date.The Cabinet Approved the proposals for new designs for the 10s.,  1and  5 notes, and for the reintroduction of a  10 note; butagreed that a  2 denomination should not be introduced.
Agii-kijMiKal The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePolicy. Minister of Agriculture (C. (59) 170) on his proposals for legislation(Previous       on land drainage.Reference:C.C. (59) 47th The Minister of Agriculture said that these proposals had been conclusions, approved by the Home Affairs Committee. They were lessMinute 3.) far-reaching than the recommendations of the Heneage Committee on land Drainage. Land Drainage, which had reported in 1951. They would empowerRiver Boards in England and Wales to levy a general drainage charge on occupiers of all agricultural land within their areas which wasoutside internal drainage districts. The charge would be the approximate equivalent of the Boards&apos; precept on the county rates,to which agricultural land did not contribute; but in areas of specialagricultural need there would be an additional charge, subject to theapproval of the Minister, such that the two charges together did not amount to more than one shilling in the   on the gross annual value for Schedule A tax. These proposals had been agreed with the fourprincipal associations concerned, including the National Farmers&apos;Union. There was reason to think that, while some local oppositionmust be expected, they would be acceptable to the governments supporters in Parliament. The Cabinet had decided that time couldnot be found in the current session for the legislation to give effect tothem but, in order that the agreement reached might not be lost, he sought authority for an early announcement of the governments intentions.Discussion showed that there was general agreement with thisproposal. It was, however, agreed that, in order to avoid theimpression that the Bill might be introduced during the current session, the word &quot; future &quot; should be inserted before &quot; legislation &quot;in the second main paragraph of the draft statement annexed to theMinisters memorandum.The Cabinet Subject to the point made in their discussion, authorised theMinister of Agriculture to make an early statement of the government&apos;s proposals for legislation on land drainage,on the lines proposed in C. (59) 170.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,17th November, 1959.secret
