CompanyLaw.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 58thConclusions,Minute 7.)2. The Cabinet had before them a note by the President of theBoard of Trade (C. (59) 173) covering a draft of a statementannouncing the appointment of an independent enquiry into theworking of the legislation regulating the creation, operation anddissolution of companies.The Cabinet Authorised the President of the Board of Trade to make inthe House of Commons that afternoon an announcement in the terms of the draft annexed to C. (59) 173.AlanWilmington.travel facilities.3. The Foreign Secretary said that he was proposing to rejectan application for the grant of a British passport to Mr. AlanWinnington, the Peking correspondent of the Daily Worker.Mr. Winnington was known to hold strong pro-Communist views and during the hostilities in Korea had helped to interrogate british prisoners in Chinese hands. It was not in the public interest that heshould have the freedom of travel which the possession of a Britishpassport would give him. If he wished to return to this country, hecould at any time obtain an emergency travel document valid for asingle journey to the United Kingdom.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s decisionto withhold the grant of a British passport to Mr. AlanWinnington.Supply ofAnns.central america.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 58thConclusions,Minute 1.)o4. The Foreign Secretary said that the United StatesGovernment were maintaining their opposition to the proposed supplyof Hunter aircraft to Cuba. They thought that the CubanGovernment might fall within a few months, and they were thereforeanxious that the present embargo on the export of arms to CentralAmerican countries should be strictly maintained. On the otherhand, the Cuban order would be a valuable export, and the UnitedStates Government had themselves recently authorised the sale of american helicopters and unarmed ships to Cuba. If we refused toauthorise the supply of Hunters, the Cuban Government wouldprobably have recourse to countries behind the Iron Curtain, andmight also take reprisals against our export trade. Nevertheless, on balance, he had come reluctantly to the conclusion that he shouldtell the Cuban Ambassador that, in view of the continuing tension inthat area, the export of Hunter aircraft could not yet be authorised.In discussion it was recognised that great weight must be givento the interest of the United States in securing greater stability in the carribbean area. It was possible that, if we refused this request, the cuban Government might obtain their requirements from countriesbehind the Iron Curtain; but the United States Government took theview that this would be evidence of the extent to which they were subject to Communist influence and that it would help to discreditthem. It was also pointed out that, although our trade interests inCuba might suffer if we refused the request, a failure to support theUnited States where their strategic interests were involved might haveeven more harmful effects on our economy.Parliament. 1.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the. House of Commons in the following week.
Forces amEurope.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 34thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Prime Minister said that the Defence Committee had agreed on 20th November that, subject to confirmation by theCabinet, the strength of the British Army of the Rhine (B.A.O.R.)should be maintained for the time being at seven brigade groups or55,000 men. It was desirable for the Cabinet now to consider thefinancial and presentational aspects of this question.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he could not at presentagree that the additional budgetary cost of maintaining B.A.O.R. atthe existing strength, which might amount to  5 millions a year,should be added to the maximum total of  1,620 millions for theDefence Budget. The additional expenditure in foreign exchangewas even more serious. Our overseas financial position was becoming more difficult. It was desirable that we should have an annualsurplus on overseas account of  400 millions, but it seemed likely thatfor the current year the surplus would be only about  250 millions,while in 1961-62 it might fall to  200 millions. Against this therewas a rising trend in our aid and investment commitments and in overseas costs generally. If the planned reduction in the size of.A.O.R. were deferred, the additional cost could only be met at theexpense of our financial assistance to under-developed countries.The Cabinet were informed that it would not be acceptable tothe Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, or to the Western european union (W.E.U.) if we were to allocate two brigade groups of our strategic reserve to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)and to retain them in this country. On the other hand, there wasprovision under the revised Brussels Treaty for our W.E.U. forces tobe temporarily withdrawn in the event of our facing an emergencyoutside Europe. If such situation were to arise we should not hesitate to send reinforcements to the area involved from B.A.O.R. ratherthan from the United Kingdom.The Cabinet then discussed the administrative consequences ofmaintaining B.A.O.R. at the existing strength. It was pointed outthat the maintenance of a force of this size in Germany would involvea serious imbalance between home and overseas postings in theall-regular Army. Moreover, 30 per cent, of the strength of the army would be in Germany an excessive proportion in a theatre whereoperations seemed least likely to occur. The effect on the phasing ofthe barrack building programme would have to be settled in further discussions about the defence Estimates for the coming year. ^Further discussion showed that there was general agreement that,^while no long-term commitment should be undertaken about thestrength of B.A.O.R., it would not be in our interest to provoke theserious disturbance of our relations with the United States and theEuropean members of NATO that would undoubtedly follow, inThe Prime Minister said that we could not afford to lose thisvaluable export order unless we had reasonable grounds for assuming that it would not be supplied by some other Western country. Iftherefore we were to refuse the Cuban request, we should obtain the^best assurances we could that other Western European countriesjwould observe the existing embargo. It would also be desirable to relate our refusal to the continuation of tension in the Caribbeanarea, and to explain to the Cuban Government that we lookedforward to the time when the state of tension would be lessened,when we would be prepared to reconsider their request.   .The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform the Cuban&quot;Government that, in view of the continuing tension in the carribbean area, authority could not at present be given forthe export of Hunter aircraft, but that the request could bere considered if the existing tension were relaxed.
Defence.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 6thConclusions,Minute 4.)BallisticMissile EarlyWarningSystem.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Defence and the Secretary of State for Air (C. (59) 158)recommending the construction of a large radar station at Fylingdalesin Yorkshire as a joint Anglo-American project as part of a UnitedStates plan for giving early warning of ballistic missile attacks on theUnited States and this country.The Minister of Defence said that the proposed station wouldgive up to 30 minutes&apos; warning of a missile attack on this country from bases in Soviet or Soviet-controlled territory. The period of warning might, under certain conditions, be considerably less. Butthe project was undoubtedly of value to the strategic deterrent policy,and it would be essential if an anti-missile defence system wereevolved. The Defence Committee had agreed at their meeting on20th November that the project was necessary on military grounds and that the station must be located at Fylingdales. But this sitewas in the North Yorkshire National Park and there would be considerable criticism on this account. Under the United states proposals the equipment for the station would be provided withoutcost to us, but construction and maintenance would involve initialexpenditure on our part of nearly  8 millions and a recurrent cost ofabout  2 millions a year.It had to be recognised that the presentation and justification ofthe project to the public had been made more difficult by thepublication that day of a newspaper article which revealed the natureof the proposals, including the site, in considerable detail and suggested that the United Kingdom would get an inadequate returnfor the heavy expenditure involved. There was reason to suppose that the article was based on information improperly released fromofficial sources in Washington, and, if this were confirmed, it mightbe thought that we should protest to the United States and draw their attention to the embarrassment caused by this indiscretion.present circumstances, from any indication that we intended toreduce our land forces on the continent below their present size. Weshould not be precluded from putting forward at a later date a reasoned case for release from the provisions of the Brussels Treatybecause of the changed situation in Europe, in particular theformation of the European Economic Community. The timing and presentation of any such approach would, however, require carefulconsideration.Summing up the discussion, The Prime Minister suggested thatthe Cabinet should confirm the substance of the Defence Committee&apos;conclusion to maintain for the time being the strength of B.A.O.R.at seven brigade groups or 55,000 men. Everything possible shouldbe done to reduce the administrative and financial disadvantages ofthis course. For the present, it would be preferable that no formal statement about B.A.O.R. should be made in NATO or W.E.U.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the strength of B.A.O.R. should be maintained for the time being at seven brigade groups or 55,000 men.(2) Took note that no formal announcement of this decisionneed be made at the present time.(3) Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of Statefor War as necessary, to give further consideration to theadministrative and financial implications of Conclusion (1)above.
The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that he recognised the military importance of the station and accepted thatFylingdales was the only suitable place for it. But it must be understood that the Government, if they accepted the project, woulcAhave to justify their action in the face of very strong criticismVWhatever was done to ameliorate the situation, the station, with itsfour antennae each over 300 feet high, would be a prominent featurein a much frequented part of the North Yorkshire National Park.Public opinion would not readily understand that it could not be builtsomewhere else where there would be less detriment to naturalamenities. Opposition to the proposal would be somewhat reduced if an undertaking could be given that the Government would remove the station if at a future date it were no longer required. It might also be necessary to consider whether the Government could take some general initiative to underline the importance which they attached to the preservation of natural amenities.In discussion of the financial aspects of the proposal it wassuggested that this radar station was less important to us than theTHOR missiles we had obtained from the United States Government.We should therefore seek to obtain more favourable financial arrangements than those at present suggested, which were on thegeneral lines of the THOR agreement.Summing up the discussion, The Prime Minister said that therewas general agreement that the new radar station proposed by theUnited States should be constructed at Fylingdales and that the selection of this site, despite the consequential detriment to the amenities of the North Yorkshire National Park, could be justified on grounds of national security. We should, however, seek to obtainmore favourable financial arrangements, on the ground that the project was primarily in the interests of the United States. TheMinisters concerned should therefore give further consideration tothe way in which negotiations with the United States Governmentcould best be pursued.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister of defence and the Secretary of State for Air, to consider how thefinancial negotiations with the United States Governmentfor the project for a ballistic missile early warning station at Fylingdales could best be pursued; and to report to thePrime Minister;(2) Subject to Conclusion (1) above, approved the proposals inC. (59) 158.(3) Agreed that, at an appropriate time, an undertaking shouldbe given to demolish the station if it were no longer required for defence purposes.Souta-EasiAsia treaty organisation.Laos.(previous reference:CC. (59) 51stConclusions,Minute 1.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (59) 175) about planning in the South-East Asia treaty organisation (SEATO) to meet the possibility of indirect aggression in Laos.The Foreign Secretary said that, although the Treaty was primarily concerned with arrangements to meet an armed attack, the planning studies which had been continuing in SEATO coveredconditions in which Communist action against Laos could not be identified as external aggression. The United States Government^and some of our other Allies in SEATO, were anxious that these plarLJshould be made fully operational. That would entail the namingof an Appointed Nation responsible for the conduct of operations bythe SEATO force and the appointment of a field Force Commander.We had so far hesitated to agree to operational planning, and our
8. The Colonial Secretary reported that, at their meeting on23rd November, the Colonial Policy Committee had approved his proposal that an announcement on constitutional advance In Tanganyika should be made in the following month. The advance would consist of the introduction of an unofficial majority in theCouncil of Ministers in 1960 (with, if necessary, the introduction ofa post of Chief Minister) and a substantial extension of the franchise.This was necessary if we were to retain the confidence of all sectionsof opinion in Tanganyika, which were united in their desire fordoubts were shared by the New Zealand and French Governments.The choice of the Appointed Nation, which would be Thailand, andthe appointment of a field Force Commander, who would be an american, were steps that might well become public. This wouldhave political disadvantages, in that it might make it more difficult for the Soviet Government to restrain the Chinese, and might alienateuncommitted countries. Moreover, operational military planning inSEATO might well entail security risks. It also had to be borne inmind that, as a party to the Geneva Settlement, the United KingdomGovernment were under an obligation not to intervene in Laos; wecould only argue that we were released from that obligation if therewere aggression, direct or indirect, by another party to the Settlement.It was, however, important to encourage the morale of theSEATO countries, and to maintain our influence with the UnitedStates and our ability to persuade them to work for a satisfactorypolitical solution in Laos. The United States Government had now given certain assurances about operational planning, and had agreedthat SEATO intervention would not take place except as a purelydefensive measure in the last resort to prevent Laos going Communist.He therefore proposed that we should now inform the UnitedStates Government that we would be prepared to co-operate inoperational planning to meet indirect aggression in Laos on certain conditions. First, such planning should be on the basis of an informalunderstanding, rather than formal decisions, about such matters asthe nomination of the Appointed Nation and the appointment ofthe Force Commander. Secondly, the terms of reference of theplan should be revised in such a way as to make it applicable only if there were &quot; armed action against the established Government byorganised bands or groups subject to such a degree of foreigndirection, support or control as to amount to indirect external aggression &quot;. Furthermore, in order to avoid the danger of theLaotian Government pressing for the plan to be put into operation in circumstances in which we did not think an intervention would bejustified we should ask the United States Government to urge theLaotians not to appeal to SEATO without first consulting the major powers.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in general agreementwith the course proposed by the Foreign Secretary. The followingpoints were made:  (a) It was quite likely that informal understandings about the nomination of the Appointed Nation and the Force Commanderwould become public. But even if this were to happen, the resultingpolitical disadvantages might well be less than if these decisions hadbeen formal in character.(b) It would be necessary for the New Zealand Government tobe informed of the course of action which we now proposed to follow.The Cabinet Approved the recommendation made in C. (59) 175.
progress towards responsible self-government. The proposedadvance would inevitably have repercussions in Nyasaland andNorthern Rhodesia, and on the review of the future of the central african Federation. In order to minimise these effects, it hadbeen agreed that the extension of the franchise should be somewhat )less than that recommended by the Post Elections Committee under&quot;&quot;the Chairmanship of Sir Richard Ramage and should include an income qualification. Furthermore, the constitutional conference,which would be necessary to work out details of the proposedadvance, should be deferred until April or May 1960.The Cabinet Endorsed the conclusions of the Colonial Policy Committeeon constitutional advance in Tanganyika.Piccadilly 9.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCircus. Minister of Housing and Local Government (C. (59) 172) on theproposed redevelopment of a site in Piccadilly Circus.The Minister of Housing said that, in view of the public disquietabout a proposal for the erection of a new building on the northside of Piccadilly Circus, he had decided to call in the application for planning permission for decision by himself. Some critics feared that the building now proposed would not harmonise with theultimate redevelopment of the Circus as a whole; others objected tothe illuminated advertisements which would be displayed on a blankwall of the proposed building; and another group wanted thebuilding to be of a more original design. All these views could find expression at the public enquiry which was now to be held.He undertook to circulate a further paper to the Cabinet before any decision was announced.In discussion it was recognised that there was a fundamentaldifficulty in securing the satisfactory redevelopment of extensive areas such as Piccadilly Circus, especially when the sites were in multipleownership. In the absence of war damage or some similar cause,the various sites necessarily became ripe for redevelopment at different times over a period of many years; it was not feasible tohold up the development of one until the manner in which all the others were to be developed became known. The London CountyCouncil, as planning authority, had indicated their general conception of how the Circus should be redeveloped and the proposed building(which had been misrepresented in the published sketches) was notincompatible with this.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of the decision of the Minister of housing and Local Government to &quot; call in &quot; the applicationfor planning permission for the redevelopment of a siteon the north side of Piccadilly Circus.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,26th November, 1959.
