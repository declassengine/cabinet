Germany. *The Prime Minister said that when the meeting of ForeignForeign Ministers reassembled at Geneva on 13th July the United StatesMinisters&apos; Secretary of State, Mr. Herter, had informed the Foreign Secretary,Meeting. in confidence, that President Eisenhower had now come to the(Previous conclusion that a meeting of Heads of Governments would have to reference: be held, whether or not progress were made by the Foreign MinistersC.C. (59) 4lst at Geneva. The President had been convinced by the argument that conclusions, the Western Powers could not allow the Berlin situation to becomeMmute 2.) s0 critical as to involve the danger of war without first trying to resolve differences by negotiation between Heads of Governments.The President therefore intended to work for a-meeting of the Headsof the Western Governments in Paris on about 20th August, and aSummit meeting in Quebec on 1st September, with the possibility thatthe Soviet Prime Minister, Mr. Khrushchev, might visit the UnitedStates at the same time. It had been gratifying to learn that thePresident had this procedure and timetable in mind. But, as thediscussions in Geneva continued, it became clear that both the UnitedStates delegation and the President were again finding it difficult to admit that there had yet been sufficient progress to justify a summit meeting. Moreover, it now transpired that President Eisenhowerhad recently invited Mr. Khrushchev to visit the United States,without mentioning a specific date or linking the invitation in anyway with a Summit meeting. Mr. Khrushchev had accepted this invitation and had suggested that he should visit the United states for about two weeks later in the autumn. This, together with theattitude adopted by the United States delegation at Geneva, suggestedthat the President would not adhere to the programme for a summit meeting on 1st September. The President was also planning to visita number of countries, including the Soviet Union, during october and the first part of November; and it followed that, unless a summit meeting were held at an early date, it could not be held before theend of November.The Prime Minister said that in these circumstances he had thought it right to send a message to the President urging that thenegotiations in Geneva could reasonably be regarded as havingresulted in definite progress, compared with the ultimatum presented by the Soviet Government in November 1958, and their attitude atthe outset of the Geneva meeting. He had also explained thedifficulties about the timing of a Summit meeting, and had expressed a strong preference for the earlier date. The President had not sofar replied to that message. Meanwhile, at Geneva, the AlliedGovernments and the Soviet Union had tabled papers setting out their respective positions on the German problem. Although the positions of the two sides had not been finally formulated, he believedthat impartial observers would conclude from these papers that, whilethe Western Governments had been more rigid in negotiation thanthe Soviet Government, sufficient progress had been made to justify a Summit meeting.We were now faced with the possibility that the geneva conference would adjourn without any agreement which would beaccepted by the United States Government as constituting progresssufficient to justify a Summit meeting, and that at about the sametime it would become known that Mr. Khrushchev was to visit theUnited States later in the autumn. To opinion in this country at anyrate it would be hard to reconcile these two facts; and the suspicionwould arise that the United States and Soviet Governments intendedto conduct bilateral negotiations without consultation with the UnitedKingdom or the other Governments concerned. Given the attitudeof the Governments of the United States, France and Germany, itwould be difficult to press for an early Summit meeting.   We could,
however, accept a proposal for a later Summit meeting, on certain conditions. First, it must be established publicly that there wouldbe a Summit meeting before the end of the year, even though the precise date could not be fixed until Mr. Khrushchev made his visit 1940 the United States. Second, it must also be established publicly that there would be an early meeting of the Heads of the western governments, and that this and Mr. Khrushchev&apos;s visit to the UnitedStates were steps towards a settlement which would be negotiatedat the Summit meeting. Furthermore, it would have to be arranged that the Geneva meeting should end on a note compatible with thesetwo requirements.In discussion there was general agreement that it was difficultto reconcile the rigid attitude of the United States delegation atGeneva with the invitation to Mr. Khrushchev to visit the UnitedStates. It would hardly be possible to present this as a purely socialvisit, and there would be a widespread belief that the United StatesGovernment intended to negotiate with the Soviet government without reference to their Allies.The Cabinet also agreed that the position papers tabled by thetwo sides at Geneva would be taken to show that the SovietGovernment had not been unreasonable in the negotiations and thatsome progress had been made.There was general agreement that, on a balance of allconsiderations, it might be preferable that a meeting of Heads of governments should be deferred until later in the autumn. Apartfrom giving more time to concert the Western position, a delay would presumably mean that unilateral action by the Soviet Union over berlin would be further postponed. In any event it no longer seemedpracticable to press for the earlier date. It was, however, agreed thatthe later programme could only be accepted if the conditionsmentioned by the Prime Minister were fulfilled. It was essentialthat, as soon as the Geneva conference was adjourned, there shouldbe an announcement that the Heads of the Western governments would meet in Paris before the end of August, and that it should be firmly understood now that at that meeting a decision would be takento hold a Summit meeting before the end of the year. It followed that the other Western Governments should be brought to agree thatthe adjournment of the Geneva meeting should not be presented asa failure. At the least it would have to be said that the foreign ministers would report to their respective Heads of Governments,and that the results were sufficiently encouraging to justify the continuation of negotiations in other ways, including the meeting ofthe Heads of the Western Governments, with the ultimate aim of reaching a negotiated settlement.The Prime Minister said that on this basis the later programme should be presented as a logical development of the government&apos;s policy in encouraging our Allies and the Soviet Government to workfor a negotiated settlement. He would consider how best to impress on the United States Government the nature of our essential requirements in connexion with the later programme, and would ifnecessary send a further message to President Eisenhower.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Minister^ statement and of thepoints raised in their discussion.
