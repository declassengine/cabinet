Europe.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 84thConclusions,Minute 5.)The Cabinet Endorsed the arrangements which had been made for thePrime Minister and the Foreign Secretary to visit Moscowlater in the month for the purposes indicated in thediscussion.Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET54730-2 B 2*1. The Prime Minister said that a dangerous situation mightwell result from the Soviet Government^ declaration of their intentionto withdraw from East Berlin and to leave the East GermanGovernment in control of that part of the city and also of the approaches to West Berlin. This declaration, and the subsequentoffer to negotiate a Peace Treaty for Germany, had exposed thelatent differences of attitude, on the part of the leading members ofthe North Atlantic Alliance, on the response to be made to a transferof authority in Berlin and the lack of a common practicable policy on the wider question of the future of Germany as a whole. Therewas now an increasing expectation that a Four-Power meeting wouldbe held in the spring to resolve the immediate problem of Berlin andto discuss the wider question of European security. But it would behazardous for the Western Powers to enter into such discussions underthe threat of a Soviet ultimatum and without agreement on a common policy to be pursued in the discussions. It was urgently necessarythat some fresh initiative should be taken to break the presentdeadlock and to find a basis for Western agreement.The Prime Minister said that in these circumstances he had thought it right to indicate to the Soviet Government that he would now be prepared to accept the invitation, which had been extended tohis predecessor, to make a visit to the Soviet Union; and the SovietGovernment had accepted his suggestion that he and the foreign secretary should make a visit of 7 to 10 days beginning about20th February. This would give him an opportunity to try toascertain the views and intentions of the Soviet Government inrespect of Berlin and of the wider issue of Germany&apos;s future. And itwould be natural that he should thereafter go to Bonn, Paris and washington to discuss these problems in the light of the views expressed by the Soviet leaders. These visits would be a valuablepreparation for any Four-Power meeting that might be held later inthe year.The United States Government had been consulted about this approach before it was made. They would now be informed that ithad been accepted. The Governments of France and western germany and the Commonwealth Governments would also beinformed that day of the arrangements for the visit and of its purpose.A statement about it would be made at the meeting of the north atlantic Council on the following day. A public announcement would be made to Parliament on 5th February.In discussion there was general support for the initiative whichthe Prime Minister had taken in proposing this visit to the soviet union. It was the view of the Cabinet that this would be generally welcomed by public opinion in this country.
Egypt.financial negotiations.(previous reference:C.C.(59)3rdConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Foreign Secretary said that we had informed Mr. Black,the President of the International Bank for Reconstruction andDevelopment, of the divergence of view between the egyptian government and ourselves about the interpretation of the provisionalAnglo-Egyptian financial agreement in relation to sequestrated assets which had subsequently been Egyptianised. As a result, Mr. Blackhad made representations to the Egyptian Government and we shouldawait the outcome of this approach before taking any further actionourselves.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.Parliament. 3.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.EconomicSituation.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 86thConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet thatduring January our deficit in the European Payments Union had beenrepaid and the level of our reserves of gold and convertible currencieshad risen by  15 millions. The sterling/dollar exchange rate wassteady at 2-81 dollars. This represented a satisfactory position atthe end of the first month&apos;s experience of convertibility of sterling.Commercial 5.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePolicy. Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (59) 13) reporting the result of aHorticulture.    further review by the Economic Policy Committee of the desirability/T1   . of an increase in the tariff on cut flowers.(previous reference: The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the majority of theC.C. (59) 2nd members of the Committee felt that an increase in the horticulturalConclusions, tariff should be authorised only if it could be shown that a reasonablyMinute 7.) efficient producer was unable to make a living without additionalprotection and that the decline in profitability from which he sufferedwas due to the impact of imports on the domestic market; that, in thecase of cut flowers, neither of these criteria was at present satisfied;and that the application for an increase in the tariff should thereforebe rejected as unjustified on economic grounds. This should not,however, affect the Governments general policy that the tariffremained the principal instrument for protecting the horticulturalindustry.The Minister of Agriculture dissented from this view. The costs of hot-house production had recently increased more sharply in thiscountry than in Holland; there had been a substantial increase in thevalue of imports of carnations since 1955; and the tariffs on roses andnarcissi were well below the 10 per cent, general duty. It was forconsideration whether we should now establish a system of guaranteed prices in horticulture as in agriculture; but any arrangements of thiskind could not take effect in the short term and the economic case foran interim increase in the tariff on cut flowers was clear. more over it would demonstrate the Governments intention to preserve thetariff as the principal means of horticultural protection and it wouldcounteract to some extent the effect of their recent decision not toincrease the tariff on tomatoes.In discussion it was emphasised that both the industry and itssupporters in Parliament were seriously perturbed by the Govern-menfs rejection of a number of applications for increases i .horticultural tariffs particularly on tomatoes, and were inclined to
territorial waters.(previous references:C.C. (58) 86thConclusions.Minute 3and 71stConclusions.Minute 7.)Law of the. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theForeign Secretary (C. (59) 15) discussing the policy to be adopted atthe conference to be held at Geneva in 1960 on the outstandingproblems on the breadth of the territorial sea and fishing limits.There was now no hope that we could sustain a claim to a 3-mile territory sea; and, if we were to avoid being compelled to accept a12-mile limit, we must support a reasonable compromise based on a6-mile limit for the territorial sea together with some limitation of fishing rights in a further 6-mile zone, subject to the preservation of historic rights. Such historic rights could take three forms full,limited, or &quot; phased out.&quot; We could not expect to secure theagreement of the conference to full historic rights, which would imply that countries with established fisheries could exercise such rightswithout limitation. Nor would it be in our interest to accept anarrangement whereby historic rights were phased out over a period.We should therefore endorse the concept of limited historic rights,which would allow the exercise of such rights in the outer 6 milesprovided that the amount of fishing did not exceed recent levels.In discussion there was general agreement that we should endeavour, by preparatory negotiations, to mobilise the maximum of support for an approach on these lines. It would be particularly important to secure the co-operation of the Canadian and indian governments. It was also agreed that, as there was no possibility ofsecuring rights of innocent passage for State aircraft at the conference,we should avoid raising this issue ourselves, even in respect ofbelieve that those decisions had been taken on political, rather thaneconomic, grounds. It might be desirable, therefore, to consider a modified method of operating the tariff on tomatoes, whereby thelevel of the tariff would be related not to the season but to the priceof imported tomatoes so that, if the price fell below a pre-determinedfigure, the flow of imports would be arrested or the tariff would automatically be increased. A system of this kind was operated incertain other countries and its adoption might embarrass us less thana straightforward increase in tariffs in our relations with our partners in the European Free Trade Area negotiations. If, however, theadoption of such a scheme provided an effective measure of increasedprotection for the industry, this would have a significant reaction onthe cost-of-living index.On the other hand, an increase in the tariff on cut flowers wouldhave no effect on the index and would help to reassure the industry of the Governments intentions. But it would be liable to prejudice our relations with other countries in Europe; and it was open to question whether it would in fact afford the industry any substantialbenefit.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, suggested that both the economic and the political implications of an increase in thetariff on cut flowers needed to be further examined in the light of thealternative methods of operating a system of horticultural protectionwhich had been indicated during the discussion.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for furtherconsideration to be given to the desirability of adjustingcertain horticultural tariffs in the light of the points made intheir discussion.
international straits, and should prepare to continue flying military aircraft over such straits in order to begin establishing newprescriptive rights after the adoption of a 6-mile territorial sea.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals in C. (59) 15.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to advise the Prime Minister onthe stage in the preparatory negotiations at which it mightbe advisable for him to address a personal message to thePrime Ministers of Canada and India in an endeavour tosecure their support for the policy which we proposed to advocate at the conference on the territorial sea to be heldat Geneva in 1960.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,3rd February, 1959.
