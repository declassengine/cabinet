commercial policy.(previous references:C.C. (58) 88thConclusions,Minute 2 andC.C. (58) 82ndConclusions,Minute 5.)Horticulture.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Agriculture (C. (59) 3) describing a proposed scheme for providingfinancial assistance to the horticultural industry. -The Minister of Agriculture recalled that, at their meeting on25th November, 1958, the Cabinet had seen considerable objection to accepting certain applications for increases in horticultural tariffs andhad invited him, as an alternative method of fulfilling the Govern-ment&apos;s undertaking to support the industry, to prepare a scheme ofassistance on a basis similar to that adopted in the case of agriculture.He now proposed the introduction of a system of 33^ per cent, grants towards the cost of equipment, buildings and other capital worksdesigned to increase the efficiency of horticultural holdings, withspecial emphasis on improved efficiency in marketing, together withgrants at the same rate to encourage the development of growers&apos;co-operative marketing organisations. The net cost of these proposals was estimated at  7^ millions over a period of five years.In discussion it was pointed out that there was no clear case forincreased assistance to the horticultural industry on purely economic grounds. There was, however, considerable evidence that the indusrty was suffering increasingly from the competition of imported products especially tomatoes and cut flowers and there was no question that, on political grounds, it must be given some form of additionalsupport. An increase in horticultural tariffs would not only besimpler and cheaper than the grants scheme now proposed but wouldalso avoid any departure from the accepted method of assisting the industry and any need to differentiate between different classesof producers. On the other hand, it would damage our prospects of success in the negotiations for the creation of a European free trade Area; it would involve the payment of compensation under theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade; and, in the case of tomatoes,it would affect the cost of living. The balance of advantage appeared,therefore, to be in favour of the proposed scheme of grants providedthat the expenditure involved did not exceed  74- millions. While,however, there should be no increase in the tariff on tomatoes,further consideration might be given to the implications of raising the tariff on cut flowers. This would indicate to the producers thatthe traditional method of horticultural protection was not beingwholly abandoned; and it would leave the cost-of-living indexunaffected.In further discussion it was agreed that a general indication ofthe Governments proposals might be given in confidence to theleaders of the National Farmers&apos; Unions (N.F.U.) before their annual General Meeting in the following week. The principles ofthe proposals should thereafter be officially announced and the N.F.U.should be invited to discuss their detailed application in the normal way.The Cabinet &apos;(1) Approved the proposals for a new system of horticulturalgrants as described in C. (59) 3.(2) Authorised the Minister of Agriculture to announce theprinciples of the scheme as soon as possible.54550-7b 2Parliament. 1.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the week beginning 26th January.
(3) Invited the Minister of Agriculture to give further considera-tion, in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the President of the Board of Trade, to the implications of raising the tariff on cut flowers.(4) Subject to Conclusion (3) above, reaffirmed their previous decision that the pending applications for increases inhorticultural tariffs should be rejected.Egypt- 3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet that financial        agreement had now been reached with the Egyptian Government on negotiations.    a settlement of the financial issues outstanding between the two(Previous        countries.  The essential feature of this settlement was the paymentReference:      of a lump sum of  27  millions by the Egyptian Government inC.C.

An agreement on this basis would minute 1.)      be initialled in Cairo that day and would thereafter be subject to confirmation by the two Governments.  The sum of  27^ millions was less than we had originally hoped to obtain and was unlikely tosuffice to meet the total of admissible claims by British subjects.  Itwould not be easily defended to public opinion, especially as weshould be releasing to the Egyptian Government, in return forthis payment, the remainder of their blocked sterling balances.Nevertheless, the balance of advantage lay in ratifying the agreement provided that we could devise adequate administrative machineryfor distributing the lump sum among the claimants.  In particular,we should need an authorised representative in Egypt who would beavailable to assist the owners of property restored after sequestrationto assess the damage which their assets had suffered.  It should bea condition of our confirming the agreement that the egyptian government accepted a British representative with the status and facilities necessary for this purpose.In discussion the following points were made:-(a) It had been suggested that we should withhold signature ofthe agreement until the Egyptian Government agreed to release the two British subjects whom they held in prison. The cabinet considered that this should not be made a condition of signature. Itwould be preferable to rely on diplomatic representations to theEgyptian Government which we should be better able to make when a British representative had taken up duty in Egypt.(b) It would be important to secure the most favourable public presentation of an agreement which was open to criticism in certain respects. It should be made clear that the lump-sum payment bythe Egyptian Government was only one item in a comprehensive settlement which would also restore to the owners of sequestratedproperty the assets which they had lost. We should also emphasise the importance of the parallel settlement between the egyptian government and the Shell Oil Company, whereby the company would recover full possession of their property, and liberty to resume their operations, in Egypt.(c) It would be necessary to decide how far the distribution ofcompensation should be made the occasion of recovering from the claimants the advances which they had already received from theGovernment.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposed financial agreement withthe Egyptian Government, including the payment byEgypt of a lump sum of  27-1- millions in settlement of theclaims of British subjects.

Employment.(previous reference :C.C. (58) 79thConclusions,Minute 4.)British NylonSpinners.4. The Minister of Labour said that British Nylon Spinners,Limited, who wished to expand their capacity, had applied for an industrial Development Certificate at Portsmouth. This had been refused by the Board of Trade; but the firm had resisted suggestions that their new factory might be established either at Hull or onMerseyside. They had now been given the opportunity to acquirefrom the Ministry of Supply a factory at Gloucester and had indicated a strong preference for this area as compared with any other part ofthe country. Although an Industrial Development Certificate wouldnot be required in respect of this factory, the level of unemploymentin Gloucester was only half that in Portsmouth and, if the firm were allowed to establish additional capacity in Gloucester, the Govern-ment would invite criticism both from Portsmouth and from other areas of high unemployment. On the other hand there was some risk that, if the firm were prevented from acquiring premises atGloucester, they would postpone their planned expansion altogether.The Sub-Committee on Local Unemployment had therefore reachedthe conclusion that the least disadvantageous course would be to allow the Gloucester project to go forward.In discussion it was pointed out that, whereas the future prospectfor employment in the Portsmouth area was relatively hopeful,unemployment in the area between Bristol and Gloucester was likelyto become increasingly serious as a result of the gradual contractionof the aircraft industry. Moreover, the firm would be able to startwork in the factory at Gloucester at least six months earlier than ifthey were obliged to build a new factory elsewhere. On this groundit would be reasonable that the Gloucester project should be approved.If, however, the firm maintained their preference for Portsmouth,it would be preferable, in the last resort, that they should be grantedan Industrial Development Certificate in respect of that area thanthat they should abandon the expansion of their capacity.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Foreign Secretary, to seek to arrange for the agreement to be signed in time to enable a statement to be made when Parliament reassembled, on the understanding thatit would not be signed until the Egyptian authorities had agreed to accept a suitably authorised representative ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government in Egypt for the initialpurpose of assisting British owners of sequestratedproperty to assess the extent of the damage to their assets.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Foreign Secretary, to submit to the PrimeMinister the draft of a statement, to be made inParliament as soon as the agreement had been signed,setting in perspective the financial settlement with theEgyptian Government.(4) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (CommanderNoble) to make appropriate administrative arrangementsfor the distribution of the lump-sum payment of  27^-millions among the British claimants to compensation.
The Cabinet-Agreed that British Nylon Spinners, Limited, should beallowed to develop additional capacity in the factory vacatedby the Ministry of Supply at Gloucester.Armed Forces.       5.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Chancellor(Previous       of the Exchequer, the Minister of Defence and the Minister of references:     Pensions (C. (59) 2, 5 and 4 respectively) about Service widows1C.C. (58) 80th pensions.Conclusions,Minute 3 and The Minister of Defence said that the Cabinet had alreadyC.C. (58) 77th accepted in principle the recommendation of the Advisory CommitteeConclusions, on Recruiting under the chairmanship of Sir James Grigg that ServiceMinute 7.) widows should, in future, receive, on a non-contributory basis,Family one-third of the pension which their husbands had been drawing.Pensions. K this recommendation was to have its full effect on recruitment, the concession should apply not merely to the future widows of men now serving but also the future widows of existing Service pensioners.Otherwise widows&apos; pensions at the new rates would not begin to bepaid, except in a few cases of early death, for upwards of twenty years. In addition, some increase, averaging about 10 per cent.,should be granted to existing Service widows in response to the growing pressure of public opinion on their behalf.The Chancellor of the Exchequer opposed these suggestions onthe ground that the Government could only make the proposed concession in respect of future widows of existing Service pensionersif they had first conceded some improvement in the pensions ofexisting Service widows. The latter concession, however, wouldhave extensive repercussions among public service pensioners ingeneral, which might involve the Exchequer in additional expenditureof the order of  10 millions a year.The Minister of Pensions said that the risk of repercussions on war widows and, therefore, on the Industrial Injuries and national assistance schemes could be ignored if war widows were grantedtwo improvements to which, in any event, they were entitled on merits. First, war widows over the age of 70 should be given a new&quot; comforts &quot; allowance of 10s. a week on the analogy of the age and comforts allowances already made to seriously disabled war pensioners. Second, the National Assistance Board should beauthorised to disregard 10s. 6d. a week of a war widow&apos;s pensionwhen assessing her means for the purpose of national assistance, thusputting her in the same position as widows of civil servants, policemen,firemen, miners and railwaymen. The cost of these two concessionswould be rather more than  1^- millions a year.In discussion there was general agreement that, notwithstanding the importance of giving every encouragement to the campaign for voluntary enlistment in the forces, it would be imprudent to grantan improvement in Service widows&apos; pensions before examining in greater detail the possible repercussions on other public service pensioners. Public opinion was already exercised about the positionof many of these pensioners; and, if the cost of living rose significantlyin the near future, it might become necessary to consider amending the latest Pensions (Increase) Act.   The field should therefore be
The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the ministerial committee on Pensions, in consultation with the Ministerof Defence, to examine the proposals in C. (59) 5 in greater detail, with particular reference to their possible reper-cussions in the public service generally. .Privileges ofInternationa!Organisations.(previous reference :C.C. (58) 80thConclusions,Minute 9.)Nuclear TestsSuspensionControlOrganisation.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (58) 262) about the extent of the privileges and immunities to be granted to the Nuclear Tests Suspension control organisation if this Organisation was created as a result of the currentconference on the suspension of nuclear tests.The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that, if theControl Organisation was to function effectively, its staff would need to enjoy not only the immunity in respect of their official acts towhich they would be entitled in the normal course under theInternational Organisation (Immunities and Privileges) Act of 1950,but also immunity from personal arrest on any grounds and immunity from seizure of their personal baggage. Otherwise the authoritiesin a country which wished to conceal a violation of the suspensionagreement would be able to arrest inspectors on some fictitious charge e.g., in connection with an alleged minor traffic offence and thusgive themselves greater time in which to conceal the evidence of theirviolation of the agreement. The proposal had the full support ofthe United States Government. It might be possible to give effectto it without fresh legislation; and it was unlikely that it would beexercised to any significant extent in this country since it was reasonably certain that there would not be more than one controlpost in the United Kingdom.In discussion there was general agreement with this suggestion.The Cabinet &apos;Approved the proposals in C. (58) 262.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,16th January, 1959.reviewed as a whole before any concession was made to anyparticular class of public service pensioner.
