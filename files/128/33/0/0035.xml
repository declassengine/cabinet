Germany. 2.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ForeignForeign Secretary (C. (59) 102) reporting on the situation reached at theMinisters&apos;       meeting of Foreign Ministers at Geneva.Meeting.(Previous The Foreign Secretary said that the discussions had made it clearReference:      that there was no prospect of agreement on the German problem as c.C. (59) 34th   a whole, unless the immediate question of Berlin could first be conclusions,    resolved.  He had therefore been working for an agreement which,Minute 2.)      while recognising that the Western Powers and the Soviet Union heldopposing views on the juridical aspects of the Berlin question, wouldprovide for improved practical arrangements covering the position of western troops in Berlin, the control of espionage and propagandaactivities there, and the right of free access for military and civiliantraffic.   Under such an agreement these practical arrangements(which might include East German operation of the control system for access provided that the Soviet Union accepted the ultimate responsibility) might continue until the reunification of Germany.Some progress had been made towards an agreement of this sort.But on 9th June the Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr. Gromyko, had putforward a plan which, while accepting all the concessions which theWestern Powers were prepared to make, included a time-limit of twelve months after which, if Germany were not reunified in themanner prescribed by the Soviet Government, the latter would signa separate peace treaty with East Germany. This reintroduction ofthe threat of an ultimatum had made the French Government, andalso to some extent the United States Government, less ready to makethe concessions necessary to reach an agreement. AlthoughMr. Gromyko had since denied that the Soviet proposals were intended to constitute an ultimatum, our Allies were inclined to theview that unless real progress could be made in the next few days the Geneva meeting should be adjourned.The United States delegation were, however, working on apossible new approach, under which a Four-Pow^r commission would be established to discuss measures for the phased reunificationof Germany, with free elections at an appropriate stage, and toexamine questions connected with the preparation and conclusion ofa peace treaty with Germany. This Commission would report to thefour Foreign Ministers in a year&apos;s time, and during that period theexisting arrangements for the level of forces in Berlin, and for access,would be maintained and the juridical positions of the western powers and the Soviet Union would remain unchanged. In thesecircumstances the question arose whether any further progress couldbe made by the Foreign Ministers, and how these discussions shouldbe handled in relation to a possible Summit meeting.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Public opinion would regard a long adjournment of the geneva meeting as equivalent to a failure. Moreover, a longadjournment would weaken the negotiating position of the western powers. On the other hand, the discussions at Geneva could notusefully be continued for much longer.(b) There would be no advantage in taking up other substantialissues such as disarmament or European security, at this meeting ofForeign Ministers.  This would only widen the area of disagreement.Mr. Menzies. I    jne Prime Minister said that he was glad to welcome thePrime Minister of Australia. The Cabinet would greatly value thebenefit of his counsel on the international problems which confrontedthem at this time.
(c) Although the latest proposals of the United States delegation were less rigid than their original position, they would needmodification if they were to have any chance of being accepted bythe Soviet Union.(d) Agreement on practical arrangements for Berlin, either onthe basis of a continuation of the present arrangements pending thereport of a Commission as suggested in the latest American proposals,or on the lines indicated by the Foreign Secretary, could be presented as sufficient progress to justify a Summit meeting. For this purpose it would not be necessary for the Foreign Ministers to reach agreement on all details. Alternative proposals could be submitted for consideration by the Heads of Governments.(e) Apart from dealing with the question of Berlin, the main purpose of a Summit meeting would be to reach agreement onprocedures for handling other international issues.Mr. Menzies said that it would be a mistake to underestimate thevalue of the Geneva meeting as a means of demonstrating the fairnessand objectivity of the Western case to international public opinion,especially in the uncommitted countries. There seemed to be little prospect of reaching agreement on the juridical aspects of the Berlinquestion, and it would therefore be best for the Foreign Ministers tocontent themselves with stating the two views without further effort to reconcile them. On that basis it might still be possible to reach agreement on some practical arrangements for Berlin which mightlast for several years. Such an outcome would at any rate make it possible to discuss the larger issues subsequently, without theoverhanging threat of a crisis in Berlin. If there were to be a summit meeting, it was important that it should be held at the initiative of theWest.The Prime Minister said that it was the general view of theCabinet that we should continue to work for an agreement at geneva on practical arrangements for Berlin, either on the lines indicated bythe Foreign Secretary or in accordance with some modification ofthe latest American proposals. It was important that any plan theWest put forward should be demonstrably practical and sensible.For this purpose we should be ready to continue the discussions atGeneva for a week or ten days. If a tentative agreement could thenbe reached, it would lead naturally to a Summit meeting. But if nobasis for an agreement could be found and the discussions reached a deadlock, Ministers would need to consider carefully what the nextsteps should be. We had made it clear to the United States andFrench Governments that, in our view, if the meeting of foreign ministers ended without any agreement, this would not preclude aSummit meeting.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement and invited him to be guided, in the further stages of the foreign ministers&apos; meeting at Geneva, by the points which had beenmade in the Cabinefs discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,15th June, 1959.
