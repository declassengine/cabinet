Conclusions.Minute 3.)Mr.Speaker 2.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMorrison. Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (59) 136) regarding the legislationPension.        required for the provision of a pension for Mr. Speaker Morrison,who had announced his intention to retire at the end of the present parliament.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that Mr. Morrison had asked that part of the traditional pension of  4,000 should becommuted to provide for a widow&apos;s pension. The Chancellor invited the Cabinefs views on the question whether entitlement to a widow&apos;pension should be provided in addition to the traditional pension of 4,000, and on the further question whether provision should also bemade for a capital payment of  4,000.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat provision should be made for a pension of  4,000 for mr. Morrison and for a pension of  1,333 for his widow, but that no provision should be made for the payment of any capital sum toMr. Morrison on his retirement.The Cabinet Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange forthe preparation of legislation providing for a pension toMr. Speaker Morrison at the rate of  4,000 a year and,after his death, a pension for his widow at the rate of  1,333a year.agricultural policy.MarginalProductionGrants.(previous references:C.C. (59) 46thConclusions,Minute 2, andC.C. (59) 41stConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the HomeSecretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland (C. (59) 133 and137) on the withdrawal of the Marginal Agricultural Production(M.A.P.) scheme in Northern Ireland and Scotland respectively.The Secretary of State for Scotland recalled that the Cabinet hadalready agreed that the withdrawal of the M.A.P. scheme in scotland should be effected gradually over the next three years. He had now reached agreement with the Minister of Agriculture on the terms ofa statement which would announce this decision but would referexplicitly to the Governmenfs general decision that the M.A.P.scheme as such would be brought to an end.The Home Secretary said that this concession to Scotland would put the Northern Ireland Government in a very difficult position.They  had  asked  that the conditions  for  benefit  under  thePensions. 1.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum (C. (59) 135)Higher by the Lord Chancellor, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the judiciary. Secretary of State for Scotland outlining their proposals for legislation(Previous to increase the future pensions of members of the higher judiciary and reference:      the present pensions of those already retired.C.C. (59) 33rdThe Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Lord Chancellor to arrange for legislation tobe prepared on the basis outlined in C. (59) 135.(2) Took note that the Cabinet would be -given a further opportunity to consider the substance of these proposals before legislation was introduced; and that in themeantime no further announcement need be made of the government&apos;s intentions in this matter.
supplementary (small farmers) scheme should be so relaxed as tobring more farms within its scope; or alternatively, that no concession on the termination of the M.A.P. scheme should be granted to scotland.In discussion it was pointed out that the position of the twocountries in this respect was wholly different. Northern ireland would receive under the small farmers and supplementary schemeswell over  1 million a year, as compared with less than  600,000received in the last year of the M.A.P. scheme. Scotland, on theother hand, would receive under the small farmers scheme only 350,000 a year, as compared with over  1 million in the last year of marginal assistance.The Home Secretary said that, despite these considerations, he must continue to support the claim put forward by the NorthernIreland Government. Discussion showed, however, that it was thegeneral view of the Cabinet that the practical effects of theintroduction of the small farmers scheme in substitution for theM.A.P. grant would justify a special concession to Scotland but notto Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Government shouldbe supplied with as much comparative information as possible, inorder to help them to demonstrate to their agricultural interests thatthe present arrangements were in the best interests of NorthernIreland&apos;s agriculture as a whole.The Cabinet (1) Approved the revised draft statement (annexed to C. (59) 137)on the withdrawal of marginal assistance in Scotland.(2) Agreed that no concession should be made on the withdrawalof the scheme in Northern Ireland.(3) Invited the Minister of Agriculture to arrange for theNorthern Ireland Government to be provided with information on the effect of the change of method of assisting small farmers in the different parts of the UnitedKingdom.investment programme.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 87ConclusionMinute 5.)the. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (59) 131) on public investment inthe period 1958-63.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in 1958-59, insteadof the increase expected as a result of the reflationary action taken from the middle of 1958, public investment had been  20 millionsless than in 1957-58. But, as a result of the increasing effectiveness of the reflationary measures, the sum of public investment authorised for 1959-60 had risen by nearly  200 millions to a total of  1,660millions. Apart from certain minor reflationary works, the investment programme for the current year should not be disturbed.Public investment programmes submitted for 1960-61 amountedso far to  1,695 millions. There was no justification for this further increase of  35 millions above the expanded level of the current year.With the expansion of consumer expenditure, private investment was already increasing quickly enough. The prospective total of public investment must be kept within prospective capital resources. TheMinister of Power had undertaken to consider a reduction in the gas CounciFs programme; and the Minister of Transport had beenasked to consider a lower figure for the Transport Commissionsprogramme, subject to the examination of their reappraisal of their investment plan for the railways. Later in the year it might also benecessary to reduce certain elements in the public investment programmes which could be altered relatively quickly, such as thenumber of housing starts, educational minor works, and miscellaneouslocal authority investment.
5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the FirstLord of the Admiralty (C. (59) 134) on nuclear propulsion for merchant ships.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that a committee underthe chairmanship of the Civil Lord, with representatives from industry, the Atomic Energy Authority and the Departmentsconcerned, had been considering for over two years the applicationof nuclear propulsion to marine engineering. Technical experts had examined the relative merits of various types of reactors for thispurpose, and had narrowed the choice to the boiling water reactorand the organic liquid moderated reactor. The latter might have agreater development potential, but research on it was less advanced,and the experts had not yet been able to make a final choice betweenthe two. The first ship built with either type of reactor could notin any case be economic, in the sense of being competitive with aconventionally  propelled   ship.  The  committee  had   thereforeAtomic Energy.NuclearMerchant Ship.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 37thConclusions,Minute 4.)The total of public investment programmes for 1961-62 was sofar estimated at  1,690 millions. Subject to the reappraisal whichwas being made of the railway and coal investment programmes, this figure could be taken as the broad framework for further discussion between the Departments concerned of the particular investment programmes.In discussion the following points were raised:  (a) Sudden adjustments in minor educational works and housing programmes would provoke considerable public criticism withouteffecting a substantial reduction in expenditure.(b) A reduction in housing investment for 1960-61 might have tobe made at the expense of the programme for slum clearance, whichwould be difficult to justify.(c) Differing views were expressed about the capacity of thebuilding industry. While the larger constructional firms were undoubtedly efficient, it was suggested that an increase in the load on the building industry as a whole might lead to uneconomicproduction.(d) It was suggested that the public investment envisaged up to1963-64 would not support a sufficient rate of economic expansion.The growth of public investment between 1959-60 and 1963-64 was expected to be of the order of only  90 millions. Public investmentoften failed in practice to reach the levels expected. Moreover, it wasnot certain that the expected growth in private investment would be fully realised. The outlook for certain basic industries, such asshipbuilding and aircraft manufacture, was grave, and it might be convenient if the effects of depression in those industries could be offset by an expansion of investment activity.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas bound to be a considerable degree of uncertainty about forecasts of investment in the public sector, no less than in the private sector.Final decisions on the details of the public investment programmes were not required immediately, and it would be advisable for theCabinet to give further consideration to this problem later in the year in the light of developments in the meantime.The Cabinet (1) Took note of C. (59) 131.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to circulate a further memorandum on the future level of public investment forconsideration by the Cabinet later in the year.
recommended that tenders should be invited from selected british firms for both types of reactor, but that this invitation should not commit the Government to order a ship for either system.    Thecommittee had also recommended that the Atomic Energy AuthorityQshould continue to study the organic liquid moderated system.The First Lord said that in his judgment the Government should go beyond these recommendations and decide at once to construct a ship powered by a boiling water reactor. Even if it were established in time that this system was not the most economic, the operatingexperience gained from it would enable us to make quicker progress towards the development of an economic system of marine nuclear propulsion. There were many problems which could not be solvedwithout the practical experience of operating a nuclear-powered shipat sea.Discussion showed that there was some support in the cabinet for the view that the problems connected with the development ofa nuclear merchant ship could not be solved unless such a ship were built and operated at sea. It was not likely that further study of theorganic liquid moderated system would make it easier to choose between that and the boiling water system in, say, a year&apos;s time.Nuclear ships were already under construction in the United Statesand the Soviet Union, and other countries were actively consideringentering this field.On the other hand it was argued that, if the wrong reactor systemwere chosen, experience in operating it would not help towards thedevelopment of an economic nuclear ship. The more cautiousapproach recommended by the Civil Lord&apos;s committee was supportedby representatives of the shipping and shipbuilding industries. TheCabinet were also informed that the Chairman of the Atomic energy authority was of the opinion that it would be wasteful to construct a ship with a boiling water reactor system before there had been further study of the possibilities of the organic liquid moderatedsystem.The Prime Minister said that, in view of the conflicting opinionsheld on the best means of developing an economic merchant shipwith a nuclear propulsion system, it would be expedient that theproblem should be studied further by a small group of Ministers.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for thequestions raised in C. (59) 134 to be studied by a Committeeof Ministers before they were considered further by theCabinet.government expenditure.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 41stConclusions,Minute 5.)MetropolitanPolice Fund.6. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the HomeSecretary (C. (59) 119) and the Chancellor of the Exchequer(C. (59) 140) about the special Exchequer contribution to theMetropolitan Police Fund.The Home Secretary said that the special grant paid from theExchequer to the Metropolitan Police Fund in respect of services rendered for imperial and national purposes had remained at therate of  100,000 a year since 1910. The local authorities had pressed for this to be increased to take full account of the cost of these services. He had ascertained that the cost was now of the order of 475,000 a year, and he thought it would be unrealistic to refuse toincrease the grant to that figure. Taking account of the normalpolice grant, the net additional cost to the Exchequer would be 187,500 a year.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that since the introductionof this grant, Exchequer support for the police had been put on the
commercial policy.Imports ofBacon fromthe dollar area.(previous references:C.C. (59) 46thConclusions,Minute 1, andC.C. (59) 40thConclusions.)7. The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that, when theCabinet had agreed on 8th July that we should offer in the negotiationswith Denmark to remove the bacon tariff, they had also authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to inform the Canadian Governmentthat a quota of 10,000 tons for dollar bacon would be authorisedif an agreement for a European Trade Association were signed. the initial Canadian response to this offer had been that it was inadequate.There v/ere now considerable stocks of Canadian bacon, and theCanadian Government were considering the possibility of reducingsupport for their pig producers. Canadian bacon producers might therefore be disposed to resume exports to the United Kingdom.The Economic Policy Committee had taken the view that it wouldnot be desirable to increase the conditional quota already offered bymeans of a corresponding cut in the quota for Polish bacon; they recommended that, if the Canadian Government were to make formalrepresentations that our offer was inadequate, the most we should do would be to open the quota of 10,000 tons at a reasonably early date and without reference to the progress of the Stockholm negotiations,and to emphasise that it was our intention to make a further relaxationas soon as circumstances permitted.The Cabinet were informed that the Canadian Government had now made formal representations about the size of the conditionalquota that had been offered, and had urged the immediate withdrawalof the restrictions on the import of Canadian bacon.In discussion it was pointed out that the general withdrawal ofthese restrictions would have to be considered in due course. Inthose circumstances it might be necessary to restrict imports from poland below the present level. Meanwhile it was important to avoid prejudicing the development of a European Trade Association andcausing further apprehensions among pig producers in the UnitedKingdom. It would therefore be inexpedient to offer at once anyfurther concession to the Canadian Government. It would be enough if we took note of their representations and undertook to give them full consideration.The Cabinet-Agreed that no further offer should be made at present tothe Canadian Government for any further relaxation of therestrictions on the import of Canadian bacon into theUnited Kingdom.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,28th July, 1959.uniform basis of a fixed grant of 50 per cent, of all approvedexpenditure. The special grant was therefore something of ananachronism and he saw no sufficient reason why it should beincreased.Discussion showed that there was some division of opinion inthe Cabinet on this issue. As a decision was not urgently requiredit could be left over for further discussion at a later meeting.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of C. (59) 119 and 140at a later meeting.
