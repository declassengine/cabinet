The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that actual farm output and income had fallen in 1958-59 and the public cost of agricultural support had been reduced by comparison with the previous year. But,on the basis of statistics adjusted to allow for variations in weather conditions, both the income and the output of the industry had risenin 1958-59. There was thus no case for an increase in the level of support for 1959-60: indeed, there were grounds for a reduction which could, without infringing the long-term assurances given to theindustry, amount to as much as  19 millions. While a decrease of this magnitude would be impracticable, the objective of the current review should be twofold first, to offset, in terms of the guarantees, the 6\ millions which represented the estimated benefit to the industry of the schemes for assistance to small farmers recently approved bythe Cabinet; second, to achieve a further net reduction in the level ofthe guarantees of the order of  A\ millions. For this purpose it wouldbe necessary, in addition to reducing the guarantees for wheat, wooland eggs on the lines proposed in C. (59) 22, to secure a reduction ofJd. a gallon in the guaranteed price of milk. This reduction was inany event desirable on its merits. . Liquid milk production in theprevious year had shown a significant excess over requirements, and increased costs had been offset by a gain in efficiency. If there were no reduction in the guarantee, normal conditions in the following yearmight produce an embarrassing surplus of milk production in the spring of 1960. The consumer, rather than the Exchequer, would gain from a reduction in the guaranteed price: and the effect on the cost-of-living index would be favourable. The Governments proposals at theopening of the discussions with the National Farmers&apos; Union should therefore be so framed as to ensure that the outcome of the subsequent negotiations would include a reduction of ^d. a gallon in the guaranteed price of milk.The Minister of Agriculture said that, in his view, it would be unwise for the Government, after taking credit for the schemes forassistance to small farmers, to insist on a reduction in the guaranteesto a figure lower than their level in 1958-59. The adverse weather ofthat year had resulted in a substantial fall in actual farm output and income and, if the current year&apos;s settlement was not to be imposed bythe Government but agreed with the industry, the level of supportshould remain unchanged. Moreover, it would be premature toreduce the guaranteed price of milk. There was some evidence of aswitch from milk to beef production; and, if this tendency were furtherencouraged by a reduction in the guaranteed price, it might well resultin a future shortage of milk. The present price should therefore bemaintained, although the question might be re-examined at the timeof the next review.Discussion revealed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat the level of support in 1959-60 should be the same as in 1958-59,subject to a reduction of  6  millions in respect of the small farmers&apos;schemes. There might be advantage in opening discussions with theNational Farmers&apos; Unions on the basis of a reduction in the guaranteed price of milk; but this proposal need not be pressed if itevoked opposition. It might also be desirable to dispense with theproposed reduction in the guaranteed price of wool. This would provoke ill-feeling, particularly in Scotland. But it might be embarrassing for the Government to refrain from pressing for this reduction in the light of their declared policy as regards the guarantee for wool.Farm Price 1.   The Cabinet had before them two notes by the Chancellor ofReview the Exchequer (C. (59) 20 and 22) about the farm price review,1959-60 1 959-60.
The Cabinet (1) Agreed that agricultural support in 1959-60 should remain atthe same level as in 1958-59, after account had been taken of the benefit derived by the industry from the schemes forassistance to small farmers.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister ofAgriculture, to decide the detailed adjustments of the guaranteed prices which would be required to secure this objective in the discussions with the National Farmers&apos;Unions.Education.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 82ndConclusions,Minute 4.)voluntary schools.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Education (C. (59) 19) discussing the increased financial assistance which it would be desirable to make available to denominationalschools in pursuance of the policy outlined in the recent White paper on Secondary Education.The Minister of Education said that he proposed two changes inthe existing system of grant aid. First, the rate of grant should beincreased from 50 per cent, to 75 per cent. Second, although it was out of the question to pay grant on all new schools, the scope of thegrant should be extended to include such new secondary schools as were required to match existing aided primary schools of the samedenomination. The cost of these measures would average rather lessthan  2 millions a year for 20 years.He had discussed the proposals, confidentially and without commitment, with representatives of the religious denominations, the teaching profession and local education authorities. Of the religiousdenominations, the Roman Catholics might have preferred a rate of grant of 100 per cent., applicable to all schools whether existing or new. But they accepted the proposals in principle as representing asubstantial improvement on the existing arrangements. The church of England also endorsed the increase in the rate of grant; and,although they had initially expressed doubt about the desirability of extending the scope of the grant, they now appeared to appreciate theunwisdom of appearing to stand in the way of educational progress.The Free Churches were opposed to both elements of the proposals;but there was reason to believe that they would ultimately acquiesce,although reluctantly, in arrangements on these lines. Opinion amongthe teachers and local education authorities was not unanimous; butthe proposals had received a considerable amount of support and hadnot evoked opposition on any significant scale. It would therefore bedesirable that, if the proposals were acceptable to the Cabinet, theyshould now be discussed in greater detail with the various interests concerned on the basis that they represented approved government policy.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The main benefit from the proposals would accrue to the roman Catholics. The other denominations, particularly the FreeChurches, might seek to make political capital out of this fact. Itwould be important that the proposals should be presented in the most favourable light from the point of view of the Church of Englandand should, if possible, be associated to some extent with the schemewhich the Anglican authorities themselves had put forward.(b) The existing denominational settlement confined the paymentof grant to existing schools, and it would be desirable to avoid creating(the impression that the extension of the grant to a limited number ofnew schools represented a radical change in the established practice.The principle involved, however, had been to some extent established in the Education Acts of 1936 and 1944, though primarily in the
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,13th February, 1959.context of the reorganisation of all-age schools. The present proposals should therefore be presented as far as possible as a logical extensionof this earlier concession and as a means of continuing the process of reorganisation, which was still incomplete. From this point of view there would be advantage in drafting the necessary legislation, ifpossible, by reference to the earlier Acts.(c) The rate of grant to denominational schools in NorthernIreland was 65 per cent.; and the Government of Northern Irelandmight be embarrassed if the rate of grant in Great Britain was increased to 75 per cent. On the other hand, grant was paid in Ulsterto all denominational schools, both existing and new; and theGovernment of Northern Ireland were likely to appreciate that the wider scope of their grant would offset the higher rate of grant whichit was proposed to pay in Great Britain to a more limited range ofdenominational schools.(d) The proposals had been communicated confidentially to theleaders of the Opposition parties who had expressed their generalconcurrence. They need not, therefore, become an issue of party political controversy; and there might be advantage in ensuring,if possible, that the necessary legislation was enacted during the lifetime of the present Parliament.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposals in C. (59) 19.(2) Invited the Minister of Education to continue to negotiate with the interests concerned on the basis of those proposals and to report the outcome to the Cabinet in due course.(3) Authorised the Minister of Education to arrange for thenecessary legislation to be drafted.(4) Agreed to consider at a subsequent meeting the appropriate time for the introduction of this legislation.
