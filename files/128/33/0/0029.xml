ContentsAircraft Industry
The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the question ofGovernment financial support for a British type of aircraft to replace the Dakota. They had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Supply (C. (59) 83) on the methods by which such support mightbe given.The Minister of Supply said that he was prepared to accept, inprinciple, this deviation from the policy that Government assistance tothe aircraft industry would in future be confined to research and thedevelopment of new types of aircraft embodying major technicalinnovations. He considered that an exception would be justified bythe size of the potential export market for a Dakota replacement.He was, however, concerned about the means by which this support would have to be given. It could not be concealed, from parliament or from public opinion. He believed that any announcement of theGovernments intention to support either of the two types of aircraftconcerned would reduce the incentive to manufacturers to seek orders on a commercial basis. This would be especially so if support were now given to the Dart Herald, since this would involve a reversal ofthe decision taken in 1954 when the Handley Page Company had beeninformed that their project would not justify the investment of public funds. Financial support in the nature of a subsidy to british european Airways (B.E.A.) would lead foreign operators to doubt the genuineness of the Corporation^ requirement for this aircraft.It would also establish a dangerous precedent. B.E.A. were asking for Government support in the introduction of the Rotodyne.In discussion it was suggested that Government assistance for theintroduction of a small number of these aircraft into service with oneof the Corporations might not influence overseas operators in favourof them to the same extent as commercial orders placed by the corporations on their own initiative. On the other hand, the enquirymade by the New Zealand Government suggested that it might be enough to influence a decision in favour of the Dart Herald; and theCabinet were reminded of the view expressed by the Civil AviationPolicy Committee that, without the relatively modest amount ofassistance proposed, British manufacturers would be unable to secure any orders for an aircraft to replace the Dakota.The Cabinet then considered whether Government support forthe Handley Page Herald or for the Avro 748 would be the more likely to result in sufficient overseas sales to justify the expenditure involved. There would be advantage in supporting only one typeif it could be clearly shown to have the more favourable exportprospects. The Handley Page Herald had the advantage of beingsome two years ahead of the Avro 748, and machinery and components had already been assembled for its production. Thiswas an important consideration in view of the competition of theFokker Friendship, of which about 100 had already been sold. Onthe other hand, the resources of the Handley Page Company were more limited than those of the Hawker Siddeley Group and their prospects of success in the export market might be less than their claims would suggest. Nevertheless, it was possible that orders mightbe obtained in the near future for the Dart Herald, not only in new Zealand, but also in South America. The Avro 748 appearedto have the better chance of obtaining the large order which the indian government wished to place for the replacement of their Dakotas;and it might be expedient before undertaking to support either type,to wait for the decision of the Indian Government, who had alreadybeen informed of the possibility that we would give assistance to theAvro 748 if they ordered it.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) Preliminary studies made in consultation with B.E.A. andthe Handley Page Company suggested that Government support ofnot more than about  1 million over ten years would be necessaryfor the introduction of the Herald into certain Scottish services of
22 CRETB.E.A. It was probable that an arrangement of this kind could berepresented as the purchase of three Herald aircraft by B.E.A.following Government assistance to the manufacturer in thedevelopment of the aircraft.(b) Both the Handley Page Company and the Hawker SiddeleyGroup had emphasised that an initial order from a United Kingdomagency was an essential prerequisite for export sales. Even limiteduse of the Herald by B.E.A. on the scale envisaged would serve to demonstrate that it was considered suitable by the Corporation for normal airline operation.(c) Circumstances had changed since the original decision wastaken that Government support should not be given to the Herald.The company had themselves found a large amount of money for. thedevelopment of the aircraft; and the aircraft industry was no longeroverloaded. It might now be considered that a measure ofGovernment support was justified in order to bring to a successful conclusion a project which the company had carried so far on theirown resources.Summing up the discussion, The Prime Minister said that theCabinet were agreed that in all the circumstances government support might be given to an aircraft which was capable of taking a share of the substantial export market for a replacement of theDakota. Further consideration would have to be given to themethod of providing this support; but there was no reason to suppose that it would be impossible to devise arrangements that werefinancially and constitutionally defensible. The possibility of earlyexport sales of the Herald would justify support for this type on thescale envisaged, even though the future of the Handley Page company was less assured than that of the Hawker Siddeley Group. But, atthe same time, in view of the interest of the Indian Government inthe Avro 748, it would be expedient to inform them that in the eventof their ordering a substantial number of this type we should beprepared to support it as well as the Herald. Expenditure of a comparable amount to that required for the Herald could beauthorised for the Avro 748 if necessary in relation to an Indian order.No announcement of the Cabinets decision should be made until theviews of the Indian Government had been obtained. Nor should itbe made known to B.E.A. or to the Handley Page Company until thedetails of the arrangements to be made with them had been settled inconsultation between the Ministers concerned.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Supply, in consultation with theCommonwealth Secretary, to inform the indian government that Her Majesty&apos;s Government had decidedto give financial support to the Dart Herald but wouldalso be willing to give similar support to the Avro 748 inthe event of a firm Indian order for a substantial numberof that type of aircraft.(2) Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to arrange for officials of the Treasury, Ministry of Supply and Ministry ofTransport and Civil Aviation, to consider what financial arrangements could be made (at an estimated cost to theExchequer of between  1 and  1-^ millions over ten years)for the operation of the Dart Herald in certain Scottishservices of British European Airways.(3) Took note that, in the light of the results of the action to betaken under Conclusions (1) and (2) above, the PrimeMinister would determine the form and timing of anannouncement of the Governments decision to givefinancial support to a British type of aircraft to replace the Dakota.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,6th May, 1959.
