Government 1.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theinformation Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (C. (59) 78) covering a reportServices. by a working party recommending measures to increase the export(Previous       of British books and periodicals.Reference:C.C. (58) 76th The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that there was conclusions, an increasing demand for books in English, especially in Asia and minute 7.) Africa. Publishers had expanded their commercial sales in manyBook Exports, oversea markets, but in many countries people were too poor to buyeven the cheapest British books which were on sale commercially.Moreover, certain countries were not prepared to use their sterlingearnings to purchase books at commercial prices. The Soviet union and China were taking advantage of the unsatisfied demand byheavily subsidising their exports of books. A high proportion ofthis material was in English, and although it was not at present being used for direct propaganda purposes to any large extent, a pattern of supply and distribution was being created which would enableRussia and China to dominate the market with propaganda in thefuture, and we were losing the opportunity of propagating Britishideas and influence. In order to stimulate the supply of Britishbooks and periodicals overseas, a number of schemes had been worked out in relation to the importance of maintaining British influence in the countries concerned. In Indonesia, Pakistan, Poland,Turkey, Yugoslavia and Israel the best course would be to negotiatebook export schemes, in which we should be prepared to acceptblocked local currency. In certain territories in the Middle East,Africa and Asia, we should introduce subsidised schemes to providelow-priced publications, both in English and in the vernacularlanguages. In addition, we should improve library and other systems of distribution, and take steps to encourage the sale of Britishnewspapers and periodicals overseas.It would be possible for these purposes to find  100,000 a yearout of the  16+ millions a year at present authorised for the oversea information services. The net additional expenditure on all themeasures described would therefore amount to no more than  150,000in the current financial year,  550,000 in 1960-61 and  755,000 in1961-62. These estimates of additional expenditure would also bereduced to the extent that further savings could be secured in thegeneral overseas services of the British Broadcasting Corporation(BBC).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while he recognised the importance of the programme which had been put to the Cabinet,he was most unwilling, in view of the forecast of substantial increases in the cost of civil programmes to which the Government were already committed, to accept additional commitments at the present time.He hoped to be able, in about two months&apos; time, to make a betterestimate of future expenditure: until then the most he could acceptwould be the inclusion of such of the measures as could be affordedwithin the expenditure of  16^ millions currently authorised for the oversea information services, and the addition of  250,000 to that expenditure in 1960-61.Discussion showed that there was general support for theproposal that appropriate measures should be taken to stimulate theexport of British books, particularly to Commonwealth countries and colonial teritories in Asia and Africa. To maintain British influence in this way would, in the end, be much less expensive than the other measures that might have to be taken to retrieve a situation whichhad deteriorated. In reply to a suggestion that this might be asuitable field for Anglo-American co-operation, it was pointed outthat the schemes which the United States Government were alreadyoperating to subsidise the export of books were confined to Amei &apos;cnproductions.
The Lord Privy Seal suggested that the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster should consider whether this programme to encouragebook exports could be reduced. It might be possible to dispense withcertain of the schemes which had been suggested, such as the low-priced book programme in the vernacular languages and the schemeto promote the sale of British periodicals and newspapers. Otheroffsetting economies might also be made, in addition to the  100,000a year which had been offered: there was, for example, the possibilityof a further saving on account of the general overseas services ofthe BBC.cThe Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to discuss with the Chancellor of the Exchequer proposals for a lesscostly programme of book exports, taking into account alloffsetting economies which could be found in other partsof the oversea information services.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to submit a further report to the Cabinet in due course.Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the week after the Whitsun recess.international labour organisation.(previous reference :C.C. (58) 79thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Labour (C. (59) 87) regarding two Conventions adopted by theInternational Labour Conference.The first of these Conventions (No. Ill), adopted by theConference of 1958, was concerned with discrimination in respect ofemployment and occupation. Some of its provisions assumed a degree of Government participation in determining terms andconditions of employment which would be contrary to established practice in this country. It also involved acceptance of the principleof equal pay for men and women in all forms of employment. Itwas proposed that the United Kingdom Government should refrain from ratifying this Convention or accepting the Recommendationwhich supplemented it.The second was a Convention (No. 87), adopted by theConference of 1948, concerning the freedom of association of workers:Our original ratification of this Convention in 1949 had applied onlyto Great Britain, because the law then in force in Northern Irelanddid not comply with the requirements of the Convention. Changeshad since been made in the law in Northern Ireland, and it was now proposed that our ratification should be so extended as to applyto the United Kingdom as a whole.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals in C. (59) 87, and authorised theMinister of Labour to present to Parliament a White paper explaining the Governments decisions in respect of thesetwo Conventions.Education.(previous references:C.C. (59) 30thConclusions,Minute 7 andC.C. (59) 17thConclusions,Minute 8.)voluntary schools.4. The Home Secretary recalled that the Government were proposing to raise the maximum grant payable for voluntary school building work from 50 per cent, to 75 per cent, and to introduce anew grant of up to 75 per cent, for the provision of new secondary schools needed to match existing aided primary schools of the samedenomination. The Church of England and the Roman catholic church were content with these proposals, but the Free Churches

The Prime Minister said that he continued to be concernedPolicy. about the presentation, to public opinion in this country, of theLiberalisation   Governments decision to relax some of the existing restrictions on of Dollar       imports from the United States.  There seemed to be little prospectImports.        that   the   United  States   Government   would   show   a   more(Previous       accommodating attitude on any of the particular instances ofReference:      discrimination against British products which were currently causingC.C.

People might therefore find it difficult to conclusions,    understand why the Government had chosen this particular momentMinute 4.)      to relax restrictions on dollar imports.  This decision could be saidto reflect the strength of sterling.  Use could also be made of the argument that the particular instances of discrimination against british productions were exceptions to a general pattern of increasingexports from this country to the United States.  Special care shouldbe taken to see that these and other considerations supporting theGovernments decision were fully presented to the public.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to concert with the Chancellor of the Exchequer arrangements for thepublic presentation of the Governments decision to relaxrestrictions on imports from the United States.Cabinet. 6   jne Prime Minister said that, unless an earlier meeting wasProcedure.      required to deal with emergency business, the next meeting of theCabinet would be held on 27th May.Parliament would return from the Whitsun recess on 2nd june and would have to complete a large volume of important businessbefore it rose at the end of July. In that period Ministers should concentrate on completing the business to which the Governmentwere already committed and should, so far as possible, avoid raising*. fresh issues in the remaining weeks of the present session ofParliament.were opposing them. Their opposition, especially to the second ofthe proposals, had recently been hardening and, although it mightbe possible to mitigate by further discussion the strength of their opposition, there was little prospect of securing their agreement tothe plan. At the same time, the Roman Catholic authorities were beginning to be apprehensive that the opposition of the Free Churchesmight cause the Government to change their plan or at least to delayits implementation. The Government were now confronted with a choice between (i) proceeding in the current session with legislation which was likely to receive substantial support from the other twopolitical Parties, at the risk of alienating Free Church opinion, and(ii) issuing a statement, which the other two Parties might be willingto support, that the Government intended to introduce this legislation in the next session and using the intervening time to make a further attempt to conciliate the Free Churches.The Cabinet discussed the political advantages and disadvantages of these alternative courses.  No conclusion was reached.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at a later meeting.
