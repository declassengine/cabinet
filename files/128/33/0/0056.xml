On   the   other  hand,   opinion   in   Colonial   and nuclear Test. Commonwealth countries in Africa would strongly favour thesubstance of the resolution and would expect us to support it. Thebest escape from this dilemma would be by way of an alternativeresolution. This would be in moderate terms, requesting France totake all necessary measures to prevent damage to the health ofneighbouring peoples, and expressing the hope that France wouldassociate herself at the earliest appropriate time with the arrangements which were being worked out to achieve the suspension of nuclear weapons tests under effective international control. The french representative at the General Assembly had welcomed the idea of analternative resolution on these lines, and wished the United kingdom to sponsor it. If we could arrange for it to be voted on first, andif it succeeded in obtaining the necessary majority, it might bepossible to prevent the Afro-Asian resolution from being put to a vote. Although this course would not satisfy certain commonwealth countries, in particular Ghana and Nigeria, we could claim that it wasa constructive and realistic approach to the problem.The Cabinet proceeded to consider whether the United kingdom representative should sponsor this alternative resolution, and whether he could be authorised to assure the French representative that wewould vote against the Afro-Asian resolution.In discussion it was argued that the allegations in the Afro-Asian resolution about the effects of nuclear tests on health wereincorrect and contradicted a number of policy statements which theUnited Kingdom Government had made in the past. If we refrained from voting against this resolution we should appear to admit the validity of these allegations. It was, however, not enough to convince the Governments of Ghana and Nigeria that there was no technicaljustification for their fears about the effects on health of the proposedtest in the Sahara. The issue was, in fact, an emotional one in Africa.The Prime Ministers of both countries had indicated that, if theUnited Kingdom were to support France, this would call into question the value of the Commonwealth association.On the other hand, there was strong evidence that, if we failed tosupport the French on this issue, they would feel deep suspicion andresentment. This might well frustrate whatever hope there was ofa rapprochement with France and her partners in Europe. TheFrench Government would not be satisfied if we were merely to abstain from voting on the Afro-Asian resolution.Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
There was general agreement that the best course would be towork for an alternative and moderate resolution on the lines suggestedby the Foreign Secretary. If it would give this resolution betterprospects of success, and so increase the chances of avoiding a vote on the Afro-Asian resolution, we ought to be prepared to sponsor it.Our sponsorship might indeed help us to persuade the Governmentsof Ghana and Nigeria that we were actively working for a constructive solution of the problem. It would be helpful if theUnited States Government, who had not so far decided what course to follow, could be persuaded to join in sponsoring the alternativeresolution.It was, however, argued that, while the French would welcome -our sponsorship of an alternative resolution, they would still wishto be assured that we would vote against the Afro-Asian resolutionif it came to a vote. Unless we gave this assurance, there was some risk that the French would feel that our support for them was half-hearted. On the other hand, if we were to give this assurance at thisstage, it might well become generally known; this would harm,perhaps unnecessarily, our relations with such countries as ghana and Nigeria, and might encourage the Afro-Asian countries to make their resolution more moderate. This might make our dilemmaeven more difficult, since it would then be less easy to justify votingagainst the Afro-Asian resolution if it became necessary for us todo so.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theUnited Kingdom representative at the United Nations should be instructed to sponsor an alternative and moderate resolution on thelines proposed by the Foreign Secretary, and to seek the widest possible support for it. In particular, the United States Governmentshould be urged to join in sponsoring it. In conveying this decisionto his French colleague, our representative should for the time beingavoid any assurance that we would if necessary vote against the Afro-Asian resolution, and should explain that the course we werefollowing was designed to avert that situation. If it became clearthat we would have to decide which way to vote on the Afro-Asianresolution, then it would be necessary for Ministers to consider thematter again in the light of further advice from our representative.Meanwhile, it was important to ensure that the Afro-AsianGovernments who were friendly to us understood our position and took full account of the facts of the situation, including the technicalassurances which the French representative had already given duringthe debate in the General Assembly.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to instruct the United kingdom representative at the United Nations in the sense indicated by the Prime Minister in summing up the cabinets discussion.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary and the colonial secretary to send to the Commonwealth Governmentsconcerned a full explanation of the attitude of the UnitedKingdom Government, and of the assurances given to theGeneral Assembly on behalf of the French Government.Pensions.higher judiciary.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 47thConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordChancellor (C. (59) 164) and a memorandum by the Lord Chancellor,the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State forScotland (C. (59) 135) proposing increased pensions for members ofthe higher judiciary.The Lord Chancellor recalled that on 28th July the Cabinet had authorised him to arrange for legislation to be prepared to give effectto proposals to increase the future pensions of members of the higher judiciary and the present pensions of those already retired.  A Bill
Territorial!Waters.Law of theSea.(previous references:C.C. (59) 27thConclusions,Minute 5 andC.C. (59) 4thConclusions,Minute 6.)5. The Lord Chancellor recalled that it had been decided inthe previous July that, in preparation for the next international conference on the Law of the Sea, the United Kingdom Governmentshould seek to secure support for the proposal (at that time supportedby the United States) for a territorial sea of six miles together witha further six miles of exclusive fishery jurisdiction by the coastalState, subject to fishing States&apos; being allowed to exercise in the outersix miles their historic fishing rights within recent levels. the canadians were at the same time canvassing support for their proposal for a six-mile territorial sea and a further six miles ofexclusive fishery jurisdiction with no saving for historic rights, andit had not been found possible to persuade them to modify this even to the extent of a gradual phasing-out of historic rights. It had recently been learned that the Americans had agreed to support theCanadian formula, on the understanding that there would be bilateral negotiations between the coastal and fishing States on the phasing-out of historic rights, and had invited us to circulate this proposalto the countries who were to be represented at a preparatory meetingof fishing States to be held in London on 16th November. Thissuggestion had been considered by the Ministerial Committee on theLaw of the Sea, who regarded it as unacceptable: there would be no time to conclude satisfactory bilateral negotiations before theInternational Conference in the following spring and, if theConference once endorsed the main proposal, there was no reasonto expect that Iceland or Norway would be willing to negotiatebilateral agreements with the United Kingdom. Moreover, there was serious danger that the Canadian proposal, if put forward at theConference, would lead to increased pressure for a territorial sea of twelve miles, which would be even more damaging to our interests.If, therefore, we were to be obliged to acquiesce in the Canadianproposal, it was most desirable that it should emerge only as a concession at a late stage of the Conference.The Committee therefore recommended that immediaterepresentations should be made to the United States Governmenthad been drafted which provided for pensions on a graduated scale,beginning with one-quarter of a Judge&apos;s retiring salary after not morethan five years&apos; service and rising to a maximum of 50 per cent, afternot less than fifteen years&apos; service, with a compulsory retiring age ofseventy-five. Members of the higher judiciary who had alreadyretired would receive an increase of 12 per cent, on their existingpensions, and the Bill provided also for an increased pension for future Lord Chancellors and dealt with the position of former lord chancellor&apos;s who continued to act in a judicial capacity.Consultations with the senior Judges in England, Scotland andNorthern Ireland showed that these proposals were generally acceptable, although some doubt had been expressed about a graduated scale of pensions and a compulsory age of retirement.Early legislation was desirable, since some of those Judges whoought to retire on grounds of age or ill-health were deferring theirretirement until the Bill was passed.In discussion there was general agreement with these proposals.It was recognised that they might enhance the pressures for increases in other pensions, and might posssibly provoke further discussion ofthe level of remuneration of Ministers and Members of Parliament.The Government were, however, committed to this legislation andthe balance of advantage lay in proceeding with it at once.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (59) 164 and 135 and authorised the early introduction of a Bill to give effectto them.
urging them not to commit themselves finally to the Canadianproposal in advance of the forthcoming discussions in London andnot to press us to circulate their agreement with the Canadians tothe other countries represented at the discussions. We should alsoask the Americans to discourage the Canadians from approachingother countries on the matter at the present stage.Discussion showed that there was general agreement with theseproposals.   There might, moreover, be advantage in our alsoapproaching the Canadians direct, on the basis that the extent of&apos;their agreement with the Americans was not wholly clear to us.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to make representations to theUnited States Government on the lines agreed in their discussion.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to seek to dissuade theCanadian Government from approaching other countries on their proposal.(3) Invited the Lord Chancellor to bring the matter again beforethem when the response to these representations was known.commercial policy.european free trade association.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 55thConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The Chancellor of the Exchequer made a report to theCabinet on the progress of the discussions in Stockholm for thepreparation of the convention for a European Free Trade Association(E.F.T.A.).He said that it was hoped to provide an almost complete draftof the convention for the meeting of Ministers from the E.F.T.A.countries which had been arranged for 19th November. several important points would, however, be left over to be settled at that meeting. The Norwegian delegate had undertaken to recommendhis Government to accept the conditional concession which we had offered on quick-frozen fish. The settlement could not, however, besecured unless the Scandinavian countries agreed to a scheme for the voluntary limitation of their exports of quick-frozen fish, and asolution was found of the question of a tariff standstill on fresh fish.The terms under which Portugal would become a member had beenagreed, but the question of making a tariff concession for imports oftomato puree from Portugal was still outstanding. Certain points arising out of the proposed origin rules might also have to be left tobe settled by Ministers, as would the definition of majority voting.The main outstanding points would be submitted to minister during the coming week, and the Cabinet would subsequently be consulted, if necessary, before the meeting of Ministers in Stockholm.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.7. The Foreign Secretary said that he had now received fromthe United States Government a reasoned statement of their case against acceding to the Cuban request for authority to exchange anumber of Sea Fury aircraft for Hunter jet aircraft. Meanwhile the cuban Government had themselves made it more difficult for us to accede to their request by threatening to expropriate British property in Cuba if it were not granted. He proposed to take some furthertime to consider the position.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at a later meeting.Supply ofArms.central america.(previous reference:C.C.
