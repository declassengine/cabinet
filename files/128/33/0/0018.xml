Armed Forces(previous reference:C.C. (59) 2ndConclusions,Minute 5.)Withdrawal ofTroops from cyprus.2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there had been much public criticism of the alleged severity of the Customsexamination to which troops returning from Cyprus had been subjected. On investigation, however, the accounts of the incidentwhich had appeared in the Press had been shown to be inaccurate.Additional Customs officers had been stationed at the port, not to intensify the examination, but to expedite the clearance of baggagein the interests of the troops themselves. Only a small proportionof the troops concerned had in fact been returning from Cyprus;and, although they had rightly been required to submit to a Customsexamination, they had been treated with the consideration whichCustoms officers traditionally displayed towards members of theForces.In discussion it was suggested that there would be advantage in arranging, if possible, for these facts to be made publicly known inview of the further detachments of troops who would be returning from Cyprus in the near future.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary to consider whether theforthcoming debate on Cyprus in the House of commons would provide an appropriate occasion on which to correct the misleading impression which had been created about theCustoms examination of troops returning from Cyprus.Pensions.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 6thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (59) 55) about the proposedintroduction of a new Pensions (Increase) Bill.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that on further reflectionhe had reached the conclusion that it would be desirable to promoteearly legislation to increase the pensions (including widows&apos; pensions)of retired public servants and to arrange that retired members of the armed Forces should be granted a similar increase by PrerogativeInstruments. In addition, he was prepared to accept the proposalsof the Minister of Pensions that a new &quot; comforts &quot; allowance of10s. a week should be paid to war widows over the age of 70 andthat 10s. 6d. of a war widow&apos;s pension should be disregarded in the assessment of her means for the purpose of National Assistance. Itwould be undesirable, however, to contemplate any wider extensionof the principle of pensions increase; and he could only recommend the introduction of a Bill increasing the pensions of retired public servants if it was agreed that no corresponding adjustment should beconsidered in National Insurance and National Assistance benefits and war pensions.The legislation which he contemplated would follow, broadly,the precedent of the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1956. But it woulddiffer in providing the largest increases to those pensioners who hadreceived the least benefit under the earlier Acts, in applying the increases to the total pensions now in payment instead of to the basic pension, in eliminating the discrimination against those retiringon salaries of over  1,500 a year and in imposing no upper limit onthe amount of the increase payable. The total cost of the proposal,including the corresponding increases in the case of the Armed Forces,Parliament. 1.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
would be of the order of  10-1 millions in the first full year, of which 8 millions would fall on the Exchequer while the balance would bea charge on the rates.The Minister of Pensions and National Insurance said that he supported the proposal. It would be liable to aggravate to someextent the public pressure for an increase in National insurance pensions; but the Government would be faced with that pressure inany event, and there was no reason to suppose that it would becomeunmanageable as a result of the proposed legislation.In discussion there was general agreement in principle that anincrease should now be conceded in the pensions of retired public servants and that it would be consistent with the governments general policy in relation to the remuneration of higher paid workersthat the forthcoming Bill should remove, on the lines indicated by theChancellor of the Exchequer, the various limitations which had been imposed by earlier Acts on the degree of benefit which they could obtain from a measure of this nature.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) Some corresponding increase in the pensions paid to workersin the nationalised industries would probably be inevitable. Thecost to the British Transport Commission might be of the order of 1-^ millions a year; and the Commission^ deficit would be increasedaccordingly. In the fuel and power industries, the additional expenditure might, at the maximum, be approximately  1 million.(b) A small number of existing widows of Servicemen, whowould be granted the maximum increase under the proposals, would still receive an inadequate pension. It would be possible to rectifythis anomaly at a very small additional cost.(c) The application of the new measure to the lower judiciarywould need to be considered.The Home Secretary, summing up the discussion, said that, ifthe Bill was to be introduced in the middle of May, the necessary consultations with Local Authority Associations should be arrangedimmediately after the Governments intentions had been publicly announced, and instructions should now be issued to the draftsmanforthwith.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposals in C. (59) 55 for theintroduction of legislation to increase the pensions of retired public servants.(2) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would announce the Governments intentions in the course ofhis Budget Speech.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for thenecessary consultations with Local Authority Associationsto take place immediately thereafter.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for instructions to be given forthwith to the Parliamentarydraftsman for the preparation of the necessary legislation.(5) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Minister of Defence, to give further considerationto the effect of the proposed legislation on the positionof certain existing widows Of Servicemen.(6) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Lord Chancellor, to consider the application ofthese proposals to the lower judiciary.
government expenditure.I (previous reference:C.C. (58) 63rdConclusions,Minute 4.)TreasuryControl.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (59) 54) on the Sixth Report fromthe Select Committee on Estimates (Session 1957-58) on Treasurycontrol of Government Expenditure.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Select Committeehad recommended that a small independent committee, which shouldhave access to Cabinet papers, should be appointed to report uponthe theory and practice of Treasury control of expenditure. Thisrecommendation was unacceptable, not only, because an outsidecommittee could not properly be given access to Cabinet papers, but because any thorough examination of the system of financial control would necessarily take account of Parliamentary control as well asTreasury control and the House of Commons could not be expectedto agree that anybody other than itself should review the financialprocedure of Parliament. Nevertheless, there would be advantages in undertaking a review of the Governments control of expenditure;and such a review would best be conducted internally by theGovernment itself, with the help of a small number of outside persons.Its report should be submitted to Ministers; and it might then bedesirable for the Government to publish a White Paper describingsuch measures as they decided to adopt.In discussion it was suggested that, while the recommendationof the Select Committee could not be accepted, an internal reviewof the kind proposed could not be expected to result in fundamentalreforms. It might therefore be preferable to remit the subject to a royal Commission. On the other hand, the main lines of government expenditure were determined by decision of policy taken by ministers and these decisions would be no less inappropriate a subject for examination by an outside body than the system of parliamentary control. But it might be valuable to promote a rather more limitedenquiry into the technical aspects of financial control, as exercised by the Treasury in relation to other Departments. If so, it would be important to ensure that the independent persons to be associatedwith this enquiry were individuals of experience and authority andthat the scope of the investigation was sufficiently wide to comprisea comprehensive review of the adequacy of the present system ofcontrol having regard to the very substantial increase in theexpenditure of the Government since the basic principles of that system were first established.The Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to give furtherconsideration, in the light of their discussion, to the proposalto institute an internal enquiry into the control ofGovernment expenditure and to circulate, in due course,detailed proposals on the composition of such an enquiry and the range of subject matter with which it should be concerned.Federation of rhodesia and nyasaland.(previous reference:CC. (59) 17thConclusions,/-Minute 9.)05. The Cabinet were informed that, in accordance with their earlier decision, a despatch from the Governor of Nyasaland,reporting on the circumstances in which a state of emergency hadbeen declared in Nyasaland, would be published on 23rd March.This despatch provided ample evidence of the existence of an organised threat to the European community and to loyal africans in the territory. Meanwhile, arrangements were being made for theconstitution of an interim enquiry into the origins of the recent disturbances in Nyasaland; and efforts were also being made to convince the Prime Minister of the Federation of Rhodesia and
Nyasaland of the wisdom of accepting a subsequent and longer-termenquiry into the future of the Federation in preparation for theconstitutional discussions due to be held in 1960. If his agreement tothis proposal was delayed, it might be necessary to confine theforthcoming Parliamentary announcements of the governments intentions to their decision to constitute the interim enquiry.In discussion there was general agreement with these proposals.It was also suggested that representations might be made to theGovernment of the Federation to secure the release of Mr. GuyClutton Brock, the European missionary who had been detained in southern Rhodesia as a member of the African National Congresswhich had been declared an illegal organisation. The part which mr. Clutton Brock had played in the recent disturbances wasadmittedly ambiguous; but it was undesirable that, in presentcircumstances, he should appear to be victimised by the Governmentof the Federation.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the circulation ofthe despatch from the Governor of Nyasaland on theemergency in the territory.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary and the colonial secretary to complete the arrangements for the institution of an interim enquiry into the origins of the recent disturbances in Nyasaland and a subsequent longer-termenquiry into the future of the Federation of Rhodesia and nyasaland.(3) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to give furtherconsideration to the desirability of urging the Governmentof the Federation to release Mr. Guy Clutton Brock.6. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that arrangements had been made to repay that day to the International Monetary Fund 71 millions of the advances which we had received from the fund in accordance with the undertaking we had given in connexionwith the renewal of the stand-by credit provided by the Fund.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,19th March, 1959.0Internationa]monetary fund.(previous reference :C.C.
