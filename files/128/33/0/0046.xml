Commercial ].  The Cabinet resumed their discussion of a memorandum byPolicy. the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (59) 128) on the liberalisation of liberalisation of dollar imports and our obligations under the International MonetaryDollar Imports. Fund.(previous reference: The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was very much inC.C. (59) 45th the international interest that we should undertake a further stage in conclusions, foe liberalisation of dollar imports without delay, and that at the minute 5.) meeting of the Fund in September we should express our readiness to participate in a programme for a concerted move to the adoption ofthe permanent provisions of the Fund during the first half of 1960.Unless we and the other European countries concerned showed thatwe were willing to fulfil our international obligations in these respects,the pressure on the United States Government to adopt more restrictive trade and financial policies would increase. If we were to fail to remove restrictions as required by Article XIV of the Fundnow that our balance of payments were satisfactory, and if we wereto stand aside from preparations to move to the provisions ofArticle VIII, we should incur the suspicion that we did not ourselveshave faith in the strength of our economy. It was true that theobligations which countries would assume under Article VIII werestrict. But if we believed that our economy would be efficient, theassumption of strict obligations by all the countries concerned wasthe best way of ensuring that our export trade would not be frustrated.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in principle in favourof moving towards the general removal of restrictions on international trade and payments. This, of course, assumed that it would bepossible, in the course of the discussions which the preparation for a concerted move to the provisions of Article VIII would require, toreach agreement on exceptional treatment for certain hard-core items,such as imports of West Indian citrus.The way in which we should approach this eventual objective was, however, open to question. The general dismantling of theremaining restrictions on trade might form an important element insome wider plan for the expansion of trade in the free world. Aninternational initiative of this sort on a large scale, in which the UnitedStates would have to take the lead, would need a great deal of preparation, and it might be premature to remove the remainingimport restrictions piecemeal in the meantime.It was also argued that, although the current balance of payments position was good, there would be considerable risk in discarding the defensive measures that were still available under Article XIV. Howfar such measures could in future be effective in practice was open to serious doubt. But international prospects, political as well aseconomic, were so uncertain that it would be hard to justify acceptingmore stringent obligations in the near future.It was pointed out that if we were to indicate at the meeting ofthe Fund in September that we were in favour of removing theremaining restrictions on trade and payments, this would imply thatwe were prepared to liberalise a considerable range of importsamounting to about  80 millions per annum. While the liberalisationmeasures we had so far announced had not provoked seriouscontroversy, it had to be remembered that these had not yet taken full effect. The prospect of the removal of virtually all the remainingrestrictions might give rise to serious apprehensions in many parts ofindustry. It was therefore desirable to postpone deciding precisely what attitude we should adopt in the Fund until considerably nearer the date of the meeting. It might be necessary for our representativesthen to say that, while we were ready in principle to participate in discussions about a programme for a concerted move to Article VIIIin 1960, we should not be able to say for the time being what our
attitude in those discussions would be. On the other hand,circumstances might be such as to enable our representatives inSeptember to give a more positive indication of our attitude.In discussing the possibility of an early announcement of a further list of import relaxations, it was pointed out that there wereparticular objections to some of the items which it had been suggestedmight be included e.g., machinery for the oil industry, fish, meat and paper. Although other items might be substituted for these, itwould be difficult to compose a list of items to be liberalised whichwould not be controversial but would be extensive enough to havea decisive effect on the trade policies of the United States. While itwas undoubtedly important to encourage the United States to resist pressure to increase her trade restrictions, the danger of restrictiveaction by the United States in the next few weeks was not very great.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet appreciated the importance of encouraging the United states administration in liberal trade policies, and they accepted thedesirability of moving towards the removal of the remainingrestrictions, save those on certain hard-core items. But it was their view that on balance a further instalment of liberalisation would be premature at the present time. It would not be possible to decideprecisely what attitude we should adopt to a proposal for working out a programme for a concerted move to Article VIII until nearer the date of the meeting of the Fund. There were a number of ways inwhich our attitude might be formulated, depending on the politicaland international circumstances at the time, and the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer would examine the possible courses. Meanwhile, incase the danger that the United States might adopt more restrictive trade policies were to become acute, the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the other Ministers concerned should prepare an explanation ofour position, which the Economic Minister in Washington might be instructed to present if need arose.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that a further instalment of liberalisation of imports should be postponed for the time being.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to examine thedifferent ways in which, at the meeting of the international monetary Fund in September, our attitude to a proposalfor working out a programme for a concerted move to article VIII might be formulated.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe other Ministers concerned, to prepare an explanation of the Governmenfs attitude to liberalisation which theEconomic Minister in Washington would be instructed to deliver to the United States Administration if the need arose.Horticulture.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 7thConclusions,Minute 4.)The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Minister ofAgriculture (C. (59) 91) and the Chancellor of the Exchequer(C. (59) 132) about support for horticulture.The Minister of Agriculture said that, although the industryaccepted the tariff as the main instrument for the Governmenfssupport of horticulture, the President of the National Farmers&apos; union had, on account of the removal of the bacon and other agriculturaltariffs in the bilateral agreement with Denmark, sought reassuranceabout the Governmenfs policy. He was already examining whatalternative forms support for horticulture might take. Although the
agricultural policy.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 44thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of memoranda by theMinister of Agriculture (C. (59) 116) and the Chancellor of theExchequer (C. (59) 127) about assurances to farming.The Minister of Agriculture said that, in addition to thereassurance which he had given to pig producers in the course of the debate in Parliament on 21st July, it was desirable to restore theconfidence of the farming industry by giving an assurance that tariffs on agricultural or horticultural products which were not covered byguaranteed prices would not be removed unless equivalent supportwere given in other ways, and by reinforcing the existing assurancesunder the Agriculture Acts. The latter reassurance could be limitedto the provision in the 1957 Act for the stability of the overallguarantee, or it could also apply to the provision in that Act for the stability of the guarantees in respect of particular commodities. he proposed to examine to what extent a reassurance in respect of the guarantees for particular commodities would affect the liability whichwould arise from an assurance in respect of the overall guarantee.studies by officials were not yet complete, it was unlikely that a generally practicable alternative to tariff protection could be found.It seemed impossible to operate a system of deficiency payments for horticulture, and the scope for direct grants was limited. The generaluse of quotas for horticultural products was open to serious objections, and the time might well come when some alternative tothe quotas which were still operated for certain products would haveto be found. Minimum price schemes might be feasible, in place ofthe existing quota arrangements, for apples and pears, and it wouldbe useful to undertake confidential discussions with the national farmers&apos; Union on this point. It was likely that a number of furtherapplications for increases in tariffs on horticultural products would shortly be submitted to the Tariff Advisory Committee. TheCommittee&apos;s examination of these cases might be more realistic ifthe principles which they followed were amended to include the need to take account of the Governments obligations, which applied tohorticulture as well as to agriculture, under the 1947 Act.In discussion it was suggested that, while there might be reasonfor the disappointment of certain sections of the horticultural industry with the findings of the Tariff Advisory Committee on a number ofrecent applications, the value of the existing tariff structure overhorticultural products as a whole tended to be overlooked.The Prime Minister said that final decisions on the important and complex questions of the Governments policy towards horticulturecould not be reached until the examinations being made by officials were complete. But some preliminary expression of the governments attitude to the industry would need to be worked out, for instance to enable a reply to be given to the President of the National Farmers&apos;Union; this should be considered by the Home Secretary and a small group of Ministers. The confidential discussions with the Union onthe practicability of minimum price schemes for apples and pearswould be useful in this connexion.The Cabinet (4) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State forScotland, the Minister of Labour, and the Minister ofAgriculture, to consider how the Governments policy towards horticulture might best be formulated.
0The Cabinet-Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State forScotland, the Minister of Labour and the Minister ofQAgriculture, to consider how reassurances to farming, as suggested by the Minister of Agriculture, might best be formulated.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,24th July, 1959.
