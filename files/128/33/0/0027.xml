Space 2.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the LordResearch.       President of the Council and the Minister of Defence (C. (59) 73and 76) on space research.The Lord President said that the Advisory Council on scientific policy (A.C.S.P.) had strongly supported a plan, drawn up by representatives of the Royal Society in consultation with the Ministryof Supply, to initiate a research programme designed to producescientific instruments which could be carried by earth satellites inorder to acquire knowledge of conditions in outer space. Theprogramme for the design and production of the instruments couldbe completed within two or three years and would cost  100,000 to 200,000 a year. The instruments could be carried in satelliteslaunched either from American rockets or from some modificationof our own BLUE STREAK, which could be adapted for the purposeat an estimated cost of between  10 and  20 millions over five years.The United States Government had already made an offer to theInternational Committee on Space Research to undertake, free of charge, the launching of satellites to carry instruments produced byscientists of other countries and there was a reasonable prospect thatthey would be willing to make a bilateral agreement for the launching of satellites containing our instruments. Since, however, it was notyet certain how far it would be technically possible to take advantageof any American offer, a team of experts should be sent to discussthe matter with the United States authorities as soon as possible.Until it was known what help we could obtain from the UnitedStates, no decision should be taken to link the instrumentationprogramme with the development of BLUE STREAK. Meanwhile,it would be desirable to appoint a Steering Group to co-ordinate thefunctions of the Departments concerned with the various aspects of space research and, since it would not be possible to avoid public knowledge of the despatch of the expert Mission to the United states or the initiation of the design programme in the universities, anannouncement of the Governments proposals would be necessary.The Minister of Defence said that, if we were to maintain ourposition as a leading scientific country, it would not in his view be enough to rely on launching facilities provided by the United States.We should therefore decide at least to put in hand design studiesfor the adaptation of BLUE STREAK. We should then be in aposition to undertake a programme of satellite launchings on ourown if, as he thought it would, that turned out to be desirable.In discussion the view was expressed that the expenditure of between  10 and  20 millions spread over five years would not bedisproportionate to the cost of research in analogous fields. to confine our space programme to the production of instruments tobe carried in American-launched satellites might damage our international prestige. On the other hand, we could not hope onour own to compete with the United States in this field. It wouldbe more realistic to proceed in co-operation with them and possibly with other Commonwealth and European countries. Moreover, theA.C.S.P. had not been prepared to say that a programme of fiveterrestrial satellites carrying the instruments recommended in the scientific programme justified the expenditure of between  10 and 20 millions. Experience suggested that this estimate was likely tobe greatly exceeded in the event and it might well be that the moneyParliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Parliament would adjourn for the Whitsun recess on 15th Mayand would reassemble on 2nd June.
could be more profitably devoted to other research projects, such asthe development of civil aircraft. Before deciding on expenditureof this order or indeed making any statement which could commitus to such expenditure at a later stage, further thought should begiven to the competing claims of other research projects. If an early statement was necessary, its terms should be as guarded as possible.It should, in particular, make no reference to the estimated cost ofthe instrument programme proposed, since this by itself woulddisappoint public expectations.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that fromthe scientific point of view it was the instruments, not the launchingvehicles, which were important; and public opinion might be satisfied with a statement that we were not yet in a position to reach a decisionon the latter. It might in the end be desirable to develop our ownlaunching rockets by the adaptation of BLUE STREAK; or we mightproceed in co-operation with the United States, or with other commonwealth and European countries; or we might, indeed, find it impossible to proceed with any major programme of space researchat all. Before a decision could be reached, it would be necessary toconsider the relative priorities of this and other research projectsbut, in the meantime, consultations could be undertaken with theUnited States and other countries and an immediate start would bemade with a limited programme for the construction of the necessaryinstruments. The object of any statement should be to show thatwe were taking all the steps necessary to put ourselves in a positionto take a decision on the extent of British participation in space research when all the relevant information was available.The Cabinet -(1) Authorised expenditure of a sum between  100,000 and 200,000 a year on a research programme on scientificinstruments to be flown in earth satellites; and of about 50,000 on design studies for the adaptation of blue streak in case it were later decided to develop it forthe purposes of space research.(2) Invited the Lord President (i) to arrange for consultation with the United Statesand other countries on the provision of launchingfacilities for earth satellites carrying Britishinstruments;(ii) in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the Minister of Defence and the Minister of Supply,to prepare and submit to the Prime Minister adraft statement on the lines indicated by the PrimeMinister in summing up the Cabinefs discussions;(iii) to arrange for the appointment of a Steering group on space research, on the lines proposed inC. (59) 73.Commonwealth 3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Common-Education, wealth Secretary (C. (59) 75) on the scale of the United Kingdom(Previous contribution to be offered at the forthcoming conference onC cer(58)6 70th Commonwealth Education towards a combined CommonwealthConclusions. effort in education.Minute 3.)The Commonwealth Secretary said that the ministerial committee which was supervising the preparations for this conference were in favour of a programme costing  10 millions over five years.Other Commonwealth countries, particularly Canada and Australia,might be expected to contribute about  3 millions towards this total,leaving the United Kingdom to contribute  7 millions, at the rate of
about  If millions a year. At the Commonwealth EconomicConference in Montreal it had been agreed that concerted efforts should be made to expand educational activities throughout theCommonwealth, and a special conference, had been convened forthis purpose. It was important that a practical and constructivescheme should emerge from this conference, and a  10 millionsprogramme would make an impact on public opinion throughoutthe Commonwealth.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, for the reasonssummarised in C. (59) 75, he had been reluctant to agree that theUnited Kingdom contribution should exceed  5 millions. He didnot question the merits of the plan, but he was concerned at the rising trend in Government expenditure and he felt that, at a timewhen we had to ration other projects for productive investment, we ought not to commit ourselves to spending as much as  7 millions on this project.In discussion there was support for the view that, while we shouldcontinue to aim at getting the Conference to endorse a  10 millionsprogramme, we should not at the outset offer to contribute as muchas  7 millions towards this. We should rather offer a contribution of  6 millions and aim to persuade the other Commonwealth countries to subscribe between them the balance required to finance the  10millions programme.The Cabinet Agreed that, at the forthcoming conference on Common-wealth Education, the United Kingdom delegation should support a programme for a total expenditure of  10 millions over five years, and should be authorised to offer a UnitedKingdom contribution of  6 millions towards such a programme.commercial policy.liberalisation of dollar imports.(previous reference :C.C. (59) 25thConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the proposals forrelaxing the restrictions on dollar imports, in the light of a further memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (59) 74).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that we should come undersevere criticism if we did not take some further step towardsliberalisation on the lines proposed in his earlier memorandum(C. (59) 70). The failure of France to remove quotas on imports from north America was at present being attacked in the international monetary Fund (I.M.F.) and it was likely that we would soon besubject to similar criticism there, and at the meeting of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) next month. Our EconomicMinister in Washington had warned us that failure to take some stepof this sort would strengthen the protectionist pressures in the UnitedStates and make it difficult for the United States Administration toavoid following a more restricted trade policy. By our declarationat Montreal in September 1958 we had undertaken to proceed witha further measure of liberalisation if all was well with our financialposition and, if we did not do so, there would be a growing suspicion that our balance of payments position was not really sound. Themeeting of Commonwealth officials which was to begin in thefollowing week would expect to be told what our attitude was onliberalisation, and it would be convenient if we could then say thatour proposals had been communicated to the other commonwealth governments.In discussion it was suggested that such a measure of furtherliberalisation would be unlikely, in itself, to affect United States trade
policies. But it would help to demonstrate to the I.M.F. and GATTthat we were trying to fulfil our obligations, and this would be valuablefrom the point of view of our international credit. It would be helpful if the announcement of a further measure of liberalisation could be accompanied by evidence that the United States would be moresympathetic to our commercial interests. Unfortunately, it was most unlikely that this would happen; for, not only had the recent decision on the American wool tariff and quota been detrimental tous, but it was doubtful whether the questions of the DECCAnavigational aid and the British Overseas Airways CorporationPacific route would be settled in our favour. Nevertheless, our export trade to the United States had steadily increased, and therewas a great deal at stake; the value of our car exports to the UnitedStates in 1958 had been no less than  63 millions. The cost of thefurther measure of liberalisation now proposed was small comparedwith our total import bill. The relaxations now under considerationcovered about 7 per cent, of current imports from the United States;and, if they were introduced, between 15 and 20 per cent, of our imports from the United States would still be subject to quota,compared with only 5 per cent, from Europe. On balance there was much to be said for a further measure of liberalisation, if it would maintain our international credit and help to prevent a deterioration in United States trade policies.The Cabinet then considered the extent of any further measuresof liberalisation and the following points were raised:  (a) There would still be tariff protection on the United Statesgoods which it was proposed to liberalise, amounting to 10-20 per cent,in nearly every case. A general revalorisation of these tariffs wouldnot be practicable, but there might well be a case for seeking tonegotiate a modification in the tariffs which were of interest to theWest Indies.(b) The proposal to relax restriction on dollar imports ofalcoholic beverages might severely damage the Jamaican rumindustry.  It would be preferable to exclude rum from the list.(c) It was undesirable, on general grounds, to liberalise theimport of United States periodicals. As regards books, the general position was that these could at present be imported from the UnitedStates except for fiction. Liberalisation might lead to severecompetition from American paper-backed novels and it would be worth examining the possibility of limiting certain categories of these imports.(a7) In view of the value of our car exports, it would be worth considering an increase in the limited quota for American cars. Weshould consider increasing it to the equivalent of the total of the quota for French and German cars. Alternatively, the present quota for American cars might be increased from 650 to 1,000. Since thepresent quota was not in fact fully taken up, it could be hoped thatany such increase would not involve a significant additional expenditure of dollars.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it would probablybe enough to put forward a list of items to be liberalised costingsomewhat less than the  17 millions involved in his proposals.Although there would be advantage in announcing a decision duringthe GAIT&quot; meeting, it was not essential to make an announcementbefore Parliament rose for the Whitsun recess. He would like toinform the United States Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Anderson,in confidence of our proposals on 7th May but he would not thenparticularise about the items.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that itwas the general view of the Cabinet that a further measure of liberalisation of dollar imports would, on the whole, be in our
The Cabinet (1) Agreed that a further measure of liberalisation of dollar imports should be introduced.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the President of the Board of Trade and the other ministers concerned, to revise the list of items to beliberalised on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister,and to arrange for the revised list to be communicated tothe Commonwealth and Colonial Governments concerned.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to urge on theUnited States Secretary of the Treasury the desirabilityof reaching decisions to show that United States trade policy was favourable to British interests.5.   The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that, in accord-ance with the procedure which had been agreed with the Federationof trawler owners, the Master of a British trawler, who had recentlybeen charged with fishing within the 4-mile limit, had&apos; been instructed by his owners to stand for trial, but had then been chargedwith other offences, including that of fishing within the 12-mileC.C. (59) 14th limit.   He had been sentenced to a fine and imprisonment.   TheConclusions,    sentence of imprisonment was contrary to assurances given informallyMinute 4.)      by the Icelandic Government. Although the Master had been releasedon bail, the incident made it necessary to reconsider the desirabilityof trawler owners instructing the Masters of vessels intercepted withinthe 4-mile limit to surrender for the alleged offence of fishing there.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that the present policy should be continued only if a firm undertaking could be securedfrom the Icelandic Government that a charge would relate only toan offence committed within the 4-mile limit. If this undertakingwas not forthcoming, the owners should not again instruct the master of a trawler which had been intercepted while fishing within the4-mile limit to proceed to an Icelandic port to stand trial for the alleged offence. But they should be asked to consider whether in such circumstances they should offer to pay a sum of money in lieu of aTerritorialWaters.IcelandicFisheryLimits.(previous reference:best economic and financial interests. The list proposed shouldbe reconsidered by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the other Ministers concerned, with a view to excluding rumand periodicals; to discriminating, if possible, between certain categories of books; to including some increase for cars; and to reaching a total cost of about  15 millions, in addition to thecost of the measure of liberalisation proposed for Colonial territories.When the list had been agreed by the Ministers concerned, theproposals should be put to the other Commonwealth and colonial governments concerned, with a view to taking their commentsinto account in working out a final list. If possible, the other commonwealth Governments should be informed of our proposals before the forthcoming meeting of Commonwealth officials.Provisionally, we should aim to make a final announcement duringthe Whitsun recess.There would no doubt be considerable public criticism of adecision to liberalise United States imports. When Mr. Andersonwas informed of our general intention, he should therefore be told that it was extremely desirable that there should be some earlyevidence of American decisions which would be favourable to british trade interests.
fine that would normally be imposed by the Icelandic courts forsuch an offence. This modified procedure would be a protection from arbitrary action by Icelandic courts, but would still indicate a desire to preserve reasonable relations with the Icelandic authorities.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries to seek the co-operation of the Federation of trawler owners in theprocedure which he had proposed.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,30th April, 1959.
