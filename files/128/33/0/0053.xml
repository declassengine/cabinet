Genera!Election,1959.(previous reference:C.C.(59)51stConclusions,Minute 7.)C.C 53 (59)The Prime Minister said that this was the last meeting of theAdministration which he had formed in January 1957. He expressed his gratitude to his colleagues for their loyal support in the past. Thereturn of a Conservative Government for the third time in successionwas a notable achievement, but it placed a great responsibility on thenew Government.The Prime Minister said that, in accordance with precedent, hewould ask all Ministers to regard their offices as placed at his disposal,in order to facilitate a reconstruction of the Government. He hopedthat this would be completed by the end of the week. Meanwhile,Ministers in charge of Departments should continue to supervise thecurrent work of their Departments.Committees of the Cabinet would be reconstituted in due course.Meanwhile, however, it was urgently necessary that work should beput in hand on the drafting of the Queen&apos;s Speech on the Openingof Parliament and on the formulation of the legislative programme for the coming session. He would therefore arrange for a small number of his colleagues to undertake this task at once on a personalbasis.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of this statement by the PrimeMinister.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,12th October, 1959.
