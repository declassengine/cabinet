Federationof rhodesia and Nyasaland.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 20thConclusions,Minute 1.)advisory commission.2. The Prime Minister -said that, as a result of the discussionsrecently held with the Prime Minister of the Federation of rhodesia and Nyasaland, a plan had now been evolved for the appointment ofa commission to advise the Government on the review of theFederation^ constitution which was due to take place in 1960. Thecommission would be appointed in the autumn. It would consist ofan independent chairman and 25 members, of whom 13, including5 Africans, would be appointed from Africa 4 by the federal government itself and 3 from each of its constituent ^territories. Ofthe remaining 12 members, 6 would be Privy Counsellors from theUnited Kingdom, 2 would be selected from Commonwealth countrieswhich had experience of federal systems and the remaining 4 would be independent persons capable of advising on constitutional questions.The commission would be required &quot; to advise the five Governments,in preparation for the 1960 review, on the constitutional programme and framework best suited to achieving the objects contained in theConstitution of 1953 including the Preamble.&quot;The Prime Minister proposed to announce this plan in astatement in the House ,of Commons ,on 21st July, in preparation fora debate on the subject on the following day. It was known that theOpposition would prefer a commission consisting wholly of membersof the United Kingdom Parliament, but this would not take accountof the legitimate interests of the Federation.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, -of this statement by the PrimeMinister.Nyasaland The Cabinet were informed that the report of the committeeEmergency. under Mr. Justice Devlin on the recent disturbances in Nyasaland would be submitted to the Colonial Secretary that day. The report should be published at an early date, accompanied by the observations of the Governor.In discussion it was suggested that, from the point of view of Pressreactions, there would be some disadvantage in publishing the reportimmediately before a weekend. On the other hand, if publicationwere deferred until the last week before the summer recess, therewould be no time before the House rose for the debate for which theOpposition were expected to ask.The Cabinet-(2) Agreed that the report of the committee on the recent disturbances in Nyasaland, together with the observations of the Governor, should be made available to Members ofParliament on the evening of 23rd July and published inthe morning newspapers on 24th July.0Kenya.HolaDetentionCamp.(previous reference:CC. (59) 34thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Cabinet were informed that the Governor of Kenya had now received and considered the report of the disciplinaryproceedings following the incident at the hold Detention Campin which a number of detainees had been killed. A despatch would shortly be received from the Governor setting out the action whichhe proposed to take in respect of the individual officers affected andthe organisation of the two Departments responsible for theadministration of prisons and detention camps.Parliament. 1.  The Cabinet were informed of the business-to :be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week. It was hoped thatit would be possible for Parliament to be adjourned for the summer recess on 29th July.
In discussion it was agreed that it would be convenient if thesetwo documents were published at the same time as the report of thecommittee on the recent disturbances in Nyasaland.The Cabinet Agreed that the report on the disciplinary proceedingsfollowing the recent incident at the hold Detention Campand a related despatch from the Governor of Kenya shouldbe made available to Members of Parliament on the evening of 23rd July and published in the morningnewspapers on 24th July.Nottingham 4.   The Home Secretary said that the Nottingham City CouncilCity Police. recently suspended their Chief Constable from duty on the suspension of ground that he had refused to report to the Council on investigationsChief Constabiehe had set on foot into the activities of certain of their members.Responsibility for the enforcement of the criminal law rested with theChief Constable (whose action in this case was supported by theDirector of Public Prosecutions), and the Home Secretary had informed the Council of his view that they should reverse their decision to suspend the Chief Constable from duty. If they declined to accept that view they might take one of three possible courses.First, they might dismiss the Chief Constable, when it would be opento the Home Secretary to hold an enquiry. Secondly, they might askfor an enquiry without reversing their decision, in which event itwould be necessary to consider the appointment of a tribunal underthe Tribunals of Enquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921. Thirdly, they might take no action and continue to suspend the Chief Constable, in which event the Home Secretary would consider withholding the police grant payable to them.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Home Secretary.nationalised industries.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 84thConclusions.Ivlinute 4.)Proposals forReorganisation.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (59) 117) covering a report by officials on the problemsof the nationalised industries.The Home Secretary said that this report had been examined bya Committee of Ministers under his chairmanship and would providea valuable basis for legislation in the next Parliament. Briefly, itrecommended that the Boards of the nationalised industries should begiven greater independence and responsibility, and that their financialand economic obligations should be defined more clearly. Itrecommended that in the case of the coal and transport industriesthere should be greater decentralisation, and a move towards a typeof organisation more closely analogous to that of large private under-takings. It also recommended that more precise financial targetsshould be set for the nationalised industries and that these should bemade public. This raised the question how far it was desirable toretain Ministerial control over the price policies of the industries. it seemed clear that&apos; Ministers should retain ultimate control in some form over price increases for the basic services provided by the nationalised industries. But it might be that Ministerial intervention,since it would probably have to be more overt, should become less frequent. Other important points which would need furtherconsideration were the possibility of some specific subsidy for railway services which were uneconomic but socially desirable; the need tofind some better way of taking the views of consumers into account inthe determination of prices; and the possibility that, as their creditbecame sounder, the nationalised industries might resort to the market for some part of their capital requirements.
Post Office. 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeFuture Status.  Secretary (C. (59) 118) on the future status of the Post Office.(Previous The Home Secretary said that the proposals which had been reference: ^ submitted to the Cabinet in April by the Chancellor of the ExchequerC.c. (59) 23rd ancq fae Postmaster-General (in C. (59) 67) for changing the financialMinuteS16)S&apos;    status of the Post 0ffice had now been examined bY the Committee ofMinisters under his chairmanship which had  also consideredthe problems of the nationalised industries.   The Committee had reached the conclusion that, on merits, the proposals were sound.They would, however, need to be carefully presented in order toavoid the danger that they might be used as an argument for applying the Departmental type of organisation to the nationalised industries.They should be presented as a logical sequence to the grant to the PostOffice, in 1955, of a measure of self-contained finance.  Moreover, inorder to avoid stimulating enquiries about the GovernmentsAlthough some reservations might be made about the effect of the economic and financial proposals, especially in view of the difficultyof defining the extent of Ministerial control over price policies, therecommendations for structural reorganisation of the National coal board and the British Transport Commission should be ofconsiderable help in making the coal and transport industries more efficient.Further detailed study would be needed before these recommendations could be put into effect, and consultation with the boards would also be necessary. It would be inexpedient to initiatethese negotiations before an Election. It was therefore proposed that,if the recommendations were approved in principle, further work on them should be undertaken by officials, but no approach should bemade to the Boards until after an Election.In discussion it was agreed that Ministers would need to give further consideration to the problem of the degree and form of ministerial control over the price policies of the nationalised industries. It was recognised that this problem governed the extentto which practical effect could be given to the recommendations fordefining more clearly the economic and financial obligations of the nationalised industries. Moreover, the degree to which the industries would be free, through their price policies, to make a profit would bea main factor in deciding whether they could obtain their capital requirements on the open market.After further discussion The Prime Minister said that it was thegeneral view of the Cabinet that the financial and organisationalchanges recommended by officials, as modified by the views of theCommittee of Ministers, might provide a valuable basis for future policy towards the nationalised industries. The Cabinet would need to give further consideration at a later date to a number of problems,in particular that of control over price policies, which would have tobe resolved before negotiations could be undertaken with the Boards.On this account, and also because it was important not to make the nationalised industries a subject of political controversy at the presenttime, the recommendations should not be revealed, in discussions withthe Boards or otherwise, for the time being. But meanwhile further study could be made of the proposals by officials of the Departmentsconcerned, so that a detailed plan would be available when required.The Cabinet Approved the recommendations in the report by officialsattached to the memorandum by the Home Secretary(C. (59) 1.17), as modified by the comments in that memorandum, as a basis for further study by officials.
intentions regarding the nationalised industries, it would be preferable that the detailed proposals for the Post Office should not be publishedbefore an Election. A White Paper could be prepared with a view to publication early in a new Parliament. It was unlikely that thenecessary legislation could be introduced ^before the second session ofa new Parliament.In discussion there was general support for the proposals and forthe timetable suggested by the Home Secretary. The point was made that strong Parliamentary objection might be taken to the proposal that Post Office receipts should not be paid into the consolidate fund.The Postmaster-General said that he would not press his proposalto make all tariff changes subject to negative resolution. But hewarned the Cabinet that this might have ;to be conceded when theproposals came to be debated in Parliament. It would be difficult todefend the present position, under which some tariff changes couldbe made without any Parliamentary authority, some were subject tonegative resolution, and others required amending legislation. Hewould also be content to settle with the Chancellor of the exchequer the basis of calculation of the Post Office contribution to theExchequer and the charges for agency services. He thought that thePost Office should have a financial target comparable with thosewhich might in due course be negotiated with the nationalised industries: that target could then be taken into account in determining the level of Post Office charges to other Departments foragency services.The Cabinet Approved the recommendations in paragraph 10 ofC. (59) 118.Gas Peices. 7.   The Minister of Powpr said that three Gas Boards were facedwith serious deficits and proposed to raise their prices to consumers.The Scottish Board were proposing an increase of 10 per cent., theNorth Western Board 6 per cent., and the North Eastern Board 2\ percent. He had no statutory power to prevent the Boards from raisingtheir prices. Nor did he wish to try to persuade the Boards not tomake these price increases, which were fully justified on economic grounds. He would, however, try to persuade the Boards to postpone announcing the price increases until early in August.The Cabinet were informed that the large increase proposed forScotland was the result partly of increased costs and partly of theuneconomic production involved in supplying gas to smallcommunities. The possibility of rationalising the supply of gas and electricity in Scotland was under discussion by the Boards.The Cabinet Approved the proposal of the Minister of Power to persuade the Gas Boards, if possible, to postponeannouncing increases in gas prices until early in August.Spain.Abolitionof Visas.(previous reference:CM. (55) 36thConclusions,Minute 2.)8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary and the Colonial Secretary (C. (59) 120) pn the abolition ofvisas between the United Kingdom and Spain.The Spanish Government had unilaterally abolished visas for united Kingdom visitors and we were willing to conclude with thema bilateral agreement abolishing visas for the citizens of both countries and their overseas territories. The Spaniards had, however, in 1954imposed irksome restrictions on movement in either direction acrossthe frontier between Gibraltar and Spain and had shown themselvesunwilling to remove these or substantially to modify them.  It was
Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,16th July, 1959.therefore suggested that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should propose,at the same time as the visa-abolition agreement, an exchange of noteswhich, while recognising the special military nature of the area of spain immediately adjoining the frontier, would abolish the special restrictions on travellers passing through that area between gibraltar and the rest of Spain. H.M. Ambassador at Madrid might be instructed to press the draft exchange of notes on the SpanishGovernment as strongly as possible without representing the exchangeas an absolute condition of the visa-abolition agreement.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals in C. (59) 120.
