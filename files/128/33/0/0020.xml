Federation of rhodesia and nyasaland.previous reference:C.C. (59) 19thConclusions.Minute 4.)1. The Cabinet were informed that if the Commission ofEnquiry into the recent disturbances in Nyasaland, whose appointmentunder the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Devlin had been announced on the previous day, was constituted under statutory powers, theproceedings would be judicial in character and there was a risk that,in present circumstances, witnesses would be inhibited by intimidationand threats of reprisal. It might, therefore, be preferable that theenquiry should be established by administrative action under the prerogative. Although it would not then be possible to require theproduction of evidence, and witnesses would not be represented by counsel, the proceedings could take place in private.With regard to the wider enquiry envisaged in preparation forthe 1960 review of the Federal constitution, there was reason to suppose that the Opposition would urge that the body appointed forthis purpose should be free to consider the possibility of the secessionof Nyasaland from the Federation. This would probably be unwelcome to the Federal Government, and it would therefore benecessary to consider with care both the form and the scope of the wider enquiry. (The Cabinet \(1) Invited the Colonial Secretary, in consultation with theLord Chancellor, to give further consideration to themanner in which the enquiry into the recent disturbances in Nyasaland could most appropriately be constituted.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation withthe Colonial Secretary, to give further consideration tothe composition and terms of reference of the proposedlonger-term enquiry in preparation for the 1960 reviewof the Constitution of the Federation of Rhodesia and nyasaland.Germany.Visit of PrimeMinister andForeignSecretaryto Ottawa and washington.(previous reference :CC. (59) 19thConclusions,Minute 1.)*2. The Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary made a reportto the Cabinet on the course of the discussions which they had heldin their recent visit to Ottawa and Washington.In Ottawa there had been strong support for the view that asettlement of the Berlin problem should be sought by negotiation.Canadian Ministers were seriously concerned at the possibility ofprecipitate forceful action by the United States.In Washington it had been more difficult to find common ground.At the outset of the discussions there had seemed to be little flexibility in the attitude of the United States Administration, either on theprocedure for negotiation or on the substance of the problems. Insome quarters in Washington there was still a disposition to suppose that, if the Western Powers stood firm on their existing rights inBerlin, the Russians would abate their demands. And president eisenhower was unwilling to be committed to a meeting of Heads of governments until it had been demonstrated, by progress at a meetingof Foreign Ministers, that the Soviet Government were ready topay some price for a negotiated settlement. In the course of the conversations, however, good progress had been made towards acommon view, at least on the procedure for conducting the forth-coming international negotiations. President Eisenhower had accepted our formulation of the purpose of the Foreign Ministers&apos;meeting namely &quot; to reach positive agreements over as wide a fieldas possible, and in any case to narrow the differences between therespective points of view and to prepare constructive proposals for
consideration by a conference of Heads of Governments later in the summer.&quot; In return. United Kingdom Ministers had accepted the somewhat equivocal formula proposed by the President with a viewto implying that a Summit meeting would be conditional on progressby the Foreign Ministers namely that on this understandingregarding the purposes of the Foreign Ministers&apos; meeting and &quot; assoon as developments in the Foreign Ministers&apos; meeting warrantholding a Summit conference,&quot; the two Governments would be glad to participate in such a conference. Although he remained unwilling to go further than this in any communication to the SovietGovernment, President Eisenhower had recognised that a summit meeting would in fact be held in the course of the summer; and hehad been ready to discuss whether this meeting could be held in theUnited States, how its business could best be organised and how hecould reconcile his attendance at it with his Presidential duties. Onthis basis agreement had been reached on the terms of a draft replyto the Soviet Note of 2nd March. This draft had now been consideredby the North Atlantic Council, and the reply would be delivered and made public in the course of the following day. Although the reply had not yet been published, it was widely assumed by the press and the public in the United States that a meeting of Heads of governments would in fact be held in the course of the year. it seemed likely that this impression would make a greater impact on public opinion than the actual terms of the reply; and it was, therefore,to be hoped that the Soviet Government would not reject the reply,although they might continue to argue about the representation ofPoland and Czechoslovakia at the forthcoming meetings.On the substance of the German problem there had been lessprogress towards a common Anglo-American view. The UnitedStates Administration were still disposed to think that the western powers would do better to stand on their existing rights in respectof West Berlin than to seek a new agreement supported by widerinternational guarantees. Even the President, who took a broaderview of this than some of his advisers, thought it would be easier tonegotiate some adjustment of the existing agreements though he recognised that a new agreement, if it could be obtained, would have greater advantages in the longer term. The State Department weretending to take a legalistic view of the problem and to place moreemphasis on form than on substance. But it had been reassuring tofind that at least the civil side of the Pentagon were hoping that apolitical solution could be found, and recognised that no militarysolution would be practicable without the use of nuclear weapons.It was possible that, on the substance of the Berlin problem, weshould not be able to find at the meeting of the four Western Powerson 31st March a common line which we could confidently support.But it seemed likely that, at the subsequent meeting of the north atlantic Council, we should find that the Scandinavians andCanadians and the Secretary-General would be ready to support themore constructive approach which we should prefer to make.On the other subjects discussion had disclosed no substantialdifference of view between the two Governments.Thus, it had been agreed that further study should be made ofthe possibility of defining an agreed area in Europe in which therewould be a limitation of forces and weapons, subject to inspection.It had also been agreed that the tv/o Governments should jointlystudy the alternative courses which might be pursued when the geneva Conference on Nuclear Tests reassembled on 13th April.From recent scientific calculations it now appeared that it would bepossible to conceal underground tests of much larger size than had previously been supposed and, further, that tests could be made inouter space. The military and scientific authorities in the UnitedStates would themselves prefer to be free to continue to carry outunderground tests. The State Department foresaw difficulty injustifying to Congress an agreement prohibiting underground tests
Middle East.(previous reference :C.C. (59) 3rdConclusions,Minute 7 and cc. (58) 66thConclusions,Minute 1.)Iraq.03. The Minister of Defence informed the Cabinet that, in thelight of the announcement on the previous day that Iraq had ceased to be a member of the Baghdad Pact, the R.A.F. personnel atHabbaniya no longer served any military purpose and should nowbe withdrawn. It would be preferable that we should take theinitiative in this matter and should not await a demand from the iraqi Government for the withdrawal of these units.In discussion there was general agreement with this proposal.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theMinister of Defence, to arrange for the Iraqi Governmentto be informed that the United Kingdom government intended to withdraw the R.A.F. personnel at Habbaniyaat the earliest practicable date.which could not be effectively enforced. On both grounds, therefore,the Administration were attracted by the idea of working for anagreement limited to the prohibition of tests in the atmosphere.But President Eisenhower recognised the presentational advantageof a more comprehensive agreement and the importance of securingsome practical application of a system of international inspectionwithin national boundaries.There had been a useful exchange of views on policy in respectof the Middle East and the Far East.Finally, there had been discussions on Anglo-American trade questions, both with the President and also with the Secretary of theTreasury and the Secretary of Commerce. United kingdom ministers had stressed the need for an expansion of world trade,and had deprecated the protectionist action recently taken against certain United Kingdom exporters. The members of the UnitedStates Administration had replied that they fully accepted theprinciple of liberalising world trade; that the particular cases ofwhich complaint was made were isolated exceptions in a general pattern of increased Anglo-American trade; and that they were dueto the heavy political pressures which certain American industries were able to bring to bear, especially at a time of heavy unemploy-ment, on the Administration and on Congress. Nevertheless it wasto be hoped that the representations which the United kingdom ministers had made at the highest level would have some effect.The Secretary of the Treasury had explained his project for theestablishment of a new international organisation to financedevelopment projects by long-term loans at low rates of interestrepayable in local currencies. It had appeared that he was nowthinking in terms of an initial fund not exceeding $1 billion. He was anxious to find a suitable opportunity for personal discussion of this project with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Cabinet -Took note of this report of the discussions which the PrimeMinister and the Foreign Secretary had held with theGovernments of the United States and Canada during their recent visit to Washington and Ottawa.
Egypt.financial agreement.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 16thConclusions.Minute 2.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (59) 60) to which was annexed thedraft of an Order in Council providing for the registration and determination of claims against the sum of  27^ millions to be paid fjjby way of compensation by the Egyptian Government under therecent Anglo-Egyptian Financial Agreement.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the draft Order gave rise to two points of possible political controversy. The first related to the position of the Ottoman Bank; the second to certain cases inwhich property formerly owned by a British national in Egypt had subsequently been acquired by a non-British national.The Ottoman Bank operated under a Turkish Charter and wasnot, technically, a British national. It could, therefore, be argued thatthe Bank did not fall within the scope of the Financial Agreement andwas not entitled to receive compensation from the lump-sum payment.On the other hand, it was largely managed from London; it had aBritish chairman; and its claim, for about  2 millions, had beentaken into account by both parties to the negotiations which had resulted in the Financial Agreement. We should, therefore, becommitting a breach of faith if we now debarred the Bank fromregistering a claim against the lump sum.On the second issue there were probably very few cases in which british property in Egypt had, since Egyptianisation or sequestration,been acquired by a non-British national. It was arguable, however,,that in such cases the title to compensation should follow the title to the property. On the other hand, the Financial Agreement hadbeen explicitly confined to property belonging to British nationalsat the date of signature; and we were not in a position to give adischarge to the Egyptian authorities in respect of the claims of owners who were non-British at that date. The balance of advantage,therefore, appeared to lie in limiting the scope of the draft Orderaccordingly. It would be desirable, however, that Parliament should,if necessary, be assured that, if any cases of hardship resulted fromthis arrangement, the Government would be prepared to consider them on their merits.The A attorney-General concurred&apos; in these proposals. Inparticular it would be preferable to admit the claim of the OttomanBank specifically rather than to attempt to. enlarge the scope of theOrder to cover any other foreign corporations which might be in asimilar ambiguous position. No such cases were known; and, ifany emerged, they could be dealt with, if necessary, by an AmendingOrder.In discussion there was general agreement with these views.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (59) 60.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,25th March, 1959.
