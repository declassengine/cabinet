The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would authorise additional expenditure of  450,000 on the oversea Information Services for 1960-61, on theunderstanding that this would be reduced to the extent that savings were secured in the overseas services of the B.B.C.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to arrangefor a programme for increasing the export of Britishbooks and periodicals to be carried out within this limit of expenditure.SECRET55310-6 b government 1.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theinformation Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (C. (59) 96) submitting revisedServices.. proposals for increasing the export of British books and periodicals.Book Exports.(Previous The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that he had reference:     submitted to the Chancellor of the Exchequer a revised programmeC.C. (59) 31st involving new expenditure (in addition to the i\6\ millions at presentConclusions,    authorised for the Oversea Information Services) of  100,000 in the minute 1.)     current year,  500,000 in 1960-61 and  600,000 in 1961-62.  To theextent that savings resulted from the current scrutiny of the overseas services of the British Broadcasting Corporation (B.B.C.) these figures would be reduced; but he could not estimate the amount of any suchsavings until the scrutiny had been completed.    To this theChancellor of the Exchequer had replied that he must adhere to his previous view that any expenditure involved in the current year would have to be found within the   16 V millions already authorised for the Overseas Information Services, and that not more than 250,000 additional expenditure could be provided in 1960-61.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that the developing Communist export of books represented a very real danger to British interests overseas, and effective countermeasureswere urgently needed. In order to be able to make a modest start onthis he had now decided to put forward a modified proposal, viz.,that in the current year the expenditure necessary for this purpose should be found within the total of  16+ millions, and that theprogramme for 1960-61 should be so adjusted as to reduce theadditional expenditure to  450,000. This latter figure might befurther reduced to the extent that further savings were secured inthe overseas services of the B.B.C.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in order to control the constant growth of public expenditure it was essential, as a matterof principle, that new commitments should be offset by compensatingsavings. He recognised the importance of increasing the exportof British books, but the cost of this plan should be accommodatedas far as possible by adjustment of priorities within the oversea information Services as a whole. He was most reluctant to contemplate any additional expenditure on these services beyondthe  250,000 which he had previously offered to make available for1960-61. Nevertheless, he recognised that the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster had tried to meet his point of view by proposing to introduce a reduced programme which would not involveadditional expenditure during the current year; and, in view of theimportance which the Cabinet attached to this scheme, he would beprepared to authorise additional expenditure of  450,000 on it in1960-61, on the understanding that this additional sum would bereduced to the extent that further savings could be secured in the overseas services of the B.B.C.
4cetcetParliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Education. 3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the teachers&apos;       Minister of Education (C. (59) 100) on teachers&apos; salaries.Salaries.(Previous The Minister of Education said that, in spite of the clearReference: indication he had given to the Burnham Committee that he wouldCC. (59) 33rd not be able to approve a basic salary scale with a minimum above conclusions,  510, the local authorities had offered a scale starting at  520 and minute 5.) this had been accepted by the teachers. The representatives of bothlocal authorities and teachers had reacted more strongly against hisintervention than had been expected. It now appeared that, if theGovernment persisted in refusing to approve the  520 minimum,there might be a prolonged controversy with the teachers. Therewas, however, a new factor in the situation: the local authorities had themselves proposed, and the teachers had agreed, that the new scale should remain in operation for 2\ years from October 1959.This made it somewhat more difficult to rely on the argument thata minimum of  520, representing a A\ per cent, increase over theminimum of the current scale, would have damaging repercussions on wage negotiations in industry and imperil the Governments wagepolicy. The choice, therefore, lay between continuing to refuse to approve a minimum above  510, which, even if accepted, might not last for more than one year, and approving the Committee&apos;recommendation for a minimum of  520, which would hold for a longer period.The Committee&apos;s recommendation would be formally submittedto the Minister on 8th July. If the Government maintained their objection to the proposed minimum, the Committee might give way and submit a revised recommendation in time for it to be broughtinto operation in October. But, if the Committee maintained theirpresent position, the Government would become involved in a longand serious controversy with both the teachers and the localauthorities.In discussion it was suggested that, as the Minister had statedcategorically on two occasions that a starting point of  520 couldnot be approved, he could not easily reverse that decision. The new proposal about the currency of the agreement did little to mitigate the objection to a 4i per cent, increase at the minimum; and, if theMinisters decision were now reversed, it would be more difficult for the Government in future to exercise control over the LocalAuthorities Panel of the Burnham Committee and the managementsides of other negotiating bodies in the public services.On the other hand, it would be unfortunate if serious controversyarose with the teachers and the local authorities over a point whichcould be represented as no more than the method of distributionof the additional  15 millions which the Government v/ere ready toaccept as the total additional outlay on the new scales. This sumrepresented an increase of 11 per cent, on the present cost of teachers&apos;salaries, and that figure might have a greater impact on wage negotiations in industry, where incremental scales were not normallyadopted, than a 4 per cent, increase at the minimum of an incrementalscale for a profession which was not closely comparable with industrial employment. If the Government accepted the burnham committee&apos;s recommendation, emphasis could be laid in presentationon the fact that the settlement was to operate for not less than2\ years, as compared with the one-year currency common in industrial wage settlements. For this purpose, however, it wouldbe necessary to obtain a clearer view of the Burnham Committee&apos;intention: whether the 2\ years was regarded as the period within
Germany. 4.   The Prime Minister said that the discussions at the GenevaForeign meeting of Foreign Ministers had now reached a critical stage. ThereMinisters&apos;       Was little prospect that further progress could be made towards anMeeting.        agreement; and it seemed likely that before the end of the week the(Previous       meeting would end either in a breakdown or in an adjournment ofReference :     some form. A long adjournment might have the result of weakeningC.C. (59) 35th the solidarity of the Western Allies.  He was at present inclined to conclusions,    think that it would be preferable to seek an adjournment of not moreMinute 2.)     than a month.  Meanwhile, the Cabinet would be glad to learn thatthe Foreign Secretary had succeeded in obtaining agreement amongthe Western Allies to a revised statement of the Western case whichwould be more easily defensible in the public debate which would follow either an adjournment or a breakdown of discussions.The Cabinet -Took note of this statement by the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,17th June, 1959.which no further claim should be made or as the period after whicha new settlement might be brought into operation, and whether the teachers would regard themselves as bound by the agreement notto submit any interim claim during the period, even if there were some further increase in the cost of living.Summing up the discussion, The Prime Minister said that thegeneral feeling of the Cabinet appeared to be in favour of approving the recommendation of the Burnham Committee if satisfactory assurances could be secured about the period for which they wereto operate. Further information should be obtained on this pointbefore a final decision was taken.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Education, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Labour,to consider the implications of accepting the recom-mendations of the Burnham Committee and the meansof obtaining satisfactory assurances on the period forwhich the recommended award would remain inoperation.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a later meeting.
