*2. The Cabinet had before them telegrams Nos. 373, 374, 377and 378 from the Prime Ministers delegation in Moscow. these telegrams indicated that the resumed discussions between the PrimeMinister, the Foreign Secretary and the Soviet leaders on 25th and26th February had taken place in an atmosphere of coolness. ThePrime Minister had re-emphasised that the Western governments were united in their determination to maintain their rights in Berlin;but he had also stressed their desire to promote a peaceful settlementof this and other problems by means of practical negotiations inthe near future. In reply Mr. Khrushchev had maintained hisintransigent attitude on the subject of Berlin and the future ofGermany; he had expressed the suspicion that the policy of theWestern Powers was dictated by their determination to attack theSoviet Union at the moment which they judged most favourable;and he had declared that the Soviet Government would resist withall the means at their command any attempt by the AlliedGovernments to impose their will on the Soviet Union by threats ofwar. He had added, however, that the Soviet Government wereprepared to enter into negotiations with the Western Governmentsat any time. If the date of 27th May, which the Soviet Union had suggested, was unacceptable, a later date could be arranged. TheSoviet Government would also be prepared to modify to some extenttheir proposals in connexion with Berlin. In particular, they wouldbe prepared to guarantee its status as a free city and to send soviet troops as a symbolic force to join Western troops in ensuring accessby the Western Powers to West Berlin.In discussion there was general agreement that a further message should be sent to the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretaryexpressing the Cabinefs support for the firm attitude which theywere adopting towards the Soviet leaders. It was not impossible thatMr. Khrushchev&apos;s offer to adjust the date of the projected negotiations and to despatch Soviet troops to guarantee the status of the western sectors of Berlin foreshadowed a more accommodating attitude on thepart of the Soviet Government, which might become more apparent in* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.secret. The Cabinet were informed that the latest evidence suggestedthat the disturbances in Nyasaland were part of an organised threat to the European community. The Governor intended to declare astate of emergency on the night of the 2nd-3rd March; and additionalsecurity forces v/ould be despatched from Southern Rhodesia as rapidly as possible. Meanwhile, action was to be taken that day to recover control of the Fort Hill airfield.In discussion it was suggested that the state of emergency shouldpreferably be declared at an earlier date than the Governor proposed.It was unlikely, however, that the reinforcements&apos; from SouthernRhodesia could be made available before 2nd March; and in the interval premature action against the leaders of the African national congress might merely aggravate the danger to the white population.Nevertheless the Governor might be invited to consider whether itwould be possible to advance to some extent the date of thedeclaration of a state of emergency.The Cabinet Invited the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for theColonies to invite the Governor of Nyasaland to reconsider,in the light of their discussion, the timing of the proposed declaration of a state of emergency in Nyasaland.
the final stages of the discussions. But there could be no certainty of this; and on the assumption that the Soviet Government mightadhere to their apparent intention to force the issue on Berlin, theCabinet would need to give further consideration to their policy on athe German problem after the return of the Prime Minister and the &quot;Foreign Secretary. In the meantime, the other members of theCommonwealth should be informed of the substance of the further discussions in Moscow, and appropriate guidance should be given tothe United Kingdom Press. It should be emphasised that it had never been the purpose of the Prime Minister^ visit to enter intoformal negotiations with the Soviet Government.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for a further message to be sent to the Prime Minister in Moscow on the lines indicated in their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,27th February, 1959.
