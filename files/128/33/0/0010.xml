C.C.Cyprus.(previous reference :C.C. (59) 9thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Prime Minister said that, in accordance with the cabinet&apos;s decision of 13th February, the Foreign Secretary had communicated to the Greek and Turkish Foreign Ministers on16th February draft proposals providing for the Governments of theUnited Kingdom, Greece and Turkey to endorse the arrangementsfor the future of Cyprus which had been agreed between the greek and Turkish Governments at Zurich and the conditions on which british sovereignty would be transferred to an independent republic of Cyprus. The Greek and Turkish Foreign Ministers had acceptedthe substance of these proposals, subject to certain reservations inrelation to our strategic requirements in the Island, which were nowbeing examined in detail. The attitude of Archbishop Makarios,however, was not clear. There was reason to suppose that, despite the earlier reports that he had accepted the Zurich agreement, he might now seek to contest its provisions in relation both to the stationing of Turkish troops in Cyprus and to the right of veto whichit was proposed to confer on the Turkish Vice-President. It wastherefore desirable that the three Governments should reach agreement on all outstanding issues before they were confronted witha demand by the Archbishop for a modification of the terms of thesettlement. If the three Governments were united, there was areasonable prospect that the representatives of the Cypriotcommunities would accept their proposals.The Cabinet Took note with approval of this statement.Nunn May.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 67thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Joint Parliamentary Undersecretary oj State forForeign Affairs informed the Cabinet that Dr. Alan Nunn May had made a fresh application for a passport, stating that he wished to takea holiday in Austria. The Foreign Secretary had considered this request in the light of the Cabinefs rejection of Dr. Nunn May&apos;searlier application on the grounds of its possible effect on thenegotiations then in progress with the United States for the exchangeof nuclear materials and information. Negotiations on these subjects had recently been renewed, and H.M. Ambassador in washington considered that it might be preferable not to issue apassport to Dr. Nunn May, at least until Congress had gone intorecess. On the other hand, it was not easy to foresee any occasion on which we should not incur some risk of embarrassment in ourrelations with the United States Government if we issued a passportto Dr. Nunn May ; and the Foreign Secretary therefore consideredthat, on balance, his application should now be granted.In discussion it was suggested that the lack of a passport wouldnot prevent Dr. Nunn May from defecting if he intended to do so.Moreover, the evidence available suggested that he had now established his permanent home in this country. Provided that hewas no longer associated with undesirable political activities, thereshould be no undue danger in granting him a passport.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the foreign secretary, to ascertain whether Dr. Alan Nunn May wascurrently connected with any subversive political activity.(2) Agreed that, if the enquiry to be made under Conclusion (1)above revealed nothing to Dr. Nunn May&apos;s discredit, heshould now be granted a passport.
Cuba. 3.  The Cabinet were informed that General Batista, the formerGeneral Batista. President of Cuba, who was at present in exile in the Republic ofDominica, had applied for a visa for entry into Nassau or Bermuda.In discussion it was suggested that the presence of GeneralBatista in Nassau, which was close to Cuba, would be undesirable.There would be a risk of embarrassing extradition proceedings if he were allowed to go to Bermuda.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that an application by General Batista for a visa for entry into Nassau or Bermuda should be refused.Supply of Arms. The Cabinet were informed that the newly constitutedGovernment of Cuba wished to obtain delivery of the balance of theorder for arms which had been placed in this country by the previous government.In discussion it was suggested that, although deliveries had been suspended during the civil war, the order had already been paid for infull and there would appear to be no objection in principle toresuming the supply of arms to the legally constituted Government.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to decide, at his discretion, theterms on which outstanding orders for arms from thiscountry, which had been placed by the previous government of Cuba, should now be fulfilled.DominicanRepublic.Supply of Anns(previous reference :C.C. (59) 3rdConclusions.Minute 5.)4. The Joint Parliamentary Undersecretary of State forForeign Affairs informed the Cabinet that, after giving further-consideration to the request by the Republic of Dominica to beallowed to obtain arms from the United Kingdom, the foreign secretary had reached the conclusion that it might be acceptable toauthorise the export of a number of small naval craft which could bemade available at once, provided that, in the interests of our exporttrade, the Government of Dominica would agree to order a numberof similar vessels from new production and would also accept a delay of some six months in the delivery of any offensive weapons.In discussion it was suggested that we should not lose sight ofthe suggestion, which had been made at an earlier stage in thediscussions with the Dominican representatives, that the orders for arms should be supplemented by orders for civil equipment. this aspect of the matter should be further explored before any finaldecision was reached.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with thePresident of the Board of Trade, to circulate a memorandumon the scope for the export of arms and civil equipment toDominica.Guy Burgess.(previous reference :CM. (56) 12thConclusions,Minute 1.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theForeign Secretary (C. (59) 26) indicating that Guy Burgess mightshortly wish to return to this country in order to visit his mother, whowas in failing health.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that, since Burgess hadnot formally renounced his British nationality or been convicted of
agricultural policy.Small FarmersBill.(previous reference :C.C. (58) 77thConclusions.Minute 6.)6. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Secretaryof State for Scotland and the Minister of Agriculture (C. (59) 28and 33) on marginal agricultural production in Scotland.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that the Agriculture(Small Farmers) Bill, which was designed to give effect to theGovernments intention to place the system of financial assistanceto small farmers on a more economic basis, provided that the existingmarginal agricultural production grants should be brought graduallyto an end over a period of three years. This proposal had provokedin Scotland a widespread expression of opposition which might be a source of serious political embarrassment to the Government. the marginal production scheme had been valuable in maintaining output in the uplands of Scotland, and its disappearance would not onlyreduce the income of many of the smaller farmers but would alsoaggravate the existing problems of unemployment and depopulation.It would also encourage the production of sheep instead of beefcattle, contrary to the Governments livestock policy. For these reasons it would have been desirable to provide that the withdrawalof the marginal production scheme should be extended in Scotlandover a longer period in order that its ultimate termination might beso timed as to avoid inflicting hardship on the small farmers. Butthe Bill had now received its Third Reading in the House ofCommons, and no amendment could properly be made in the Houseof Lords which would have the effect of increasing the charge on theExchequer. In these circumstances it would be &quot;desirable either to offset the withdrawal of the marginal production scheme by increasing the hill cow subsidy by  2 per head as part of the finalany offence, the Government had no legal grounds for refusing himentry to this country or for arresting him while he was here. Inparticular, although it would be technically possible to prosecute him under Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act for retaining official documents, the papers which he had retained were not of sufficient importance to justify this course. Nevertheless it was undesirable that he should return to the United Kingdom. It might thereforebe advisable to require him, if he presented himself at a British port,to establish his identity and to prove that he had not become an alien by acquiring Soviet nationality. In addition, consideration shouldbe given to the possibilities of dissuading him from embarking onthe journey. He could be warned, for example, that, if he returnedto the United Kingdom, he might face a prosecution forhomosexuality. He might also be deterred if he could be confronted with evidence of seditious behaviour on his part during his stay inthe Soviet Union which might expose him to the risk of legal actionin this country.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with the attorney-General, to ascertain whether there was any evidence of seditious behaviour by Guy Burgess during his stay in the Soviet Union.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with the attorney-General, to arrange for Burgess to be dissuaded,if possible, from attempting to return to the UnitedKingdom on the lines indicated in their discussion.(3) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange that Burgess shouldnot be admitted to this country without satisfying a stricttest of identity and British nationality.
settlement of the current farm price review or to promise theintroduction of amending legislation providing for a more flexibleabatement of the existing scheme. The latter would be the preferablecourse. It was doubtful whether an increase in the hill cow subsidy would suffice to allay the opposition to the Bill.The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture, said thatit was doubtful whether the economic effects of the loss of the marginal agricultural production grants would in fact be as serious as had been suggested. But although the Minister of agriculture would not, for this reason, regard an increase in the hill cow subsidyas justified on grounds of agricultural policy, he would not wish to oppose it. But if any concession on the termination of the marginal production grants were made to Scottish opinion, it would beimpossible to avoid a similar concession both to England and wales and to Northern Ireland. These repercussions would endanger the underlying principle of the new scheme of assistance to small farmerswhich the Bill was intended to promote.In discussion there was general agreement that, in thecircumstances, it would be expedient to offer an increase in the hillcow subsidy as part of the current annual review, provided that thecost would be offset by other adjustments in the guarantees as awhole. In addition, a statement should be made during the debate on the Agriculture (Small Farmers) Bill in the House of Lords thatthe Government intended to keep under review the effect of the gradual withdrawal of marginal production grants and would consider in due course whether it was necessary to introduceamending legislation.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Agriculture to arrange for the hillcow subsidy to be increased by  2 a head as part of thecurrent farm price review, the cost of this measure beingoffset by reductions elsewhere in the total amount of the guarantees.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland, in consultationwith the Home Secretary, the Commonwealth secretary and the Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture,to draft a statement, to be made during the debate in theHouse of Lords on the Agriculture (Small Farmers) Bill,on the Government^ intentions as regards the withdrawalof marginal production grants on the lines indicated intheir discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,17th February, 1959.
