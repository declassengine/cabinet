The Dutch Government were also exercised by our action in supplying a limited quantity of arms and aircraft to the indonesian Government. A particularly difficult case had now arisen in connexion with torpedo equipment which was being manufacturedby Messrs. Vickers Limited for incorporation in naval vessels nowunder construction in Germany for the Indonesian Government. Toavoid embarrassment in connexion with this order we must seek toevolve, in consultation with other members of the North atlantic alliance, a common policy on the supply of arms to Indonesia.K.L.M. On the issue of the K.L.M. services to Singapore we should notServices to lightly amend our decision, which had been welcomed in otherSingapore. countries as evidence of our determination to deal with questions ofthis kind by reference to the commercial, rather than the political,considerations involved. On the other hand it might be desirable tooffer to postpone the implementation of our decision for a short periodif such a postponement would be of material political advantage tothe Dutch Government at the present time.The Cabinet (1) Took note with approval of this statement.(2) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to inform the DutchForeign Minister, if necessary, that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be prepared to postpone until 1st March the implementation of their recent decision to restrict the frequency of the services operated by RoyalDutch Airlines to Singapore.Egypt. 3.   The Foreign Secretary said that we must seek to ensure that financial       the Anglo-Egyptian financial agreement which had recently beenNegotiations,    initialled in Cairo should now be signed on behalf of the two(Previous       Governments as rapidly as possible.  But we should withhold our reference:      signature until we had agreed with the Egyptian Government aCC.

As regards other outstanding issues we should be free to say in public that signature of theagreement would be followed by the restoration of normal diplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Egypt as soon as possible.We should also remind the Egyptian Government privately of theundertaking which they had given during an earlier phase of thenegotiations to release the tv/o British subjects imprisoned in Egyptas soon as an agreement had been reached.Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
The details of the agreement itself had now been largely settled,apart from the question of the extent of the claims to compensation,in respect of land confiscated by the Egyptian authorities, against the lump-sum payment of  27^ millions to be made by the egyptian government. It now appeared that land had been Egyptianised ona more extensive scale than we had supposed and that the claims to compensation on this account would be greater, by some  3 millions to  4 millions, than we had originally estimated. We should endeavour to reach the best compromise settlement on this issue that could be arranged.In discussion there was general agreement with these views. TheEgyptian Government had, however, expressed the hope that theagreement would be signed by a United Kingdom Minister. Thiswould be undesirable; but it would be appropriate that Sir DenisRickett, who had conducted the recent negotiations and had initialledthe agreement, should return to Cairo with authority to sign the texton behalf of Her Majesty&apos;s Government. It would be unwise to givethe Egyptians any grounds for supposing that we were prepared to reopen the agreement. Sir Denis Rickett should not, therefore, leave for Cairo until it had been ascertained that the text would be ready for signature on his arrival.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for SirDenis Rickett to sign, on behalf of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment, the Anglo-Egyptian financial agreementrecently initialled in Cairo, subject to a satisfactory settlement of outstanding issues on the lines indicated intheir discussion.Air Journeys 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the by the Royal Secretary of State for Air (C. (59) 9) about the provision of Royal AirFamily. Force escorts for flights by members of the Royal Family.(Previous The Secretary of State for Air said that, under existingReference:      arrangements, when the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, the QueenC.C.

Royal flights were now tending to increase in number and minute 4.)      length, and Royal aircraft were liable to fly considerably faster thanthe Shackleton aircraft of the R.A.F. squadrons which were the mostsuitable aircraft for escort duty.  Substantially more escort aircraft were now required, therefore, to cover a given distance at a time whenthe number of maritime aircraft in the Royal Air Force had beenreduced. Moreover, communications between ground and the Royalaircraft had been considerably improved, and the chances of a Royalaircraft having to alight at sea were now very slight. After discussionwith the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation and the First Lordof the Admiralty he had reached the conclusion that the provision ofescort aircraft as a general rule no longer made a significant contribution to the safety of Royal flights.  He therefore proposedthat the Royal Air Force should continue to provide air escorts forflights by the Sovereign and the Heir to the Throne but that suchescorts should not necessarily be required to be within one hour&apos;sflying time of the Royal aircraft in areas where other facilities forrescue could be expected to be plentiful.   Air escorts should not normally be provided for other Royal flights, on the understandingthat, if it was essential to route such flights over an area where thenormal rescue and search facilities were inadequate, the provision ofadditional facilities would be carefully examined.In discussion there was general agreement with these suggestions.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (59) 9.
Armed Forces.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 1stConclusions,Minute 5.)MalcolmClubs.5. The Secretary of State for Air informed the Cabinet that lord Tedder had tabled, for debate in the House of Lords that afternoon, a motion about the affairs of Malcolm Clubs, Ltd., an organisation which maintained a number of clubs and hostels for members of the Royal Air Force. The financial position of theseclubs was unsatisfactory. Over the last two years their debt to public funds, for which there was no Parliamentary authority, had increasedto about  40,000 despite the fact that over the same period they hadreceived a subsidy of  30,000 a year to offset the loss of concessionalthe Air Council had decided, afterFor *hDeutschemarks.very careful consideration, that the clubs should be closed unless theycould raise adequate funds by their own efforts. It was forconsideration whether this decision should be reaffirmed in theforthcoming debate in the House of Lords or whether, in response tothe case which Lord Tedder was likely to develop on behalf of theclubs, the Government should allow them additional time in which to seek to strengthen their finances.In discussion it was suggested that the balance of advantage layin offering the clubs a further opportunity of augmenting their resources by their own efforts. It should, however, be made clearthat if, by 31st December, 1959, they had not effected a considerable improvement in their financial affairs, including a substantialrepayment of their debt to the Exchequer, the Government wouldrequire them to be closed.The Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Air, in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Lord President ofthe Council, to arrange for the Government spokesmen inthe debate on the Malcolm Clubs in the House of Lordsthat afternoon to announce the Governments intention toallow the clubs to continue to function until the end of 1959but to require them to be closed at that date if their financial position had not been significantly strengthened inthe meantime.Representationof the Vaticanin the UnitedKingdom.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 40thConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theForeign Secretary (C. (59) 8) on the representation of the Vatican inthe United Kingdom.The Foreign Secretary said that, at the request of the CatholicUnion of Great Britain, the Duke of Norfolk had written to thePrime Minister renewing the suggestion that an Internuncio shouldbe accepted, with diplomatic status, as the representative of the vatican in the United Kingdom. At present the Vatican was notdiplomatically represented in this country; the Apostolic Delegatewas a purely ecclesiastical functionary. The authorities of the vatican, however, had not made any direct request for diplomaticstatus for their representative; and, although from the point of viewof foreign affairs, there would be certain advantages in the proposal,it might be open to objection on grounds of domestic policy.In discussion it was suggested that there was a risk that acceptance of the request would revive, particularly in certain partsof the United Kingdom, a religious controversy which had largelydied away. There were particular possibilities of embarrassment inthe inevitable refusal by a diplomatic representative of the Vaticanto take part in State functions in consecrated buildings in thiscountry. Moreover, the Governments proposal to increase the rateof grant to denominational schools had already aroused opposition,particularly among the Free Churches, and any action which mightaggravate denominational feeling would be liable to endanger theGovernments educational  policy.    The balance of advantage
6appeared, therefore, to be against acceding to the proposal at thepresent time.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would inform the duke of Norfolk that the Government regarded it asinopportune to accept an Internuncio as the representativeof the Vatican in this country at the present time.commercial policy.Horticulture.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 1stConclusions,Minute 2.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Agriculture (C. (59) 10) on the desirability of an increasein the tariff on cut flowers.The Minister of Agriculture recalled that at their previous meeting the Cabinet, after approving his proposals for a new systemof horticultural grants, had decided to reject five of the six pendingapplications for increases in the tariffs on horticultural products but had invited him to reconsider the implications of raising the tariff oncut flowers. In spite of some increase in the acreage devoted toflower production in this country, the profitability of the industry had declined and the value of its output had fallen. There seemedtherefore to be a case on economic grounds for increasing the tariff,especially as the percentage rate of duty on cut flowers was relatively low.In discussion it was emphasised that the Tariff AdvisoryCommittee had reached the opposite conclusion; and the Governmentwould therefore be in an embarrassing position in seeking theapproval of Parliament, by affirmative resolution, to an increase inthe tariff on cut flowers. Moreover, the political advantage to be derived from accepting one of six applications for tariff increases would not be commensurate with the damage which such action would inflict on our relations with Holland, France and our otherpartners in the negotiations for the creation of a European free trade Area.On the other hand, there were political disadvantages inappearing to abandon the traditional method of protecting the horticultural industry and it would be unwise to adopt a policy whichmight be interpreted in this sense without first examining in greater detail the reasons put forward by the Tariff Advisory Committee for rejecting this application.The Cabinet (1) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to announce thatthe Government were unable to accept five of the sixoutstanding applications for an increase in the tariff onhorticultural products but would give further considera-tion to the application in respect of cut flowers.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for theEconomic Policy Committee to reconsider, in the light ofthe report of the Tariff Advisory Committee, thedesirability of an increase in the tariff on cut flowers.CEievening. 8.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (C. (59) 6) about an offer by Lord Stanhope to bequeathChevening House, together with its contents, 3,500 acres of land anda substantial endowment for its maintenance, to be used after his death as a residence for the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary Mor other senior Minister or for a member of the Royal Family.Sir Winston Churchill, when Prime Minister, had accepted this offer;but legislation in the lifetime of Lord Stanhope would be requiredto give effect to his purpose and, in view of his age, must now beregarded as urgent.
cabinet Office, S.W. 1,22nd January, 1959.In discussion there was general agreement that the necessary legislation should be introduced as soon as possible. There mightbe advantage in expressing the purposes for which the house mightbe used in reasonably wide terms rather than confining them to itspersonal occupation by certain individuals. It would also benecessary to inform the Opposition of the proposal.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary to inform the Leader of theOpposition of the proposal that steps should be taken to validate the intention of Lord Stanhope to bequeathChevening House, on his death, to the Government.(2) Authorised the preparation of the legislation required forthis purpose, and its early introduction in the House ofCommons.
