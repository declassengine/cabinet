2. The Cabinet considered the situation of deadlock which appeared to have been reached in the discussions on Berlin at the geneva meeting of Foreign Ministers. The Western Powers couldnot accept the latest proposals tabled by the Soviet Government, evenas a basis for further discussion, without appearing to be negotiatingunder duress; and it might now be timely for the Western Powersthemselves to take a fresh initiative and put forward new proposalsof their own. Before this could be done the Foreign Ministers would need time for consultation with their Governments, and it had beensuggested that the Geneva meeting should be adjourned for a time.A long adjournment would be dangerous; but it might be advantageous if the discussions could be suspended for one or two weeks so that the Governments concerned could take stock of theposition. In any event it was desirable that the Foreign secretary should have an opportunity of consultation with his cabinet colleagues; and he was proposing to return to London for thatpurpose at the end of the week. There would be a meeting of theCabinet, at which he would be present, on the morning of 15th June.The Cabinet Took note that the course of the international discussions on berlin would be reviewed at a special meeting of the Cabinet,which the Foreign Secretary would attend, on the morning of 15th June.Germany.foreign ministers&apos;Meeting.(previous reference:C.C.

(59) 97 and 98) on the policy which had been followedfor the rehabilitation of Mau Mau detainees by forced labour and onthe line which the Government might adopt in the forthcoming debate in the House of Commons on the Motion of Censure tabled by theOpposition as a result of the death by violence of 11 prisoners in theHola Camp.The Colonial Secretary recalled that in 1954 the Cabinet had authorised the policy of compulsory labour as part of the process ofrehabilitating the 70,000 Mau Mau members and sympathisers whowere then held in detention camps in Kenya. This policy had provedeminently successful and the number held in detention had beenreduced to under 1,000. He proposed, in the debate, to describe thehistory of the emergency, to justify the policy of rehabilitation and toemphasise its success. But it was likely that the Government wouldbe pressed to institute some further enquiry, of a judicial nature, inaddition to that already carried out by the examining magistrate in kenya and to the disciplinary proceedings which were now being taken against the Camp Commandant, Mr. Sullivan, and his assistant, andto the enquiry which was to be undertaken into the future administration of the detention camps. Acceptance of a request fora further enquiry might call into question the whole policy ofrehabilitation by forced labour. On the other hand, as it was notpossible, in advance of the results of the disciplinary proceedings, to assess how far the Kenya Government, or the senior officers concerned, bore any responsibility for the events at hold, refusal of afurther enquiry might fail to convince public opinion that the matter had been fully and properly investigated.In discussion it was pointed out that a further enquiry could notbe expected to elicit any relevant facts additional to those which had emerged from the examining magistrate^ investigation.  Nor was itParliament. 1.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.
likely that the results of the current disciplinary proceedings would throw any more light on the responsibility of senior officers of the kenya Government or of the Kenya Government itself, since mr. Sullivan could not now plead that he was acting on the orders of his superiors without contradicting the evidence he had already given before the magistrate. Moreover, the main criticism of theOpposition would be directed to the plan drawn up by Mr. Cowan, a senior Superintendent in the Kenya Prison Service, whichcontemplated that if the detainees at hold refused to go to work theyshould be &quot; manhandled to the site of work and forced to carry outthe task.&quot; The Kenya Minister of Defence, who had that day been invited by the Colonial Secretary to forward a statement explainingwhy he had approved the Cowan plan, would probably argue that theplan was to be read in conjunction with the Prison Standing orders and Ordinances, which made it clear that men could not forcibly bemade to work by beating them. The interpretation of the plan would,however, be affected by a letter written by Mr. Cowan in 1957, whichwas available to the Opposition, describing an earlier occasion whenbatons had been used and injuries inflicted on prisoners at anotherdetention camp.On the other hand, if the Government were to take the line thatan enquiry was unnecessary since all the facts were known, it followed that the Government must accept the findings of the examiningmagistrate. This implied that disciplinary action might have to betaken, not only against Mr. Sullivan and his assistant, but also against mr.. Cowan and other senior officers. Whether criticism of the Kenya government would be justified would depend to some extent on the reply received to the further enquiries which the Colonial secretary had already made. There was much to be said, on political grounds,for not ruling out entirely the possibility of some further investigation.The Government might take the line that, in the light of the outcome of the disciplinary proceedings against Mr. Sullivan and his assistant,they would not exclude a further enquiry if this were necessary todecide where responsibility for the events at hold lay.As regards the legality of the policy of rehabilitation by forced labour, which the Cabinet had approved in 1954, it was open to question whether the Kenya regulations constituted a breach of theForced Labour Convention of 1930, or the Convention on human rights. But there could be no doubt that the way in which theregulations were put into effect at hold on this occasion involved a breach of both Conventions.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that theGovernment should emphasise in the debate the successfulrehabilitation of the great majority of the Mau Mau detainees throughthe policy of forced labour. This policy had, however, becomeprogressively more difficult to operate as the detainees were reducedto a hard core. The policy should not be repudiated; but, in the lightof the recommendations of the Fairn Committee, it might well benecessary to modify its operation in the future. The Governmentwould have to admit frankly in the debate that the way in which thepolicy had been applied on this occasion at hold had undoubtedly been wrong. In due course the Government would have to decidewhere the responsibility lay. But the facts were known, and therewas therefore no need for a further enquiry on this account. Whenthe results of the disciplinary proceedings were available, theGovernment would have to decide what further action to take; and, ifit were not then possible to decide where the responsibility lay, thepossibility of a further enquiry would not be ruled out.The Cabinet Agreed that in the forthcoming debate on the Motion of censure in the House of Commons the government spokesmen should follow the line indicated in the cabinets discussion.
Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,11th June, 1959.Park Lane. 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeProject Secretary (C. (59) 95) reporting the views of the Home affairs for Hotel Committee on a project for constructing a high hotel building in building.        Park Lane overlooking Hyde Park.The Minister of Housing said that, when he refused to approve the original plan for a building of 390 ft. in height, the promoters hadbeen informed, with the concurrence of the Ministers concerned, thatthere was no objection in principle to the erection of a high building onthis site. They had now put forward amended plans for a building of improved design which would be 300 ft. high.&quot; If there were further delay in giving approval, the project was likely to be abandoned. Thiswould be unfortunate, as there was a serious shortage of hotel accommodation in London and the project would be of benefit to thenational economy. The Home Affairs Committee had recommendedthat it should now be approved, and he sought the Cabinetconcurrence.The Minister of Works said that he recognised that thedevelopment of a number of high buildings in London was inevitable.He also agreed that the new design for this building was a great improvement on the original proposal. Nevertheless, it would stillbe very high, and it would on that account impair the amenities ofHyde Park. He thought it undesirable that very high buildings shouldbe erected in the immediate vicinity of the Royal Parks in London.This was also the view of the Royal Fine Art Commission.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were generally in favour of allowing this project to go forward. It was inevitable that the rebuilding in London would increasingly take the form of highbuildings. Indeed, if a new large hotel in London were to be aneconomic proposition, it would have to be a high building. Moreover,subject to proper planning control, a number of high buildings mightaesthetically be an improvement to the London skyline.The Cabinet Agreed that planning approval should be given for the amended project for a high hotel building in Pitts HeadMews, Park Lane.
