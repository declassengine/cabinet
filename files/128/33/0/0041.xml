Germany.guided missiles.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 30:Conclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs recalled that attheir meeting on 7th May the Cabinet had .agreed that the UnitedKingdom representatives on the Council of the Western european union should be authorised to support an amendment of the treaty which would allow Germany to manufacture anti-aircraft missiles of limited dimensions. This would have enabled Germany to co-operate in the joint production of the HAWK missile and in the joint production of the British missile SUPER BLOODHOUND. TheFrench Government had now decided to support the Germanapplication for a wider amendment, which would allow Germany to manufacture anti-aircraft missiles without limitation of size. Theimmediate purpose of this wider amendment was to enable Germanyto manufacture an anti-aircraft weapon of American design knownas SIDEWINDER. This question was to be discussed at a meetingof the Council on the following day. It w9.s lilc ely that the Germanapplication would also be supported by the Italian and NetherlandsGovernments, and would secure the necessary two-thirds majority. Ifwe voted against it, our motives would be suspect, and we could notin any event prevent it from being carried. At the same time it was desirable that it should not appear that Germany was being enabled to manufacture missiles of an offensive character. In thesecircumstances the best course would be to accept the Germanapplication in principle, but to suggest changes of wording whichwould make it more clear that German manufacture of anti-aircraftmissiles would be limited to proximity fuses and ground-to-air andair-to-air guided missiles for anti-aircraft defence. We should also propose that the formal agreement of the Council to the amendment should be postponed until, say, the beginning of November on theground that this would avoid the possibility of embarrassment in thecurrent negotiations with the Soviet Union.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in general agreementwith the course proposed. While it was worth trying to postpone the formal decision until November, it was likely to become known at anearly date that the Council were in favour of the German application.We should therefore be ready to justify such a decision to publicopinion on the basis that the weapons which Germany would beallowed to manufacture would be strictly defensive, and that this wasto the advantage of the North Atlantic Alliance as a whole.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs to authorisethe United Kingdom representatives on the Council of theWestern European Union to put forward an amendment to the revised Brussels Treaty on the lines which he had proposed.foreign ministers&apos;Meeting.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 38thConclusions,Minute 1.)* The Prime Minister recalled that, at their meeting on30th June, he had informed the Cabinet of the proposals which heand the Foreign Secretary had put before the United states administration regarding the line to be taken by the Western Pov/erswhen the Foreign Ministers resumed their negotiations on theproblem of Berlin.  The Cabinet would be glad to learn that theseProcedure. 1.   The Prime Minister referred to the standing instructionrequiring Ministers to consult the Foreign Office on any reference toforeign affairs which they were proposing to include in a publicspeech. In the current state of international relations ministers should be particularly careful to follow this procedure.

(59) 15thConclusions,Minute 4.)MarginalProductionGrants.proposals had evoked a satisfactory response from the United states administration, who recognised the advantages of an interimsettlement by which the existing position in Berlin would bemaintained for a further period. They had agreed that this was the objective to be pursued when the Geneva discussions were resumed,and they were willing to take the initiative in putting forward, at theappropriate time, proposals on the general lines of those which wehad suggested.The Cabinet (2) Took note of this statement by the Prime Minister.3. The Minister of Labour said that the renewed discussions between the employers and the unions in the printing industry, underthe chairmanship of Lord Birkett, were to begin that day. It wouldbe some weeks before an award could be expected, but some of theunions would soon be in financial difficulty and it was possible thatthe men might return to work before the award was received.Meanwhile, it was desirable that the Government should not accede to pressure from the employers for an increase in the quota of imported printed matter, which would soon be exhausted.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour.4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Secretaryof State for Scotland and the Minister of Agriculture (C. (59) 111 and112) on the withdrawal of marginal agricultural production grants.The Secretary of State for Scotland recalled that at their meetingon 10th March the Cabinet had agreed that, while pressure for the indefinite continuance of the marginal agricultural production(M.A.P.) scheme in Scotland should be resisted, there would be advantage in arranging for the scheme to be withdrawn moregradually. In the light of discussions with the Scottish national farmers&apos; Union (N.F.U.), he now proposed to announce a schemefor reducing assistance over the next three cropping seasons whichwas acceptable to the N.F.U. provided that marginal units were not excluded from assistance solely on account of their size. There would,however, be strong protests throughout Scotland if all hope of continuing the present method of assistance in the years after 1962were finally ruled out at this stage. Marginal producers in scotland would derive little or no benefit from the small farmers scheme andit might be that, as a result of the review which would be held in 1961,the continuation of the present M.A.P. scheme would be found to bethe most satisfactory method of assisting them.The Minister of Agriculture said that, unless the proposed announcement referred explicitly to the Governments view that theM.A.P. schemes as such should be brought to an end, there wouldbe irresistible pressure for their revival in England and Wales andNorthern Ireland. In those countries assistance under these schemeshad already been discontinued for 25,000 farmers; and a further15,000, who were at present receiving assistance through the supplementary scheme under the Agriculture (Small Farmers) Act,    r-would lose it in 1962. These figures compared with the 4,000 Scottishfarmers for whom under the current decision M.A.P. assistance wouldbe discontinued in that year. The Minister therefore suggested that,without ruling out some form of continued assistance to Scottishfarmers after 1962, the proposed announcement should set a definiteterm to the run-down of the M.A.P. scheme as such.
Government 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theExpenditure. Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (59) 108) giving a forecast of(Previous       Government expenditure in 1960-61.C.cer(59)30th The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the revised forecastsConclusions, Qf ClVil expenditure in 1960-61 showed an increase of  183 millions,Minute4and or 6-2 per cent., over the current year. This did not take accountC.C.(58)63rd of a number of increases to which the Government were alreadyConclusions, committed, such as expenditure under the Cotton Bill, or otherMinute 4.) increases which might have to be faced, such as increases in the pavof doctors and dentists. The latest figures suggested that defence expenditure in 1960-61 would show an increase of  131 millions, or8^- per cent., over the current year. The forecasts did not include any allowance for rising costs and, although some reduction mightbe secured by the normal processes of Treasury scrutiny, experience showed that the final Estimates were unlikely to be lower than theseforecasts. It therefore seemed likely that total supply expenditurenext year might be at least  315 millions, or 7 per cent., over thecurrent Estimates. This compared with an increase in the currentyeafs Estimates over those for 1958-59 of  237 millions, or 5-4 percent. It was most unlikely that the gross national product would increase next year by as much as 7 per cent, and, unless it did, theGovernment would be unable to achieve their aim of securing thatthe total of Government supply expenditure should absorb a steadilydeclining percentage of the gross national product. Finally, it was by no means certain that the forecast increase in expenditure wouldbe matched by an increase in revenue at present rates of taxation.In discussion it was pointed out that, in addition to the forecastincrease in next years Estimates, it was likely that public investment would show a substantial increase and that private investment wouldsteadily rise. There was a risk that the load on the economy would again become too heavy. On the other hand it was argued that theeconomic expansion might provide a substantial increase in the grossIn discussion there was general agreement that any announce-ment now made should refer explicitly to the Governmenfs decisionto terminate the M.A.P. schemes as such. This might be included inthe preamble to the statement. It would, however, be more convenient if the Governmenfs decision to allow a three-year period for the run-down in Scotland were communicated to the Scottish N.F.U. ina letter, which could be published in the Press, rather than in astatement in Parliament.In further discussion the Home Secretary said that theGovernment of Northern Ireland were now representing that the concession envisaged for Scotland should be extended to NorthernIreland. It was agreed that further consideration should be given tothese representations before any announcement relating to Scotland was made.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary to circulate a memorandum onthe effect on Northern Ireland of the government&apos;s decision to terminate the marginal agricultural productionschemes.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland, in consultationwith the Minister of Agriculture, to prepare a revisedstatement on the lines agreed in their discussion which,subject to their decision in relation to Northern Ireland,could be communicated to the Scottish National Farmers&apos;Union.
Egypt.financial agreement.(previous references:C.C. (59) 28thConclusions,Minute 3 andC.C. (59) 20thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theForeign Secretary (C. (59) 115) seeking authority for an Order inCouncil to provide for interim payments to be made in respect ofproperty which had been Egyptianised or sequestrated by theEgyptian Government.The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that the Order inCouncil which had been made on 6th April had provided for theForeign Compensation Commission to receive and assess claims inrespect of property which had been Egyptianised or sequestrated, but had made no provision for any payment to be made an account ofsuch claims. Up to date 234 applications in respect of Egyptianisedproperty had been received, and in some cases the Commission would soon be ready to make some interim payment if authorised to do so.There had also been 45 applications in respect of sequestratedproperty, but evaluation of these would take much longer. some further applications in respect of both categories of property would doubtless be received. The scale of final compensation could not bedetermined until all the claims had been received and assessed, butthere were strong political arguments for making some interimpayments at an early date. It would of course be necessary to ensurethat interim payments did not prejudice a future decision on the scale of final payments. He therefore proposed that authority should beobtained, under a further Order in Council, for a graduated schemeof interim payments on the lines set out in the Annex to C. (59) 115.This scheme took account of the fact that in general it was the smallerclaims which represented the greatest hardship. Under it, themaximum possible cost of making interim payments in respect of the applications so far received for Egyptianised property would beabout  4 millions, and it was estimated that the maximum cost of interim payments in respect of sequestrated properties would beabout  9 millions. The total of interim payments would thereforebe well within the  27^ millions which were available for these claimswithout resorting to public funds. As regards the ex gratia loanswhich had already been made to certain claimants, it would be best that these should remain in abeyance until the time came to decide the scale of final payments; but in such cases interim payments shouldbe abated to the extent to which, with the ex gratia loans and anyassets recovered, they would exceed the value of the registered assets.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Having regard to the extent to which ex gratia loans had beengranted, if interim payments were made on the basis of the scheme now proposed, and if the  27Jr millions were insufficient to meet all claims in full, it would follow that the final settlement would have tobe of a graduated character.(b) Under the proposed scheme interim payments would not be ^made until claims had been examined by the Foreign CompensationCommission.(c) It would have to be settled whether compensation payments were to be made at the current rate of exchange, or at the rateobtaining at some earlier rate, such as the date of Egyptianisation orsequestration.national product, and that the increase in Government expenditure should not be unmanageable.The Cabinet  O(1) Invited all Departmental Ministers to scrutinise their estimates with a view to reducing expenditure wherever possible.(2) Agreed that the Cabinet should keep in mind the general&quot;position disclosed in C. (59) 108 whenever they had toconsider proposals which involved new expenditure.
british transport commission.(previous reference :C.C. (58) 74thConclusions,Minute 3.)7. The Minister of Transport said that he had now receivedfrom the Chairman of the British Transport Commission a report onthe reappraisal of the railways modernisation plan and the financial prospects of the Commission. The report stressed the part which the rationalisation of railway installations and the pruning of uneconomicservices must play in the modernisation plans. It also assumed thatthe Commission would be able to increase its passenger earnings overthe next five years by raising fares, but it did not suggest that increases in fares were imminent, and it showed that the Commission had inmind the desirability of adjusting fares to assist towards a solution ofthe peak load problem. The Economic Policy Committee had recommended that, unless the printing dispute made it impossible,the report should be published without undue delay. There wouldin fact be no difficulty in printing the report, and he therefore proposed to publish it as a White Paper, but without any commentby the Government, on 22nd July.In discussion it was pointed out that, although the assumption inthe report that the total consumption of coal in 1963 would be200-210 million tons was not inconsistent with other estimates, itwould be inappropriate for this estimate to be disclosed in the reportof the Transport Commission.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Transport to arrange for the estimateof coal requirements in 1963 to be omitted from thereport of the British Transport Commission.(2) Authorised the Minister of Transport to publish the reportof the British Transport Commission as a White Paper,without comment by the Government, on 22nd July.irish republic.-Q) (previous reference :C.C. (57) 50thConclusions.Minute 3.)8. The President of the Board of Trade said that the PrimeMinister of the Irish Republic had, on the previous day, put before him a suggestion that the economy of the Republic should be furtherintegrated with that of the United Kingdom. His concept was thatthe Republic might enjoy not only the system of Commonwealthpreferences but also possibly even the benefit of United kingdom&quot;icuitural support prices and might, in return, give some furtherpreferential treatment to United Kingdom exports and reduce duties on imports from Northern Ireland. The President had suggested thatThe Prime Minister said that it was the general view of theCabinet that interim payments should be authorised in the case of applications which had been examined by the Commission, and thata scheme for this purpose should be worked out as soon as possible.This should take into account the fact that ex gratia loans had beenmade in a number of cases, and could therefore provide for a final settlement in the case of the smaller claims. At the same time it was important that the payments under the scheme should be well withinthe  27-J,- millions available. A revised scheme on these lines shouldbe prepared as a matter of urgency.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerof State for Foreign Affairs, in consultation with the lord president, to prepare a revised scheme of interim payments in respect of Egyptianised and sequestrated property, andto submit it as soon as possible to the Prime Minister forhis approval.
Liquor. 9.   The Secretary of State for Scotland said that he was underLicensing considerable pressure to reform the liquor licensing law in Scotland.Law in He believed that it would be possible to effect considerableScotland. improvements by agreement, but he was satisfied that he could make no move without first instituting some form of enquiry. The HomeAffairs Committee had therefore agreed that he should appoint a departmental Committee to consider, in relation to Scotland, thesale of alcoholic liquor on Sundays, permitted hours on week days and a number of related matters. He proposed to announce thedecision that day.The Cabinet Authorised the Secretary of State for Scotland to announce the appointment of a Committee to review the licensing lawin Scotland.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,14th July, 1959.if he wished to pursue these proposals he should put them forward in writing.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the President of the Boardof Trade.
