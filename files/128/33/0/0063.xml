Interception ofCommunica-tions.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 62ndConclusions,Minute 8.)02. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (59) 186) on the question whether information obtained by the police in the course of criminal investigations should be disclosed to professional disciplinary tribunals.The Home Secretary said that at their last meeting the cabinet had considered a proposal that, where a professional tribunal wishedto obtain evidence under subpoena, application must be made to a judge or Master of the High Court. At that stage the Secretary ofState would have the opportunity to claim Crown privilege where appropriate, and the police to object on the ground that the issue ofthe subpoena would be contrary to public policy. It had then beensuggested that a right of objection should also be given to the defendant. This possibility had since been examined by him, inconsultation with the Lord Chancellor, the Law Officers and other ministers. There would be serious difficulty about giving a similarright of objection to the defendant before the tribunal, but he was satisfied that, without it, the proposal would not go far enough to allay the current Parliamentary and public disquiet. He therefore proposedthat, in the debate on an Opposition Motion of Censure on thefollowing day, he should announce that the whole matter was beingreferred by the Government to an independent committee of enquiry.He had ascertained that Lord Simonds would be willing to preside over such a committee. The enquiry could be completed in a reasonably short time.In discussion there was general agreement with this proposal.The following points were made:  (a) The committee should include a Scottish member, and a non-legal member with some experience of administration.(b) Further consideration might be given to the desirability ofreferring, in the terms of reference, to information obtained by police officers &quot; in the course of their duties &quot; rather than &quot; in the course of criminal investigations &quot;.(c) It was most unlikely that circumstances similar to those of therecent Reading case would recur before the committee reported. TheHome Secretary might make this clear in his statement and add thatas an interim arrangement the point could, if necessary, be dealt withParliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in procedure.      the House of Commons in the week beginning 25th January, 1960.)The Home Secretary informed the Cabinet that, after appropriateconsultations, he intended to make a statement on the following dayabout Private Members&apos; time and the recommendations of the SelectCommittee on Procedure, 1959. In addition to the 20 Fridays alreadyallotted for Private Members&apos; business, four half-days would be given during the present session for the consideration of Private Members&apos;Motions. In the present state of feeling in the House it was difficultto avoid conceding this curtailment of the time available forGovernment business, including legislation; but it could be done onan experimental basis without amendment of Standing Order No. 4,which could be considered later in the light of experience. he intended also to circulate in the Official Report a statement of theGovernments views on certain of the recommendations of the SelectCommittee on Procedure. The necessary amendments to standing orders would be tabled immediately after the recess.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Home Secretary.
by an amendment of the procedural rules of the General MedicalCouncil, who had approached him in a constructive spirit, and ofother tribunals.(d) There was some concern among the Governments supporters in Parliament about the provision, in the Second Schedule to f\Professions Supplementary to Medicine Bill, for the establishment ortribunals in a number of other professions with powers similar to thoseenjoyed by the General Medical Council. Consideration of the Billin Standing Committee was due to begin immediately after the christmas recess and any material postponement should be avoided.The Government might therefore announce that the Second Schedulewould in due course be amended in the light of the recommendationsof the proposed committee of enquiry or, preferably, might move the Schedule out of the Bill on the understanding that it would bere-inserted in a revised form at a later stage.Summing up, the Prime Minister said that the Cabinet agreedthat an independent committee of enquiry should be established.This should be announced in the debate on the following day, togetherwith the name of the chairman but not those of the other members. Itwould be necessary to handle this question cautiously in parliament and the Government should not make any unqualified statement thatthey intended to proceed with the Professions Supplementary toMedicine Bill in its present form.The Cabinet-(1) Approved, subject to the points made in their discussion, theproposal put forward in C. (59) 186.(2) Authorised the Home Secretary to make a statement inParliament on the lines agreed in their discussion.Europe.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 4thConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (59) 188) about European economic relations.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled the history of theabortive negotiations for a European free trade area, following theestablishment of the European Economic Community (E.E.C.); andthe later establishment of the European Free Trade Association(E.F.T.A). He said that the project for a wider free trade area inEurope had come to nothing because of French hostility, and it couldnot at present be revived because the French Government were stillable to secure the co-operation of the German Government in opposing it. It remained true that, in the absence of the E.F.T.A. theE.E.C. would have serious effects on the economy of the UnitedKingdom. The extent of the damage we would suffer would dependon the ultimate level of the external common tariff of the E.E.C.,which might be relatively high. But, in addition, the consolidation ofthe common market in Europe would increasingly encourage the flow of capital investment there from the United States and even from theUnited Kingdom. Moreover, if the E.E.C. adopted protectivepolicies, this might lead to the development of trade restrictions inmany other countries; and this would constitute a grave economicthreat to the world-wide trading interests of the United Kingdom.To some extent the establishment of the E.F.T.A. had offset thesedangers. Although the population of the E.F.T.A. countries wasonly 90 millions compared with 160 millions in the E.E.C. countries,in terms of national incomes the former group were two-thirds, andin terms of foreign trade three-quarters as large as the latter. Tf \establishment of the E.F.T.A., in addition to its importance as a meawof facilitating an association with E.E.C., provided valuablecommercial opportunities for the United Kingdom.
The discussions which United Kingdom Ministers had recently had with the United States Under-Secretary of State for economic affairs (Mr. Dillon) had been useful; but Press reports of these discussions had given the impression that, while the United StatesGovernment would accept the E.F.T.A., provided that it was inconformity with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT), they did not favour a link, or even negotiations, between theE.F.T.A. and the E.E.C. as groups. Mr. Dillon had not accepted ourview that the E.E.C. represented a danger to the political unity ofEurope as a whole. He had, however, indicated that the UnitedStates were prepared to take a more active part in co-operating with europe in the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation(O.E.E.C.), and it was possible that the United States would agree tobecome a full member of the organisation. Their object would be todeal in O.E.E.C. with the problem of aid to the under-developed countries, and to bring pressure on Germany to accept herresponsibilities in this matter, as well as to consider the world balanceof payments situation and the problems of trade. The United Statesconsidered that the best course would be to work, in the comingGATT tariff negotiations, for a reduction in the common tariff of theE.E.C.Other Commonwealth countries were increasingly anxious aboutthe possibility of trade discrimination by the European groups, andthey did not particularly favour an association between the E.E.C.and the E.F.T.A. The consolidation of the E.F.T.A. was neverthelessour first objective. If any of the members were to leave theAssociation, our position would be greatly weakened. Some of the member countries (Austria, Denmark and Switzerland) were eager to start negotiations for some economic association with the E.E.C. Itwould however be a mistake to put forward specific economicproposals at present. The best course would therefore be, while maintaining the objective of an association between the E.E.C. andthe E.F.T.A., to be ready to join in a general move, in association withthe United States and the Commonwealth, in the O.E.E.C. and in the gatt to reduce tariffs and bring pressure upon the E.E.C. to adopta liberal policy. The Ministerial meeting of the O.E.E.C. which hadbeen arranged for 14th January, 1960, would provide an opportunityfor such a move, but it would clearly be preferable to leave it to theUnited States to take the initiative.The President of the Board of Trade said that the economic and commercial threat to our economy from the consolidation of theE.E.C. should not be underestimated. British industry was at presentassuming that there would be a development towards freer trade inEurope, and if this hope was not realised, the incentive to investcapital in E.E.C. countries would be greatly strengthened. TheE.E.C. countries could develop a common market as big as that ofthe United States, with the added advantage of comparatively lowwage rates. United Kingdom trade interests outside Europe wouldbecome increasingly subject to strong competition from E.E.C.countries. In addition to seeking to consolidate the EFT.A., weshould continue to try to persuade the United States that the E.E.C.alone would represent a danger to the political unity of Europe. the representations which had been made to Mr. Dillon on behalf of our partners in the E.F.T.A. had been most useful in this respect.The Minister of Education said that the E.F.T.A. countries didnot have the same political incentive to consolidate their position asdid those of the E.E.C. It would be logical to invite the United Statesand Canada to join the E.F.T.A., and to co-operate in the mutualreduction of tariffs. This was not only economically possible, butpolitically essential, if the West were to face the economiccompetition that could be expected in the future from the Sino-Soviet
bloc. The United States were justified in reducing the recent scale oftheir aid, but the corollary was that they should now be ready toco-operate in positive measures for the increase of their trade withthe rest of the free world.\jIn further discussion the following points were raised:          *(a) The United States would be most unwilling to join in adiscriminatory trade group. They were conscious of their obligations in the GATT, and particularly of the effect which their trade policiesmight have on the political situation in South American countries.(b) The reluctance of Commonwealth countries to support an association between the E.E.C. and the E.F.T.A. was based on their belief that the United Kingdom could only make trade concessions atthe expense of the existing arrangements for preferential treatment forour imports from them. This pointed to our trying to avoid the damage which the E.E.C. would otherwise cause us by working for a world-wide solution through GATT in association with theCommonwealth and the United States.(c) If the United States were to become a full member ofO.E.E.C., there might be additional pressure on us to make tradeconcessions at the expense of Commonwealth countries. Nevertheless,on balance, it was clearly in our interests to strengthen O.E.E.C. inthis way, in order to overcome French hostility to it.id) It should not be impossible, from the point of view of our commercial policy, to achieve some degree of harmonisation of tariffs between the E.E.C. and the E.F.T.A. This could perhaps be worked out on a piecemeal basis. Moreover, we could hope, in anysuch negotiations, to safeguard the principle of commonwealth preference. Study was now being made of the concessions we might make at the appropriate time. But . even if some economicaccommodation between the E.E.C. and the E.F.T.A. could be worked out, it would not be possible to make any real progress untilthe French Government became willing to consider an agreement.(e) It was not possible to decide at present what were the realintentions of the French President as regards the future relationsbetween European countries. He presumably felt confident that hecould continue to command the support of the German Government,despite the fact that many sections of German opinion favoured aneconomic accommodation between the E.E.C. and the rest of Europe.The Prime Minister said that the economic problem with which&apos;we were faced in Europe could not be satisfactorily settled until wehad reached a political understanding with the French Government.A united Europe was, on balance, in the best interests of the free world. We had no wish to deprive France of her natural leadership of Europe. But we had to bear in mind our special relationship withthe United States, and also the value of our position in theCommonwealth. It would be necessary at some future time toconsider how best to proceed to discuss these questions with theFrench President. It would, however, be premature to raisethe problem of European economic relations at the forthcoming meeting in Paris of the Heads of Western Governments. our immediate purpose at that meeting was to settle the date, place andagenda for the meeting between the Heads of the Western and soviet governments next year. It would be necessary, at the Paris meeting,to arrange how a common policy on the problem of Germany,including Berlin, and on disarmament should be worked out. Itwould also be very desirable to try to bring the Geneva conferenceon the suspension of nuclear tests to a satisfactory conclusion. It was important not to prejudice decisions on these matters, and in any-\case further time was necessary in which to consider what economiL^and political arrangements would be in our best interests. Meanwhile,our economic objectives in Europe should be those proposed by theChancellor of the Exchequer.
4. The President of the Board of Trade said that, in the tradediscussions now in progress, the Polish Government had been persuaded to accept the cut in their quota of pigmeat exports to theUnited Kingdom, which the Cabinet had decided was necessary to offset the establishment of a quota of pigmeat from North America.The Polish Government were, however, pressing for an increase intheir present quota of canned ham from  1 - 7 to  2 - 5 millions, whichwas equivalent to an increase of about 1,600 tons of ham. Theywere prepared to give certain quotas in return, for example, for motorcars, and they might be prepared to order three Viscount aircraft.Discussion showed some division of opinion in the Cabinet onthis proposal. The sale of British aircraft to a member of theSino-Soviet bloc would be of very great value, and to refuse the PolishGovernments request would seriously damage our political andeconomic relations with them. Moreover, the decision to limit the quota for Polish pigmeat to 20,000 tons for the first six months of1960 had not yet been announced and the increase now proposed for canned ham might not seriously detract from the value to Britishproducers of the reduction in imports of pigmeat from Poland. Onthe other hand, various sections of the pig and bacon industry were showing serious concern at recent developments. It was not easy to reconcile the present proposal with the Cabinefs previous decisionon pigmeat imports.It was suggested that a possible solution might be to reject thePolish proposal for an increase in their quota of canned ham, but tooffer instead to buy from them 2,000 tons of butter in addition to theamount already agreed, on the firm understanding that they wouldorder three Viscount aircraft. This concession would not harm ourpig and bacon producers, nor would it appreciably affect the interestsof Commonwealth butter producers.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Agriculture, in consultation with theCommonwealth Secretary, the Minister of Aviation and thePresident of the Board of Trade, to give further considerationto the solution suggested in their discussion, and to informthe Prime Minister whether an agreement could be madewith the Polish Government on this basis.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,15th December, 1959.Commercial!Policy.(previous references:C.C.
