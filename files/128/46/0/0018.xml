TOP  secret copy No..cabinet confidential ANNEX-CC(66) 37th conclusions tuesday, 19th July, 1966 at 5. 00 p. m.THE ECONOMICSITUATION(previous reference:CC(66) 36thConclusions,Minute 3)The Cabinet considered Notes by the Secretary of theCabinet (C(66) 106, 107, 103, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114and 115), covering nemoranda, prepared by officials, on measures which might be taken to deal with the economicsituation.THE HEUME MINISTER said that the situation withwhich the Govern^-ient were faced was due to the pressure on sterling which had developed over the past ten days.     This was largely irrational;  and a number of factors had contributed toit.    The seamen&apos;s strike had had an adverse effect on confidence in sterling;  and this had been increased when the losses in the reserves for the month of June, which were largely due to the strike, had been published.     The intensifies-tion of the war in Vietnam had also affected confidence; and reports following the visit to London by the French PrimeMinister and Foreign Minister had suggested that in their view the United Kingdom Government should consider devaluation.   s.There had been a  general breakdown of confidence in sterling;and the rate of deterioration was now such that a statement ofthe Government^ policy mu3t be made without delay and couldrest wait until after hie forthcoming visit to Washington.    the papers now before the Cabinet had been prepared by officials inthe light of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on 14th July and covered thevarious measures which were open to the Government.    these included a  sharp reduction in private consumption through theuse of hire purchase restrictions and. the economic regulator;restrictions on construction both in the private and publicsectors;  and reductions in investment, particularly by the nationalised industries.     They did not suggest significantreductions in current Government expenditure; and the priority programmes of capital expenditure for housing,hospitals and schools would be largely exempt.    The measureswhich were selected and the rate at which they were appliedwould affect the size and severity of the disinflationary impetus.The memoranda also covered reductions in oversea expenditure,both governmental and private;   and they included studies of import quotas and export incentives as well as of a possiblestandstill on prices and incomes.-1-(972*141The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...$.*r*^..v(^r-*- ^ M.c. 
It had been suggested that devaluation might be analternative to disinflation; but, even if sterling were devalued,it would remain no less essential to free resources for exports and for import substitution.    It could be argued that the disinfla-tionary measures should be combined with immediate devaluationin order to produce the necessary shift in the economy and toprovide a direct incentive to exports.    But there were serious objections to devaluation, certainly at this stage, whether it took the form of a change to a new fixed rate or the adoption of a floating rate.    In the first case other countries might v/ell followour example and we should very shortly find ourselves in the samerelative position, having meanwhile incurred the odium of dis-locating world trade.    .0evaluation to a fixed rate would also shakethe confidence of the holdei-s of sterling balances;  and, if therewere a general :move to -withdraw these balances, a furtherdevaluation might well be inevitable within a short period.    Theadoption of a floating rate might be less open to objection,particularly if this step was taken when sterling was in a strong position and the rate would therefore tend to rice rather than to fall.     The adoption of a floating rate could, hov/ever, encourageother countries to act similarly when faced with economic difficulties;   and this could engender a condition of uncertaintywhich would affect world trade.     The need for stability of export prices had been regarded in the past as a decisive argument against the adoption of a floating rate for sterling;  and this argument still had force today.     It did not follow that devaluationneed be ruled out for all time;  if the disinflationary measureswhich the Government might now adopt proved ineffective, there might be no alternative but to devalue.    If, however, these measures proved reasonably effective, the position might beexpected to improve considerably;  and the situation could thenbe reviewed again after his forthcoming visit to Washington.The United States Government would probably be strongly opposedto a unilateral devaluation by the United Kingdom^ particularlybefore their own elections in November, since they might then be forced to devalue the dollar and this would compel them toincrease the price of gold, to which there were strong emotionalobjections in the United States,    There was oo::ne evidence,however, that, owing to the obstruction of the European countries,particularly France, to current proposals for increasing worldliquidity, the United States Government were now prepared toconsider new measures for this purpose, possibly including a link between sterling and the dollar and the adoption of a floating rate for the two currencies.     This concept had manyattractions, since it would constitute a joint operation with theUnited States, which could be launched from strength ratherthan weakness.If the choice lay simply between devaluation and themaintenance of full employment, he would prefer to devalue.In fact, however, it did not appear that we had reached the point at which devaluation was inevitable.    Moreover, while the studies by officials suggested that the disinflationary measures now proposed would lead to some increase in unemployment,this could provide a positive means of correcting the balance of-2-TOP SECRET
the economy and directing the national effort into economicallymore productive and socially more valuable channels.    Moreover,if these measures led to a higher level of unemployment than hadbeen estimated, it would be open to the Government to correctthis tendency by measures of reflation.    Finally, public opinion would welcome firm action;  and the measures now adopted mustcarry conviction and demonstrate the Governments determination to deal with the situation.    They should include a substantial reduction in internal demand, which must be balanced by areduction of expenditure overseas, both governmental and private.In order to be credible the measures should include action to stabilise prices and incomes.The Cabinet should now discuss the Governments basiceconomic strategy and should then consider in more detail the memoranda before them and the various disinflationary measureswhich might be adopted.    All measures, including devaluation,would be open to examination; but it was of the utmost importance that complete secrecy about the course of the discussion should bemaintained.In discussion it was urged that a change in the Governmentsfundamental economic policies was needed.     The proposals before the Cabinet contained no new features;   s.nd this wouldbecome apparent in any public istatwicrot be.De4 upon it.    by contrast devaluation would add a new dimension to economic policy, which would give the Government a wider range of choice of objectives.     The measures required to support a floating rate for sterling would not be, in kind, different fromthose needed to defend the present rate, the essential require-ments being that real standards of living should be reduced, that prices and incomes should be froaen, and that expenditure over-seas should be curtailed.     But the measures necessary to defend the present parity would have to be more severely deflationary thanthose required to make the best use of the additional scopeafforded by a devaluation.   If devaluation carried an inherent rickof further devaluations, the same was true of the alternative policy of deflation.    In recent years there had been a series ofdeflationary measures;  and sooner or later it had always been necessary to take further action of the same land.     Givendevaluation, however, the risk of a succession of similar moveswas much less;  and the objective of devadueing by means of a floating rate would be to restore the strength and the parity of the pound once the accompanying deflationary measures had overcome the immediate difficulties.    The combination of devaluation withrelatively moderate deflationary measures should permit economic recovery within a year, whereas two years or more would berequired for a policy of deflation alone to achieve its effect.Moreover, a dramatic decision to devalue sterling would have agreater psychological effect than a succession of disinflationary measures in awakening public opinion both to the gravity of thepresent situation and to its probable results if no effectiveremedial action was taken.    It was arguable that we should notresort to devaluation while the economy was weak; but theopportunity to devalue when the economy was strong would never-3-
in fact materialise.     It was also arguable that the Governmentshould have devalued sterling on taking office in October, 1964;but, that occasion having been missed, the opportunity of thepresent crisis should be taken to devalue to a floating rate and simultaneously to introduce the necessary measures ofdisinflation.In support of these arguments it was further urged thatthe parity of 2. 80 dollars to the pound; which the Government,on assuming office, had undertaken to dcfsnd, had proved to be incompatible with their two major objectives of improving therate of growth of the economy and of shifting resources from theprivate to the public sector.     The measures now before theCabinet were not only not new but offered no guarantee thatreflation after 1967 could be undertaken from any stronger position than that now prevailing.    Moreover, to embark upona deflationary policy now would be likely to prove embarrassingpolitically, especially if the reflation envisaged in 1968 were toproduce, as on pact experience it might, a renewed sterlingcrisis at a politically inconvenient time.    If the government recognised in the Prirae Minister&apos;s statement on the following day that they had been trying to maintain an unreal parity and anunrealistic role in the world - a reduction of  100 million inoversea expenditure was the minimum required to demonstratesuch recognition - this would have the maximum impact.     It hadbeen argued that a decision on devaluation snould be delayed until after the Prime Minister&apos;s visit to Washington;  but the UnitedStates Government were not likely to give us more than temporaryhelp before their elections in November; and even this would bolikely to involve us still more deeply in long-term commitments in the Far East and elsewhere and to inhibit the development of the  new economic strategy for which devaluation would open theway.     The worst of all courses would be to adopt a series of     &quot;*stringent disinflationary measures now and then to be compelledto devalue sterling a few months later.The experience of the last tv/o years or more suggestedthat it was impossible to combine a policy of full employmentwith a healthy balance of payments at the present parity.Theoretically it would be possible to maintain that parity by a combination of quantitative restrictions and export subsidies;but these merely constituted a disguised devaluation, which mightwell provoke international retaliation.     The choice, therefore,lay between devaluation and true deflation; and in the latter casethe deflation would probably have to be considerably more severethan would be necessary if it were accompanied by devaluation.But deflation on this scsde would disrupt internal confidence,particularly as regards investment, and would virtually preclude the possibility of any sticcess for the Governments long-tarmeconomic policies for removing restrictiva practices and promoting growth.    An announcement of further deflation on thefollowing day would be a confession tha.t the Governmentsprevious policy had failed;  and it would have to be followed by afurther admission of the same kind after a relatively shortinterval.-4-
A fundamental weakness in the Governments present policy was the fact that we were seeking to maintain a positionin the world which our economy could not support.     This weak-ness could not be remedied merely be declaring an intention to achieve a modest saving&apos; on the Governments oversea expenditure.The only practical course was to abandon a very substantial partof our oversea commitments.    Action of this kind, accompaniedby devaluation, would free us from our mpnetary and politicalobligations to countries who at present sought to enact politicalsupport in return for their assistance to sterling.    We shouldalso refuse to be bound by international obligations which prevented us from providing export incentives or imposingrestrictions on imports when we judged these steps to benecessary.There was admittedly no easy solution for our present economic problems,    Ctern measures of disinflation,accompanied by devaluation, would be accepted by the country as demonstrating our independence of purpose and our deter-mination to maintain economic growth.    But if the government did not take this opportunity to devalue and adopted, instead, aseries of harsher deflationary measures ap evidence of their determination to maintain the parity, devaluation might still be forced on us at a later date but it would than be no longer possible to take political credit for it as a deliberate act of policy,based on a considered economic judgment.      /e should have to admit that we had tried to maintain the parity and had failed.And this failure would have mere than merely economic implications.On the other hand it was argued that it would be a mistake&apos;to devalue the pound or to allow the rate of exchange tofloat a.t the present time.     The issue could not fairly be presented in terms merely of providing reassurance to foreignbankers at a particular moment of time,    The prevailing lack ofconfidence in the British economy was due to a persisting doubt about our ability to pay our way and to meet our obligations inthe longer term, as illustrated by the substantial deterioration in the forecasts of our balance of payments yaboap&amp;cte ascompared with those on which the Budget had been based in April.For this continuing imbalance devaluation would provide no simpleor rapid remedy.Moreover, its effects, both economic and political, wereunpredictable.    The result might well be so greatly to increasethe reluctance to hold sterling, even on the part of those who had hitherto continued to do so, that we should quickly be forced topermit the exchange rate to fall to a very damaging extent;  andthe initial devaluation, if to a new fixed rate, might then haveto be followed by further devaluations.    Alternatively, if weallowed sterling to floa.t and to find its own level, we could notcommand the reserves to prevent it from sinking to an unaccept-ably low rate.    Nor could it be argued in support of devaluationthat sterling was over-valued at the present parity.    The-5-
increase in exports of 6 per cent in volume and 9 per cent in value in the first five months of 1966, compared with thecorresponding period of 1965, indicated that v/e v/ere not failing to be competitive in world markets in terms of our prices.The deterioration of the balance of visible trade in June was immediately attributable to the effects of the seamen&apos;s strike;but basically our balance of payments difficulties v/ere due toan inflow of imports which was generated by the excessivepressure of domestic demand.    Despite the serious objectionsto import restrictions which were summarised in the memorandabefore the Cabinet, it might be desirable to consider later,but not at present, the introduction of a system of selectiveimport controls.Moreover, devaluation would not remove the need fordisinflationary measures.     That need would be as great, oreven greater, if we devalued, since, unless capacity for exportproduction were increased by the restraint of domestic demand,we should lose the benefit of the competitive advantage whichdevaluation should afford our exports.    The measures beforethe Cc.binet would reduce demand by something of the order of 500 million or more.    But this was marginal in comparisonwith the gross domestic product (GDP), now running at over 30, 000 million; and it could hardly be argued, therefore, thatthe effects of these measures on the domestic economy would be disastrous.     On the other.hand they should be sufficient to bringabout the marginal shift of resources which was all that was required, without leading to an unacceptable level of unemploy-ment.    Even if, contrary to expectation, they proved to have more severe effects than were either needed or intended,measures such as the regulator or hire purchase restrictionscould be reversed at short notice.It had been a.rgued that devaluation would represent anew strategy, particularly in the sense of a release from theeconomic constraints which at present inhibited the Governmentin the pursuit of their political objectives.    But experienceafter the last devaluation in 1949 did not support the thesis thatdevaluation v/as likely to make it easier for us to break out ofthe cycle of &quot;stop and go&quot; which had characterised the economysince the end of the war in 1945.    Devaluation would contributenothing to the overriding requirement of our longer-term economic policy, which v/as the improvement of productivity.It was correspondingly important, therefore, that any combina-tion of disinflationary measures should include action which would contribute to the positive aims of this policy;  and it might benecessary to contemplate more drastic measures to divertman-power and resources from inessential and secondary industries to industries which could make a substantial contribution to exports.-6-
Devaluation would increase both the coot and thedifficulty of meeting our obligations in foreign currencies.Moreover, to devalue, or to let the exchange rate float, wouldbe tantamount to defaulting on those who had continued to holdsterling in the faith, in which they had been encouraged by successive Government statements, that the exchange paritywould be maintained.    It would be dishonourable for the UnitedKingdom Government to take this couro e unless it was forcedon them.;  and foreign opinion would not be ready to accept theinevitability of a devaluation unless the Government had shown a readiness to face their responsibilities and to take all possible action to avoid such a step.    That point had not yet beenreached.The Government must also weigh the political consequences of devaluation for our relationships with othercountries.     These consequences were incalculable;  but theymight be gravely damaging to our interests.    Moreover, in considering the measures necessary to avoid devaluation itwould be unwise to attach too much importance to reductions inGovernment expenditure overseas.      This expenditure constitutedonly some 12 pvv cent of total United Kingdom expenditure overseas, which would therefore be reduced by only 2. per centif the reductions now proposed were approved.    3ut these reductions, once made, would be irrevocable, and the surrender of commitments which they would imply would be liable to involve us in great difficulties which would be not merely political buteconomic as well.    Foreign opinion would be more impressed by resolute domestic measures than by drastic  reductions in overseas expenditure which weakened our influence abroad.    Butit would also be influenced by the character of the disinflationary measures which were introduced;  and from this point of view it was possible to maintain that the proposals before the Cabinetlaid insufficient emphasis on the need to reduce unproductiveexpenditure, including unproductive Government expenditure, inthe United Kingdom.    It might be thought preferable to laygreater emphasis on the need to encourage the sectors of the economy concerned with economic growth and to make reductions,if necessary, in expenditure on e. g. social benefits, health and housing until our rate of economic growth was adequate tosupport the burden of the social expenditure which we wished toundertake.    Moreover, the increase in the housing programme,whether by public or by private enterprise, logically requiredfmxtfeer substantial investment in the public utility industries inorder to provide the necessary services for new houses.Reductions in capita.! expenditure on e. g. electricity supply and
14distribution, should therefore be considered in the context of thedemand for these services generated by other investment.    Onthe other hand reductions in social expenditure would not onlyrepresent the negation of policies to which the Government were committed but would be widely regarded as incompatible with a standstill in respect of increases in prices and wages.But the overriding political consideration was the factthat the Government^ supporters and the country as a whole were looking to the Government to provide firm and unitedleadership in the situation.which faced the::;.; and the action taken must be an adequate response to this challenge.     Inparticular the Government v/ould be expected to adopt a firmattitude towards the leaders of both sides of industry whoseperformance e. g. as regards improvement in productivity, hadnot matched their professions.      The country would be preparedto support a Government which showed a clear determination todeal with the problems confronting them., rege.rdless of sectionalinterests.    Meanwhile, although even disinflationary measures as severe as those now under consideration might be insufficient to restore confidence in sterling and we might therefore be forced to consider an alteration in the parity at a. later date, itwould none the less bo premature to take ah insufficientlyconsidered decision on this vital question before the PrimeMinister&apos;s forthcoming visit to Washington.
THE PRIIV..E MINISTER, summing up the discussion,said that it was important to distinguish clearly betweenproblems of reality&apos;&apos; and problems of confidence.     the realities of the situation were that our export achievementswere good;   our exports were rising ahead of target but our effort was being impeded by shortages of labour which couldonly be solved by redeployment.     On the other side of the account, however, our position was being prejudiced byexcessive demand for imports;   and sooner or later we mighthave to recognise that a solution could only be found by introducing selective import controls.As regards the problem of confidence, in so far asit had a rational origin this was to be found in the increasein world prices, which itself resulted from the fact that thewar in Vietnam had new created a situation net unlike thatprevailing at the time of the Korean war in 1951.     The Vietnamconflict had also exacerbated the adverse balance of payments of the United States;   and their counter-measures, by reducingthe world supply of dollars, had increased our own diffi-culties.     Moreover these special factors were operating inthe wider context of a world shortage of liquidity;   and ailattempts to find a remedy for this longer-term problem had so far failed in the face of opposition from European interests,particularly the French Government.Since sterling was a reserve currency we inevitablyfound ourselves exposed to the full brunt of die resultingpressures;   and sterling, rather than the dollar, had to withstand the initial attack which we had been experiencingduring the last 18 months and were now confronting in its full intensity.    At some point it might be necessary to reconsider our position as the banker of the sterling area.It was clear, however, that the balance of opinion in theCabinet was opposed to any immediate alteration of the sterling parity;   and, although it would be unrealistic to reject devaluation in any circumstances, it was virtuallycertain that, if the Government took prior decision to devaluesterling, his subsequent visit to Y7ashington in the following week might be largely frustrated in advance by an act whichcould have a very serious effect on our relations with theUnited States.In these circumstances it would be right for him tomake on the following day a statement in the house ofCommons which would indicate the Governments firmdetermination to put the economy to rights by means of a programme of disinflationary measures.     But if, thereafter,sterling did not make a sufficient recovery and no positiveresults emerged from his forthcoming discussion with theUnited States President of the possibilities which he had indicated in his opening statement, it would be necessary toconsider the whole situation afresh.-9-
His statement in the House of Commons should be ofa nature to give the country the sense of renewed purpose forwhich it v/as now calling.    At the same time it must make itclear that the policy of the Government v/as different fromthat of its predecessors in that, first, there would be no reduction in expenditure on social priorities such as housing,schools and hospitals and, second, while the Governmentwere determined to eliminate the wastdful use of labour byredeploying it in the more productive sectors of the economy,particularly exports, it would also be their purpose to avoidexcessive levels of unemployment, both nationally andregionally,THE FIRST SECRETARY OF STATE indicated thathe was not convinced that this policy would suffice and thatan immediate devaluation might not be the wiser course.He therefore wished to reserve his position for furtherconsideration.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that the cabinet should now proceed to an initial discussion of some of theeconomic measures to be announced in his parliamentary statement on the following day.In discussion the following main points were made -(a)    While hire purchase restrictions had someadvantages over the use of the regulator, notably that theydid not affect the retail price index, their impact onpurchasing power was only temporary.     The inclusion ofthe regulator in the measures was therefore essential tcestablish its credibility in the eyes of overseas opinion.There was a widespread measure of agreement, however,that the regulator should not be applied to the tobacco duty;the evidence suggested that tobacco had reached the limit oftaxable capacity and a further increase might reduce con-sumption to the point where there v/as no net increase in revenue.    Moreover the increase in tobacco duty would raise the retail price index by nearly one point.     Theincrease in purchase tax would raise the index by less thanone-fifth of a point and the increase in the duties onalcoholic liquor by about one-third of a point.     Theincrease in the hydrocarbon oil duty would also affect thecost of living ultimately;  but the additional duty would berebated to exporting industry through the e::port rebatearrangements and could be repaid to public passenger trans-port operators by arrangements similar to those adoptedin the previous year.-10-
(b) It was pointed out that the average downpaymentactually paid on motor cars bought on hire purchase was atpresent 38 per cent.    In these circumstances to raise theminimum deposit to 40 per cent might not constitute a very substantial disincentive;  and it might be preferable to raisethe figure to 50 per cent.    On the other hand at a time whenthe motor car industry was running at 90 per cent of capacity the combination of a 50 per cent minimum depositand an increase of purchase tax could have serious conse-quences for employment in the industry.(c) In general it would not be possible to increase direct taxation at this juncture in the light of the difficulty of introducing a new Finance Bill at the present point in theParliamentary Session.    The Cabinet would however, beinvited to consider a proposal for a surcharge of 10 per centon surtax for 1965-66.     This proposal, which would yield anadditional  26 million, could be given statutory sanction inthe following year&apos;s Finance Bill.     Tiiere would be political advantages in such a proposal, although it might be argued that it would bear hardly on some of the younger executivesin industry, on whose energy and willingness increases inefficiency depended.(d) There was general agreement with the proposal toextend the control of office building and to lower the limit for the purpose of building licensing.(e) There was general agreement that a limit should be imposed on the tourist travel allowances.    Although some members of the Cabinet fa.voured an allowance of  60, itwas pointed out that an allowance of  50 would be higherthan the present average level of expenditure (excludingfares).    It v/as suggested that the travel allowance shouldbe fixed at  60 but should be applied to travel within as wellas outside the sterling area.     The Chancellor of theExchequer undertook to consider whether the Governmenthad power to impose a travel allowance for travel in the sterling area and whether, if so, such an allowance couldtechnically be administered.(f) There was general agreement that the proposedalterations in arrangements for emigrants1 allowances werejustifiable.(g) It was re-ernphasised that the level of investment in the electricity and gas supply industries v/as directly related to the level of housebuilding and that it would there-fore be difficult to make major reductions in the investment programmes of these industries if the housebuildingprogramme was not to be curtailed.    It was suggested thatthe ban on advertising by the electricity and gas boards should be extended for a further period, although this mighthave the disadvantage of reducing sales of off-peak storageheaters which helped to spread the load on the electricity supply industry.-11-
THE PPv.II/lE MINISTER, summing up this part of thediscussion, said that at this stage the Cabinet were expressinginitial views and that firm decisions would need to be taken attheir next meeting.    If the Cabinet decided to introduce hire purchase restrictions at the lower cf the levels proposed, toimpose the regulator and to make the proposed reductions in public sector investment, the total amount by which demand wouldbe reduced would approach  500 million.     The Governmentcould also take credit for the  26 million in respect cf thesurtax surcharge proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the  20 million increase in postal tariffs, which had alreadybeen approved by the Cabinet and could well be included in his statement on the economic measures.    \7ith these additionsthe total reduction in demand would amount to rather more than 500 million, although to the extent that overseas expenditure(particularly on tourism) was reduced there would be semeincrease in the level of domestic demand which would need tobe offset.The Cabinet -Agreed to resume their discussion of theeconomic situation at a meeting to be heldon Y/wednesday, 20th July, at 9. 00 a. m.Cabinet Office, S. 17.1.22nd July, 1966-12-
