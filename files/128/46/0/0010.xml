He was seeking
Legislation would be necessary either in the overspill period or early-next Session to implement the arrangements for the transfer andsecondment of Great Britain police.    He hoped that he could persuade the Northern Ireland Government to acquiesce in all theseproposals for the RUC,The proposals relating to the USC (the iB1 Specials), were more difficult; and he and the Defence Secretary shared reservations about them.    The Hunt Report proposed that the USG should be disbanded and that their former functions should be undertaken by two new&apos; bodies: a special constabulary, on the Great Britainpattern, of unpaid, unarmed volunteers under police control, whichwould relieve the RUG of routine duties such as traffic control;and a part-time, locally recruited, paid and armed defence force,rather like the wartime Local Defence Volunteers, to guard the border and key installations, who would teceive military trainingfrom the British Army and would be under the control of theGeneral Officer Commanding (GOC), acting in consultation with theNorthern Ireland Government,    Lord Hunt&apos;s Advisory Boardthought that the political repercussions of disbanding the USC wouldbe less severe if it was replaced by such a force; some of themore suitable of its ex-members might be absorbed into the newforce and the creation of the force would reduce the risk of theUSC going underground.    Even so, there was some risk of an adverse Protestant reaction^ although it was perhaps not as graveas Mr, QuSnfcSn Hogg had suggested to him it might be.The most difficult problem in this part of the proposals was how and to what extent the Northern Ireland Government should share in the control of the new defence force..    They had made itclear that they wanted to play a larger part than Lord Hunt hadenvisaged, whereby the GOC would exercise his command in close consultation with them through the medium of a Security committee under the chairmanship of the Minister of Home Affairs.    he recognised the special difficulty for the Northern ireland government in accepting this element in the proposals; and it would clearly be much easier to persuade Protestant opinion to accept the disbandment of the USC if the package included a good measure ofcontrol of the new force by Storrnont;  but it would not be possibleto go beyond an arrangement for the GOC to consult with the.Northern Ireland Government on any matters of the forcevs size and deployment, where their local knowledge would obviously be helpful.The matter was so delicate that Lord Hunt and his colleagues hadnot been able to reach a fully woiked out solution and it would therefore fall to him, keeping in touch with the Defence SecretaryiVto do this during his forthcoming talks with the StormentGovernment.    The disbandment of the USC and the establishment ofthe new local defence force under the control of the GCC azud ;:he.2-
Ministry of Defence were integral parts of the package of reforms,which were the minimum that we should require0   He believed thathe would be able to persuade the Northern Ireland Government ofthis but he would need the Cabinefs authority for a measure of discretion in his talks0THE DEFENCE SECRETARY said that he found the HuntReports recommendations for the RUC itself admirable.   he agreed that the USC should be abolished in its present form andhe accepted that there v/as a case for a military force to undertake the tasks which they had performed in the border areas.   It wouldnot be possible for the regular forces to shoulder this burdenthemselves, and, even if they had the manpower, there were other objections to their becoming involved In it.   He accepted, therefore,that mere would have to be a separate new military force.    To be adequate, the new force would need a strength nearer 5,000 thanthe 4, 000 proposed by the Hunt Reports and It would need about250 British officers and NCOs in its command structure.    their task would be similar to that which the Army and the USC had hadto perform in blocking the frontier during the irish Republican Army(IRA) insurgencies of the 1950s,    The nature of this task wouldrequire the force to be raised in mainly rural areas and to beprovided with arms which they would keep at home,   He saw no serious objection to this.    The force should not be part of theexisting Reserve Army but rather should be analagous to theHome Guard, with a flavour more of the original Local defence volunteers,    The Home Guard legislation, which was still on theStatute Book, would provide a convenient model for a separatecomprehensive Bill - to be passed by the United kingdom parliament ** to cover the new force, which would be preferable toattempting to make provision for it by amendments to Reserve Armylegislation.   He would wish- to be sure that adequate arrangements would be made to offset the extra  1 million cost of the force to theDefence budgeto    Like the Home Secretary, he recognised thatthese proposals raised a political dilemma.    To make the newforce acceptable to Roman Catholic opinion, it would have to be clearly under the control of the Westminster Government andfirmly linked to the Army.    On the other hand, to avoid a seriousProtestant reaction, the Stormont Government would somehow haveto be involved in its management,,   He was content to leave it tothe Home Secretary to obtain the best terms of agreement he could with the Northern Ireland Government p so long as ultimate controlof the force lay with the GOC responsible to the Ministry of Defence.i;    la discussion it was argued that no hasty decision should bemade on the proposed new defence force.   Several major questionsneeded to be answered.   How could it be ensured that the force would contain a reasonable balance of Protestants and roman catholics ?   If the force were dominated by Protestants - as seemedm3**
likely, and, indeed, perhaps necessary if it were to defend the border with resolution - how would the Irish Republic react to it,and how could Roman Catholic opinion in the North be persuaded ofits advantages over the USC ?   It was not sufficient to compare itfavourably with the USC, because the USC was a relic of the pastwhich was widely recognised as offensive and which the government now had to remove.    We should be most circumspect aboutcreating, at this stage of Northern Irelandrs history, a new specialmilitary force, even though it admittedly would be better than what it replaced.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the Governmenthad only a choice of evils before them.    There were undoubtedlyserious objections to the proposed new defence forcej but it wouldbe a substantial improvement cn the USC0    It would be only halfas larger it woald be located away from i;he urban areas of tension?and it would be directly under Army command and not Indirectlyand ineffectively controlled through the RUC    The issue of theminimum necessary arms to them had to be viewed against the background of the hundreds of thousands of small arms privatelyheld in Ulster, many of them by the USC themselves.    But the decisive consideration was that there was no satisfactory alternativeThe Army would need five further battalions to undertake the dutiesenvisaged for the defence force.    These would be additional to the extra garrison that would be required in the long term for the army to fulfil Its role of assisting the civil power and backing the defenceof the frontier.    The Armyfs other commitments would not allow itto provide a force totalling the 11 battalions which would be needed.In the long run it was to be hoped that the defence force v/ouldwither away when it had served its purpose.In further dlscusrion there was general agreement that theNorthern Ireland Government should not have as large a say in thecontrol of the force as Lord Hunt proposed,, lest it should in effectbecome simply a reincarnation of the USC.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of thediscussion, said that the Cabinet welcomed the proposals ofLord Hunt*s Advisory Board for bringing the Ulster police system as closely as possible into line with that in Great Britain.? and they agreed with the Home Secretary^ proposals for the publication ofthe report, the announcement of decisions on it and the appointmentof the new Inspector-General.    They agreed also that he should bring in a Bill to make possible the transfer and secondment ofpolice from forces in G:*eat Britain to the RUC,    They agreed withthe proposal to abolish the USCj but thc-y chared the unease of theHome and Defence Secretaries about the proposed defence force,to which there were several cogent objections.    But they accepted that there was no satisfactory alternative way of providing for the-4-
long-term protection of the border and of key installations, given that the British Army could not undertake the entire burden.Furthermore, the force v/would  be a necessary political counterweightto the abolition of the USCj if nothing were put in its place, it mightnot be possible to contain the reaction by the Protestants to theabolition of the force on which they pinned such reliance.   So longas the essential condition that the GOC, and through him the westminster Government, controlled the new force was met, theCabinet reluctantly accepted that it was the best solution in a mostdelicate and intractable situation.    The Hunt Report had not given a definitive answer to the problem how to associate the NorthernIreland Government with the management of the new force in orderto secure their co-operation.    The Home Secretary, in consultationwith the Defence Secretary, should have discretion for thispurpose in working out an acceptable arrangement, subject to ensuring that the ultimate control of the force was safeguarded inthe manner which the Cabinet considered essential.The Cabinet -(1) Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part oftheir discussion.(2)    Invited the Home Secretary to proceedwith the arrangements for introducingv the reforms of the RUC as agreed in discussion, and to bring in a Bill toprovide for the transfer and secondmentof Great Britain police. .(3)   Invited the Home Secretary, in consultationwith the Defence Secretary, to securethe best practicable arrangements for control of the new defence force, subjectto the essential requirements agreed in discussion, and to report to the Cabinet,(4)    Invited the Defence Secretary, in consultationwith the Home Secretary, to consider urgently the necessary legislative provision in the United Kingdom Parliament for establishing the new defence force.-5-
THE HOME SECRETARY said that the two Governments hadreceived reports from the three Working Parties and the economic mission of officials which he had initiated on his visit to Ulster inAugust,    The three Working Parties had examined the extent towhich the Northern Ireland Governments present practice orpledged commitments adeqtiately ensured the promotion of goodcommunity relations by methods including the prohibition ofincitement to religious hatred? the avoidance of any discrimination in any f orm of public employments and the fair allocation of houses by public authorise So    The economic mission had assessed theeconomic and industrial prospects in Northern Ireland in the lightof recent events,,    He proposed in his forthcoming visit to discusswhat action should follow from these reports.    The conclusions ofthe Working Parties on community relations and on the avoidance of discrimination in public employment were comprehensive andacceptable? but he considered that the proposals of the Working party on housing allocation - that reliance should he placed on the newallocation schemes and on the Commissioner for Complaints as along stop - would not go far enough to satisfy the R.oman Catholicminority that there was no discrimination.    He advocated transferringail public authority housing to the Northern Ireland Housing Trust,which had a reputation for impartiality.    It owned 40, 000 houses(in comparison with the local authoritiess which owned 76^,000) andits organisation could be expanded to undertake this extra task0He did not think that even the proposed new enlarged local authoritiesin Northern Ireland could be relied upon to administer housingwithout discriminationj and he could see no grounds why housing,any more than education, should not be administered as a centralservice for the whole Province,    Re was well aware that his proposal would arouse opposition and that it would, leave the local authorities with limited functions; but this was a price which would have to bepaid to ensure that the housing problem was properly dealt with.The economic missions report was encouraging for  heshort terms but it carried a warning that the longer term effectswere potentially very serious.    In  he light of their report, theNorthern Ireland Government proposed immediate measures to reassure investors about compensation for future district damage andto restore relative levels of inducement; and they proposed that u ?. million programme of labour intensive works, directed inparticular at the peak unemployment areas of the west, should beundertaken.    He doubted whether these proposals would besufficient to solve the unemployment problem or to ensure an acceptable future rate of economic progress; but he Invited theCabinet to agree to them in principle so that he could base his forthcoming discussions upon them.
In discussion there was general agreement with the HomeSecretary1^ attitude to the reports and to his proposals for actingupon them.   It was pointed out however that his proposals for public authority housing would make this a 100 per cent charge onthe Exchequer.   There would also have to be financial discussions between the Treasury and the Northern Ireland Ministry of Financeon the proposal to increase by  1 million the special capital programme.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of thediscussion, said that the Cabinet endorsed the Home Secretaryfsviews on the reports of the three Working Parties and the economic mission.   They authorised him to discuss action on them accordinglywith the Northern Ireland Government during hi3 forthcoming visit,subject to a full examination of the financial considerationsmentioned in discussion.The Cabinet -(5) ; Invited the Home Secretary to proceed asproposed in C(69) 131, subject tc fullconsultations as appropriate on thefinancial points.Cabinet Office, S. W. L9th October, 1969
