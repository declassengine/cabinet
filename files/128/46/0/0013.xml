About mid-day on the previous day we hadreceived an indication that the United States authorities were beginning to think that some action would be required to stemthe demand for gold;  and, although it was far from clear what form this action might take, a rapid examination of itsvarious possible forms had shown that their implicationscould not be other than very unwelcome to us.    It was not until late in the evening, however, that the Secretary of theUnited States Treasury, Mr. Fowler, had informed him by telephone that the United States Government intended to convene in Washington during the forthcoming weekend aconference of representatives of the Central Banks of thecountries members of the Gold Pool in an endeavour to restore stability in the international monetary situation;  andthat, as an essential preliminary they must ask us to close the gold market in London.     This request had been reinforced by a parallel discussion at about the same time between theGovernor of the Federal Reserve Bank, Mr. Martin, and theGovernor of the Bank of England.    It was clear that, if we took action of this kind, it would be necessary to arrange that15th March should be a bank holiday, since, if we continued toallow foreign exchange dealings, pressure on sterling could develop on a scale which would make it impossible for us tomaintain the parity.    But ordinary domestic banking businesscould be permitted;  in particular, cash for the payment ofwages would continue to be available.     The Stock Exchange,however, should be closed.
In the circumstances we had had no alternative toacceding to the United States request to close the London goldmarket.     Had we not done so, we could not have faced the drain on our reserves which would have developed that day, moreparticularly if we had alienated the sympathy of the United states who alone were in a position to help us to support the sterlingparity.    On the other hand, it had been essential to obtain fromthe United States authorities an assurance that, in return for auragreement to close the gold market in London while the marketselsewhere remained open, they would provide whatever support for sterling was required in New York to enable us to maintainthe parity.    Once we had obtained this assurance, by means of afurther telephone conversation between Mr. Martin and theGovernor of the Bank of England, it was necessary to take themost urgent action to obtain the approval of The Queen in Councilto a proclamation of a bank holiday if instructions were to beissued to the bar-thing system in time to be effective at the openingof business.     The Privy Council had therefore been arranged at 12. 30 a. m. j and he himself had explained the situation to theHouse of Commons in a statement at 3. 30 a. m.In discussion some Ministers expressed concern that decisions of this importance had been taken without collectiveMinisterial consideration.     This was merely the latest of several occasions on which issues of monetary policy had been judged tobe of such secrecy and complexity that decisions had been reserved virtually to the Prime Minister and the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer of the day.    The deflationary policy adopted inJuly, 1966; the act of devaluation decided in November, 1967;and now the action which we had been compelled to take on theprevious night - these were successive examples of decisions which the Cabinet had been forced to take at very short notice and without the benefit of any preliminary discussion on the basisof considered appreciations of alternative courses of policy andtheir implications.    In each case, however, it had been sufficiently clear for some time before the critical moment thata dangerous situation might develop; and there had been ample opportunity for the Cabinet to discuss the issues involved while there was still time to examine them in detail and to reach a deliberate judgment.    This was less than satisfactory if the concept of collective responsibility was to retain its meaning;and alternative arrangements should be made to ensure that infuture the Cabinet would be given an opportunity to discuss issues of this gravity before they wore overtaken by events.     their recent prolonged examination of future policy on prices and incomes illustrated the value to be obtained from full collectivediscussion of major issues of economic policy.On the other hand the prices and incomes policy was amatter which lay essentially within the Governments control,whereas the possibility of a change in the price of gold and theprobable attitude of the United States Administration to thisquestion were matters which the Government had little, if any,power to influence.     Nor was there any reason to suppose that even the most protracted discussion of the complex issues involved would have enabled Ministers to reach any decision other than that
which the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the exchequer had been compelled to take on their own responsibility duringthe previous night.    In fact, it had only been at a very latehour that the United States intentions had been established with sufficient certainty to make it realistic to contemplate taking any decision at all;   and by that time the need to take action asregards the closing of the gold market and the proclamation ofa bank holiday was so urgent that it would have been impossiblefor Ministers to be gathered together in time to debate theeeissues.In further discussion there was general agreement thatthe decisions which the Prime Minister and the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer had taken in the small hours of the morninghad been right beyond any question.    Indeed, if those decisions had not been taken, the Cabinet might be meeting that morningin very different circumstances to deal with a far graversituation.    Nevertheless, it remained desirable in principlethat for the future some rather more effective arrangement should be made to ensure that, even on the most sensitiveissues of economic and financial policy, a sufficiently representative body of Ministers should be brought into consultation tosafeguard the concept of collective responsibility.    And. if theprice of such an arrangement was the risk of premature andunauthorised disclosure of highly secret information, thatrisk must be accepted,THE PRIME MINISTER,, summing up this part of thediscussion, said that he recognised the force of the views whichhad been expressed and would give further consideration to thepossibility of meeting the wishes of the Cabinet in this respect.He had regretted that it had not been possible to arrange for collective discussion of the issues which he and the Chancellorof the Exchequer had had to confront on the previous evening;but he had in fact been able to inform about half the Cabinet,who had been assembled by the Foreign Secretary at the Houseof Commons and had been brought to see him at No.  10.     In theabsence of the Foreign Secretary from the Cabinet it would notbe right or profitable to discuss the attitude which the foreign secretary had adopted during and after that discussion; but he appreciated that some Ministers took exception to it,, -The Cabinet should now consider the policy which weshould adopt henceforward in dealing with probable further developments in the international monetary situation.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that,although it was the dollar which was currently under pressure,circumstances might well develop in which the dollar couldnevertheless survive at its present exchange value for sometime longer but it might become impossible to maintain theparity of sterling.     Our main purpose, therefore, must be toorganise sufficient additional support for sterling, preferably in the form of an open-ended line of credit, to enable us to-3-
maintain the parity during the next few weeks.    There was little doubt that those weeks would see a very profound change in theinternational monetary situation, a change which might in effectbring the sterling area to a virtual end in view of the rapiddiversification of sterling balances which was almost inevitableas soon as normal trading was resumed.     This process could beeffected in an orderly way, in which case it would be to our longterm advantage,,    But, if it was carried out in circumstances ofinternational confusion and chaost the effects on the British economy could be very damaging indeed.Much would depend on the policy which the United states authorities adopted towards the continuing demand for gold.     Theymight decide to increase the price of gold;  and in certaincircumstances this could be helpful to us.     On the other handexpert opinion was inclined to believe that the demand for goldwas now of such intensity that even a doubling of the price mightnot suffice to check it.    Moreover, the United States Governmentwere so heavily committed politically to maintaining the price at its present level that it was very unlikely that they would adopt anincrease in the price as a deliberate policy.    In practice, therefore,we could expect little help in this respect,Alternatively, the United States authorities mightdemonetise gold by unilaterally suspending their sale and purchaseof the metah     The exchange value of the dollar would then be left,in effect, to float.     We should still need to seek to link sterlingto the dollar at the present parity; but, if we were to succeed, weshould need very substantial United States support for sterling.A third course open to the United States would be to adopta dual system of gold transactions, whereby they would maintainthe gold price at the present rate of $35 per ounce for the purposesof exchange with a limited number of Central Banks who would undertake not to market it or to make it available for speculation;but in the open market they would allow the price of gold to findits own level, which would inevitably be higher than $35.    A systemof this kind, however, would be inherently unstable;  and, if sterlingwas to accommodate itself to an arrangement of this nature, itwould need support on an extensive scale.Finally, the United States authorities might seek tomaintain the present system, possibly with the modification of theintroduction of a gold certificate as a means of giving the holders of dollar balances an insurance against any subsequent change in the dollar value of gold.     On balance, this was the course which theywere most likely to adopt;  and, if they were unable to commandsufficient support to maintain the present system, demonetisationwould probably be their second choice.    Neither course would beas attractive to us as an increase in the price of gold; but theUnited States authorities were very unlikely to embrace this policy.We must therefore concentrate all our efforts, particularly at theforthcoming conference of the representatives of the Central banks of the Gold Pool countries, on securing, partly from Europe andpartly from the United States, a further substantial line of credit as
a means of onsmring the support which sterling would certainlyneed in the weeks ahead, whichever course the United Statesadopted.    In addition, we must prepare as a matter of urgencya contingency plan for emergency action if, by the following monday, it was clear that this conference had failed and thatrenewed disorder in financial markets must be expected.    If inthose circumstances we took no action to protect our interests(e. g, by blocking the sterling balances), we should probably be driven to allow the sterling rate to float.    But we no longer had sufficient reserves to support it;  particularly since we shouldbe in default to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) andshould therefore forfeit our drawing rights on the Fund.      As aresult a floating rate would fall to successively lower levels;and we should face the prospect of a renewal of the conditionswhich had developed in the 1930rs, when a failure of confidenceon a world-wide scale had precipitated a contraction of inter-national trade and had dislocated the whole system of internationalpayments.     On the other hand, if we could secure further support for sterling in the weeks ahead and could ensure that the forth-coming monetary conference was conducted, on positive and constructive lines, it might thereafter be possible to devise apolitical basis on which to reorganise the international monetary system and to increase international liquidity by activating thespecial drawing rights which had been agreed in principle at themeeting of the IMF at Rio de Janeiro in the previous autumn.THE PRIME MINISTER informed the Cabinet of the messages which he had exchanged with the President of the UnitedStates, President Johnson, during the previous night.    He had warned the President that some of the possible courses open to theUnited States authorities might temporarily relieve theirembarrassment but at the almost certain cost of intrinsic damage to sterling;  and that, if this were to happen, the dollar too would ultimately be at risk.    He had therefore made it clear that, ifthe United States Administration took a decision which put sterling in danger, it was essential that they should support sterlingduring the days immediately ahead;  otherwise, either bothcurrencies would be devalued or we ourselves should have to takeurgent action to protect sterling, which would transfer the wholeof the speculative pressure to the dollar.    In his reply PresidentJohnson had emphasised that he hoped to deal with the presentsituation in a way which would contribute to the development ofa more stable and satisfactory international monetary mechanism.He had stressed the importance which he attached to themaintenance of a very close link between the British and UnitedStates authorities in this matter but had made it clear that hewould personally find any change in the price of gold unacceptable.In discussion there was general endorsemat of the lines on which the Prime Minister had approached PresidentJohnson.    In particular, the implied warning that in certaincircumstances we might have to contemplate a secend devaluationof sterling might be our most effective means of persuading theUnited States Administration that they had no alternative topromoting further international credit to support it.    None of thepossible courses of action which they might adopt would be-5-
de m ens tr ably to our advantage in the short term.    In particular,the dual system would be unworkable, since it would beimpossible to maintain two gold prices in simultaneous butseparate operation for very long;   while an increase in the priceof gold would benefit countries which, on the whole, were hostile to us and, by implying that further increases in price were possible, might reduce, rather than increase, internationalliquidity.     The principal danger, however, was that the UnitedStates would adopt the easiest course by seeking in effect tomaintain the present system and refusing to contemplate any-drastic or fundamental change in international monetary arrange-ments - whereas it might be to our long term advantage to seek to move in the direction of the demonetisation of gold, while maintaining the link between the sterling and dollar parities.This, however, was entirely dependent on our securing additionalsupport for sterling on an adequate scale.Ultimately we had most to fear if the short term solution which was adopted did nothing to reduce or to eliminate theessential instability in the present monetary system.    This wasa political, rather than a technical, issuej and what was required was essentially an act of political will directed to bringing into force the system of special drawing rights.Hitherto all attempts to achieve this had been frustrated by the refusal of the French Government to allow the monetaryauthorities of the European Economic Community (e.c.) toco-operate in activating these drawing rights.    But we mustmaintain our efforts to overcome this obstruction;  and weshould seek to promote a series of international conferences,both political and technical, directed towards a thorough-goingreform and reorganisation of the international monetary system.In further discussion it was suggested that the Governmentshould be concerned to ensure, so far as possible, that publicopinion was adequately informed about the real issues at stake inthis highly complex matter.     Properly presented, the monetarycrisis could provide a favourable context for the forthcoming budget, which could now be seen as essentially the british contribution to the solution of a problem which was world-widein its scope.     This, however, would depend on a conscious and concerted effort to explain to the public the nature of theproblem which now confronted us, the reasons for its suddenemergence and the means by which we might best seek to grapplewith it.     These questions would need to be dealt with as part ofthe presentation of the Budget in the weeks ahead.The Cabinet -(1)    Took note, with approval, that the Prime minister would arrange to constitute a small group ofMinisters who would keep the situation under constant review during the weekend and would report to an early meeting of the Cabinet.
(2)    Agreed that, if it became necessary toextend the bank holiday which had beenarranged for that day, the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer should make the necessary arrangements.(3)    Agreed that the purpose of our representatives at the forthcoming meeting of Central Banks ofthe countries members of the Gold Pool shouldbe to secure the maximum additional support for sterling in the weeks ahead.Cabinet Office, Sc W. 1.16th March, 1968-7
