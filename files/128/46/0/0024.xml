NO CIRCULATION RECORDCC(67) 2nd Conclusions(19th January, 1967 - 10. 00 a. m. )On 19th January, 1967, the Cabinet considered the situation which had arisen as a result of the fact that Lord Harewood had&apos;recently announced in public his intention to part from his wife and to marry Miss Tuckwell, by whom he had had a son some two years earlier.    Divorce proceedingsbetween Lord Harewood and his wife had already been set in train.THE HOME SECRETARY informed the Cabinet that Lord Harewoodwould be prevented by the Royal Marriages Act, 1772, from contracting anew marriage without the consent of the Sovereign signified under the GreatSeal and declared in Council.    Alternatively, if his marriage weredisapproved by the Sovereign, he would be entitled to give notice ofhis intention to the Privy Council and to marry after an interval of12 months unless both Houses of Parliament had declared their disapproba-tion.     This situation, however, could only arise if The Queen had initiallyrefused permission;   and,  since it would be liable to seem anomalous in modern circumstances that permission should in fact be withheld, it would clearly be embarrassing to Her Majesty to have to adopt this course.Two alternative courses of action were possible:-(a) The Act of 1772 could be amended.     There was a strong case on merits for altering it since, although its basic purpose was to safeguard the succession, it was so drawn that its provisions applied to manyindividuals who, despite their connections with the Royal Family, werenever likely to succeed to the Throne and were therefore entitled to regardtheir matrimonial affairs as their private concern.     On the other hand, theconcurrence of other member countries of the Commonwealth was required,under the Statute of Westminster, in any amendment of the law touching the succession;  and it was undesirable that these issues should be raised in public, for example in the Canadian Parliament, at an inopportune moment.(b) The Queen could give her consent to the remarriage.     But, sinceshe was Head of the Church as well as Head of the State, she might be exposeto criticism in Church circles if she consented to Lord Harewood&apos;sremarriage, given the circumstances of the divorce.
2P\Of these two courses the latter appeared to be the least disadvantage -ous, provided that The Queen&apos;s position was protected, i. e. provided that sheacted, and was known to act, on the advice of her United Kingdom Ministers.It would therefore seem right that the Government should tender advice toHer Majesty in this sense and that at the appropriate time - i. e. whenLord Harewood sought The Queen&apos;s formal consent to his remarriage afterthe conclusion of the divorce proceedings - they should state publicly thatthey had done so.In discussion there was general agreement with this proposal.    TheCabinet recognised that, in tendering formal advice to the Crown in a matterof this kind, they might be creating a precedent - at least in the sense that,although it had been accepted in the past that The Queen&apos;s consent in mattersof this kind was an act of State (and therefore to be given only on the advice of Ministers), there nevertheless appeared to be no previous occasion onwhich formal advice had in fact been tendered in such circumstances andthere was certainly no occasion on which a Government had publicly statedthat they had so advised the Crown.    On the other hand the circumstancesof the present case were unusual and perhaps unlikely to recur;   and there appeared to be no alternative to proceeding as was proposed.In further discussion it was suggested that consideration should begiven to the possibility of amending the 1772 Act at some opportune moment,provided that it continued to apply to such individuals as were clearly in theline of direct succession.    It was not certain that this would involve the riskof embarrassment in relation to other monarchical countries of theCommonwealth partly because, even if their concurrence was required,this need not necessarily imply that they must themselves enact legislation for this purpose (as distinct from signifying their assent by an executivedecision) and partly because it could be argued that United Kingdom legislation which merely limited the Act to, say, the first six individuals in the line ofsuccession would not in itself affect the succession and that the concurrence of other Commonwealth countries would not therefore be required in any event.     On the other hand Sir Anthony Eden had stated, in reply to a parliamentary Question in 1955, that no amendment of the 1772 Act couldbe undertaken without the concurrence of the other Commonwealth countries;and in the light of this statement there might be a case for examining thequestion further in due course.
The Cabinet -(1)     Took note that at an appropriate moment the PrimeMinister would tender advice to The Queen thatshe should consent to Lord Harewood&apos;s remarriage.(2)    Agreed that it should be made publicly known that, in giving her consent, The Queen had acted on the advice of her United Kingdom Ministers.(3)    Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange forfurther consideration to be given in due course tothe desirability of amending the Royal MarriagesAct, 1772.Cabinet Office, S;W.l.19th January, 1967
