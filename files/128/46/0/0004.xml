He himself intended to give a clear lead forthis purpose i but he would need the full support of the Cabinet,acting in complete unity.There had for some time been a growing tendency for some ministers to act in ways which called in question the collective responsibility of the Cabinet, in so far as they had apparently feltfree, in their personal dealings both with members of the PLP andwith the Press, to dissociate themselves from certain of theGovernments policies and to allow this to be known to outside bodies, particularly the Trade Unions, with whom their colleagues were often conducting difficult and delicate negotiations in the nameof the Government as a whole.    Before a decision was reached on anyitem of Government policy a Minister was entitled to defend h?.s ownpoint of view within the Cabinet as strongly and persuasively as he wished.    But once a decision had been taken the principle of collective responsibility required every member of an administration to endorse it and to defend it to any outside body on any occasion,whether private or public.    This remained true even if theMinister was himself a member of the outside body concerned.There was no objection in principle to Ministers retainingaffiliations of this kind provided that no conflict of interest orallegiance resulted.    But this proviso was especially important in the case of Ministers who were members of the National ExecutiveCommittee of the Labour Party (NEC), where any clash of loyaltieswas liable to be particularly embarrassing.    It had to berecognised that the NECS concept of its relationship to theParliamentary Party had changed since the Labour Party became theGovernment Party,    During the Labour Government of 1945-51 theExecutive would never have sought to enforce a decision of the annual conference of the Party on the Government,    And even in I960,when the Labour Party were in Opposition, the Executive had refused to try to impose the decisions of the conference on the PLP.Now, however, it was seeking to assert a right to withhold support from the Government on issues on which the annual conference hadnot yet expressed a view,
It would be unfortunate if circumstances developed,perhaps later in the year, in which it proved impossible to dealwith this situation except by means of a ruling that no member ofthe Cabinet might offer himself for election to the NEC.    he himself would greatly regret it if he were forced to give such aruling, since the result would be not only to weaken the links between the Government and the NEC but al^o to reduce thelatter to a body which was competent merely to discuss and to protest but not to exercise influence or to accept responsibility.Nevertheless, this situation could be avoided only if ministers themselves recognised and accepted that, where any conflict ofloyalties arose, the principle of the collective responsibility ofthe Government was absolute and over-riding in all circumstances and that, if any Minister felt unable to subscribe to this principle without reservation, it was his duty to resign his office forthwith.He regretted that he had had to reaffirm this doctrine andto emphasise its correct interpretation in relation to membership of the NEC,    But recent events had left him no alternative; and,since NEC membership was not confined to members of theCabinet, he would arrange to draw the attention of all members ofthe Administration to the principle involved.    For this purpose he must formally invite the Cabinet to endorse his statement as the definition of a code of conduct to be observed by all Ministers inrelation to the collective responsibility of the Government.Thereafter it would be necessary to give further consideration tothe best means of improving communication between theGovernment and the PLP and restoring the morale of the Party asa whole.In discussion reference was made to the meeting of theNEC on Wednesday, 26th March, at which the Home secretary had voted for a resolution which was at variance with theGovernments policy on industrial relations, as recently published in the White Paper &quot;In Place of Strife&quot; (Cmnd. 3888).    THE HOMESECRETARY said that in his view there had been only a marginaldifference between the attitude which he had adopted at the NECmeeting and the attitude adopted by the First Secretary of Statewhen she had spoken in defence of the White Paper.    He would askcolleagues to remind themselves of the speeches of the first secretary and her Parliamentary Secretary during the debate onthe White Paper in the House of Commons.    She had clearly said on that occasion that its proposals were a matter for discussionwith the interests affected and might therefore need to be amendedbefore legislation was introduced.    Unless this offer was meaning-less and it was now intended that the Government would not in any circumstances be prepared to modify the proposals in the white paper, there was clearly scope for compromise.    This was allthat he had sought to achieve, bearing in mind the difficultrelationships with the Party and the unions in the summer ahead,F.ven in its original form the resolution before the NEC had been**2 *.
relatively mildly worded.    Moreover, the amendment which hadbeen proposed would have made it milder still in so far as itwould have had the effect that the Executive would not have been committed to oppose &quot;any&quot; of the proposals but would have indicated that they could not endorse &quot;all&quot; of them and would have urged the First secretary of State to give the matter furtherconsideration.    In its final form, it came so near to the purposeof the statement which the Government themselves had made whenthe White Paper was originally published that he could not agreethat there had been any breach of collective responsibility on his part.     But, if a contrary view was taken, he was very ready todiscuss the matter further with the Prime Minister.On the other hand it was recalled that the Cabinet had considered at an earlier stage a suggestion that the governments proposals should be published as a Green Paper or in some other form which would indicate that the controversial proposals inparticular were put forward as a basis for public discussion with-out commitment on the Governments part.    But they had specificallyrejected this suggestion and had decided that the proposals should bepublished as a White Paper, L e. as a definite statement ofGovernment policy which was not negotiable.    Equally, the cabinet had decided that there could be no concession on the three cardinalpoints in these proposals - namely, that an official strike should be preceded by a secret ballot; that an unofficial strike should be preceded by a pause for conciliation; and that this pause should, ifnecessary, be enforced by the sanction of attachment of earnings.And they had ruled that only if alternative suggestions which wouldbe no less effective were produced could there be any question of modifying these proposals.    Certain hypothetical modifications ofthis kind were in fact under consideration; but this did not affectthe fact that those who took part in the meeting of the NEC on26th March were well aware that the issue with which they weredealing was an issue of major policy, on which the governments position had been made clear in the White Paper.     The HomeSecretaryrs intervention at the NEC could therefore be argued tohave been, in effect, a vote against the Governments policy and anattempt to modify that policy from a position outside the Cabinet,As a result the resolution which had finally emerged had inevitablyprejudged to some extent the outcome of the discussions with theinterests concerned which the Government had undertaken to initiate;and the extent of the Governments embarrassment was illustrated by the fact that Trade Union branches in various parts of the country were now writing to certain Ministers deploring the fact that theywere among those who had voted in favour of the White Paper.Moreover, the NFC had seen fit, during the public controversywhich had followed their meeting, to refuse to circulate to thePress certain passages in a statement by a member of the Cabinetin which he had criticised the proceedings.     The whole episodedemonstrated the need for the Prime Minister to reassert his authority in the Cabinet and to require Ministers to accept the discipline necessarily inherent in the concept of collectiveres pons ib ility.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, saidthat, given the Cabinet&apos;s earlier decisions about the basis on whichthe White Paper should be published, it was clear that any minister who had voted in favour of the resolution before the NEC at their meeting on 26th March had committed a breach of the principle of collective Ministerial responsibility.    Nevertheless, he was more concerned with the future than with the past; and, provided that the basic principle was thenceforward observed strictly, he did not propose to take any further action in relation to the NEC meeting.It was open to any Minister to raise any matter within the Cabinet,which would have another opportunity to discuss the issues involvedwhen the relevant legislation on industrial relations came forward for consideration.    Meanwhile Ministers were committed,individually and collectively, to support the Cabinet&apos;s earlier decision as expressed in the White Paper &quot;In Place of Strife&quot;unless and until alternative, and no less acceptable, proposals were put forward.As regards the more general issue the practice ofcanvassing outside support for personal views must thenceforwardcease.    It was possible that he had been too tolerant in this respect in the past; but he must now require the whole Cabinet to reaffirmthe principle of collective Ministerial responsibility in the form inwhich he had stated it and in relation not only to White Papers butalso to Green Papers while they were the subject of public discussion and to any other statements of Government policy.    Hewould take steps to ensure that all members of the Government whowere not members of the Cabinet were informed that they, too,would be expected to comply strictly with this principle thence-forward? and he would give further consideration to the implications of the action of Transport House in refusing to circulate, and therebypurporting to censor, a public statement by a Cabinet Minister.He would use his own discretion in deciding the means bywhich the outcome of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion should be givenappropriate publicity, as was clearly necessary in order to restore the morale of the Labour Party.The Cabinet -(1)    Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;sstatement about the principle of collectiveMinisterial responsibility and of his intention tobring his statement to the notice of all membersof the Administration as a code of conduct to be strictly observed.(2)   Assured the Prime Minister of their full support in any action which he might find it necessary totake in order to deal with any breach of this principle.-4-
(3)    Agrraed that in the exceptional circumstances ofthe case it would be desirable that appropriatepublicity should be given to the outcome of their discussion and took note that the Prime minister himself, in his sole discretion, would make thenecessary arrangements for this purpose.(4)    Agreed that it would be necessary after the easter Recess to consider how best to improvecommunication between the Government on theone hand and the Parliamentary Labour Party,the National Executive Committee and theLabour Party in the country on the other hand.(5)    Reaffirmed their endorsement of the proposals inthe White Paper &quot;In Place of Strife&quot; (Cmnd. 3888),subject to further consideration in the light of any-alternative proposals which might be put forwardbefore the Cabinet had to approve the relevantlegislation.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1.21st April, 1969-5-
