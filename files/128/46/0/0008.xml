DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.__      r m , ^ N \\ qQIt is issued for the personal use of......Stetrrr^^^J-H^ 1TOP SECRET copy No-cabinet confidential annex cc(69) 43rd Conclusions, Minute 3Thursday, 11th September, 1969 at 10. 00 a.zn.THE HOME SECRETARY said that although he was lesspessimistic about the outlook than he had been 24 hours earlier,the situation in Northern Ireland was still extremely tense.   the tension was unlikely to be diminished by fche publication of theCameron Report on the origins of the disturbances of last January,which would take place on the following day.   Arrangements had beenmade for the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh,Cardinal Conway, to receive a copy of the report in advance of publication, and to have the main features of it explained to him.This would go some way towards dissipating the impression the cardinal had formed that we were not taking him fully into our confidence.   Most of the problems raised in the report were beingcovered by the various working parties and commissions which hadbeen set up following the London meeting with the Northern IrelandPrime Minister, Major Chichester-Clark, and his own visit to northern Ireland.    In presenting the report to public opinion,emphasis would be laid on the fact that the disorders had taken placenine months ago, and that since then, action had been initiated on anumber of the grievances which had caused them; but the task of presentation remained a difficult one.   Much of the recent increasein tension v/as due to the activities of the illegal broadcasting stations which had been set up by both sides: for instance the crowdof 3e 000 which had been responsible for the disorders in Belfast on 7th September had been called together by incitements from&quot;Radio Orange&quot;.    It had not been thought advisable to attempt to close the illegal stations down: but it had now been decided thatdespite the various legal and ethical objections to such a course,they must be jammed, and this was now being done, though thejamming was not yet fully effective.    One difficulty was that the frequencies employed by the illegal stations were very close to that used by a station in the Irish Republic, and there was a risk ofprotests from the Government of the Republic if there were interference-1-
with it,   \There was also some ground to suppose that some of the illegal Protestant stations had the support of influential UlsterUnionists, \  The situation would be carefully watched, and the broadcasts monitored.    There was increasing concern in NorthernIreland at a situation in which political tension was leading to a progressive breakdown in the enforcement of law and orders andit was likely that the Northern Ireland Prime Ministers statementof 9th September on the removal of the barricades - of which theHome Secretary had had only an hour*s warning - had been promptedby pressure from the business community rather than from the ulster Unionist fhard-liners*.    When he had seen the NorthernIreland Minister for Commerce, Mr. Bradford, the Home secretary had emphasised the need for closer consultation on pronouncementslike this which caused serious implications for the troops inNorthern Irelands but the Northern Ireland Government had beenunder considerable political pressure to show that they were stillin control of affairs and he did not want to add to their difficulties.Over the past few days he had had a number of contacts with the&quot;HIS IS A COPY. THE ORIGINALRETAINED UNDER SECTION 3 (4)F THE PUBLIC RECORDSThe Home Secretary wouldthat afternoon be receiving a deputation consisting of Mr, Fitt andother influential Roman Catholics, including Father Padraic Murphy,a parish priest from the Falls Road area of Belfast,   He hoped thatthe deputation would come out publicly with a statement urging theremoval of the barricade a f if necessary over a period and ifnecessary under the protection of the Army.    This would do a greatdeal to Improve the atmosphere.   So far as the Northern ireland government was concerned, the Northern Ireland Prime Minister^statement of 9th September had been a gambles but it was satisfactorythat he (and now the Minister of Commerce) had staked his politicalfuture firmly on the continuance of reform.   Major Chichester-Clarkwas still hesitating about the appointment, foreshadowed in the communique issued on 29th August,, of a Minister for community relations, but we were keeping up the pressure on this.   It was difficult to give a firm forecast of progress.    But most of the working parties would have completed their reports by the end of September,lord Huhfs enquiry into the police forces would probably becompleted about 6th October, though he proposed that its resultsshould not be published until he himself visited Northern Ireland afew days later, when he would be in a position to say somethingabout the views and intentions of the British Government,    Thenecessary legislation by the Northern Ireland Parliament might be passed by the end of the year.
There would clearly have to be a debate on Northern Irelandat Westminster when Parliament reassembled.    The most suitable time for this might be after the publication of the various reports andafter his own visit to Ulster.    He had been considering whether, asa long-term measure, it would be possible to relieve the Army of theburden of police duties, for which they were not equipped or trained,by bringing in substantial police contingents from Great Britain.This would require legislation in the United Kingdom Parliament,and one possibility might be for the Northern Ireland debate to beheld on this.    Although it was impossible to forecast the future course of events with any accuracy, it was clear that the whole Irishproblem was once more on the move and that there would be pressure for fundamental changes going far beyond what was at present contemplated.    In these circumstances, it was important to get adialogue going with the Government of the Irish Republic after thereports had been published, he himself had paid a second visit to northern Ireland and a debate had been held at Westminster.    Theattitude of the Prime Minister of the Ir:british Republic, Mr. Lynch,had not been helpful or easy to assess.    Though he had specificallyrenounced the use of force, he had sent troops to the borders and hehad embarked on a v/orld-wide propaganda campaign against theUnited Kingdom and Northern Ireland Governments,    If he reallywanted a united Ireland, he must conciliate Protestant opinion; but so far his tactics had done nothing but alarm it,,    Nevertheless, ifthere were to be any prospect of a final solution, relations betweenthe North and South of Ireland, and between the South and theUnited Kingdom must be lifted to a different plane.    As thingsstood at present this was likely to take a long time.In conclusion, the Home Secretary paid tribute to the mannerin which the Army had discharged an arduous and ungrateful task.He expressed his gratitude for the support he had received from hiscolleagues, and in particular for the help they had given him in theprovision of staff for the various working parties and commissions.He would have to ask for the present provisional arrangements to becontinued for some time to come, and he hoped that his colleagues would bear with him in this; but it would probably be possible to regularise the position after the end of October,THE DEFENCE SECRETARY said that v/ith eight battalions in Northern Ireland and two in reserve, we had reached the limit ofavailability of troops uncommitted to the North Atlantic treaty organisation.    Further reinforcements could of course be madeavailable if need be under the procedures agreed with the supreme allied Commander, Europe; and he fully appreciated the necessityespecially from the point of view of maintaining the confidence of the roman Catholics, of providing whatever forces were required.    he must however give warning that the forces at our disposal v/ere not-3-
inexhaustible.    The calling&quot;in of the arms of the TB* Specials had gone reasonably well in Belfast and Londonderry, but less well inthe country.    The present arrangements might have to be changed;and this might lead to an increase in tension.In discussion general agreement was expressed with theHome Secretary^ analysis of the situation.    The Cabinet agreedthat it might lead to, a considerable slackening in tension if the roman Catholic deputation to be received by the Home Secretary that day could be induced to make a statement on the lines he had proposed.1   While the Army&apos;s image as an impartial authority had beena majorasset in the early atagec, Protestant confidence in the Army&apos;aobjectivity had been shaken by recent events and by misrepresentations-tions in Illegal broadcasts, and there was now a danger of come degree of polarisation, with the Protestants placing their reliance on the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and the Roman Catholicsputting their trust in the Army.    This might lead to distrust andtension between the police and the Army: and the tone of the recentRUC statement on the use by the Army of CS gas In Belfast on 7th September suggested that this might already be happening.    Itwould be useful if the General Officer Commanding, NorthernIreland,- could come to London and give his appreciation of themilltarysituation to the Ministers most closely concerned.    Therewas general approval of the Home SecretaryTs suggestion that though the tension in Northern ireland was not necessarily entirely religious in origin, the Churches were clearly a key factor: and the Cabinet welcomed the efforts whichhad been made to take them into our confidence.   Reporting by thePress and other information media had not always been strictlyobjective, and a watch should be kept on this: in particular, an eyeshould be kept on commercial television in Ulster, which was underUlster Unionist control.   Although the Northern Ireland PrimeMinister and several of his colleagues had committed themselvesfirmly to the cause of reform, the Government was in danger from both left and right, and the possibility could not be excluded of itslosing control of the situation.    In that event the United KingdomGovernment might have to assume direct responsibility.    E this contingency arose, it would be better both, presentationally and politically if the United Kingdom Government were to take over atthe request of the Northern Ireland Government rather than on itsown initiative.   A crisis might arise at very short notice, and thearrangements for the introduction of direct rule should be reviewed and if necessary brought up to date.
colleagues at their next meeting; and he warned the Cabinet thatthey might have to be recalled earlier than was at present contemplated if there were any marked deterioration in thesituation.    The arrangements for transition to direct rule shouldbe re-examined by officials with a view to a discussion in the ministerial Group on Northern Ireland,    Officials should give further consideration to the long-term possibilities to which theHome Secretary had referred and in particular to that of placingrelations with the Irish Republic on a better and more constructivefooting.    They should also examine our diplomatic posture and theinternational implications of fche Northern Ireland situation in termsnot only of fche Irish proposal, to which the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary had referred earlier, for fche inscriptionof fche Northern Ireland situation on the agenda of the forthcoming meeting of the General Assembly of fche United Nations, but in termsof our bilateral relations with Commonwealth and foreign countries.In view of the gravity of the Northern Ireland cituafcion andthe potentially serious consequences, both internal and international, of any indiscretions, members of the Governmentwould have to exercise particular care to avoid making any publicpronouncement which might be exploited to the Governmentsdetriment or tq increase tension.    He would circulate a warning to ministers not in the Cabinet and to junior Ministers on this point.The Cabinet -(1)     Took note of fche statements by fcheHome Secretary and Defence Secretary,and of the points made in discussion,,(2)    Took note which approval of the PrimeMinister^ summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office, S. W.l.12th September,, 1959
