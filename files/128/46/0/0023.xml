cabinet confidential ANNEX.CC(70) 7th Conclusions, Minute 4Thursday, 12th February, 1970, at 10.00 a.m.In the course of the discussion on incomes policy THE PRIME MINISTER invited the Cabinetto consider the wage claims before them not onlyon their individual merits but also in terms of their political implications during a period in which theGovernment must face an approaching General-Election.    If excessive wage settlements provokeda new economic crisis of a kind requiring freshmeasures of restriction or an autumn Budget, theGovernments freedom of electoral manoeuvre couldbe seriously affected;  and this danger would be aggravated if international speculation about the renewal of inflationary pressure in the UnitedKingdom reached a level at which the stability of sterling came under renewed threat.    Laconsidering the current wage claims, therefore,the Cabinet must weigh carefully the implied risk that they might provoke a revival of demand inflation.The risk of cost inflation could be held to be no less serious; and, although the wage claims underconsideration, being confined to the public sector,might be thought to have relatively little relevancein this context, this argument would be nullified inso far as they set a precedent for comparable claims in the private sector.    The economy could not standa dock strike or a seamen&apos;s strike.    But, if this was so.-and if it followed that the Cabinet would have to yield in the face of a threat of such a strike, theyshould avoid, so far as possible, any action inrelation to the public sector which might provokeor aggravate demands for unacceptable wage claims in the private sector.
These considerations had a direct bearing onthe phasing of the wage settlements now in question.If it was indeed the case that further concessions ofthe kind advocated by the responsible ministers might provoke an economic crisis requiring further measures of restriction, it would probably bedesirable, on balance, to try to defer such measures, if possible, until after the GeneralElection.    If the Labour Party were then returnedto power, it would no doubt be distasteful to have tointroduce a policy of restriction immediately thereafter;  but this situation would have to be faced.     If, on the other hand, they lost the Election,they might do so by only a narrow margin; and inthat case the Conservative Party, who would thenconstitute the Government, would have to shoulderthe responsibility for dealing with the potentiallyinflationary problem which they would haveinherited, a problem which they would probablyfind it impossible to resolve consistently with their declared policies in other fields.    In either case theLabour Party might be better placed than if they hadbeen compelled to introduce fresh disinflationary measures before appealing to the country.    On this basis the Cabinet should consider how the phasing offorthcoming wage settlements - particularly asregards the choice of effective dates for their second stages - might contribute most effectively to a process designed to defer for as long aspossible the need to introduce renewed measuresof disinflation.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE exchequer said that there were certain risks in any course ofaction which would merely seek to postpone until after a General Election the action necessary to dealwith the situation which might be created by
excessive wage settlements.    The government might be unable to adhere to the timetable involved;and in that event they might be compelled to appealto the country at a time and in circumstances whichin other respects would be unprbpitious.    Moreover,the economy would be in an increasingly vulnerablecondition during the whole of the period in question;and the Government would be putting at risk theeconomic recovery which they had now achievedafter several years of great difficulty and anxiety.It could be argued to be better for the Labour party that they should lose the next Election but should leave behind them a record of sound management of the economy than that they should put that recordat risk in order to achieve an electoral victory whichmight be no more than marginal.    He could notendorse this course;  and for the reasons whichhe had given earlier in the discussion he wouldjudge it wiser to continue to resist excessive wage claims.    Until recently he had thought it possibleto accept a degree of relaxation of the prices and incomes policy which might result in a 10-12 percent rate of wage increase.    But this had proved to be feasible for only a short period;   and now that claims were running at a 20 per cent rate of increase it must be made apparent that theGovernment were not prepared merely to acquiesce in this tendency but were determined to bring it to a halt before the situation deterioratedstill further.    It was not sufficiently realised that allthe interests now before the Cabinet had already received substantial wage increases during thelast four or five years;  and a more determinedattempt should be made to convince public opinionthat the public sector had neither been unfairlytreated in the matter of wage increases nor been allowed to fall so far behind the
The Cabinet should take particular care toprevent any disclosure of the fact that their discussion had involved, among other things, a reference to the possibility1 of a renewed threat to the strength and stability of sterling.Cabinet Office, S7W7I.12th February, 1970
