HIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE PROPERTY OF HER  BRITANNIC   MAJESTVS   GOVERNMENT9 The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited. &quot; 7 \ 1*It is issued for the personal use of.....^sxrfysme^^ (;&apos; ^&apos;feyTOP secret copy No.....cabinet confidential annex cc(69) 41st conclusions tuesday, 19th August, 1969 at 2.00 p.m.The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (copies of which are available Li the Cabinet Office)reviewing the situation in Northern Ireland and making proposalsfor the handling of the discussions between the Prime Minister andthe Prime Minister of Northern Ireland later than afternoon.THE HOME SECPJ2TARY said that the situation in NorthernIreland had become more grave since the Cabinet last reviewed iton 30th July,    There had been rioting in Belfast on the nights of the2nd and 3rd August, barricades being built and petrol bombsthrown.    The following week had been fairly quiet but he had suggested to the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland that to reducethe risk of further violence, he might consider banning the demonstration planned by the Civil Rights Association on the11th August, the Parade of the (Protestant) Apprentice Boys on the12th and the meeting of the (Catholic) Order of Hibernians on the15th August,    Major Chiehester-Clarks however, had consideredthat it would be impossible to ban one of these occasions withoutbanning them all; he had not expected that the March of theApprentice Boys would itself lead to violence in view of the accommodation which had been reached locally between Catholicsand Protestants and no trouble had been thought likely to result from the meeting of the Order of Hibernians.    The Civil RightsRally on the Monday (11th August) had been disorderly;  on theTuesday, there had been fighting in Londonderry, with theresidents of Bogside determined to keep the Royal ulster constabulary (RUG) out of the area; and after a lull on Wednesday,there had been worse rioting on the Thursday, with tensionmounting in Belfast,    On the Thursday he had met the PrimeMinister at the RAF Station^ St. Mawgan, to discuss the situation,and later that day, with the Prime Minisfcer &apos;o authority s he had agreedto the request of the Northern Ireland Gover&amp;merrfif or troops to be brought in to restore order in Londonderry.    Similar action had later beentaken in regard to Belfast,    Thanks to the efficient pre-planning ofthe Ministry of Defence, the troops had moved in very fast and order-1-
had been rapidly restored in,the limited areas where they could be deployed in force, although there had been some minor incidentselsewhere^   Their arrival had been generally welcomed, inparticular by the Catholics.The question before the Government was what to do next.Opinions differed as to who was responsible for the troubles.There was a good deal of corroboration for the view that theCatholics had acted largely in Gelf-defence, and there was little evidence to support the view of the Northern Ireland Governmentthat the Irish Republican Army (IRA) were mainly responsible?  butthere was no doubt that the dominant feeling in Northern ireland was fearB    The initial impact made by the arrival of British troops could not be expected to last, and it was essential to act urgently to lower the temperature.    He had himself posted a senior official and an Inspector of Constabulary with the General OfficerCommanding (GOC) to advise him on the Governments political objectives and on English police practice; and he had sent the deputy Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis and the chief constable of Hampshire to be liaison officers and consultants withthe RUC and to assess the structural changes that might be needed in that force.These were the aims which he suggested the Prime minister should pursue in his discussions with Major CLichesfcer-Clark.    Hethought that the latter was now a chastened man and that he would be willing to collaborate so far as he felt able.    So long as he was willing to do so, it would be better to avoid direct intervention andTOP SFCRET
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN and commonwealth AFFAIRS said that the Government of the irish republic had been over-anxious to outflank the IRA and the extremistsgenerally.    Their Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Hillery, hadpaid an uninvited visit to London, but had been told ihat we regardedNorthern Ireland as a matter of internal jurisdiction.    Dr. Hilleryhad now&apos;requested a meeting of the Security Council of the united nations, and if normal practice were followed this request would beacceded toa    He had also asked to addrees the Council?.    TheForeign and Commonwealth Secretary did not propose to object tohis doing so, but he thought there was a good chance that the Irishwould fail to muster the votes necessary fcr the item to be includedon the agenda; that would be a satisfactory outcome.    He wasinstructing our Ambassador in Dublin to remind the Governmentof the Irish Republic of their responsibility for curbing die activitiesof rhe IRA in Northern Ireland.    The Prime Minister of NorthernIreland should also be reminded that foreign relations were theresponsibility of the United Kingdom Government! a break withthe Irish Republic would be most damaging, in the short run more damaging to us than tc the Republic.    Bu; in h?.s view the issues were mainly domestic, and their international significance, thoughimportant should not be exaggerated.    He agreed with theimmediate steps proposed by the Home Secretary and on the needfor immediate results (particularly in regard to the *B* Specials)to be seen to flow from that eveningts meeting.    For the future hewould prefer to work through the Northern Ireland Governmentand thought that the proposal to influence them through senior civilservants stationed in Belfast was workable,,    But if they would not co-operate the Government would have no alternative but to assumedirect control.In discussion there was general agreement that theimmediate need was to contain the situation and that for this purpose the steps proposed by the Home Secretary were the right ones;there would be no advantage in recalling Parliament.    The first priority was to persuade the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland toaccept the withdrawal of the Specials from the streets and their effective disarming.    Subject to this, it would be desirable to leavethe Ministers conducting the discussions with the Northern ireland government the widest possible discretion to play the hand as they thought best.    The replacement of the Inspector-General of theRUC was also highly desirable, because withdrawal of the troopsdepended on the reconstitution of that force, but most members ofthe Cabinet thought that the talks should not be allowed to break down on this point.    There was also agreement on the urgent need forresults to be seen to flow from that evening&apos;s talks.    They should aim at the publication of a communique laying down basic principles and setting out the immediate decisions.    This should make clearthat the border was not in issue and that the problem lay wholly
He agreed that they should aim to retain the Northern ireland government as an effective force, for in that way they stood morechance of being able to withdraw the troops., Fjinanyf1hje;. wished to support the: proposal made by the NorthernQ Ireland^Moyer^^ the GOC, for fche blockingr* pfjsome minor roads crossing the &quot;&quot;border by cratering or other means; this would make it more difficult for the IRA to smuggle-riarms,in and generally^exploit the situation.1 HE PuBuC KfcCOff)S Afrr Sto use the Northern Ireland Government as agentsj he would proposeto place senior civil servants in the Prime Ministers Office and theMinistry of Home Affaire as a means   of bringing influence to bear.It was important to remember that the majority of the population ofNorthern Ireland were Protestant; in seeking to allay theapprehensions of the Catholics, they must not drive that majoritybeyond endurance.    He thought that in the circumstancesMajor Chichester-Clark would feel able to accept the withdrawalof the Specials and arrangements for their arms to be kept inarmouries.    Reactions-to the proposals for an enquiry and for achange in the Inspector-General were difficult to forecast; there might be resignations at the top, but he thought that some middle-rank officers would welcome a change in the ethos of the force.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said thatthe deployment of troops had gone smoothly, and they had been welcomed by both sidesj but there were already signs that thehoneymoon period was ending.    There would shortly be two brigades in Northern Ireland.    Further units could be madeavailable if needed, without affecting our North Atlantic treaty organisation (NATO) commitment, and this force should be adequate for its present role; but it would be quite inadequate to cope witha major emergency, such as would arise if the Protestant majoritywere stung into armed opposition.    In that event, it would benecessary to draw on forces assigned to NATO.    He was inagreement with the Home Secretary on the need to act urgently tomake the situation less explosive; but at the same time, he wishedto stress the importance of not pushing too hard and so alienatingProtestant opinion.    It was important to remove the tBt Specialsfrom Catholic and mixed areas - if possible this should be announcedtonight - and to withdraw their weapons into armouries where theycould be kept under control, and would not constitute a temptation to the IRA and other subversives.    The GOC would then be able toconsider what further troops he needed to maintain law and order;he was aiming at a light coverage of the whole country by mobiletroops.    The arrangement whereby the troops had been introduced at the request of the Northern Ireland Government and the continuing close contacts between the GOC, the Northern ireland government and the Home Secretary^ representatives ensuredcivil control over the disposition of the troops.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that he had thought it right that the Cabinet should have the opportunity to consider the situation despite the authority which had been delegated to him. They were agreed that the first need was to contain the position and that for this purpose the steps proposed by the Home Secretary were appropriate. They were also agreed that the withdrawal and effective disarming of the Specials were essential and he would make it his prime purpose in his talk with the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland to secure his agreement to this. For the rest the Cabinet were content that he should reach the best settlement that he could on the lines which they had discussed; agreement to the blocking of roads might be an element in such a settlement, but he would not take the initiative in proposing it. He proposed to start the talks that evening with a general discussion, and then work towards an agreed communique which would declare that the border was not an issue and that the disturbances were entirely an internal affair within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom Government; explain the basis on which troops had been brought in; and refer to the programme of reforms to which the Northern Ireland Government were committed; this should be accompanied by a declaration setting out the principles which would guide the policies and the mutual relationship of the two Governments. The Prime Minister of Northern Ireland would be supported by a number of Ministers at the talks, and he therefore proposed that the Foreign and Commonwealth and Defence Secretaries should be present in addition to the Home Secretary. Assuming that the talks were successful, it would probably be appropriate to have a second round of talks in about a fortnight&apos;s time at which longer term arrangements could be discussed. If however the talks came to no satisfactory conclusion, it would be necessary for the Cabinet to resume their discussion as soon as possible and he asked those present to hold themselves available. He would consider further in consultation with the Ministers most concerned how security intelligence might be improved. Finally he wished to emphasise the importance of ensuring that no hint of their discussions reached the Press which could be exploited by the Opposition or others to suggest that there was any disagreement in the Cabinet; the lives of our troops were at stake.
