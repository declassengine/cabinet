NO CIRCULATION RECORDfrr OFI INTO THEPEANlMIC[ilNITY ONPITEDJOMNCE OFIntsCC(67) 25th Conclusions(Sunday, 30th April, 1967   -   10.30 a.m.)This note records a part of the discussion by the Cabinet,which is not included in the circulated record, of the note by theSecretary of the Cabinet (C(67) 61) on the effects of entry intothe European Economic Community (e.c.) on the United kingdom balance of payments.It was argued that it was a major premise of thememorandum before the Cabinet that we should not enter the eec unless our economy was fully competitive, with a relatively good level of efficiency - wages and a surplus on thebalance of payments sufficient to enable us to take the strainsof entry.    But we were still some way from such a condition;  andif we were to enter in any weaker state, the consequences wouldbe grave.    In furtherance of our existing balance of paymentsobjectives, it had already been necessary first to arrest, and nowto continue to restrain, the rate of growth of the economy;  tomaintain an undesirably high level of unemployment;  and to curtaildesirable social expenditure.    If we were to enter the e.c., thesubstantially adverse effects on our balance of payments would add to these present difficulties.    It would not be acceptable,however, to meet this additional burden simply by intensifyingpresent deflationary policies with their unpalatable economicand social consequences;  and it would therefore be necessary toconsider major policy changes.    There were two mainpossibilities - first, a major change in foreign policy whichwould permit cuts in defence expenditure overseas greater thanthose now in contemplation (a course which would be entirelyconsistent with entry into the e.c.);   second, a change in theparity of sterling.    In particular, without some degree of devaluation we were unlikely to secure the further shift of resources into exports and import substitution, over and above that necessary to resolve our present difficulties, which wouldbe required to mitigate the adverse effects of entry on the balanceof payments.    But a decision to devalue sterling could bediscussed only by a very small number of Ministers;   and boththe discussion and the decision would have not only to remainsecret but, if necessary, to be denied until the decision had been announced.    It was therefore right that there should be some discussion of devaluation before any decision was taken whichmight, as a consequence, lead to circumstances in whichdevaluation could not be ruled out.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the points which hadbeen raised were relevant in the present context.    Nevertheless,the Cabinet would appreciate that there were great dangers inany discussion of a change in the parity, as was shown by theexperiences of last July when a grave run on sterling had resulted from a popular belief that the Government had an adjustment of the parity under consideration.    It must always be open to any Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider
devaluation at the proper time and in full secrecy.    In the context of entry to the Community, however, there would probablybe strong resistance in France to a British devaluation.    Duringthe visit which he and the Foreign Secretary had recently paid to paris M. Pompidou had disclaimed the sentiments attributed tohim last July and had specifically stated that we had been rightnot to devalue at that time.     Whilst devaluation remained an option which was open to us, it was not a pne-way option;  itcould have economic consequences no less unpleasant than thoseof deflation.    The Cabinet might wish to discuss the subjectfurther from this point of view.    But it would be imperative thatany such discussion should remain strictly secret and should notbe imparted to any other individual, whether Ministerial, officialor advisory.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said he agreedthat it was right that he should give the Cabinet his views on thisquestion in the strictest secrecy.    He was bound to say at the outset that devaluation was not an option which was open to him personally - he had given too many pledges to holders of sterlingfor that.    Nevertheless, it must be recognised that devaluationremained both an option open to us and a course which might be forced upon us.    It would, however, present us with fundamentaldifficulties, of which the most important was the problem ofchoosing the right rate to which to devalue.    Too small adevaluation would lead to the expectation of further similar measures and so to renewed speculation.    It would also conferno sufficient advantage, e.g. in terms of import deterrents and export incentives.    On the other hand, too great a devaluationwould invite other countries to follow our lead not only in orderto stay on comparatively favourable competitive terms with usbut perhaps also in certain cases for retaliatory reasons stemmingfrom ulterior motives in the international monetary field - theFrench hostility to the dollar as the main reserve currency wasa case in point.    The choice of rate would therefore be a verydelicate one.    If we chose the right rate, our import prices would not rise to the full extent of the devaluation, because someof our sterling area suppliers, for example, would devaluepari passu with us.    Nor would our export prices fall in real terms by the full extent of the change in parity, because someof our exporters would take the opportunity to increase theirprofit margins whilst maintaining or increasing their volumeof sales.    In general, however, it could be assumed that, whiledevaluation would cause substantial short-term damage to thebalance of payments, its long-term impact should be much morethan offset by the expansion of exports and the contraction ofimports which it should stimulate.    A final assessment of thetotal effect, however, was very difficult to frame because of theproblems of quantification which had been underlined in anothercontext during the present discussions.     Nevertheless, a tentative analysis of the overall effects had been made in thelight of the experience of the French devaluations of 1957 and1959, on the basis of the most favourable assumptions whichcould be made as to the choice of rate and other factors.    Onthat basis the best estimate was that in the first year after a
&quot;SOdevaluation we could reasonably aim at an improvement of atleast  300 million in our balance of payments.    This, with thefurther improvements which might be expected in later years,should offset any damage to our balance of payments which might result from our entry into the Community.    At the same time,since the initial damage to the balance of payments that wouldbe caused by devaluation was also put at about  300 million,the total shift of resources that would be required in the first year would be some  600 million.    Part of this diversion of resources would be achieved by the deflationary effect of higherimport prices, which would, of course, entail a higher cost ofliving.    But it would also be necessary to impose additionaltaxes to the extent required to ensure that sufficient resources were available to meet the improvement in our exports whichthe devaluation would make possible.    The amount of this additional taxation was put at about  400 million.    these calculations assumed that we should maintain a rate ofunemployment of the order of 1. 8 per cent, i. e. somewhat lessthan we now had.    In short, we should need to divert at least 600 million of resources from domestic use to exports;  and additional taxation of perhaps  400 million would have to beraised in the first year.    The resulting austerities would therefore be additional to those which we were suffering at present.It was also necessary to take into account the externaleffects of devaluation.    First, there would be the effects ofimitation of, and retaliation against, our devaluation of whichhe had already spoken.    There would also be a loss of confidenceby the holders of sterling, who would inevitably draw down theirbalances if we devalued.    There would be a further reactionupon confidence in the dollar, opening up the possibility of aflight into gold and a consequential reduction in world liquidity,which in turn would react upon our export markets.    The deviceof a floating rate which had been put forward as a way out ofthese difficulties was not a solution.    It would not be attractive to holders of sterling, who would be bound to take the view thatwe had allowed the rate to float in order that it should floatdownwards rather than upwards;  and this assumption would create the conditions in which the rate would be bound to fallprogressively.    In sum the external consequences might well lead to a return of those disorders in world trade and payments which the International Monetary Fund had been established to counter;  and they would inevitably result in a period ofconsiderable confusion before international stability was eventually restored.The alternative was to follow a policy designed to overcome the internal disabilities from which our economy hadbeen suffering.    We were now set on this course, which wouldnot be easy to follow but would nevertheless be within our capacity, as recent discussions had confirmed.    It followed that, whilst a theoretical case could be constructed in favourof devaluation at the point when we entered the e.c., it wouldunleash such powerful adverse forces beyond our control andwould involve a breach of so many pledges which he had givento holders of sterling that he could not remain Chancellor of theExchequer if this course were adopted.
In discussion it was asked why, if the consequences of devaluation would be so unfavourable for us, the French appearedto have benefited from it.    In reply it was pointed out that theFrench (who had had to devalue twice) had had no problem of francbalances on the scale of the sterling balances.    Moreover, theirdevaluations had been accompanied by price increases and compulsory wage stabilisation (estimated to have produced an per cent reduction in real wages), which had been made possibleonly by the personal authority of General de Gaulle and the weakness of the French Parliament.    It did not seem politicallyfeasible that, e.g. Part IV of the Prices and Incomes Act, shouldbe reintroduced and reinforced not only in order to hold downincomes but also to effect a substantial reduction in them.It was also asked whether the improvement in the balanceof payments which devaluation might be expected to secure in, say,the third year would not offset the disadvantages which it was estimated would be caused in the first year.    In reply it was stated that it was not possible to make an effective quantificationof these advantages because of the uncertainties of assumptions about such factors as the elasticity of demand for exports and imports.    In the third year the balance of payments should certainly show an improvement; but to reach that point theGovernment would first have to survive the initial impact.In further discussion, it was suggested that devaluationwas irrelevant to consideration of our entry into the e.c., since its effects would be concentrated in the short term, whereas the adverse consequences of entry, particularly as regards acceptanceof the common agricultural policy would involve a long-termworsening of the terms of trade and a reduction in the standardof living.    These long-term effects could not be altered bydevaluation.    On the other hand it was urged that the adverseconsequences of entry might well create conditions wheredevaluation was forced upon us;  and it was therefore right toconsider whether we should forestall this situation by devaluationbefore entry.    If we entered the Community without devaluingand subsequently found that we had miscalculated, we might notbe allowed, as members of the Community, to devalue ourcurrency.    But in that event the only alternative would be severedeflation, which in turn would offset the advantages of economicelan which it was claimed we might secure as a consequence of entry, but only if we were to enter very quickly.    As against this, however, it was wrong to interpret the analysis which hadbeen put before the Cabinet as representing devaluation anddeflation as alternatives.    Devaluation itself would require tobe reinforced by sharp deflation.    In the context of the time-scale of entry to the e.c. the additional shift of resourcesrequired to offset the extra strain which entry might place onthe balance of payments amounted to no more than -j of 1 per cent of the estimated annual growth rate, starting in about 1970, and thereafter making itself felt only gradually over a transitional period of five years or more, so that the full strain would notbe felt until 1975 or later.    Meantime, we should have had theopportunity, as full members of the Community, to influence the critical decisions of the e.c. on such relevant matters as the
common agricultural policy and the harmonisation of economic policies.    Moreover, the savings on defence and foreign policywhich were likely to emerge from the forthcoming decisions onthe Defence Review should produce substantial savings inforeign exchange by 1975.    We should also have discharged ourremaining debts to the IMF by 1970.    Further, only free access to the larger market of the e.c. would give British industry thenecessary stimulus for investment and growth, the effects ofwhich would be an increasing force in our favour in the years1970-75.THE PRIME MINISTER summing up this part of thediscussion, said it had been right to consider the issue of devaluation in the context of the approach to Europe.    Devaluationmust always be one of the options open to the Government, whetherthey entered the e.c. or not;  and it was always permissible forthe Chancellor of the Exchequer to raise this issue in theappropriate way at the right time.    There were, however,extremely powerful objections, as outlined by the Chancellorof the Exchequer and in discussion, to devaluation as a way outof our present and prospective difficulties.    It was of thehighest importance, therefore, that no hint should be givenoutside the Cabinet that the question of devaluation had beenunder discussion;   if any disclosure were made, the consequencescould be extremely grave.    The Cabinet should now resume themain theme of their discussion of C(67) 61.Cabinet Office, S. W.l.30th May, 1967
