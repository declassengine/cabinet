cabinet confidential annex cc(67) 46th Conclusions, Minute 1 (Part)Tuesday,^Uth July, 1967 at 10. 00 a. m.*        THE COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that there hadbeen a grave incident on the border of Hong Kong the previous day.    In a village v/hich spanned the frontier between Hong kong and China, several hundred demonstrators had attacked the hong Kong police station and there had been firing across the border.    Five policemen had been killed (four of them before they themselves had been given authority to open fire) and elevenpolicemen had been wounded.    British troops had been brought up but the demonstrators had dispersed and it had not been necessary for the troops to open fire.    There was no evidencethat the Army of the Peoplers Republic of China had been involved,nor the Chinese Government, but Chinese newspapers admitted that the Chinese militia had been used and further inflammatorypropaganda was being issued in Peking in respect of our positionin Hong Kong.    There had subsequently been further attacks onthe police in which two policemen had been killed and, ifdisorders continued on this scale, it would not be possible for thepolice to maintain order indefinitely.    It would be provocativeif troops were used to maintain order, but this might become inevitable.    It must, however, be recognised that this might lead to still further exacerbation of the situation and that ourposition would quickly become untenable if the ChineseGovernment were determined to evict us from the Colony.In discussion concern was expressed by the Cabinet atthe gravity of the situation and at the risk to our position in hong Kong,    There was general agreement that the reportcurrently being prepared by officials on the action which weshould take if it became impossible to maintain our position in hong Kong should be completed and circulated to Ministers asa matter of urgency.    It was also suggested that there would be advantage in setting up a Committee of the Ministers primarily concerned to keep the situation under constant review and toagree on any action which might be necessary in an emergency.It was also suggested that the present division of departmental responsibility between the Foreign and CommonwealthSecretaries in respect of our interests in China, on the one hand,and Hong Kong, on the other, might complicate reaching agreement on policy and the taking of action, particularly where decisions were urgently required.Copy No.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of thediscussion, said that the report by officials should be circulated to Ministers as quickly as possible,,    He would consider what arrangements should be made to enable theMinisters primarily concerned to keep the situation under constant review and to take immediate decisions as events might require.The Cabinet -Took note that the Prime Minister would consider what action should be taken to facilitate collectiveMinisterial consideration of the situation in HongKong and in particular to consider urgently thereport now being prepared by officials on theaction which should be taken if our position in hong Kong became untenable.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1.11th July, 1967
