ISCABINETCONFIDENTIAL ANNEX  -CC(66) 32nd Conclusions, Minute tuesday, 28th June, 1966 at 10. 30 a. ra.REFORM OF The Cabinet considered a riemoranduin by theTHE HOUSE Lord Chancellor and the Lord Privy Seal (C(66) 87) on theOF LORDS reform of the House of Lords.THE LORD CHANCELLOR recalled that the Governmenthad undertaken in their Election Manifesto to introduce legislation to safeguard measures approved by the House ofCommons from delay or defeat in the House of Lords.     Itwould be important to consider the content and timing of this legislation early in the lifetime of the Parliament;  and aforthcoming debate in the House of Lords on a Motion byLord Alport for the appointment of a Select Committee toconsider how, by changes in its procedures or by other means within its pov/ers, the House of Lords could make a more substantial contribution to the efficient working of parliamentary government,would afford an occasion for a debate which mightrange over wider issues on which it was desirable that theGovernment spokesman in the House of Lords should be aware of the Cabinet&apos;s views. ^The major issues were those of the powers of the Houseof Lords and its composition.    The House of Lords had power,not subject to the Parliament Act, to decline to approve an order or Ste.tutory Instrument subject to affirmative procedure, or todisapprove one subject to negative procedure, and power underthe Parliament Act to delay the passage of Bills for one Session.A Bill rejected by the House of Lords could be passed under theAct if the identical Biil was reintroduced in the following session, but at least a year must elapse between the SecondReading of the first Bill in the House of Commons and thepassing by that House of the Second Bill.     These powers couldbe use a to*e*tBE*SII Government policy in the latter years of a parliament; and the Governments freedom to manage public business might also be jeopardised as a result of the absenceof firm rules of procedure and of any means of controllingback-bench and cross-bench peers.     It was proposed that aBill should be introduced in the 1967-68 Session to provide that delegated legislation should be subject to affirmative ornegative procedure only in the House of Commons; that aGovernment Bill might on a resolution of the House of Commonsreceive Royal Assent three months after it had been sent to theHouse of Lords, with such Lords&apos; amendments as the House ofCommons might accept;  that Bills introduced in the House ofLords should be passed within three months;   and that Commons-1-The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use ol..^*v^..4dTOP SECRET 1 copy No.......J-..Q
amendments should not be subject to the agreement of theHouse of Lords.    Once the powers of the House of Lordswere reduced, the problem of its composition became easier.A possible course would be to adopt a system of voting writswhich would enable any peer to attend and speak, but only those holding voting writs to vote.     The writs might be issued to all peers of first creation and life peers, and possibly tosome outstanding hereditary peers.    This would give theGovernment a good chance of securing a majority in divisions in normal circumstances, though not in all divisions.     Therewere, however, alternative possibilities which should be examined.    It would be convenient to remit to a CabinetCommittee for consideration the problems of the composition of the House and related matters, including how far proposals could be implemented by amendments in the Standing orders of the House and the question of the timing of legislation.In discussion it was generally agreed that legislation should be introduced to deprive the House of Lords of its power to frustrate subordinate legislation and to delay Bills.As to its timing, it was pointed out that there was a good prospect that the Opposition in the House of Lords would co-operate in securing the passage of the Government Billsrequired before the Summer Recess, and it was not certainthat the House would reject or substantially amend the Ironand Steel Bill and the Land Commission Bill;  but this connection-operation might be prejudiced if it were known that theGovernment intended to introduce legislation to curtail thepowers of the House in the 1967-6G Session.    If the House ofLords attempted to impede the passage of the Iron and Steelor Land Commission Bills, the Government should immediatelyannounce its intention to legislate to reduce their pov/ers;  ifthey did not, however, it was arguable that it would not benecessary to legislate in the 1967-68 Session, when therewould be considerable pressure on the Parliamentary timetable.On the other hand, it might be desirable to legislate early inthe Parliament as a means of demonstrating the governments intention to carry through radical reforms and of avoiding thepossibility of embarrassment if, towards the end of the parliament, the Government found it necessary to introduceurgent and unpopular economic measures which the House ofLords might see advantage in rejecting.    A Cabinet Committeeshould therefore consider the details of legislation on thepowers of the House of Lords and arrange for a Bill to be madeready.    The timing of its introduction should be considered inthe light of the progress made with the current Session&apos;clegislation, and in the meantime no indication of theGovernments intentions should be given.On the question of the composition of the House ofLords, it was suggested that consideration of the composition of the House could not be divorced from that of its powers.The Labour Party had a.dhered in principle to a bi-cameralsystem of government, and it was arguable that, if a SecondCham-ber was to be retained, it could not continue to be basedon hereditary membership, but should be reformed on a basis-2-
appropriate to its modern functions.     On the other hand, itwas argued that, once the powers of the House of Lc   &apos;.a werecurtailed, the controversial question of its compo:.&apos;. jn wouldbecome less important, and on balance it seemed preferable not to reopen discussion of it.The Cabinet then considered the attitude which theGovernment spokesman should adopt in the debate on lord Alport&apos;s Motion.    It was suggested that a SelectCommittee, which might be composed of four Labour, fourConservative, one Liberal and three cross-bench peers,might well have a majority of menbers interested in reform and might be persuaded to make recommendations for the &apos;voluntary reform of the House of Lords, not only in mattersof procedure, but also of composition and even of powers.It was arguable that it v/as within the competence of the Houseof Lords to determine its own composition by Resolution, andif it was willing to reform itself on these points it would be embarrassing for the Government to appear to be opposed toits doing so.     On the other hand, viiile there was no objectionto a Select Committe to consider procedure, constitutional changes going beyond this were properly a matter for bothHouses of Parliament.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion,said that the Cabinet were agreed that legislation should beintroduced at a convenient juncture to curtail the powers of theHouse of Lords on the lines proposed in C(66) 87.     They were disposed to think that the legislation should be undertaken in the1967-68 Session, but further consideration should be given toits timing in the light of the manner in which the House of Lordsdealt with important Government measures in the present session.    In the meantime no indication should be given thatthe Government were contemplating the introduction of a Billin the 1967-68 Session.    He would arrange for the appoint -ment of a Committee of Ministers to draw up detailed proposalsfor a Bill, and to arrange for it to be held in readiness.    TheCabinet considered, on balance, that the controversial questionof the composition of the House of Lords should not be reopenedin this connection.     In the forthcoming debate on Lord Alport&apos;motion, the Government spokesman should offer no objectionto the appointment of a Select Committee on Procedure, but,if the question of powers were raised, he should confinehimself to a statement of the policy to which the Governmentwere already pledged of introducing legislation to ensure that measures approved by the House of Commons were not delayedor defeated in the House of Lords.    He should, if necessary,indicate the Government^ view that the composition of theHouse of Lords was a constitutional matter which should notbe dealt with by that House alone.-3-
The Cabinet -(1)    Agreed that legislation should be introduced a.ta convenient time to abolish the powers of theHouse of Lords to prevent or delay legislationbut not to alter the composition of the House.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister, would arrangefor the constitution of a Committee of ministers to consider the details of the legislation.(3)    Invited the Lord Privy Seal to be guided, in replying to the debate on Lord Alport&apos;motion, by the Prime Minister&apos;s summing upy&apos; (4)    Agreed to consider the timing of the introductionof the proposed Bill in the light of the progress made with Government legislation in the current session,Cabinet Office, S.
