Conditions in the foreign exchangemarkets were still uncertain though the reaction in the lasttwenty-four hours had been rather better than might have been expected.    He was most grateful to his colleagues for their readiness to endorse in his absence the domestic economic measures which he had announced on 22nd November without which the pressure on sterling might have been very severe.In the light of the discussions in the Group of Ten at Bonn theFrench Governments decision to maintain the external valueof the franc was a surprising one.    The French finance minister had reserved his Governments position at theconference;  and there was no question of the $2 billion inter-national credit being tied to a devaluation of the franc, whichthe American and German Governments had wanted to avoid.Nevertheless the conference had spent a good deal of timediscussing the precise  amount by which the franc could bedevalued without unduly disturbing the international monetarysituation; and the view put forward by the Managing Directorof the International Monetary Fund that a devaluation of11. 11 per cent would be tolerable had been generally accepted.We would have liked the Germans to revalue the mark, thoughit must be recognised that this would have brought great profitto the speculators who had caused the crisis.    When it became clear that they were not prepared to revalue we had pressed themhard, though unsuccessfully, to make further changes in theirborder taxes.     The final outcome would have a mixed effecton sterling.     A devaluation of the franc of around 10 per cent would have cost us about  80 million on the balance of payments which we should not now have to meet: but to the extent thatdoubts remained about the stability of the current paritiessterling would still be subject to pressure.    It was there for every much to our interest that the decisions taken by the Frenchand German Governments in the previous week should bemaintained.     In the longer term it would be desirable to importgreater flexibility into the international monetary system.    Itwas, however, hard to see how an international conference couldbe arranged to consider long-term monetary problems untilthe new United States Administration was installed;  and aBritish initiative to this end might well be counter-productive.He intended, however, to consult closely on these matters withthe new Secretary to the United States Treasury when he wasappointed.-1.TOP SECRET
The following points were made in discussion -(a) The German Government had been warned through theirAmbassador in London that if as a result of their failure to revaluethe mark the Bonn conference failed and we were forced to allowsterling to float, we should not be able to meet the resultingincrease in the sterling cost of maintaining troops in Germany.It must however be recognised that a revaulation of the markwould have led to a similar increase and it was important thatthe line we took with the German Government in monetary matters should be consistent with our attitude in NATO.      Similarly weshould consider whether there was scope for closer co-operationwith Europe on monetary matters to complement our efforts tostrengthen co-operation on defence and foreign policy.(b) The international monetary situation was likely to remainuncertain for several months.     It might be useful to arrangeregular meetings of the Group of Ten to supplement the monthlymeetings of the central bankers at Basle,     The timing and presentation of any such meetings would, however, need to beconsidered carefully in order to avoid provoking further specula -tion in the foreign exchange markets.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1.26th November, 1968
