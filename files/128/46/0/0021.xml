MR. REIDThis record can be filed in the MCR series witha brief note to the effect that -&quot;At their meeting on 13th October, 1966(CC(66) 5 0th Conclusions) the cabinet considered the possibility of using force tobring to an end the rebellion in Rhodesia.     no reference to this discussion is made in theCabinet Minutes of that meeting;  but the following is a record of what was actually said and decided. &quot;r&apos;31st October, 1966
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said thatthe Rhodesian Army numbered 10, 000 men, formed in tenbattalions, together with a Special Air Service Regiment and anArtillery Regiment; all were well equipped with modern weapons,There was an armed police force of 12,000.    The Rhodesian AirForce comprised three squadrons of modern ground attack aircraft and one squadron of Canberra light bombers.     The morale of theforces was good.    Some very senior officers were opposed to the illegal regime but would not attempt to use-, force against it.    Therest supported the Rhodesia Front and their backing for the regimehad become firmer during recent months.     The former ArmyCommander considered that they would fight hard to defendRhodesia.For any British operation there would be no main basenearer than Aden; and forward mounting bases in Nairobi, Lusaka,Blantyre or from carriers off Beira would be at great distancesfrom Rhodesia.    For supplies by sea the nearest port atDar-es -Salaam was 1, 000 miles from Rhodesia and the road and rail facilities between them were inadequate.    We should requirefull facilities from neighbouring countries, Zambia, Kenya,Tanzania and Malawi, as well as overflying rights over Mozambique.A further condition was that South Africa would not intervene.The operation would require five brigades with artillery support.These forces could be made available only if heavy withdrawalswere made from Germany.    By mobilising all available air transport and requisitioning shipping three brigades could bepositioned in ten weeks and five brigades in three months.    this long preparatory period would give time for political pressure tobuild up in the United Kingdom and might provoke South Africanintervention.    It would be impossible to achieve surprise.Although the risk of pre-emptive action by the Rhodesian Air force was not high, it seemed highly probable that power supplies fromKariba to Zambia would be cut off.      For our own operation a pre- -emptive air strike would be necessary on all Rhodesian airfields and at some, such as Salisbury, there would certainly be civilian casualties.     The campaign itself might well be short;  but thereafterwe should be committed to occupying the country, with a bitterlyhostile European population and with no Africans capable of running the country.     We might well find that we should soon be under thesame pressure as were now operating against the illegal regime,i. e. to hand over to African rule before the Africans were qualified to exercise it.In discussion there was general agreement that an operation on the lines described by the Secretary of State for Defence was impracticable and that it would be wrong to threaten the use of force as a means of impressing public opinion in Rhodesia.    It wassuggested that we might consider more limited types of operation insupport of the policy of mandatory sanctions;  these sanctions mightwell prove ineffective and we should be under increasing pressure to agree to some further action.     It was confirmed that certainpossibilities in this connection were under consideration; but evena blockade of Mozambique, let alone of Southern Africa as a whole,would require very considerable forces.-1-
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion,said that in view of the statement by the Secretary of State for defence the use of force to defeat the illegal regime was clearly impracticable and we should therefore not use the threat of force against Rhodesia.     But it might be impressed on the regime in Salisbury that, if our terms for a settlement were rejected, we should have to withdraw the protection which wehad hitherto afforded Rhodesia in the United Nations;  and we might add, without spelling out the consequences in detail,that, if mandatory sanctions were imposed and enforcementaction was taken in support of them, there could be no tellingwhere this road would lead.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval,  of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1. ,13th October, 1966.-2-
