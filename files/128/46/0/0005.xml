THIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE PROPERTY OF HER  BRITANNIC  MAJESTYS   GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of Isev^^L^....^.^^ sTOP secret copy No..XCABINETCONFIDENTIAL annex cc(69) 22nd Conclusions, Minute 1Thursday. 8th May, 1969 at 11. 00 a.m.THE PRIME MINISTER said that on the previous day the3RNMENT      Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP),THE Mr. Houghton, had made a prepared statement warning theLIAMENTARYGovernment that they should not press their proposed IndustrialOUR PARTY  Relations Bill in the face of the opposition of their own back-benchers to the point of risking the disintegration of the LabourParty.    This statement raised an important issue which hadconstitutional implications comparable with those which had been involved when Mr. Harold Laski, then Chairman of the LabourParty, had presented a similar challenge to the Prime minister of the 1945-51 Labour Government, Mr. Attlee.    It implied eitherI that the Government must accept that they could not. carry on theI government of the country and must face a Dissolution ofI Parliament or that, if they continued to govern, they must do soII on sufferance and in the knowledge that there were certain policiesI                  which they must not pursue, however necessary in the country^interests they might consider them to be.    If the government accepted such a situation at the dictation of the PLP, they wouldbe acquiescing in a dangerous precedent, which might be invokedagainst them on subsequent and equally critical occasions; andthey would be demonstrating the truth of their opponents1 claim that Labour government did not work and could not v/ork in anyforeseeable future circumstances.    The Cabinet themselves mustbe clear where they stood on this issue.THE HOME SECRETARY said that the issues of principleraised by the proposed Industrial Relations Bill had strained the loyalty of the PLP and of some Ministers to breaking point.    TheCabinet were not in fact in unanimous agreement on the Bill; andit could not be expected to achieve more than a bare majority inthe House of Commons, even if all members of the Governmentvoted in its favour? and that was an issue which they would need to consider when the Bill was available for discussion.    he himself did not believe that the benefits which it was claimed would-1-
result from the Bill were worth the destruction of the LabourPartyj and he would do all in his power to prevent a Dissolutionon an issue which was of such little real significance.    he therefore strongly urged the Cabinet to consider how they couldwithdraw from the brink of disaster; in particular, they should realise that they could not enact the Bill in its present form andthey should therefore refrain from publishing it before theConference of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) on 5th June,Otherwise, they would inevitably destroy any possibility that the tuc might bring forward alternative proposals which would afford a way out of the impasse.In discussion it was argued that, although Mr, Houghtonhad been at fault in issuing his warning as Chairman of the PLP,particularly on the eve of the local government elections inEngland and Wales, he had not in fact raised a strictlyconstitutional issue, unlike Mr, La ski who had addressed theGovernment of the day from a position outside Parliament.    no government could govern without the support of their ownParliamentary Party; and it was the right of any member of that party, not least its chairman, to warn them that they ran the riskcf forfeiting that support and destroying the Party itself.    TheCabinet had throughout underestimated the opposition to the Bill;and it was a mistake to suppose that support for their policy was now growing or that it could be secured by the threat of a dissolution,    On the contrary, many members of the PLP nowforesaw only defeat for themselves and for the Party at the next general Election in any event; and the Government should therefore lose no time in reassessing their attitude to the Bill forthe sake of the party&apos;s morale.On the other hand there was reason to believe that many members of the PLP were content that the Government were activelyseeking agreement with the TUC; and it was in the Governmentsinterests to encourage the Party to turn from arguments aboutprinciples to the discussion of the details of industrial policy,from which agreement might emerge.    The wisest course,therefore, would be to avoid any appearance of rebukingMr. Houghton who had claimed to have alternative proposals ofhis own, and to allow time for a calmer approach to the industrial relations Bill to develop.    At the same time the Government must avoid encouraging the irrational belief in the PLP that a new, butunidentified, Leader could rescue them from a desperate situation.It must be made clear to them that in this respect they werepursuing a fantasy: there was no question of the Cabinetsaccepting that the PLP could overthrow the present Prime Ministerand expect a successor to emerge in his place.    The Party mustshed the illusion that they could at the same time govern and notgovern.    If they rejected one Government they must be able and willing to support another; but this they could not produce from within themselves.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, saidthat it must be clearly understood that any Minister who did notvote in favour of the Bill in whatever form it was eventuallyintroduced could not, of course, remain a member of theGovernment.    But it was clearly important that the Government,with the help which Mr. Houghton had promised earlier in theweek, should endeavour in their forthcoming discussions with the tuc about the Industrial Relations Bill to find means of reducingthe controversy within the Party and making the proposed legislation generally acceptable.    It must not be thought that thestatement by the Chairman of the PLP had placed the Governmentin a dilemmaj but, equally, the Party should be in no doubt that,if they sought to overthrow the Prime Minister and it becameimpossible to maintain effective government, a Dissolution ofParliament would be inevitable.    He would arrange to give further consideration, in consultation with senior colleagues,to the best way of handling the political situation henceforward.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisterTs summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.23rd May, 1969
