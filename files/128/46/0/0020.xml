cabinet confidential annex cc(66) 42nd Conclusions, Minute 3Thursday, 4th August, 1966, at 10. 00 a.m.THE PRIME MINISTER informed the Cabinet that,together with the First Secretary of State and the Chancellor of theExchequer, he had met a representative gathering of bankers on theprevious evening in order to discuss the probable impact of thedisinflationary measures which the Government had recently introduced.    The discussion had been profitable and constructive;and it was satisfactory that those attending the meeting had undertaken, regardless of individual political convictions, to supportthe Governments endeavours to rectify the balance of the economy and to protect sterling.    They had expressed their confidence that,provided that the Government maintained a united political front andsucceeded in sustaining the credibility of their programmes, therecent measures should achieve their purpos6f  and it had been notablethat, with one possible exception, they had been unanimous inrejecting a devaluation of sterling.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that it was now essential that the Cabinet should dismiss devaluation from consideration and should devote themselves to a single-minded and determined attempt to ensure the success of the recent disinflationary measures, which had been based on the assumption that the existingparity of sterling would be maintained.    It would be particularly important to refrain from any public statements about devaluation,since any reference to the topic, however carefully expressed, would merely excite fresh speculation about the Government1 s intentions.In discussion there v/as general support for this view.    Atthe same time the Government should take such steps as were possibleto ensure that they were not confronted again, at equally short notice,by an emergency requiring critical decisions to be taken without adequate preparation.     Contingency planning for eventualities of thiskind should therefore be put in hand;   and, although in certain of itsmanifestations it might need to be confined to a very small numberof Ministers directly concerned, other aspects of our future economic policy should receive more continuous and systematic attention froma Ministerial Committee v/hich should be specially constituted forthis purpose and should report regularly to the Cabinet.    ThisCommittee should be concerned not with detailed issues but with the-1-(97294&apos;The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...

broad strategy of economic policy.     Moreover, it should considernot merely the defensive measures which v/e might have to take if our economic situation deteriorated once again but also the positivesteps which would be required if the balance of the economy j***votM.restored and it became possible to relax the disinflationary pressureand to introduce selective measures of reflation.    All these issueswould need to be examined in relation to the basic problem of thefuture position of sterling in the world and the growing threat of ashortage of international capital.Any systematic examination of future economic policy onthese lines should also include a reassessment, whether by the newMinisterial Committee or otherwise, of the priorities at presentgoverning Government expenditure, which had been largely inheritedfrom the Conservative Administration but might now need to beradically revised.    This process should be carried out, if possible,before the Cabinet were required finally to decide the details of the1967-68 Estimates, which were at present under examination by theCommittee on Public Expenditure.The Cabinet -Took note that the Prime Minister would consider arrangements to ensure that the strategy of future economic policy wouldbe kept under regular review.Cabinet Office, G.W.I.4th August, 1966-2-
