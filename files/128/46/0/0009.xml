CUMENT  IS  THE PROPERTY OF HER   BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;?,   GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.

This had been followed by a discussionof the situation arising from the issue by the extremist committeewhich was in de facto control of the Catholic enclaves in belfast and Londonderry of a statement in connection with the removal ofthe barricades which linked this to far-reaching political demands and affirmed that the extremists were prepared to negotiate only with the Army and not with the Government of Northern Ireland,During the meeting the Government of Northern Ireland had informed us of their intention to issue immediately a statement which would set a time limit for the removal of the barricades by agreement,failing which they v/ould be removed by force.    The NorthernIreland Prime Minister, Major Chichester -Clark, was clearlyunder pressure from his right wing.   If he failed to make a firmstatement on the removal of the barricades, or was inhibited from doing so by us, there was a danger that a large section of his supporters would be alienated and join the &quot;Protestant backlash&quot;which had recently become evident, and that there might beresignations from his Government which would threaten itssurvival.    At one point it had seemed possible that the PrimeMinister himself or the Government collectively might resign.In that event, it was unlikely that any alternative Governmentcould be formed with which we could co-operate.    It might notbe possible to form a government at all, in which case we shouldhave no choice but to assume direct responsibility for the governmentof Northern Ireland,   It might be necessary in the last resort to use force.    On the other hand, a threat, explicit or implicit, to use itcommitted the United Kingdom Government, which would have toprovide the force.    The use of force would have the gravestimplications, and the GOC, Northern Ireland, had expressed
strong misgivings about the consequences of our becoming involved, as we v/ell might be, in an urban guerilla war.It seemed advisable to bring pressure to bear on the NorthernIreland Government to omit from their statement any referenceto a time limit or to the use of force, and to hold the situation sofar as they were concerned by saying - and allowing them, if they wished, to say -that General Freeland had been authorised to discuss with the Government of Northern Ireland the nature of the actioninvolved in dismantling the barricades and the manner in whichtills would be done.    In such discussions the GOC was not to commit himself to any precise timetable.    If there were any question of theuse of force he was to refer back for instructions, which would haveto be considered collectively by Ministers.    In the event theNorthern Ireland Government had agreed to issue a statement on lines acceptable to us.     This had been followed by a televisioninterview given by the Home Secretary in which Mr, Callaghan had emphasised that there could be no question of entering into apolitical negotiation in the context of the removal of the barricades.Thi3 was a -security problem which the GOC was empowered todiscussi but he was not empowered to discuss with self-appointedbodies political issues which were properly the concern of theGovernment of Northern Ireland, which had already put forwardthrough the appropriate constitutional channels its proposals fordealing with the majority of the problems involved.    Meanwhile,negotiations on the spot for the removal of the barricades continued,THE DEFENCE SECRETARY said that Londonderry wasrelatively calm, but that the situation in BeJiast remained verytense.    The troops were subjected to constant vilification byextremist Protestant elements: but by the standards which applied to active service the strain on them was not excessive,and the GOC was not worried about morale.    With the arrivalthat day of a further battalion in Belfast (making bix battalions in all in that area) the GOC felt that he would be able to contain the situation, provided that there v/as no major deterioration.He intended to pay a short visit to Northern Ireland himself on18th September.THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOREIGN and commonwealth AFFAIRS said that the Irish proposalfor the inscription on the agenda of the General Assemblyof the United Nations would be considered by the GeneralCommittee of the United Nations on 17th September,    Wehad been lobbying with some success, and the prospects for an adverse vote were quite favourable, but promises of support obtained in capitals did not always result in votesin the desired sense by delegates.    Even if the Irish proposal were rejected by the General Committee the matter could beraised afresh in the General Assembly itself,    If this happened
and if the proposal for inscription succeeded, the United kingdom permanent Representative to the United Nations, Lord Caradon,had been instructed to press for the matter to be referred to the human Rights Commission where it could be argued that it wouldbe out of order to discuss the political aspects of the question.In discussion there was general approval of the action takenby Ministers arising out of the meeting on 15th September.    Thepoint was made that we should not recoil from political demandsas such.    What was at issue was the manner in which these weremade.    They could not be channelled through the GOC who was concerned solely with security, but should be dealt with throughthe Northern Ireland Government which in many instances hadalready initiated action on the alleged points of grievance.,   Itwould be necessary to keep up the pressure in Stormont.    full use should be made of the good offices of moderates on both sides and in particular of responsible churchmen.    In this connection itwas noted that the Catholic hierarchy were already in touch withthe leader of the committee running the Catholic barricaded areasin Belfast and Londonderry, a Mr. Sullivan,with a view- j-to inducing Mm to adopt a more reasonable attitude.    consideration was given to the position which might arise if the present NorthernIreland Prime Minister were forced into resignation.    If thepresent Minister of Development, Mr. Faulkner, were able toform a government, he would probably continue in the main with present policies and we should be able to co-operate with him.A government headed by the former Minister of Home Affairs,Mr. Craig, would however present an entirely different situation,and we could not allow ourselves to be forced into the position of supporting an administration of extreme and uncompromisingright-wingers.   It had to be borne in mind that it might prove impossible to form a viable Northern Ireland government at all.Emergency legislation to deal with tMs contingency had beenprepared, and had recently been reviewed, as had the generalconstitutional position.    It was true that there had been someweakening in confidence in the Army as an impartial force asbetween Protestants and Catholics, in particular among theformer.    The use by the Army on a very small scale of CSgas against a Protestant crowd had produced a much moreviolent reaction than the expenditure of CS gas on a much larger scale by the Royal Ulster Constabulary against Catholicsat an earHer stage.    But accusations, however unsubstantiated,that the Army load a. pro^Catholic bias were probably inevitable in a situation where the Catholics were on the whole on the defensive: where Army intervention had in the main beenwith a view to their protection; and where reforms, mostlypro-Catholic in effect, which had been delayed for 50 yearsD UNDER SECTION 3 (4J !XQR&amp;secret
