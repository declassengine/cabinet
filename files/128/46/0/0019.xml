1^cabinet confidential annex cc(66) 41st Conclusions, Minute 4Tuesday, 2nd August, 1966, at 10. 00 a. ra.JmE THE PRIME MINISTER informed the Cabinet that duringpISTER&apos;S his visit to &quot;7ashington at the end of the previous week he had heldT TO very profitable discussions with the President of the United States,pHINGTCN        President Johnson.     There had been no disposition on the part ofthe United States authorities to maintain their earlier criticism ofour attitude in dissociating ourselves from their bombing of the oil installations at Hanoi and Haiphong and in purporting to attachconditions to the supply of arms to the United States.    They hadbeen more interested to discuss the disinflationary economic measures which we had recently taken, -measures which had clearly created a favourable impression in \7ashington and should ensure that henceforward the United States Government would support us in our efforts to rectify the balance of the UnitedKingdom economy.    He had taken advantage of this opportunityto remind President Johnson and his colleagues that, if these measures failed, we might be compelled to take action whichwould be unwelcome to the United States Government - e. g. theforced liquidation of United Kingdom privately-owned securitiesin the United States.    But he had made it clear that we should bevery reluctant to take steps of this kind and should certainly prefer to concert action with the United States Government tc face theproblems which lay ahead.    Not the least of these problems wasthe question of international liquidity, on which he had impressed on President Johnson and the United States Secretary of theTreasury the importance of collaboration between the UnitedStates and the United Kingdom against the possibility that thecurrent multilateral international discussions on possible meansof increasing liquidity might prove to be insufficiently rapid oreffective.    It v/as clear that the United States Government would regard a devaluation of sterling as inimical to their interests;and our own decision to avoid this step if possible made it themore likely that we could secure their cc-operation in establishing a link between sterling and the dollar which should enable the United States and the United Kingdom Governments topresent a united front on the question of international liquidity.There were various ways in which this concept of a link betweenthe two reserve currencies might be given formal expression -e. g. an arrangement whereby United Kingdom-owned assets inthe United States might be managed by some joint organisationrepresentative of both Governments.    But it would have beenpremature to attempt, during so brief a visit, to discuss thedetails of any projects of this kind;  and a more fruitful methodof developing the concept might be found in a suggestion, whichhe had mentioned to President Johnson, that we should establishin the United Kingdom an advisory body on the analogy of the-1-The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of.;$s**r&amp;Jtfi*!&amp;::  ^-c.&amp;.TOP SECRET copy No......(.(972941
Dillon Committee in the United States as a means of maintainingcontact and exchanging views with the United States authorities onthe complex of problems connected with liquidity.As regards the more specifically political issues which hadfigured in the discussions President Johnson had appeared to be rather less directly interested than hitherto in the problem of nuclear sharing in relation to the Federal German Republic;   andhe had shown no particular concern about the reductions which we proposed to make in our own military expenditure overseas.     Gnthe other hand there were now good reasons to suppose that theUnited States Government would make a sustained attempt toensure that the heavy liability which we should incur in respectof our purchase of the Fill and other United States aircraft wouldbe offset by United States purchases of United Kingdom military equipment.     They were about to place a substantial order for ships in the United Kingdom;  they had decided to incorporate the rolls-Royce Spey engine in certain United States aircraft, whichshould yield 100 million dollars over the period of the order;   andtheir decision that certain United States troops in France should now be transferred to the United -Kingdom should provide furtherrelief to our balance cf payments.The United States Government were e.lso keenly interestedin the question cf aid to the developing countries;   and this had shown itself both in their desire to develop, in discussion with ourselves, a more coherent and integrated policy of aid to african countries and in the Presidents expressed determination tomaintain aid in the form of food surpluses under Public Law 480by maintaining agricultural production in the United States at a level which would ensure the continued availability of suchsurpluses.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER confirmed thatthe Prime iV.inister&apos;s discussions with President Johnson hadalready introduced a new and welcome element of stability in a situation which still held great dangers for sterling.     The UnitedStates monetary authorities were now giving us all possible assistance in supporting the exchange rate;  and, provided that thedisinflationary measures which we had recently adopted were putinto full effect and maintained without relaxation, we could nowhope that v/e should achieve a surplus on our balance of payments in 1967.     But it was essential to reinforce these measures byrestoring international confidence in the credibility of theGovernment&apos;s policies;  and from this point cf view the Governmentshould do all they could to discourage the continuing speculationabout a possible devaluation of sterling, which, if it were maintained, would be liable to offset all the benefits which we might otherwise expect to derive from our disinflationary measures.    On the separate, but related, topic of internationalliquidity we must prepare ourselves for a situation in which, if thewar in Vietnam were brought to an end, the United States thorn-selves might move into surplus on their balance of paymentsrelatively rapidly;   and the problem of the shortage cf internationalcapital would then become acute.     The United States authoritiesv/ere probably too optimistic in assuming that the current inter-national discussions on liquidity would suffice to avert this danger
in good time.     There was as yet no sufficient reason to suppose that the European interests concerned would cb&apos;-operate effectively to this end;  and France, in particular, seemed determined tomaintain her speculative pressure on sterling.    It was ail themore important, therefore, that we should concert action with theUnited States to avoid these dangers.    Even so, wo could not afford to relax our own efforts to reduce the strain on our balanceof payments;   and it would be particularly important to curtailour military expenditure overseas as rapidly and as effectively aspossible.In further discussion it was suggested that after the new measures of disinflation, particularly the standstill on wages and prices, had been in force for a period of not less than six months,it might be possible to begin to consider adopting reflationarymeasures.    But these would require very ca.reful consideration as regards both their form and the timing of their introduction.Meanwhile, the restoration of confidence in sterling would inevitably take some time;   and we could not afford to relax any ofour efforts to this end.    It was satisfactory that the reductions in our defence expenditure abroad which the Cabinet had approved in principle offered a prospect that our net military account over-seas should be in balance in two years1 time.    But the realisation of this prospect depended on our achieving in full each one of the economies in question;   and from this point of view it would be particularly important that we should demonstrate our detcrmina-tion to withdraw troops from Germany if the Federal GermanGovernment were unable or unwilling to meet our demand for complete repayment of the foreign exchange expenditure involved.The Ministers concerned should give early consideration to theovert measures which might now be taken for this purpose,including the initiation of die necessary consultations in the North-Atlantic Treaty Organisation and Western European Union.the Cabinet -(1)     Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister &apos;s report on his recent visit to washington,(2)    Took note that the Prime ivdnistcr would arrange for an early meeting of theDefence and Oversea Policy Committeeto consider proposals for clemonstratingour determination to withdraw troops fromGermany, if necessary.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.2nd August, 1966
