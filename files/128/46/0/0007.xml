Thediscussions had been protracted largely by the need to discussamong ourselves the proposal made at the meeting by the NorthernIreland Prime Minister with - as was subsequently confirmed - theagreement of the General Officer Commanding, Northern Ireland,that the latter should assume overall responsibility for securityoperations.    There had also been a good deal of discussion withthe Northern Ireland representatives over the terms of theDeclaration of Principles and Communique,    However, thefinal result had been satisfactory.    There had been no need,as at one time had appeared possible, to recall the Cabinet;and the objectives agreed by the latter at their meeting earlier in the day had in substance been achieved.    Subsequently, theHome Secretary had visited Northern Ireland from 27th to 29thAugust&apos; he invited the Home Secretary to report on the outcome of this visit.THE HOME SECRETARY said that he had been accompaniedon his visit by the Minister of State at the Home Office,Lord Stonham, and also by his Parliamentary Private Secretary,Mr. Roland Moyle, MP, both of whom had rendered invaluableservices behind the scenes.    He had found the Northern ireland government bewildered and inert.    It had been difficult to arousethem to a realisation of the full gravity of the situation, possiblybecause for obvious reasons they hadjjbeen able to see for them-selves the situation in the areas where tension was at its highest.But though there was inertia, there was no ill-will and they had appeared ready enough to co-operate once they had been given a lead.    He had addressed the backbenchers of the Ulster unionist party and had sensed a surprising amount of agreement with what he had said to them.    They v/ere however clearly apprehensiveabout the extent to which they could carry their supporters withthem.    He had also had contacts with religious leaders.    BothProtestants and Catholics had emphasised that the problems ofNorthern Ireland were political and economic rather than religious^

Mr,-), lllBlt.....auviiriniif mhw Hi.......-.....order in Ulster was a difficult task at the best of times; andMr.There was indeed some danger of a Protestant right wing backlashin which the Ulster Unionist Party would lose support not to the left but to the right.    So far as security was concerned, he had spoken to the Commandants of the SB&apos; Specials, all of whom wereretired Service officers.    He had appealed - he thought not without success - to their loyalty to the Crown and the constitutional government.    Although this would be subjected to a severe strain if there were a radical change in the role of the ,3I Specials,the position would be eased if the change came as a result of theindependent investigation at present being conducted by Lord Hunt.The Commandants would obey orders, but there remained some doubts about the extent to which their men would follow them.The handing in of the JBJ Specials&apos; arms was an extremelydelicate operation, but it had been proceeding reasonably well.     There were however reports that some of these armshad been finding their v/ay to the Protestant volunteers controlled by Mr. Paisley and othersj and the situation v/ould have to be carefully watched.    Meanwhile, the &apos;B! Specials had been withdrawnfrom crowd control duties and restricted to the guarding ofvulnerable points and police stations.    The Royal ulster constabulary (RUG) remained unacceptable to large sectionsof public opinion, both for reasons of history and because feeling against them was being exploited for ulterior political motives;and some areas in the large cities were still either self-policedor without any effective enforcement of law and order.    It wouldbe difficult to restore public confidence in the RUC and the Force&apos;confidence in itself: and major changes of policy, organisation and personnel were likely to be called for in the light of Lord Hunt&apos;sreport.    The public lack of confidence in the police forces throwa heavy burden on the Army, whose commitment to the maintenanceof law and order was likely to have to continue for some considerable time.    Although the troops had done very well, they were nottrained in police duties: they could not be expected to carry them out indefinitely: but for the present there was no alternative.After outlining the measures taken following the NorthernIreland Prime Liinister!s visit to London and his own visit to Ulsterthe Home Secretary pointed out that while civil rights and non-discrimination were of cardinal importance, the problem ofNorthern Ireland v/as also to a very large extent an economicone.    From this point of view, the biggest problem of all wasLondonderry - a city divided against itself and without hope.The pattern was that unemployment led to political extremism,and extremism to disorders, which were then reflected in Belfast.
If even 1, 500 jobs could be created in Londonderry, this would goa long way towards transforming the situation: and he appealed tohis colleagues for their co-operation.    The Irish problem, afternearly 50 years of relative stagnation, was on the move again andunrest was likely to continue as long as the long-term problempersisted, whatever we did in the short term to ease immediatepressures.    The situation was a grave and urgent one.    time was not on our side.    More barricades had been set up by bothsides in Belfast the previous night.    While this was more of a gesture than anything else, it was indicative of the atmospherethat still prevailed.    But disturbing though the outlook was, itwas more promising than it had been a generation age    In contrast to the position in 191^* the British Army was not now emotionallyinvolved.    The Opposition at Westminster, whom he had been at great pains to keep informed - were no longer totally committed to the Protestant North? and despite some unhelpful public utterances by the Prime Minister of the Irish Republic,Mr. Lynch, and others, ha judged that the temper in theIrish Republic was very different.   As to this last point,he believed tha.t our long-term objective should be to move forward towards a better relationship between Northern Irelandand the Republic.    This would need very careful consideration andit might be that no major progress would be achieved within the lifetime of the present Parliament.    However, as a first stepit might be useful for the Prime Minister to see Mr. Lynch.The timing of this would need further thought: but talks might take place after he himself had paid a second visit to NorthernIreland, which it was his present intention to do about 8th-9thOctober? after the reports of the various commissions and otherinvestigating bodies which had been set up had been received? andafter further discussions in London with the Northern IrelandPrime Minister,in discussion general appreciation was expressed of theway in which both the political and military aspects of thesituation had been handled.    The conduct of the troops hadbeen exemplary: but they were not equipped or trained to do a long-term policing job.   Although their presence and theirobvious impartiality had been a valuable psychological deterrent,this was to some extent a wasting asset; and there was some doubt whether if there were further major outbreaks of violence, thetroops would have the necessary experience or techniques to contain them.    This made it all the more urgent to press on with the reorganisation of the regular police forces and therestoration of public confidence in them.    The point was made that one illegal broadcasting station was attempting to createfriction in Belfast and Londonderry between the troops and thelocal population: and it might be necessary to take action againstthe anarchist groups who were behind it.   The Irish republican army was also trying to maintain tension and foment violence:
but it had not been very effective;  its importance had been greatlyover-estimated by the Northern Ireland authority; and there hadbeen little real co-operation between it and the extreme left, evenin the areas, such as the Bogside in Londonderry, where the writof the Northern Ireland Government still did not run.    There was general agreement on the urgent necessity ox creating moreopportunities for employment, especially in Londonderry and,in general, in the areas west of the River Barm, where bothunemployment and the proportion of Roman. Catholics werehighest.    The financial implications would have to be considered further v/hen specific proposals had been worked out.    The point was made that intelligence about the internal security situation had been deficient in the early stages.    At that point, we had hadto rely on the RUC whose information was both one-sided andinadequate and it had not been considered advisable to establish an independent intelligence organisation    Steps had howevernow been taken to improve both the RUCs and our own sources of information.    In general, Press and public reactions to themeasures which had been taken had been favourable;  and theOpposition had not sought to exploit the Governments difficulties,,Reactions abroad had also been favourable, and the visit c.CMiss Bernadette Devlin, MP, to the United States had on thewhole been a failure,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion,said that the meeting of 19th August with the Northern IrelandPrime Minister and the Home Secretary&apos;s subsequent visit to northern Ireland had achiaved the substance of the objectiveslaid down by the Cabinet,    Measures had been set in train todeal with the most urgent problems.    The action taken had be onwell received by public opinion, and would reflect credit on theGovernment,,    Y/e had bought time in which to work out a long-term solution.    This might be a long time in coming, and it was unlikely to be achieved within the lifetime of the present parliament,    Meanwhile we should avoid being rushed;and in particular there should be no premature withdrawalof the troops.The Cabinet -Took note of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up andof the points made in discussion.Cabinet Office, S. V/,1.5th September, 1969
