THE PRIME MINISTER said that developments of the last few hoursas regards the international monetary situation and the decision to seek theapproval of the Privy Council to the proclamation of a bank holiday, whichhe and the Chancellor of the Exchequer had had to take at very short notice,had led him to call a meeting of the Cabinet at 10. 30 on the following morningin order that all Ministers should be informed of the grave situation whichwas now emerging.     But it had been represented to him that some Ministers,who had been meeting in the House of Commons in what appeared to havebeen almost an irregular session of the Cabinet, wished to be brought intomore formal consultation forthwith;  and he had therefore agreed to receiveimmediately such members of the Cabinet as could be collected from the HousTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that during the evening he had learned that, as a result of the continuing and increasinginternational speculation in gold, the United States authorities were considering taking action to limit their undertaking to buy and sell gold atthe fixed price of $35 per ounce to those Central Banks which would undertaketo confine gold transactions to other Central Banks which agreed to observe the same restriction and to refuse to indulge in market speculation.     the implications of such a step for us would be far reaching.     But it had been impossible to obtain any clarification of the real intentions of the UnitedStates until the Secretary of the United States Treasury, Mr.  Fowler, had got in touch with him by telephone at about 10. 40 p. m.  and had conveyed a request that the British Government should close the London gold market on15th March.     There had been a parallel communication from the governor of the Federal Reserve Bank, Mr. Martin, to the Governor of the Bank ofEngland, including a statement that the United States authorities proposed to convene a conference in Washington over the weekend, to be attended by representatives of the Central Banks and Finance Ministries of such of thecountries members of the international Gold Pool as were willing to attendin an attempt to re-establish orderly international monetary arrangementsbefore trading was resumed on Monday.vThe Governor of the Bank of England had advised him to accept theproposal that the London gold market should be closed on 15th March.     Hehad also proposed that that day should be declared an official bank holiday inorder that we might be able to suspend dealings in foreign exchange, as was essential if we were to maintain the existing exchange rate for sterling.In these circumstances he had seen no alternative to accepting this advice - but only on condition that, since the New York market would remain open on 15th March and sterling would therefore remain exposed to pressure,the United States authorities would give us a firm undertaking to providewhatever support for sterling was required during the day.     In addition itwould be necessary to interpret the bank holiday in a manner which, whileinhibiting the banks from exchange dealings, would allow them to conductnormal domestic business, particularly as regards the provision of cash forthe payment of wages.An immediate decision had been essential if we were not to face, assoon as the day&apos;s business began, a loss of reserves on a scale which could make it impossible for us to maintain the new parity of sterling.     We hadnot yet succeeded in making good the very heavy drain on our reserves at thetime of devaluation;  and we could not afford to take any further risks of weakening the sterling/dollar parity.
THE PRIME MINISTER emphasised that the losses which the reserves had suffered on the previous day (Thursday, 14th March) hadbeen heavy;  and during the Friday which still lay ahead we might wellsustain - unless we took preventive action - further losses on a scalecomparable with the catastrophic drain on the day before the devaluationof the previous November.      The situation earlier in the evening had beenvery unclear;   in particular Mr. Fowler had not been specific in histelephone discussion with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the linehad been bad.     But, when he and the Chancellor of the Exchequer had subsequently been able to consider the situation with the Governor and deputy Governor of the Bank of England, it had been clear that we hadno alternative to meeting the United States request provided that theUnited States authorities would undertake to support the sterling rate in new York during 15th March.    This undertaking had been subsequently   jconfirmed in a telephone conversation between the Governor and Mr. Martand thereafter it had been necessary to arrange for a meeting of the privy council to validate the bank holiday as a matter of extreme urgency.    TheLord President, who would normally have attended the Privy Council,could not leave the House of Commons;  but he had been informed of thesituation and efforts had been made, unsuccessfully, to contact the ForeigiSecretary.    The Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, who happened to be available, had therefore accompanied him and the Chancellor of theExchequer to Buckingham Palace in order to establish a quorum for the privy Council.    There had been no alternative to action on these lines and at this speed.    Had we not acted as rapidly, we faced the prospectof a loss of reserves which could be of the order of  3 00 or  400 million during the day which lay ahead.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCEsaid that there was no question that the course which had been adoptedwas necessary and right.    It was important, however, that the general public should understand that our action had been taken at the request ofthe United States authorities.    But what now should be our tactics at theforthcoming conference of monetary authorities in Washington?THE PRIME MINISTER said that this would need further thought;but the action which we had taken would at least have minimised theextent to which sterling could be threatened.     The pressure on sterling would be further eased if, by Monday, it had been agreed either that thegold price should be raised or that gold should be demonetised.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE said that theepisode raised certain issues of the machinery of Government.    In thecircumstances it would clearly have been impossible to summon the wholeCabinet;  but there were certain Ministers who would have wished to havethe opportunity to express their-views on a situation which had now beendeveloping for several days and could, to that extent, have been foreseen.It would surely not have been impossible to assemble at least a small group of Ministers before the decision to arrange a meeting of the privy council had been taken.    As it was, the statement which he himself had made in the House of Commons that afternoon, indicating that we wouldbe prepared to accelerate our implementation of the Kennedy Rounddecisions, would now be liable to look ridiculous.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he agreed.     Why had theCabinet, at their meeting that morning, been given no hint that this situation was likely to arise ?
THE PRIME MINISTER replied that there had been no indication of any change in the United States position until 6. 00 p. m. that evening;and even then all that was known was that the Governor of the federal reserve Bank was calling on President Johnson.    In these circumstances he had sent the President a message, which was necessarily couched ingeneral terms but did at least warn him that sterling and the dollar musthold together if we were not to be driven to take action in protection of sterling which might be unpalatable to the United States authorities.At 7.30 p. m. he had tried to make contact with the Foreign Secretary,both as Deputy Leader of the Parliamentary Labour Party and In hisDepartmental capacity in case issues of our relations with the UnitedStates were involved.     But he had been unable to find him.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he had never been out ofreach of the telephone during the whole evening.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE said that this argument was not particularly relevant;   but other economic ministers were involved and might have been consulted.THE PRIME MINISTER said that a message just received fromthe Lord President in the House of Commons suggested that there was now considerable disorder in the House.THE FIRST SECRETARY OF STATE commented that in that case it was fortunate that both the Foreign Secretary and he himself had had at least some inkling of what was afoot while they were in the House.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he wouldhave welcomed an opportunity to take advice from other economicMinisters;  but there simply had not been time to do so.    As regardswarning them earlier in the day, he had had no reason to suppose, whenthe Cabinet met that morning, that this situation would arise.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY replied that, even if the situationdid not arise until the evening, all the Ministers concerned were available.The whole matter had been handled with great arrogance.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER replied that he hadoften warned the Cabinet that sterling was still in an exposed and sensitiveposition.    But he could only repeat that he had had no knowledge at the morning&apos;s Cabinet that it was now in a particularly dangerous situation -indeed it was not until 4. 00 p.m. that the first intimation of this kindhad reached him.THE PRIME MINISTER then spoke on the telephone to the lord president;  and they discussed whether the statement which the Chancellorof the Exchequer would have to make in the House of Commons about the proclamation of a bank holiday and the closing of the London gold market should be made forthwith rather than be held until after Questions later in the day.    In any event he should make it clear that the banks werebeing closed, as regards foreign exchange transactions, at the requestof the United States authorities and in order to prevent disorder in financial markets.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY observed that, even so, this statement would create an impression that sterling was now in danger;   and it mightbe impossible to hold the parity.
THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER replied that, however that might be, there had simply been no time to consider any alternative course,THE PRIME MINISTER endorsed this statement.     The situationearlier in the evening had been very confused and uncertain.    It had notbeen until about 4 o&apos;clock in the afternoon that we had had any indication of the way in which the mind of the United States authorities might bemoving;   and it had not been until shortly after midnight that we had beenable to secure the United States undertaking to support sterling, which was essential if we were to meet their request that dealings in gold and foreign exchange in London should be suspended.     Thereafter it had been necessaryto move with the utmost speed.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that his colleaguesmust ask themselves what other course could in fact have been adopted.If we had not agreed to close the London gold market and to suspend foreign exchange transactions, the sterling parity would have collapsed within24 hours.      But, by taking the action which the Privy Council had endorsed,we now had at least a chance to discuss at the forthcoming monetaryconference the possibility of making some more satisfactory arrangements inthe longer term.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would certainly ask the Cabinet,as a whole , on the following day if they supported the action which had beentaken.     But he agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the cabinet would have to consider the probable consequences if we had refused to accede to the United States request.      There was a real danger that, if the UnitedStates Government obtained the approval of the Senate to release the goldwhich was at present earmarked as backing for the currency, they would bevery tempted to use it to maintain the existing gold/dollar parity for as longa period as possible, during which sterling could be overwhelmed.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE repeated that, even so,he felt that it should have been possible for a few Ministers to discuss thisgrave issue before any decision was taken.THE PRIME MINISTER replied that there had been no time for this.The situation had not begun to become clear until 11. 00 p. m. ;  and by thenurgent action was imperative if the banks were to be warned of the bank holiday in time.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that it remained true that thePrime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer had acted by themselves and on their own authority.     They could have consulted other Ministers atany time from 6. 00 p. m.  onwards.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE said, once again, thathe, too, resented being excluded from the discussion of such gravecontingencie s.THE MINISTER OF TECHNOLOGY said that the decision taken had clearly been right.THE FIRST SECRETARY OF STATE said that the substance of thematter was too serious for Ministers to waste time in arguing about procedureNevertheless, the incident had certain lessons for the future.     It was a factthat from 6. 00 p. m.  onwards some Ministers at least could have been warned,since from that hour the possibility of some action must clearly have been inthe Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s mind.
TTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that this was not so.He had naturally considered a ban on dealings in gold and foreign exchangeas one of a number of alternative steps which might have to be taken; but hehad no reason to suppose that the United States would ask us to take it.THE FIRST SECRETARY OF STATE repeated that, even so,  some ministers might have been warned.     It had been sheer luck that a few of theMinisters in the House of Commons had realised,   before the Prime Ministerand the Chancellor of the Exchequer went to the Palace, that something wasafoot and had therefore not been wholly unprepared for &quot;some significantdevelopment.     But it was untrue to say - as the Prime Minister had earlierimplied - that, when a few of them thereafter met in the House to speculateon what was happening, their discussion amounted to an irregular meetingof the Cabinet.     In the circumstances the Foreign Secretary could not havedone less than tell such of his colleagues as were available that the PrimeMinister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer had gone to see The Queen;and it had been natural and inevitable that those Ministers should then wishto talk the matter over.    He did not dispute that there had been no real choiceabout the action to be taken.     But it remained true that there had not been as much prior consultation between Ministers as there might have been;and in future some machinery should be devised to prevent decisions of thiskind being taken by the Prime Minister alone or with only one other colleague.THE PRIME MINISTER asked whether this&apos;would really have beenpossible at 10. minutes past midnight.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY agreed that it would not;   but it wouldhave been perfectly possible at 10 minutes past 6 in the evening.    Herepeated that there had been no telephone call from No.   10 to the ForeignOffice in an attempt to establish contact with him in those few hours.THE PRIME MINISTER replied that he had tried for over an hour tofind the Foreign Secretary.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY repeated that there had been no telephonecall.THE FIRST SECRETARY OF STATE said that there was no point in pursuing this dispute; there might have been some misunderstanding in the transmission of the message.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that there had been no misunder-standing.     The Prime Minister was trying to cover up a monumental muddle;and he did not accept his version of the episode.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE said that the foreign secretary&apos;s behaviour was regrettable; but perhaps one could hardly blamehim.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he could not accept a situation inwhich the Foreign Secretary denied his assurance that he had tried to make contact with him and asserted that he had deliberately deceived otherMinisterial colleagues.At this point the Foreign Secretary left the meeting.
THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE said that, of course,he accepted the Prime Minister&apos;s word on this.    But it was still true that from 6. 00 p. m.  onwards the Prime Minister would have been wiser to bring a few other Ministers into consultation.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that there would havebeen no point in doing so, since at that point there was no firm proposal for ministers to consider.     It was not until 10. 40 p. m. that he had received theAmerican request - and then it had taken a form which we had not expected.Moreover, it was not until he had spoken to the United States Secretary of theTreasury (and the Governor of the Bank of England had subsequently confirmedthis conversation with the Governor of the Federal Reserve Bank) that the realnature of the United States proposal was clear.     This had been at 11. 00 p. m.It would have been impossible at that point to refuse to act as the UnitedStates had asked us to act;  but speed was then the essence of the matter ifthe banks were to be warned in time before business began in the morning.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION said that he agreed.It would have been impossible to take any meaningful action at 6. 00 p. m.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE said that he was not convinced on this point.     But it was too late now to discuss this questionprofitably.     As far as he was concerned there was no need for the matter to be reported to the Cabinet.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, on the contrary, the Cabinet would need to discuss the tactics that we should adopt at the forthcoming monetaryconference.     in particular, we must ensure that the political implications ofthe situation were taken fully into account in any technical decisions whichmight be reached.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ECONOMIC AFFAIRS said that,as one who had become involved in the incident largely by accident (because he happened to be available when a Minister was required to make up a quorum for the Privy Council), he could endorse all that the Prime Ministerand the Chancellor of the Exchequer had said about the need to act with greatspeed.     Nevertheless, there was force in the views which had been expressedin so far as the real object of ^criticism was the curtain of secrecy behindwhich the Treasury concealed their conduct of economic policy.     Many of the issues hidden behind this curtain needed more collective consideration.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would ask the Cabinet later in theday whether any Minister thought that he and the Chancellor of the exchequer could, or should, have acted differently.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE said that he, for one,would not be able to say that he did not think that they could have taken anyother course.     Having heard the present discussion, he simply did not know.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR said that, personally, he was satisfiedthat the decision taken had been right and that, in circumstances of this kind,prior consultation was impossible.     A discussion had been unnecessary;  and ministers should never have taken it on themselves to come to No.  10 at thathour in the morning if their only purpose was to make some of the statements which had been made.     The matter would now be better left until the Cabinetmet later in the day.Cabinet Office, S.W.I.17th March, 1968
