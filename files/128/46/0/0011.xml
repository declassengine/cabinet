TTuPter) \ iCf^TOP SECRET .Copy No.........a-........cabinet confidential. annex cc(69) 48th Conclusions, Minute tuesday, 14th October, 1969 at 10,,30 a.mtTHE HOME SECRETARY, reporting cn his visit to northern Ireland, said that a full account of his discussions withthe Northern Ireland Government was given in the communique issued on 10th October, copies of which he had circulated to theCabinet with C(69) 139.    He was convinced that the Northern ireland government would do their best to push the reforms through,because they recognised that they could not go back, and they believed that they could hold their Party together,,    But he confessedto an inner concern and it remained to be c?een whether the disturbances would build up to a rew peak or gradually die away;the previous night had been fairly quiet.    Ke was however sure that there would have been real trouble had fche Cabinet not decidedto institute a new local defence force to replace the Ulster special constabulary (USC)j  it was very likely that the USC would have gone underground.    As regards fche Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC)?his impression was that the change to a civilian police role was generally welcome, even among senior officers? and he believedthat fche RUC would be preparedf if need be, to act againsfc the USCThe new Inspect or-General, Sir Arthur Young, was off to a goodstart?  and as soon as he was well established they should review thearrangements whereby the police came under control of fche GeneralOfficer Commanding (GOC), with a view to giving the Jhcpector-General more freedom of action,,    His opinion should also be given full weight in deciding when it was safe to withdraw troops from thevarious areas.THE DEFENCE SECRETARY said that in hie judgment troops were likely to be required in Northern Ireland for a considerableperiods little confidence would be p?.faced in the local forces byCatholics until they were seen to be working efficiently and fairly,particularly in the matter of promotion, and that might take until theend of next year0    He agreed that the relationship between the RUCand the GOC should be reviewed;  indeed there was a need to lookagain at the arrangements which had been improvised and to-1-
Improve communications between the two Governments and the advisers stationed at Stormont and with the GOC.    Intelligence of feeling among Protestants was still poor^, though it was improving;but the Shankill Road riots showed signs of organisation and ho had little doubt that some members of the USC were involved.    The risk that organised elements of the USC would go underground had formed a large part of the case for establishing the proposed new local defence force; and he hoped that it might be possible to set this up at the beginning of the New Year, though ideas, had still to be clarified,    legislation of the United Kingdom Parliament would berequired? and he thought that this should be announced inThe Queen*s Speech.In discussion there was general appreciation of the skillshown by the Home Secretary in negotiating with the NorthernIreland Government, which had done much to allay fears expressedby some members of the Cabinet during the previous discussion.Every effort should be made to settle policy on the new local defence force before the Debate on the Address,    The aim should be tointroduce legislation for this purpose and to facilitate the transfer and secondment of Great Britain police during November;  theOpposition were not likely to obstruct its passage^THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, saidthcvt he wished on behalf of the Cabinet to congratulate theHome Secretary on his success in achieving the objectives on whichthey had agreed during the discussion on 7th October,    The Homeand Defence Secretaries should consider urgently, in consultationwith the Lord President, what provisions needed to be included inthe proposed legislation and should report back to the Cabinet,The Cabinet -(l)     Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion,(2)    Invited the Home and Defence Secretaries,in consultation with the Lord Presidentof the Council, to consider urgently the content of the proposed legislation and toreport to the Cabinet,Cabinet Office, S.W.1.14th October, 1969
