In the event the outcome of that conference, as recorded in trie communique issued on fche previous evening, had been noi; wholly uncatisfactory from our point of view;and there had been no point at which; by pressing a particularpoinfc of view, we could have decisively influenced the course of theproceedings.    The group of Ministers had therefore decided thatthere was no need to summon the Cabinet aft short notice duringSunday evening; but Ministers would now wish to consider thesituation and its implications at relative leisureuTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that it had become clear at an early stage in the international conference that,despite the intense speculation in gold during the previous week,the United States authorities were^still not prepared either toincrease the price of gold or to adopt a policy of demons 11 cation.They had preferred to sponsor a dual price system?  and, sincethe other countries represented at the conference had been readyto accept this, we ourselves had concentrated on securing themaximum additional support for sterling, which would be exposed to fresh pressure as soon as operations on the basic of a dv.alprice system began in the world exchange markets.    We had secured assurances which would bring the total of such support to a figure of $4, 000 millicc-..    Of this figure- however.$1,400 million represented., our own resources; a. further$ls400 million was constituted by the stand-by faciiitie s which theLi fee r national Monetary Fund (IMF) had earlier put at our disposal;and only $1, 200 million therefore represented genuinely newsupport,,    Nevertheless; this margin of additional resources,coupled with the fact that the IMF stand-by facility1 would now be
released from the so-called &quot;negative pledges &quot;and would therefore be more easily and rapidly available if required, shouldbe sufficient to safeguard sterling against an unacceptable strainin the days ahead.    An additional measure of stability should beprovided by the agreement between the Central Baric represented at the international conference &quot;to co-operate even more closelythan in the past to minimise flows of funds contributing toinstability in exchange markets and to offset, if necessary, anysuch flows that may arise in view of the importance of the dollar/sterling in the international monetary system. &quot;   He and hiscolleagues in the Ministerial group had therefore judged that itwas preferable to accept a settlement on this basis than to embark on either of the very grave alternative courses of blocking the sterling balances or allowing the exchange rate for sterling tofloat.    Nevertheless, a situation might develop in which we shouldbe forced to contemplate action on one or other of these hypotheses;and their implications should now be studied as rapidly andintensively as possible.The Ministerial group had also had to consider whether theban on dealings in foreign exchange which had operated on theprevious Friday and Saturday should be maintained on Monday andTuesday, a course which would have involved proclaimingadditional bank holidays on those days.    To do so, hov/ever, wouldbe liable to be interpreted by international opinion as implying that the Budget on the following day would include come drastic measures of a monetary kind? and, if this impression once tookroot, the impact on sterling in other exchange markets, whichwould remain open even though the market in London v/as closed,could be very dangerous.    On balance, therefore, it had beenjudged right to allow normal banking business to be resumed.The London gold market, however, would remain closed f or afurther two weeks since, although this would involve us in some loss of foreign exchange earnings, it should do much to restorestability to transactions in gold and should therefore reinforce thenew gold policy which the international conference had endorsed.In discussion some doubt v/as expressed whether a dualprice system for gold could be expected to endure for very long.It was agreed that further pressure on gold might develop quiterapidly and that in those circumstances our own interests would be best served if the United States authorities moved towards a policyof demonetisation.    This, hov/ever, would have major implicationsin terms of the political alignment of the world Powers,&apos;  and theCabinet 3hould therefore take an early opportunity to consider howour own external policy might be affected, particularly ?.s regardsour relationship with the United States and with Europe respeefcively.It would be important to try to establish how far the events ofrecent months, which had brought the international monetarystructure to the verge of collapse, had resulted from deliberateaction to this end by the French Government and how both theFrench and German Governments were likely to react in the weeks-2-
ahead to the new situation which would develop as a result of theintroduction of a dual price gold system.    Meanwhile it would remain essential that both the United States and we ourselvesshould adopt domestic policies which would put the economy and the balance of payments of both countries on a more stablebasis, albeit without provoking deflation on a scale which,particularly as regards the United States, might precipitate acontraction in international trade.    In our case this considerationunderlined the importance of the forthcoming Budget,,The Cabinet -Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for further study to be givento:-(a) the political implications ofrecent developments in theinternational monetary situation;(b) the action which might be required if we were compelled in the nearfuture either to block the sterling balances or to allow the exchange rate for sterling to float.Cabinet Office, S.W.I.18th March, 1968-3-
