TOP SECRETCABINETCopy No....^.g.CONFIDENTIAL, annex cc(66) 47th Conclusions, Minute 1Friday, 22nd November, 1968 at 9. 30 a. m,NATIONAL THE PRIME MINISTER informed the Cabinet of developmentsITARY in the international monetary situation since the French represen-iTION tative at the recent meeting of central bankers in Basle had disclosesthe intention of the French Government to devalue the franc.     TheFederal German Government had subsequently announced their intention to adjust their turnover taxes so as to increase the tax on exports and reduce the tax on imports by 4 per cent in each case.The Germans claimed that this was equivalent to a 4 per centrevaluation of the Deutschmark (DM) in visible trade.    SubsequentlyMitial a meeting of the Group of Ten had been called in Bonn and v/as stillin session.     Concerted pressure by the United Kingdom and most other Governments on the Federal German Government to increasethe extent of their &quot;revaluation&quot; had so far proved unsuccessful.The latest position was that the Federal German Government had offered, in addition, to impose a 100 per cent reserve requirement in respect of foreign deposits held by German banks.     The FrenchFinance Minister had indicated that if his Government devalued the franc it would be by 11,11 per cent and it seemed highly probable thata devaluation to this extent would be announced by the FrenchGovernment sometime on 23rd November.    The communiquefrom the Group of Ten in Bonn was expected early that afternoon and it was hoped that it would announce a sufficient package of measures - by surplus and deficit countries alike - to stabilise the monetary position at least for some time.The British Government would be announcing its own packageof measures immediately after the Bonn communique.     Themeasures proposed had been considered by the small group ofMinisters which had been established under his chairmanship,after the gold crisis last March, to keep the economic and monetarysituation under review and make contingency plans as necessary.The proposed measures would in any case have been required, atleast in part, to deal with the continuing excess of home demand and of imports over the levels forecast at the time of the Budget,The present international monetary crisis made them easier toexplain to public opinion and urgently necessary - both to make good the adverse consequences for our balance of payments of the franc devaluation and to help, with the other measures to be takenby other countries, to restore international confidence.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use ot..$Tt?&amp;..yrfx.rx.. .-:U&apos;^-*&apos;&apos;&apos;-
The proposed measures were, first, a further tighteningof credit by banks and other financial institutions.     The effect would be equivalent to a reduction of bank credit from 104 percent of the November, 1967, level to 102 per cent by March, 1969.Secondly, immediate activation of the Customs and Exciseregulator in order to put a surcharge of 10 per cent on alcoholicdrinks;  petrol and other hydrocarbon oils;   and on all rates of purchase tax.     Thirdly, the introduction of an import depositscheme requiring importers to deposit with Customs 50 per cent of the value of their imports on importation for a period of sixmonths.     This scheme would extend broadly to all imports exceptfood, raw materials and fuel, and a limited range of goods importedmainly from developing countries.     The Parliamentary Committeehad considered whether some goods - particularly cars and con-sumer durables - should be excluded from the scope of theregulator but had concluded that they should not, on the advice of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and in view of the latter&apos;undertaking that he would be prepared to review the effect onthese particular industries of the current hire purchase restrictions in January or February next,    The effect of the regulator would beto add about one point to the cost of living index.    The Minister of power might consider whether the resultant increase of 4d, on a gallon of petrol could be offset by withdrawal of all or part of thepresent Sues; surcharge of three-quarters of a penny a gallon.     Theimport deposit scheme was an entirely new departure, and conse-quently its effects could not be gauged with any certainty.    But itwould of course greatly increase the credit squeeze:  if its effects on industrial liquidity became too severe it would bepossible to ease the restrictions on bank credit.It was proposed to announce these measures as soonas the Bonn communique, reporting the outcome of the meetingof the Group of Ten, was issued.     The precise timing was stilluncertain but would almost certainly be that day.    The Chancellorof the Exchequer would not inform the Group of Ten about the importdeposit scheme until the end of the meeting, and there must there-fore be some risk that the Group of Ten would then seek to reopentheir discussions and the terms and timing of the communique.    Ifthe Bonn communique were issued that day but the Chancellor hadnotsreturncdhe (the Prime Minister) would probably make the statement to the House,    But the Parliamentary Committee had firmly taken the view that the British measures should not be announced inadvance of the Bonn communique.     He apologised for the very short notice at which these major issues had been put to them for decision but in view of the exceptional degree of security required the planning had had necessarily to be restricted to a very small group of those Ministers directly involved.    He invited approval for the announcement of the measures which he had outlined assoon as the Bonn communique had been issued.In discussion, the following points were made -(a)    It was argued that the level of domestic demand and imports in recent months justified the introduction of the import depositscheme and the intensified squeeze on credit, but not the use ofthe regulator, which had originally been considered as an
alternative to the tighter hire purchase regulations which had recently been introduced.    The latest economic forecast showedonly a very small further expected increase in the level of domestic demand over the next 12 months in the absence of new measures.The use now of the regulator could be justified only as a measure to offset the deterioration in our balance of payments consequent on devaluation of the franc and in order to bolster international confidence.      On the other hand, it was argued that the measures proposed were probably insufficient to deflate domestic demand tothe level required to get the economy back on to the course chartedat the time of the Budget:  even if there had been no international monetary disturbance, it was doubtful whether the measures proposed were adequate to provide the balance of payments surplus which we urgently required and had been aiming for.     Moreover,there had been a very substantial fall in the seasonally adjustedunemployment figures and a rise in those for unfilled vacanciesover the last three months.    There were other economicindicators which pointed to a gathering momentum in the rateof growth of the economy, stimulated in large part by a high level of domestic demand.    In publicly presenting the measures now proposed it would, in any event, be necessary to relate themto the economic situation at home as well as abroad.(b) Action to stem the capital outflow to the rest of the sterling area should have been included in the measures.    It was pointedout that, whereas only a fraction Of a reduction in internal demand was reflected in reduced imports, the whole of the effect of any restriction on capital was reflected in full in our balance ofpayments.     On the other hand, it was pointed out that if westopped the capital outflow to, say, Australia, the latter would no longer be bound by the Basle Agreement, on which the futureof sterling depended.    However, the Steering Committee onEconomic Policy would shortly be reviewing economic strategyas a whole and in this context the problem of capital outflowswould be examined,(c) The exclusion of food a.nd feeding stuffs from the scopeof the import deposit scheme was mistaken and would cause theGovernment considerable embarrassment,    V/c had been seekingfor some time to restrict imports of cheese in order to ease theposition for our dairy farmers and in the interests of increasedimport substitution it was highly desirable to extend the importdeposit scheme to cover a wide range of agricultural products.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the purpose of theimport deposit scheme was not to give additional direct protection to individual industries;  and if this became the obvious purpose itwould greatly increase the risk of retaliation and of similar measures by the United States Administration.    Moreover,the application of the import deposit scheme to food and feedingstuffs would have a substantial effect on the cost of food andtherefore the cost of living.    Nevertheless, if the british market suffered from increased imports of dumped or subsidisedEuropean agricultural produce, the Government should considerwhether countervailing measures were needed.    The presentscope of the import deposit scheme could not be extended after its introduction because any such extension would lead to increasedspeculative and anticipatory imports of commodities which still remained outside its scope.
(d)    It was suggested that the announcement of the measures should indicate firmly that there was no justification for any increase in the price of goods already in the shops as a resultof the introduction of the import deposit scheme.    On the otherhand, it was argued that any statement to this effect would encourage the public to buy imported goods as swiftly aspossible in order to avoid the forthcoming increases inprices.    There was general agreement that public presentation of this aspect of the scheme should be urgently considered.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet agreed the proposed measures to be taken whichhe had outlined.     These measures would be announced, if possible by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to the House of Commons that afternoon, as soon as the communique from the Group of Tenmeeting had been issued.    He would, however, inform theChancellor of the Cabinet&apos;s view that it seemed desirable for himto remain in Bonn until the end of the conference and until agreerneon the communique had been reached.    If this resulted in delaying the Chancellors return until after the House had adjourned, hewould discuss with the Chancellor the most appropriate methodof issuing a statement of the British measures.     The steering committee on Economic Policy would shortly be consideringeconomic strategy as a whole and the problem of capital outflowswould be examined in this context.     The Chief Secretary,Treasury, should arrange, in consultation with the first secretary of State, for officials from their departments and from the Board of Trade to advise urgently on presentation of the effect on prices of consumer goods of the introduction ofthe import deposit scheme.    Ministers should seek to avoiddiscussing publicly the present monetary situation and the Britishmeasures before they had briefing material which was being prepared by the Treasury.    If, however, discussion of thesetopics could not be avoided before official briefing was available,the Ministers concerned should clear the line they proposed to take with the Chief Secretary, Treasury, and the Paymaster General,The Cabinet -(l)     Approved the economic measures which the PrimeMinister had outlined to them.(2)    Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(3)    Invited the Minister of Pov/er to examine urgently thepossibility of withdrawing the present Suez surchargeso as to offset, to some extent, the increase in theprice of petrol which would result from the 10 percent surcharge applied by the regulator,(4)    Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in consultationwith the First Secretary of State, to make arrange-ments for officials to advise urgently on public presentation of the effect on prices of consumer goods of the introduction of the import deposit scheme.Cabinet Office, S. W, 1,22nd November, 1968
