hi v.!NO CIRCULATION RECORD0. M* ( 50) 71s t C one las ions(6th November, 1950 - 11.0 a. m.)THE MINISTER OF FUEL MD POWER said that in viewof the danger that, notwithstanding other short-term measureswhich might be taken, there would be a serious shortage of coal for inland consumption before the end of the winter, theNational Coal Board were anxious to have authority to purchaseimmediately between 500,000 and 750,000 tons of coal, mainly from the United States,    The cost would be between $6 and 8millions and the loss in selling this coal at current prices in this country would amount to  1^ millions.   Since it wouldtake three months for the coal to be available in this country,purchase would have to be made forthwith and it would be essential to preserve complete secrecy until the contractshad been placed, since otherwise the price of the coal andthe cost of freight might move against the Coal Board,The Cabinet saw serious objection to this proposedpurchase of coal from the United States,    The political conse-quences of having to import coal were likely to be so serious that all other possible steps to equate demand and supply inthe coming winter should be taken before the question of importing coal was further considered.    It would be preferable that United States and other foreign coal should be used for meeting some of the requirements for British coal abroad,rather than that foreign coal should be brought to this country.The Cabinet -Agreed that, pending urgent consideration of thecoal situation by the official committee tobe set up under the chairmanship of theChief Planning Officer, no steps should betaken to negotiate the import of foreign coal.to this country.

Id,h November, 1950CABINETj*[EASURE5 TO PREVENT A fuel OulSIS DURING TFIE WINTER OF1950 - 1951Note by the minister of Fuel and power in view oi the current level of coal output, and of theLock position it has been necessary to consider what furtherjasures can be taken to prevent a&apos;fuel crisis during the comingInter months.Output CampaignI have arranged to have a Conference with the NationalDnsultative Council of the Coal Industry   (i.e, the Nationalaal Board and the National Union of Miners), to lay beforelem the facts of the present situation; and to invite them) make renewed efforts for increased coal output,Gas Oil for Gas WorksAs a result of a series of Conferences held since lastilly, the Gas Boards have used more gas oil than I then hopedight be possible, ana they have arranged to use still morewring the coming winter,,   They have indeed reached the limittiicti the supply of coke makes possible.Retarding exports the Production Committee have agreed that exports muste retarded by 50,000 tons a month until the end of the year,hope the Cabinet will endorse this decision./5.   Double
,   Double Bunkering of Merchant ships the Minister of Transport has undertaken to see how muchyal can be saved by &quot;double bunkering&quot;, of merchant ships, and supplying overseas bunker depots with overseas coal.   Thisill mean a use of dollars, but it might save ^00,000 - 300,000jns of coal during ohu coming winter..   The Purchase of Coal for Eventual ImportIt may happen that the present fall in man-power will belecked, or that output will rise, But, if the most recentfends continued, and if we had increased coal consumptionBcause of a severe winter, the measures mentioned above wouldDt suffice to close the gap in the winter budget The N.C.B.i:e anxious to be allowed to buy some coal abroad, and. I thinke should immediately authorise them to do so if this is to be done:(a) The decision must be taken immediately - only instantaction will secure coal for delivery in February;(b) Permission must be given to the N.C.B. to spend, thenecessary dollars,(c) The greatest secrecy must be maintained, to prevent a rise in prices.It is improbable that we could purchase more than half aillion tons in the united States,   There may be some smaller -uch smaller - quantities available elsewhere, but this ispoblematical.,   This help might be of great importance, if theinter in February or March is hard,P.J.
