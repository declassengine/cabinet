ItLA T IONousnee:1) 26thsions)NO CIRCULATION RECORDC.M.(5l) 27TH CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 2(12th April, 1951 - 11.0 a.m.)When the Home Secretary proposed that the national health Service Bill should be introduced on 17th April and that the motion for its Second Reading should be debated in the week beginning 23rd April, THE MINISTER OF LABOUR at once saidthat, if there were a division, he would not feel able to vote infavour of this Bill.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE suggestedthat, in view of the division of opinion within the Cabinet on thisquestion, it would be preferable that further Cabinet discussion ofit should be postponed until the Prime Minister (who was still in hospital) was able to preside.    Meanwhile he suggested that theintroduction of the Bill should be delayed.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that the Cabinet had decided to impose charges for dentures and spectacles supplied . .under the National Health Service, and had authorised the Chancellorof the Exchequer to announce that decision in his Budget statement.The decision had proved acceptable to a substantial majority of thoseattending the meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party at whichthe Budget statement had been discussed.    From the point of viewof Parliamentary tactics the wisest course was to proceed withoutdelay with the legislation authorising the imposition of these charges.    If the introduction of the legislation were delayed, theGovernment would be thought to be wavering;  and, once this impression was given, the Parliamentary difficulties of passingthis legislation would be greatlyTHE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE said that hewas not sure whether this proposal would in fact prove acceptable to a substantial majority of Government supporters.    Of those whohad spoken at the meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party, amajority had been critical of this proposal.    There was a good dealof feeling about this in the Party, and he thought it would be wiser onthat account not to rush the introduction of the legislation,THE MINISTER OF DEFENCE said that there had been wide-spread relief in the Parliamentary Labour Party when it became known on the previous day that there were to be no Ministerialresignations over this issue.    Moreover, the Budget had met witha substantial measure of support throughout the Party,    If thiscontroversy within the Cabinet were now renewed, a very seriousParliamentary situation would arise.   The fact was that the cabinet had decided to impose these charges, and had authorised theChancellor of the Exchequer to announce that decision.    Thelegislation now proposed did no more than give effect to thatdecision.   If its introduction were delayed, for the reasons putforward by the President of the Board of Trade, there was boundto be canvassing and agitation among Government supporters;  andthe division of opinion within the Cabinet would soon be reflected in the Party,    This would cause a split in the Labour Party - withall the grave consequences which the Cabinet had discussed at their
two meetings on 9th April.    Some Ministers had said that theywould resign if the Cabinet decided to impose these charges;but the Cabinet had so decided, and the Ministers had not resigned.It was now the duty of those Ministers to support the Cabinet&apos;decision.    If, after all that had happened, the Cabinet were nowto reverse the decision which had been announced, some other ministers might find themselves unable to defend such vacillationand might feel obliged themselves to resign from the Government.At this point, at the Foreign Secretary&apos;s suggestion, themembers of the Secretariat withdrew.    On their return, half an hour later, THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that the Cabinet had reached the decisions recorded in the Minutes, viz. that theNational Health Service Bill should be introduced on 17th april and that the Second Reading should be taken in the week beginning23rd April,
