NO CIRCULATION RECORDC,M.(5l) 29TH CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 2(19th April, 1951 - 10.0 a.m.)NAL After the Cabinet had been informed that the Second ReadingH of the National Health Service Bill would be taken on 24th April, these BILL MINISTER OF LABOUR said that, if there were a division, he wouldnot be able to vote in favour of the Bill and that if it were carried onous Third Reading, he would resign from the Government,    He thoughtnee: it right to warn his Cabinet colleagues that these were his intentions,1) 27th    and he wished to have them placed on record,sions,2) THE FOREIGN SECRETARY suggested that it would be more appropriate for the Minister to put this on record in a letter to thePrime Minister, and he still thought this should be done.    He hopedthat the Minister would not now seek , by threats of resignation, to cause the Cabinet to modify the decisions which they had authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to announce in his Budget statement.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR said that he would write to thePrime Minister.    But he had thought it only fair to his cabinet colleagues that he should make his position plain to them also.The Cabinet then proceeded to the discussion (recorded inthe Minutes) regarding the possibility that, on the Second Reading ofthis Bill, some statement migH be made on the Government^ behalfwhich would allay the fears of some Government supporters that thelimit upon expenditure on the National Health Service and the chargesimposed by the Bill would become a permanent feature of the Serviceand would lead to the imposition of charges for other facilities pro-vided under it.    In the course of this discussion THE MINISTER OFLABOUR said that his difficulties might be met if a statement couldbe made to the effect that the charges authorised by this Bill were ofa temporary nature and that no further charges were contemplated.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER indicated, however, thata statement in such terms as those could not be regarded as consist-tent with what he had said on the point in his Budget speech.
