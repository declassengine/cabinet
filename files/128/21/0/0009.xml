UsJi o_.il;P. (HNO CIRCULATION RECORDC.M.(51) 26TH CONCLUSIONS(9th April, 1951 - 6. 30 p.m.)The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the level ofSS Government expenditure on the social services.)I-THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that during the afternoonhe and the Chief Whip had seen the Prime Minister in hospital andis had given him a full account of the Cabinefs discussion at theirce: meeting that morning.    The Prime Minister had asked him to con-) 25th      vey to the Cabinet the following expression of his views.     First,ions,        he had pointed out that in all Cabinet discussions of Budget proposalsl) there must be a substantial measure of give and take between ministers.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer had particularresponsibility for the national finances;  and no other Ministerought to claim that any particular estimate should be treated assacrosanct.    It would be a most unusual thing for a Minister to resign on a Budget issue:   so far as he was aware, the onlyMinister who had ever taken this step was Lord RandolphChurchill, whose political fortunes had never recovered thereafter.Secondly, a Minister who found himself in disagreement with aparticular part of the present Budget proposals should consider,not only his personal position, but the effect which his resignationwould have on the present and future fortunes of the Labour Party.Thirdly, the Prime Minister had said that it would be stark follyfor any Minister to provoke a political crisis at the present time.He could not imagine a worse moment for a General Election.There was some reason to hope that, as the summer went on, theconditions would become more favourable for an election - the meat ration might be increased, the weather might improve and there might be some change in the international situation.    But a GeneralElection at the present time, with a Labour Party torn by dividedcounsels, would prejudice the fortunes of the Labour movement for years to come.     Fourthly, if the Government were forced to face the electors in these circumstances, they would inevitably wear theappearance of being incompetent to govern.    They could not hope towin such an election;  and, after such a debacle, the Conservativesmight be expected to remain in office for a long period.    Theresponsibility for provoking this situation would rest with anyMinisters who resigned from the Government at the present justice.     Finally, and for the foregoing reasons, the PrimeMinister urged his Cabinet colleagues to give solid support to theBudget proposals put forward by the Chancellor of the Exchequer;and, in particular, to adhere to the decisions which they had taken,as a Cabinet, on 22nd March regarding the future level of expendi-ture on the National Health Service.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR said that he was not surprisedto hear that the Prime Minister took this view.    He had, however,discussed the matter with the Prime Minister before 22nd March;
and he had then made it clear that he would not be able to sharecollective responsibility for a decision to abandon the conception ofa free Health Service.    This was   for him, a question of principle.He had given five years to building ,up the HieaLth-Servjice^, he hadproclaimed it on many public platforms &quot;as one of the outstandingachievements of the Labour Party in office:  he had, in particular,upheld the conception of a free Service as the embodiment ofSocialist principles.    It&apos;was too much to ask him now to go intothe division lobby in support of a measure authorising the impositionof charges for dentures and spectacles provided under this Service..In saying that he must resign from the Government if the Cabinetpersisted in this decision, he was not speaking lightly or withoutconsideration of the possible consequences which the Prime Ministerenvisaged.    But a Minister must be free to resign if he felt that hecould not conscientiously share collective responsibility for decisions which his Cabinet colleagues wished to take.    ThisCabinet had taken many decisions which he had not wholly approved;but, when it became clear that these represented a preponderantview in the Cabinet, he had been prepared to take his share ofresponsibility for them.    But, latterly, he had come to feel that hecould bring more influence to bear on Government policy from out-side the Cabinet than he could ever hope to exercise within it;and, when a Minister reached that position, it was time for him to go,THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE said that he wished at this stage to make his own position clear.    In theCabinet&apos;s earlier discussion that morning he had said that he supported the view of the Minister of Labour that it would not bepossible to persuade all Government supporters to vote in favour oflegislation authorising the introduction of charges under the health service.    He now wished to make it clear that, if the Cabinet main-tained their decision to introduce these charges, he would feelunable to share collective responsibility for that decision and, likethe Minister of Labour, would feel obliged to resign from the Govern-ment.In the course of a long discussion Ministers dwelt upon the grave consequences which would follow if resignations from theCabinet caused a division in the ranks of the Labour Party.This would almost certainly precipitat e a General Election, at a mount most unfavourable to the fortunes of the Party and in circum-stances in which the party  s chances of success must be rated very low.    But, worse than that, it might undermine the authority of theParty&apos;s leaders and weaken the electoral prospects of the Party formany years to come.    From a wider point of view it was also argued that the Labour Party had given an example to the world of stable and progressive Government in the difficult period of transitionafter the end of the war and in the dangerous period of international tension which had followed it;  and it would be a tragedy if at this juncture the inspiration of its leadership in world affairs werecast away.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR said that he could not accept responsibility for these consequences, even if they turned out to beas serious as some of his colleagues had feared.    It was not he whohad taken the initiative in proposing charges under the health service.    The political crisis, if one developed, would have beenprovoked by those who had made this proposal.    Other Ministers, onthe other hand, held that any Ministers who resigned from the
Government at the present time would be responsible for thepolitical consequences which were likely to follow; and, in their view, this was a very heavy responsibility.Beside these grave consequences, the issue which nowdivided the Cabinet seemed relatively small.   Was there not some compromise on the basis of which agreement might still bereached?   The Cabinet then discussed various possibilities.Thus, would it be possible to postpone for six months theintroduction of charges under the National Health Service?During the interval Ministers should be able to resolve theirdoubts on the question whether the money allocated to the increaseddefence programme could in fact be profitably spent;  and theywould then be able to see more clearly whether the proposedeconomies on the Health Service were in fact essential.Postponement would also have the advantage that the discussioncould be resumed at greater leisure under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister himself.   Alternatively would it suffice for the Chancellor in his Budget speech to say merely that expenditure on the Health Service would be kept for the timebeing within an upper limit of  400 millions, and that the Govern&quot;ment were considering what steps would be necessary to ensurethat this limit was not exceeded?   Would it not be possible tosecure economies in the administration of the Service withoutresorting to charges?   Or could the necessary savings besecured by imposing a charge for prescriptions, and abandoning the proposed charges for dentures and spectacles?   This wouldhave the advantage that no fresh legislation would be required.And in 1950 the present Minister of Labour had accepted theview that a charge for prescriptions would not involve a breach of the principle of a free Service.   THE CHANCELLOR OF THEEXCHEQUER pointed out that none of these alternative courseswould give him a sufficient assurance that the necessary savings would in fact be secured.   Other Ministers testified that theCabinet Committee on the National Health Service hadexhaustively considered all practicable alternative methodsof reducing expenditure on the Service, and had satisfied them-selves that this expenditure could not be kept within an upper limit of  400 millions without recourse to charges.   They were alsosatisfied that the charges now proposed, for dentures and spectacleswere the most practical and the least unpalatable of any whichcould be introduced.   The Cabinet reluctantly came to theconclusion that no compromise solution could be found along theseline s.In the course of further discussion THE MINISTER OFLABOUR indicated that, if he resigned from the Government, hewould feel obliged to make it clear that his differences with hiscolleagues had not been restricted to this question of changesunder the National Health Service.   He was also gravelyconcerned about the economic consequences of the increaseddefence programme.   While he supported the policy of rebuildingthe armed strength of the western democracies, he was concerned about the pace and volume of their rearmament programmes.He believed that, by trying to do too much too quickly in response to united States pressure, the western democracies were in grave danger of undermining their economic strength.   The UnitedKingdom Government would in his view make a double mistake ifthey allowed the increased defence programme, not only to distortthe national economy, but also to do this at the expense of thesocial services.
Further appeal s were then made by a number ofMinisters that the solidarity of the Government and the LabourParty should not be breached by resignations on this issue.THE MINISTER OF EDUCATION, in particular, made it clearthat in his view Ministerial resignations were too high a price to pay for an economy of  13 millions on the Health Service,He felt sure that it must be possible to resolve the differenceswithin the Cabinet by some means which would not involveMinisterial resignations;   and he hoped that the majority would not press their view to a point which would make these resignationsinevitable.After further discussion THE FOREIGN secretary said that he must bring the issue to a decision.   He read out theconclusi ons reached by the Cabinet at their meeting on 22nd March,viz, that for the time being expenditure on the National health service should be subject to an upper limit of  400 millions;that charges should be imposed for the supply of dentures andspectacles under the Health Service;  and that the health ministers should draft the necessary legislation and make suchadvance preparations as were required to bring the scheme of charges into operation on 12th April,   He asked each member ofthe Cabinet to state whether he was still prepared to adhere tothose decisions.  THE MINISTER OF LABOUR, THE PRESIDENTOF THE BOARD OF TRADE and THE MINISTER OF EDUCATIONsaid that, for the reasons which they had indicated in the courseof the Cabinefs discussion, they were not in favour of re-affirmingthose conclusions.   The remaining members of the Cabinet allindicated that they favoured re-affirming those conclusions,THE MINISTER OF LABOUR said that in these circum-stances he would have to resi gn from the Government,   He would submit his resignation to the Prime Minister in the course of thefollowing day;  and he presumed that he would thereafter make a personal statement in the House of Commons, possibly on11th April,The Cabinet -(l) Reaffirmed their decisions of 22nd March regardingthe limitation of expenditure on the National health service and the introduction of charges for denturesand spectacles supplied under that Service,(2)    Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to announcethese decisions in the course of his Budget speech.(3)    Invited the Minister of Labour to reconsider his position,and expressed the earnest hope that he would not find it necessary to resign from the Government on this issue.
