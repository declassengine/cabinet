A copy of this is enclosed.     I have sent acopy to Rickett, but have suggested that ho need not show itto the Prime Minister at the present stage.     The originalwill be bound up, in due course, with ay personal volume ofthe Cabinet Minutes.     No other copies have been made.(Signed) NORMAN CROOK.

TOP SECRETMR. KICKETf-I think you should have, for your personal informa-tion, the enclosed copy of a &quot;?lo GirculatiOE&apos;&quot; record which Ihave made of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on 9th March about thesituation which would have arisen if the Government had been defeated in the deV-te on the Address.I doubt if you will think it necessary to show this to the Prime Minister.     But you may like to have it by you incase a similar situation should arise at a later stage in this parliament.(Signed) NORMAN BROOK.15th March. 19*50
NO CIRCULATION RECORDTOP SECRETCM,(50) 9th Conclusions. Minute 1(9th March, 1950 - 9.30 a.m.)THE PRIMj;; MINISTER said that the two Conservative amendments to the Address, both that on the Iron and Steel Act and that on housing, would be pressed to a division;   and he had been considering what advice he should tender to His Majesty if the Government were defeated in either of these divisions.     He did not think it would be right to ask for a Dissolution so soon after the General Election,and he was inclined to think that his proper course would be toadvise the King to send for Mr. Churchill.     The resultingParliamentary situation would be very unsatisfactory, for the conservatives, being in a minority, would find it even more difficultto carry on&quot;the essential business of Government!   but this situation would have been created by the Conservatives and he thought theyshould be forced to assume the responsibility for handling it.In discussion emphasis was laid upon the embarrassmentswhich the Labour Party would face if they went into Opposition in thepresent Parliament.     The Conservatives, if they assumed office,would have to present some kind of programme to the house, and theLabour Party would find it difficult to avoid challenging at least some of the features of that programme.     But the Labour Party wouldbe in greater difficulty than the Conservatives were at present for,with their majority, they would be in a position to defeat theGovernment at any time and any challenge which they found it necessaryto make was likely to lead to a Government defeat.     They would thus be faced with the unpleasant dilemma of assuming responsibility forturning the Government out and forcing a Dissolution or, alternatively,refraining from challenging policies which were distasteful to their supporters. At the present time the country&apos;s greatest need wasa period of political stability;   and, as the strength of the two
main Parties in the House of Commons was so evenly balanced, it was theduty of both to practise moderation and avoid unnecessary controversyfor the time being - at any rate until the essential financialbusiness of the spring and summer had been completed.   There was some reason to believe that Mr. Churchill*s action in making animmediate challenge to the Government in the debate on the Addressmight be regarded as irresponsible by a substantial section of publicopinion, which recognised that the Labour administration were right in deciding that, despite their narrow majority, it was their duty to carry on the King*s Government.   It might therefore be expedient for the Prime Minister to give a warning, during the debate on the address, that if the Labour Party were prevented, by factious andirresponsible action on the part of the Opposition, from discharging their duty of carrying on the Xing&apos;s Government, a further appeal tothe people might have to be made.   This would have the effect of bringing home to the House the serious risks that were being run.While the sentiment underlying this view commanded general support, it was pointed out that an early Dissolution was hardlypracticable, in view of the necessity for passing the Budget and making the other financial provision without which the ordinary business of administration could not be carried on.THE PRIME MINISTER, in conclusion, said that he was grateful to his colleagues for this expression of their views, which hewould bear in mind.   At the moment this question was only hypothetical,for he had no reason to fear that the Government would in fact be defeated in the divisions in the debate on the Address.   And the issues involved were so grave that he would wish to have an opportunity of considering them again, and possibly holding further discussions withsome of his colleagues, before he finally made up his mind whatadvice he would tender to His Majesty if the Government should in theevent be defeated.Cabinet Office, S.W.I.
