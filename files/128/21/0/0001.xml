Note of a Meeting of Ministers held at Chequersat ^.30.;.p. m.  on JRXDAY, 19TH . AUGPSTT: 1949. !::-FRSSENT?-Prime MinisterSecretary of State for Foreign AffairsChancellor of the ExchequerPresident of the Board of trade minister of Fuel and Powex&quot;Sir Edward Bridges1.     DEVALUATIONThe meeting had &quot;been arranged for the purpose of discussing the timing of devaluation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who had landed at Northolt Airport earlier that afternoon, on returning after amonth&apos;s absence in Switzerland,    The meeting lasted three hours and coveredmuch ground by way of recapitulation of arguments adduced in previousMinisterial discussions during the past month.The immediate point discussed was whether devaluation should&quot;be carried into effect on August 28th or September 4-th, i. e.  the twofeasible dates for the operation before the Vfashington talks started,At the outset the Chancellor expressed himself as still not wholly convinced that we should benefit on balance from devaluation.But in the course of discussion he accepted the view of his colleagues that devaluation would be in the interest of this country as part of other arrangements to be made in the Washington discussions.On the issue whether to devalue before or after the Y/ashingtondiscussions, the three points which weighed most with Ministers againstdevaluation before the discussions opened were as follows(a) It was noted that we intended not to give the international monetary Fund the notice required under the Constitution.    It wastherefore of the utmost importance to make sure that we carried theUnited States and Canadian G-overnmeniswith us, and this meant dueconsultation,(b) The. Chancellor had not made up his mind.to what rate we shoulddevalue if we did devalue.    He would be most reluctant to go below
$3* 0 (the Foreign Secretary favoured $3. 2) , and wanted to be sure thatthe Americans were satisfied that the degree of devaluation effected was sufficient to ensure that we did not have to repeat the operation again,(c)     It was important to make sure that the Americans did not regard the degree of devaluation which we were carrying out as excessiveand entitling them to take counter-action which would frustrate ourdevaluation.On the point that it would be difficult to obtain, security for the operation if carried out in Washington, the Chancellor of theExchequer thought that this would not present difficulties if the matter was discussed with Mr. Acheson and Mr. Snyder alone.As for the argument that we did not want devaluation to appearas something done at the dictation of the United States Government, theChancellor said that if it was planned to devalue on 18th September hewould fly back about 16th September, on the conclusion of the talksjand that he would not feel any difficulty in putting devaluation acrossas part of other arrangements made with the Americans and Canadians.Indeed, he felt that, if devaluation was to be carried out, say, on28th August, he did not know on what ground he could defend it.    It wouldbe asked what change of circumstances had occur/red since he made his last pronouncement on the subject, and there could be no answer exceptthat we were doing this in the hopes of getting something out of the americans - which he thought would be far more damaging politically than if we devalued on 18th September.,The Prime Minister summed up the conclusions as follows(1)     Ministers agreed in principle to devaluation, as something which they would do in the course of September as part of the general arrangements which would emerge from the Washington talks, and that itshould be so presented to the public.(2)     The level to which we should devalue was a matter which wewould discuss in Washington as part of the other arrangements to be madethere.
(3)     Provisionally we should aim at carrying out devaluation on18th September, in which event the Chancellor would probably leave?/ashingtan on 16th September.r(4)     In the light of this time factor, the Foreign Secretary andthe Chancellor of the Exchequer should both leave on the Mauretaniaon 31st August.(5)     The meeting of Ministers provisionally arranged for thursday, 25th August, should be postponed until Monday, 29th August.2*     MEASURES TO ACCOMPANY DEVALUATIONA short discussion took place on this subject.Government expenditure.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while in his view it would be necessary that further measures should be takento check inflation, these should not be of the &quot;orthodox&quot; variety suchas would be associated with a Geddes axe.    Reduction in government expenditure must not substantially affect the food subsidies or thesocial services.    It was agreed, however, that there was advantage in pursuing administrative economies vigorously on the lines set out in thePrime Minister *s directive.The possibility was also mentioned of abolishing one or twoMinistries in order to save costs.It was also generally agreed that reductions in public expenditure, investment, and credit policy, should all be considered together and presented together in any public handling of this matter.3.     defence the Foreign Secretary said that, as the United Statesappropriation for defence aid to the Atlantic Powers had.been cut byhalf, we should also cut by half the second instalment of extraproduction for Western Union defence, totalling  50 millions, which wehad agreed to undertake in the American financial year 1950/1.    he proposed to speak in these terms to the Minister of Defence early in thefollowing week.    In presenting this decision we should bear in mind thatit was not so much a question of America defending us, as of our helping to defend America,
The Foreign Secretary said that he had now had an opportunityof considering the question of wages in the distributive trades which had&quot;been discussed at the last meeting of the Cabinet.    He thought that torefer hack the decision of the Wages Council would give rise to great difficulties and might result in the present wages policy vis a vis the ToUeC. &quot;breaking down.    He also thought that the cost would not hebetween  15 and  20 millions, as suggested, but  5 millions or  6 millionssince most of the firms concerned were already paying more than theminimum,    He thought the best way to handle it would be, not to writea letter, but that a Minister should see the President and Secretaryof each of the Unions concerned and should say that the government did not reject the claims, but that the present moment was inconvenientand they thought the matter should be brought up again in October,It was agreed that the Foreign Secretary should consult withthe Minister of Labour&quot; and the other Ministers concex-ned and take actionon these lines early in the following week.    This action would includeseeing Mr. Tews on and speaking to him on the lines proposed,
