NO CIRCULATION RECORDCM.(51) 52HD CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 1(16th July, 1951 - 11.0 a.m.)THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that, as he had been inParis at the end of the previous week on business connected with theOrganisation for European Economic Co-operation, he had had the oppor-tunity of a private meeting with Mr. Harriman, who was passing throughParis on his way to Persia.     With the concurrence of the Prime Ministerand the Foreign Secretary, he had seen Mr. Harriman, under conditions of extreme secrecy, and had had a full and frank discussion with him.Mr. Harriman had shown himself friendly and sympathetic towards the UnitedKingdom Government, and seemed to have a clear understanding of their point of view.    ,He understood that the proposals which we had put to thePersian Government contained no margin for bargaining;   and, on thefinancial side, he was inclined to think that they went too far.     His aimwas to convince Dr. Mussadiq that he could not hope to succeed in his present policy, and that Persian oil could not be sold without Britishhelp.     Mr. Harriman had said that we need have no fear that he would represent himself as a mediator between the Persian Government and our-selves.     He must avoid this,, if for no other reason, because his activities were being jealously watched by the American oil companies.Mr. Harriman had raised two points of detail.     First, he had expressed some doubts about our attitude regarding the receipts which the persians had tried to extract for oil shipped from Abadan.    The chancellor had explained that our whole case would have been prejudiced if we hadacquiesced in a form of receipt implying that the Anglo-Iranian oil company had no claim to property in the oil.     Secondly, he had suggestedthat the A.I.O.C. mission need not have broken off their discussions withthe Persians so abruptly, when their first proposals were rejected,
without trying to find out   the area of disagreement.   The^Chancellor had explained to Mr. Harriman why this course hadbeen taken.The   Chancellor had also referred to the risk of disorders,in which the Tudeh Party, might seize power, and had mentioned thepossibility that in such an event military intervention might become inevitable.   Mr. Harriman had seemed to be prepared to acceptmilitary intervention in such circumstances, provided that it took place at the invitation of the Shah.   Mr. Harriman alsoseemed to be impressed with the need to prevent the Russians .from gaining control of the oil area in North Persia, and this consideration seemed likely to influence his whole attitude towards this problem.Mr. Harriman was anxious to keep in close touch with .M. Ambassador in Teheran.   And he thought that there might be. developments which might make it desirable that a Minister or a senior official should go out to Teheran from the United Kingdom before he left.On more general issues, Mr. Harriman evidently regretted thatthe Western Powers had not been able to do more to promoteeconomic development in the Middle East, and he was much concerned about this.   He had hot, hoviever, discussed in detail the possibilityof United States financial assistance to Persiaj   and he evidentlyrecognised that there was little prospect of furthering the economic development of Persia so long as Dr. Mussadiq remained in power.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL pointed out that if the Russians gained afoothold in Horth Persia they would, apart from gaining access to the oil supplies there, acquire effective control over the whole countrysince the grain producing areas lay in the north.The Cabinet took note of these statements.
