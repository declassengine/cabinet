PRIME MINISTER

As it has not yet been decided when public reference should be made to the possibility of an early Election, I have thought it right to exclude from the Minutes of this morning&apos;s Cabinet any summary of the discussion about a further appeal to the electorate. I realise that this makes the Minutes somewhat unreal, and may give some Ministers the impression that you have decided to carry on for a much longer period than you have in fact in mind. If, however, it is agreed, at the Party meeting next week, that some early statement should he made to the effect that an early Election this year is inevitable, I can then substitute for this record a rather fuller Minute which reflects more accurately the tone of this morning&apos;s discussion.

CM. (50) 5th ConclusionsRecord of the Cabinet&apos;s Meetingon 25th February, 1950.The following is a fuller record of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion at their first meeting after the General Election.     The circulatedMinutes included no reference to the possibility that the PrimeMinister should let it be known that he thought it inevitable that another General Election should be held before the end of the year.It was thought at the time that the Prime Minister might give some indication to that effect in his speech in the debate on the Address^and the fuller record of the cabinet s discussion, which is set out below, was prepared in the expectation that it would become possibleto print this in substitution for the shorter version which had been circulated on the day following the meeting.     In the event, thePrime Minister decided not to make any reference to the possibilityof an early Election.     This fuller account of the Cabinet&apos;s dis-cussion was not therefore given any circulation^   but it is reproducedhere for the purpose of completing the historical record.The Cabinet met to consider the situation resulting from theGeneral Election.     With six returns still outstanding, 314 seats hadbeen won by Labour, 294 by Conservatives and their supporters, 8 byLiberals and 2 by Irish Nationalists.     The remaining seat was the speaker&apos;s.     Thus, whatever the results in the six outstandingconstituencies, Labour would have a majority over all other Parties inthe new House of Commons.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the King&apos;s Government must becarried on and, as Labour would have a majority, the proper course was for a Labour Administration to remain in office for the time being.With so small a majority, however, the Government would be in a veryweak position:   they would have great difficulty in transactingGovernment business in the House of Commons, and would be unable tocarry through any of the major legislation foreshadowed in the Party&apos;s
Election Manifesto.     No Government could carry on for long under those conditions;   and he himself believed that, after the necessarySupply business had been got through and the Finance Bill had been passed, there must be a further appeal to the electorate.     It was for consideration whether, in announcing his intention to carry on for the time being, he should let it be known that he thought it inevitable that another General Election should be held before theend of the year.Meanwhile, some reconstruction of the Government would benecessary;   and he asked that, in order to facilitate this, all ministers should place their offices at his disposal.     ministers should, of course, continue to supervise the current administrationof their Departments until his wishes were made known to them.The Cabinet agreed that a Labour Administration must remainin office for the time being.     Discussion turrfed on the questionwhether any early intimation should be given that a further Electionmust be held before long.     It was generally agreed that it would be inexpedient to make any announcement to this effect before there hadbeen an opportunity of consultation with the National Executive ofthe Labour Party and with the Parliamentary Labour Party.     Subjectto these consultations, however, most Ministers felt that nothing would be gained by attempting to conceal their belief that an earlyElection was inevitable and that there might even be some advantage inletting this be known in the course of the debate on the Address.     Insupport of this view it was argued that the country&apos;s greatest need atthe present time was for a strong and stable Government able to take decisions which might be temporarily unpopular - e.g. in relation tothe level of Government expenditure, the investment programme, wage increases etc.     Recent experience had shown the difficulty of taking such decisions under the shadow of an approaching Election;    and fromthis point of view there was everything to be said for holding afurther Election before the end of the. year.
Some Ministers thought it would have been preferable if thenext General Election could have been deferred until the policiesintroduced by the Government during their first period of office from1945 to 1950 had borne fruit.     At the recent Election many Labourcandidates had been embarrassed by complaints about the working of the nationalised industries, the high cost of living and the shortage ofhouses.     It would be advantageous if, before the next Election, theGovernment could have had time to remove some of the grounds for thesecomplaints.     A longer interval would also be useful for the purposeof persuading those who had voted on this occasion for the liberal party that they were more likely in practice to be able to secure their fundamental objectives by supporting the Labour Party.It was, however, the general view of the cabinet that thedifficulties of transacting Government business in the House ofCommons with so small a majority, and the country&apos;s urgent need of aperiod of strong and stable government, would make it inevitable thata further General Election should be held before the end of the year.The question whether some indication to this effect should be givenin the course of the debate on the Address could be determined in thelight of the consultations which would be held, during the following week, with the National Executive of the Labour Party and with theParliamentary Labour Party.In further discussion the suggestion was made that it wouldbe useful if the Cabinet could give some preliminary consideration tothe country&apos;s financial situation before the Chancellor of theExchequer formulated his final Budget proposals.     This suggestion was approved.The Cabinet&apos;s conclusions were as follows:-(1)   It was the duty of a Labour Administration to continue in office, in order that the King&apos;s Government might becarried on. -(2)   A public announcement to this effect should be issuedforthwith:   to this there should be added a call to all members of the community to turn their efforts, now that
the Election was over, to carrying on the necessarywork of the nation.(3)   All Ministers should place their offices at the PrimeMinister&apos;s disposal in order to facilitate hisreconstruction of the Government.(4)   At their meeting on 2nd March the Cabinet should considerthe terms of the King&apos;s Speech and a draft of theDefence White Paper.(5)   At a meeting of the Cabinet on 3rd March the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer should give his colleagues a broad picture of the financial position of the country and of the main factors which he would have to take into account in framing his Budget:   discussion of this statement could,if necessary, be continued at a further meeting in thefollowing week.(6)   The Prime Minister should ascertain whether Colonel CliftonBrown was willing to be nominated for re-election asSpeaker.     If so, the Chief Whip should suggest to him that Mr. David Kirkwood might propose his election, andthat a member of the Opposition might be asked to secondthat proposal.(7)   As the strength of the two main Parties in the House ofCommons was so nearly equal, the Chief Whip should ascertain whether it would be possible to arrange forthe office of Deputy Chairman of Committees to be filled by a member of the Opposition.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,25TH FEBRUARY, 1950.
