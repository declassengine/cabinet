NO CIRCULATION RECORDCM. (50) 65th Conclusions(19th October, 1950 - 10.0 a.m.)THE PRIME MINISTER said that, leaving out of account the special meeting held in the spring of 194-9 to discuss con-stitutional developments in India, there had been no meeting of-Commonwealth Prime Ministers since the autumn of 194&amp;.     In viewof the critical state of international relations, he thought it advisable that an attempt should be made to hold a further meeting pof Prime Ministers at an early date.     From the Commonwealthpoint of view it would certainly be valuable to have a fullexchange of views on the current international situation;   andthe meeting might also have a steadying influence on world affairs!The meeting would be concerned primarily with matters of foreignpolicy, but it would provide a valuable opportunity for discussionof defence problems with at any rate the Prime Ministers of the older Commonwealth countries.     Subject therefore to the Cabinet&apos;concurrence he now proposed to invite all Commonwealth PrimeMinisters to a meeting to be held in London in the early part ofDecember.There was general agreement with the Prime Minister&apos;views.The Cabinet -Took note that the Prime Minister would now take steps to arrange for a meeting of commonwealth Prime Ministers to be held inLondon in December.
