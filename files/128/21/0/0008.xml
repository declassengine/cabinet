33(5 . L&quot;-icc/NO CIRCULATION RECORDC.M.(51) 25TH CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 2(9th April, 1951 - 10.30 a. m. )After the Chancellor of the Exchequer had explained his budget proposals the Cabinet reverted to the question, which theyhad discussed at their meeting on 22nd March, of the level ofGovernment expenditure on the social services.    One of the assumptions on which the Chancellor had constructed his Budgetwas that, in pursuance of the Cabinefs decision of 22nd March,expenditure on the National Health Service would be subject for thetime being to an upper limit of  400 millions.    Before that decision was taken expenditure on the Health Service in the financial year1951/52 had been estimated at  423 millions;   and, in order tokeep it within the upper limit approved by the Cabinet, the health ministers had agreed to effect economies in hospital administrationtotalling  10 millions and to introduce charges for dentures andspectacles which, in the coming year, would produce  13 millions.In a full year these charges would produce a much larger revenue;but the saving on the hospital s service was non-recurrent and therevenue from charges would be needed in future years, if the totalexpenditure was to be kept below the upper limit of  400 millions,in order to offset increasing costs in all parts of the Service.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR said that he had always been opposed to the introduction of charges for dentures and spectacles.In his view it would be undesirable in principle, and politicallydangerous, for the Labour Party thus to abandon the conception ofa free Health Service.    Now that he was aware of the details ofthe Budgetary position he was able to add the further argument thatthis step was not financially necessary.    In a Budget of over  4,000millions it should not be difficult to find so small a sum as  13millions in some other way which would not breach the principle ofa free Health Service.    He was specially disturbed at the prospect that this inroad on the Health Service would be justified by the argu-ment that the money to be saved was needed for the increased defence programme.    He himself believed that shortages of raw material sand machine tools would make it impossible in practice to spendeffectively all the money which was to be allocated under this Budgetto the defence programme;  and in this view he had the support of thePresident of the Board of Trade and the Minister of Supply.   TheDefence Estimates for the coming financial year totalled  1,250millions;   and of this the estimated cost of defence productionamounted to  510 millions. These were large figures and mustbe subject to a substantial margin of error.    He believed that,within that margin, the Chancellor could have found the savings which he proposed to secure by introducing charges under the health service.    The Minister reminded the Cabinet that such chargescould not be imposed without fresh legislation.   Believing, as he did, that such charges would involve a serious breach of Socialist
principles, and having on numerous occasions proclaimed in public speeches his opposition to such a course, he did not see howhe could be expected to vote in favour of such a Bill.    If the Cabinetreaffirmed their decision that these charges should be imposed, hewould be obliged to resign from the Government.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that it was his special duty, in framing the Budget, to determine how thenecessary revenues should be raised to meet essential government expenditure and also, in present circumstances, to form a judgment on the figure of the Budget surplus at which the Government should aim in order to keep inflationary tendencies in check;    The Budgetwhich he had outlined to the Cabinet was a carefully constructed andintegrated plan for regulating the national finances over the coming year;   and it would be difficult for him to modify at the last momentany essential feature of that plan.    The Cabinet should, in particu-lar, be content to leave it to his judgment to determine the size ofthe Budget surplus at which he should aim.    He believed that theestimates of defence expenditure were as reliable as any such estimates could be:  he could not accept the suggest ion that heshould frame his Budget on the as sumption that the out-turn of this expenditure would be something less than the estimate.    He hadtaken the view from the outset that some part of the rising cost ofthe defence programme must be met by reductions in other Govern&quot;ment expenditure:  many of his efforts to secure such reductionshad been frustrated:  and he had now reached a point at which hecould not make any further concessions.    The Cabinet had agreed,on 22nd March, that expenditure on the Health Service should besubject for the time being to an upper limit of  400 millions: hewas satisfied, from his consultations with the Health Ministers,that the cost of the Service could not be kept within that limit withoutthe imposition of charges: he believed that, of the various charges which might be made, these would be the least unpalatable politically:and in all the circumstances he felt obliged to ask the Cabinet tomaintain their earlier decision.A long discussion ensued.   The following is a summary ofthe main points made in it:-(a)    THE MINISTER OF LABOUR and THE PRESIDENT OF THEBOARD OF TRADE thought that the Government would find greatdifficulty in persuading their supporters in the House of commons to accept this departure from the principle of a free Health Service.They considered that some Government supporters would abstain from voting in favour of the legislation authorising the imposition ofthese charges;   and they pointed out that, if only a few government supporters abstained, the Conservative Opposition)by voting againstthe Bill, could bring about a major Government defeat.    In that event the Government would face a General Election in circumstances which would enable the Conservative Party to pose as the championsof a free Health Service.    THE HOME SECRETARY also feared thatthere might be considerable Parliamentary difficulty in securing thepassage of this legislation.On the other side it was pointed out that, so far as con-cerned legislation, the principle of a free Health,Service had alreadybeen breached by the Bill introduced after the HS&amp;Budget authori-sing the imposition of a charge for prescriptions.    This Bill, which
the present Minister of Labour had himself introduced, hadencountered no substantial opposition from Government supportersand had in fact passed into law.    It was not until after the Bill had reached the Statute Book that the Government had decided not toproceed with their plan for making a charge for prescriptions,The preponderant view in the Cabinet was that theGovernment, if they remained united on this issue, would have no substantial difficulty in persuading the Parliamentary Labour Partyto support legislation authorising charges for dentures and spectaclessupplied under the National Health Service.(b) THE MINISTER OF LABOUR said that, in a Budget total -ling over  4,000 millions, there must be tolerances which would allow the Chancellor, if he wished, to forego his insistence on a saving of only  13 millions on the Health Service.    By the exerciseof ingenuity, means could surely be found to avoid having to imposethese charges.    Thus, for the coming financial year, the relatively small amount required might be obtained by increasing the contri-bution made to the Health Service by the National Insurance Fund.Alternatively, the Chancellor might reduce by  13 millions theBudget surplus at which he was aiming.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he wasnot prepared to adopt either of the courses suggested by the Ministerof Labour.    They would both be inflationary in effect.    Moreover,if he had such a sum at his disposal, he would certainly wish toconsider to what purpose it could most usefully be applied.    He was by no means satisfied that, even within the social services, the health Service had the first claims on any additional money thatmight be available,(c) Several Ministers expressed the view that, if the Ministerof Labour resigned from the Government on this issue, an acutepolitical crisis would develop.    With their present Parliamentarymajority the Government could not afford any diminution in theirvoting strength in the House of Commons.    And, if the Governmentfell, as a result of divided counsels within the Cabinet, the LabourParty&apos;s prospects at the following General Election would be verygravely prejudiced.After a prolonged discussion THE FOREIGN secretary said that it seemed clear that the Cabinet would not be able to reach an agreed conclusion at that meeting.    He therefore proposed thatthe discussion should be resumed at a further, meeting later in theday.    In the interval he would see the Prime Minister (who was in hospital) and would report to him the course which the discussion had so far taten.The Cabinet -Agreed to resume their discussion at a meeting later in the day.
