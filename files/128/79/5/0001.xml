It was probable because of the fall in United Kingdom milk output, there would super-levy to be paid from the United Kingdom when it became the end of September.

The task would then be more manageable and the results more readily assessed; the grades concerned &quot;^re those on whom Ministers relied to carry through plans fordemising and improving the performance of the Civil Service; and it Knecessary to demonstrate to the public that the incentives and &quot;&apos;&quot;)lines of performance-related pay applied at senior levels. The llor of the Exchequer had agreed that a gross amount of  4 million ^ght be expended on an agreed   programme of merit bonuses. It &apos;^important to avoid the impression that the Government was &quot;to give more money to the better paid, but not to contemplate )related pay arrangements for the lower paid; or that the~)i performance-related bonuses for some staff would be &apos;the expense of their colleagues.

Even as experiments, the proposed schemes might be inadequate:    it was all too likely that they would be ineffective and fail to produce any useful evidence.    They might also be difficult to withdraw if they were unsuccessful.On the other hand, there were serious difficulties about (troducing experimental schemes for more junior grades. They Id be much more costly in terms of their effect on the pay sand much more difficult to administer and assess.    The Civil trade unions, who were likely in any event to be opposed introduction of performance-related pay arrangements,^particularly active among staff at more junior levels fid try to insist on a degree of rigidity and uniformity &gt;as inappropriate to such arrangements.
