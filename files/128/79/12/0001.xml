CONFIDENTIALTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that problems had arisen over positioning in Ethiopia the Hercules aircraft which the British Government had agreed to make available for famine relief; and over the arrangements for transporting the growing volume of aid to the areas where it was needed.   The attitude of the Ethiopian regime to British offers of help had been unhelpful but appeared to have improved during past 24 hours.    The Ministry of Defence and the Foreign and Common-Lth Office were together endeavouring to accelerate the completion &gt;rangements for the departure of the Hercules aircraft.it was noteworthy that the Soviet Union had at  last come ith a substantial offer of help to Ethiopia, including 24 aircraft ber of vehicles and substantial quantities of rice.    It was, ling that the United Kingdom&apos;s bilateral aid programme for tried to concentrate, over a considerable period, on the mprovement of Ethiopia&apos;s agricultural performance; but these been disrupted by the policies of the Ethiopian regime, including the collectivisation of agriculture.In a brief disc of the Hercules Ethiopian authori Publicity, since . and present at thebase m Ethiopia foron investigation, to water.

CONFIDENTIAL5.     The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr Channon)  (C(84) 31) on the question of credit support for the sale of 40 Tornado aircraft to the Turkish Government.E MINISTER OF STATE, DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that the er for 40 Tornado aircraft, for which the Turkish Ministry of &quot;nce had issued a Letter of Intent, was important not only by virtue size ( 985 million, of which the United Kingdom share would be llion) but also because of its political and strategic implications, ised that there were problems over the financial aspects of r_^   In the light of these, British Aerospace (BAe) had discussed rkish authorities a variation on the financial package whichidered by the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee at its 22 October; under the revised proposals the Turkish Government or 25 per cent of the order in cash and the proportion of the credit to be guaranteed by the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) would be reduced from 40 per cent to 30 per cent.    BAe, for their part, wer&lt;$/p&quot;refc&gt;ared to take on a substantial share of the credit risk; the attitaH k. .cHKthe commercial banks who had been asked to takein cautious until a decision had been taken on but they would probably be prepared to make up tish Government decided to enable the deal ernment had confirmed that they would follow vernment would be likely to do the same, it in terms of employment in the cting a large number of sub-contractors run-down of Tornado production would Finally, it should be borne in on its payments for purchases ofon the balance wo the extent of ECGD the difference.

The key question to be addresV&amp;dVwjfts not the value of the order for Tornados but the capacityvdlrthe Turkish Government to pay for them.   The Turkish economy w^s, currently in a poor way and Turkey had been obliged to reschedule its debts three times in the past six years.    35 per cent of Turkey&apos;s foreign exchange earnings were allocated to debt servicing aKjC^-n the view of the International Monetary Fund, a further resc^tediliing operation could not be excluded.   Turkey&apos;s good record in no^^ T ulting on cash payments for military equipment would not be rtipmHt to a deal involving a high credit element, since this wouT^|r^Ll within any rescheduling regime.b-     Bad debts insured by the ECGD had already added to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) in financial year and this was likely to rise to  450 mil&apos; J985/86.    This existing burden on the PSBR should not be increased.million rrent
CONFIDENTIALc. Of the current ecgd limit of  100 million on credit insurance for Turkey, only  30 million now remained, assuming that the Turkish purchase of Airbus aircraft went ahead.    This should be seen in the light of significant prospects for the United Kingdom in civil business with Turkey, which included a fair chance of winning the order for the second Bosphorus Bridge (worth  25 million) and major power station projects from which a number of British firms could benefit.   Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Ankara had advisedat, at a time when British exports to Turkey across the board e on a strongly upward curve, with the prospect of an increase ,0 per cent in the current year, it would be a mistake to put eggs in the Tornado basket.    It was pointed out, on the and, that civil contracts would be as much affected by a ling of Turkish debts as would defence contracts, although ower order of magnitude.d.

It was pointed out that concluded contract for the suppl would be equivalent to 21,000 man any comparable benefit from the suecontracts (although, if a British consortium won the contract for the second Bosphorus Bridge, the steel fabrication would be carried out in the United Kingdom).f.

It was clear, for example from Turkey&apos;s purchaseof F16 aircraft from the United States in 1983 at a cost of $4,000 million, that Turkey was spending beyond its means, )Much as the United Kingdom would like to sell its Tornado aircraft to V key, it could not in effect give them away.he Cabinet -ted the Secretary of State for Defence and the Minister of &quot;e, Department of Trade and Industry, to be guided by the Minister&apos;s summing up of their disoussion.CONFIDENTIAL167

CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that the line to take following the breakdown of the ACAS talks should be to point out that one-third of NUM members had voted, by a majority of two to one, not to strike and were at work, that the National ssociation of Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers (NACODS) had hed a satisfactory understanding with the NCB not only on the rs of particular concern to its members but also on the fundamental in the dispute, and that the remaining union in the mining indj rt*v, the British Association of Colliery Managers, had remained at^wp^fc^hroughout the dispute.
