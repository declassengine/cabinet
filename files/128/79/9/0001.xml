THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the agreement which had been reached between Her Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of the People&apos;s Republic of China on the future of Hong Kong had been a key feature of discussions at the United Nations in New \York during the previous week.   The terms of the draft settlement had ien generally well received and had attracted favourable comment from representatives of a large number of countries.    The agreement &gt;een welcomed as a characteristically British achievement.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he had met the Soviet Foreign Minister/^-M^N Gromyko, in New York on 27 September and discussions had taken place l^eK_lunch.

The British Government&apos;s posit six would not be forced to leave the Consulate agaThe practical difficulties created by their presenceincrease and might necessitate a running down of the Cons activities and possibly its temporary closure.

CONFIDENTIAL Iage, due to demographic factors, made it more difficult to keep unemployment down.   The importance of moderate pay settlements and higher productivity to keep down unit labour costs and enhance competitiveness, and the damaging effects of industrial action, should also be stressed.b.     The Government should take credit for the success of the Youth Training Scheme (YTS).   It seemed likely that those young eople who had been on the scheme would enjoy greater success subsequently finding employment than those who had been on predecessor, the Youth Opportunities Programme. More lly, the Government&apos;s efforts to keep the wages paid to people down to economic levels, and to improve training, need the employment prospects of young people. By ast, the actions of certain trade unions in insisting that ers must pay excessive wages for young people had had damaging effects on the willingness of those employers to recruit and train young people.   The one point of concern was that the very succe/ffor\ the YTS might worsen the employment prospects of those young&gt;Re&gt;pie who had not been on it.Lon of working age had increased by 158,000 \&gt;2 months, while unemployment (beforeincreased by only 116,000, it was clear icrease in the numbers of those inc.

       The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Environment (C(8A) 28) and a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet (C(84) 25) on local government finance.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that the Party onference agenda contained a motion which urged the Government to e positive steps towards the abolition of the domestic rating em, replacing it eventually with a system of local taxation which ore fairly on a wider spread of the population.   As it stood the was unacceptable, and he proposed that an amendment should be forward which welcomed existing policies and looked forward steps to improve the position of the ratepayer and secure onsibility in local government spending.   The fact was that tes the Government was pursuing had been successful in reducing ^ f growth of local government spending and had achieved the lowest increase in rates for many years.   Nonetheless the whole system  f local government finance was suffering severe strains and present Policies could .jjiik. in his view, hold the position very far into the life of the ne/xt Parliament.   The regime of targets and penaltieswas becoming increasingly unpopular.   The system t-related expenditure assessment, though sound hderstood.

2.     Took note that the Prime Minister would give instructions for the reconstitution of the Sub-Committee on Local Government Finance of the Ministerial Steering Committee on Economic Strategy as proposed in C(84) 25.The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chief Secretary, sury (C(84) 26) about the assumption to be made about pay increases Government&apos;s expenditure plans for 1985-86.SECRETARY, TREASURY said that it was necessary to decide ssume about public service pay increases in public expenditure itimates for 1985-86.   The assumption for 1984-85 was Given the prospects for private sector pay settlements, Lgure for 1985-86 would be seen as unrealistic and could be ineffective:   a higher figure would give the wrong signals about the desirable course of future settlements.   He therefore recommended thatthe figure of apply to all it would not a expenditure fi_ the basis of an A 3 per cent pay 1985-86 and later yecent should be retained.   The assumption would service groups other than those in local government; the nationalised industries.

Despite the rise in mortga seemed likely that the annual rate of inflati would be close to the 4i per .cent forecast at The money supply was well under control; but in high, partly because of the effect of interest States and partly because of the effects of the coa market sentiment.

In discussion, the following main points were made -a.     Although the proposal to set the pay assumption for 1985-86 at 3 per cent was entirely justified, it should be recognised that the Government was finding increasing difficulties in recruiting and retaining the most able people against competition from the private sector.   Civil Service pay arrangements should be made flexible enough to allow higher rewards to be given to people within whatever overall pay settlements could be orded.ere were stronger arguments than seemed to be allowed ) 26 for announcing the Government&apos;s decision on the ssumption for 1985-86.   The decision was likely to leak: theN^act that the Government had not announced it might then be misinterpreted.

CONFIDENTIALIndiscussion, the following main points were made -a.     In the interests of competition policy it was undesirable to transfer the Atlanta route from BCal to BA.   Moreover, although the Secretary of State for Transport had displayed great negotiating skill in bringing BA and BCal so close to agreement, the point to which public opinion was likely to attach most y^^i importance was that the arrangements envisaged were much less ^iL/^-avourable to BCal than the route transfers recommended by the (J^y^&apos;   It would be difficult in these circumstances to defendstence that any route swap should involve the transfer from to BA of the Atlanta route, in which the airline had invested t deal of money and which was crucial to the development of business in that part of the world.the other hand, it was unlikely that BA would accept the proposed exchange unless it included transfer to them of theAtlanta rout different least it privatising importance o Atlanta route.

The Cabinet would prefer to see an exchange of routes between BA and BCal as descjri SH in C(84) 27, but with BCal retaining the route to Atlanta.   BA toght/be accept an exchange on this basis, especially when they were to be awarded the contract for trooping1^ Falkland Islands for which they had tendered.
