Although 19 November was an important date in the campaign to encourage a return to work, it would be important to maintain the momentum after that date, when there would remain some, although smaller, financial incentives for those going back to work.PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the first priority y:o assist the return to work.

Although these figures assumed that the corporation tax birCoCM e electricity industry in 1987-88 was likely to be at least  200 miwjon less than had previously been thought likely, the Secretary of St*&amp; lor Energy had made it clear that even if the reduction  did not m^V&gt;^jTise he would expect the industry to stay within its EFL fej)^^J-88 by savings from some other source.The only remaining progrtJagiJrpWfcas housing.

The reductions wou\V^ T;l most heavily on the construction of new dwellings and conversiot&amp;^^apd home improvement grants, allowing a modest increase in expenditurt^m^renovation and repairs. The Secretary of State for the Envirop^tok* however, considered that the resulting provision would not be aded*rate to meet irreducible housing needs.   The Secretary of State for oc$^nvironment proposed additional gross expenditure of  250 million in $65^86,  350 million in 1986-87, and  400 million in 1987-88, mainly foi^radditional expenditure on renovation and repairs to deal with the substantial new need for repairs to industrialised and system-built housing of the 1950s and 1960s.If the recommendations of MISC 106, and the a Secretary of State for Energy and Treasury Mi electricity industries, were endorsed, the overa exceed baseline provision by  348 million in 198 1986-87, and  934 million in 1987-88.

Good progress had been made towards this in the owner-occupied sector.   But the Government was fallingent was ousedCONFIDENTIAL179
CONFIDENTIAL Ibehind in new building in the public sector for those who could not afford to buy their own homes, in public sector renovation, and in help to poorer owner-occupiers with repairs and improvements. The proposals on housing in C(84) 32 would have very serious effects. The number of households was rising at 190,000 a year.   About 30 per cent all households were unable to afford owner-occupation.   There was se for 75,000 new starts a year in the public sector to deal with resulting need.    In the light of the public expenditure situation prepared to defend a figure of 40,000.    But the proposals in would mean only 19,000 starts a year.    There would be a con%eqj/J&amp;t increase in homlessness and overcrowding which could not be defeiirf^dj^ There were about 4-V4 million dwellings in the public sector which n&amp;yta&gt; be kept in reasonable repair.    It was already estimated that abo r /&apos;l25,000 prefabricated reinforced concrete dwellings would need strux^ural repairs to make them safe, at a cost of about  1.5 billion.   Although the exact size of the problem was not established, a large number of system-built flats and houses, including Ronan Point type blocks, wokrf^need even larger expenditure.    Finally, the condition of the private s( (ctox housing stock was deteriorating.    The increasesimprovement grants in 1982-83 and 1983-84 had &apos;on, but had not reversed it.

Expenditure had to be contained within what could This was especially relevant to home improvement grants been reasonable to increase expenditure on the grants in and 1983-84, when money had been available.   Now that the e,utonomous and formation the price even the f State tlyCONFIDENTIAL^80

Moreover, there was a danger that if expenditure on the grants continued at a high level an expectation would grow up that they would always be paid;   and the Government would de facto have created a new form of subsidy to which many people would think they were entitled and which would be hard to reduce.   Although cutting back on home improvement grants would be unpopular, it was better to take the step now than later.Many features of housing policy needed fresh examination, sums of public money were being paid out in housing benefit, in many cases the social justification for this was open ion.   The prospective addition to the cost of housing was one of the obstacles to a revival in the private sector, which was otherwise very desirable.    There was a good case for substituting loans for home improvement grants, at least in part.

The available evidence suggested that the condition of the housing stock in Wales&lt;Has worse than in England.   There was a large backlog of ap/lic^ions for home improvement grants, equal to several years^fe^oivditure.   All these problems would be  greatly  aggravated if theyorpj/cjsals in C(84) 32 were accepted and the Welsh block budget requrr^wyto accept consequential reductions in accordance with the n raal arrangements.THE PRIME MINISTER,summing up this part of the discussion the Cabinet considered that the housing programme should the original Survey baseline by amounts of  312 million in\  142 million in 1986-87, and  100 million in 1987-88 rather the amounts proposed at the end of paragraph 28 of C(84) 32. figures assumed that it would be possible to increase receipts Programme, particularly through higher sales of council houses, an additional  100 million a year, so that total receipts wouldCONFIDENTIAL181
CONFIDENTIAL 1,700 million in 1985-86,  1,500 million in 1986-87 and  1,400 million in 1987-88.    If these estimates should prove excessive, the Secretary of State for the Environment would be entitled to seek a review of the size of the programme in future Public Expenditure Surveys. So (far as he could, bearing in mind that the allocation of expenditure ts largely a matter for local authorities, the Secretary of State the Environment should try to ensure that the main weight of ictions in expenditure fell on home improvement grants.   The Cabinet&apos;s lion had revealed a number of unsatisfactory features in ^housing policy, which should be reviewed.
