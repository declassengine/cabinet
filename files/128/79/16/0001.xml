The corresponding figure in the current week waa likely to be about 2,000.    The fall in numbers was partly due to th^/smmller immediate financial incentives for those returning and pais^v^Jw. widespread intimidation, particularly in the North East and York&amp;hirie.    The case of Mr Michael Fletcher, a Yorkshire miner who had been Vfe^zrfybly assaulted in his own home by a gang, had received extensive puM^ifty and had made many miners in Yorkshire less willing to return to wc(pj &lt;^^yen so, only 37 pits had been on strike orsvember, compared with 94 at the beginning Board (NCB) hoped to consolidate this &gt;ects of being able to use the large the pits in question were notpicketed out on Wednes of the month.

The prosecution could apply for an expedited hearing; but the defence was entitled to object.    It must also be remembered that undue haste could lead to inadequate presentation of the evidence, especially on such aspects as the involvement of third parties, and even to the quashing of a conviction on appeal.   Expediting one case also meant that other cases must be deferred, to the detriment of the defend-The Solicitor General would draw the attention of the DPP J\e arguments of public policy in favour of applying for an ^xpeJVited hearing of the Fletcher case;   but  the DPP would need to v*g* ]t*jiall the factors in reaching his decision.c.  ^r^extensive publicity which had been given to Mr Fletcher and nvis injuries could well make it impossible to hold a fair trial in Yorkshire.
