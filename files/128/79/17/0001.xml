The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House of Commons in the following week.SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that Clause 1 of the Local ^ment Bill, which contained the principle of abolition of the Greater Council and the Metropolitan County Councils, would be taken in Cdlirf^tce of the whole House on 12 and 13 December.   Already 37 substantive amendmTO*^ to the clause had been tabled and it seemed inevitable that a guillwtlw^would be required.

The events suggested that some Conservative Members of Parliament who allegedly supported the Governments economic policy did not in fact fully understand it.   There was a gre more clearly the Government&apos;s strategy of reducit proportion of Gross National Product in order to fr| reductions in income tax.   These must be directed at threshold for the payment of tax; far too many people-relatively low incomes.   This, combined with high le benefits, created the unemployment trap which discourage* unemployed from seeking work.   A low income tax threshold demand for higher wage increases than would otherwise be the perceived deficiency was in net income and it was regard? to secure pay rises than increases in the tax threshold.

CONFIDENTIALTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the situation in Sri Lanka was bad.    Tamil terrorists had recently mounted a more effective and stronger campaign against the Sri Lankan Government, operating in part from bases in south India.   President Jayawardene of Sri Lanka would shortly renew his efforts to reach agreement with the Tamil United beration Front but his prospects of success were poor; the President therefore, attempt to impose a solution but such an attempt was ly to succeed.    There was resentment in Sri Lanka over the Indian ment&apos;s inactivity with regard to terrorist bases in Tamil Nadu. The Government had made it clear that the Sri Lankan Government could any military assistance from the United Kingdom under the 1947 reement.    The Sri Lankans had, however, requested of the United also of the United States and Japan the loan of naval patrol se against Tamil terrorists operating from India.    It was possible for the British Government to supply vessels of the but it would, in any case, be politically inadvisable for the m to meet the Sri Lankan request.Defeh King vessel unlikely required United Kinisation&gt;luSllst Ve 2 nS&lt;THE SECRETARY OF ttT/ the Defence Plannr Treaty Organisation of the Defence PlannT of the new Secretary-G&apos;e success.

It was rtheless desirable to promote a more rational structure for ltation on defence matters and thus to reduce the tendency of theStates to deal directly with either the Federal Republic of ^^or with France, to the possible detriment of British interests.THE SECKBagSY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that although the improvement in the clna  of Anglo-French relations had also been apparent at the meeting ofwie Franco-British Council in Avignon on 30 November which he had attended^ he hoped that the French Government could be persuaded to improve the calibre of its Ministerial representation at future meetings of the Council.

The European Council d reached a satisfactory agreement that the Community and its member tes would provide 1.2 million tonnes of grain for African countries, in cular Ethiopia, before the next harvest.    This was a major effort. Id be achieved, however, without a supplementary budget. The ,tive discussion of the work of the committees established at the eau European Council had been deferred until next year. Finally, budgetary discipline had now been adopted.In disc^jfSroh it was pointed out that, as France was now becoming a net contributg^*J&gt; the Community budget, there would be an increasing convergence/uetween French and British views.    It was said that the integrated mediterranean programmes had been a French invention but, with the change in the situation, their enthusiasm for these programmes had now almost vanished.    In an enlarged Community the changes would be even more fundamental.   The/^erTwpe for the Mediterranean member states to shift the balance of agriciHj^jral expenditure even more towards their commodities would be increased^y^mwas important that we should foster the closer relationship which i^&amp;^ay developing with the French.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE^ &apos; of Ministers (Fisheries) oi between the Community and No&gt; decisions might be held up byiHERIES AND FOOD said that at the Council jember it was apparent that the negotiation auld be difficult and that some otherCulturesPortTHE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES&apos;AS&gt; FOOD said that at the Council of Ministers (Agriculture) on 10-11 De^jBb c there would be strong pressure on the United Kingdom to agreeWvJ^4,eeiling on the total amount of hill subsidy which might be paid to a^A^dividual farmer.
