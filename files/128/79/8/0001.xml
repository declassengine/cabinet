CONFIDENTIALinSthes2? 3othe 2Silet1-     THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that six leaders Of Opposition Parties in South Africa remained in the British Consulate in Durban, which they had entered on 13 September. Their Presence in the Consulate, which was small and lacking in facilities, was giving rise to considerable inconvenience. The x men clearly could not be allowed to stay in the Consulate efinitely; but it would be wrong for the British Government to el them to leave or to become involved in negotiations on their with the Government of South Africa.   A lawyer representing sition leaders, Mr Yacoob, had arrived in London on ^pteijiber and had asked to see both the Prime Minister and bimsQ^^^The Government&apos;s position had been explained to him by a seniot^bxeign and Commonwealth Office official.   There had been some sugV^tion from the South African side of a deal by which the South African authorities would rescind detention orders on the six Opposition leaders if court proceedings against four South Africans in the United Kingdom were to be dropped, but this suggestion seemed unlikely to be pursued.   Given time, the situation Was likely to rasolwe itself and ways were being considered of easing the probi^B/gr^dually towards a solution.THE FOREIGN AND COMMO: Federation concluded b to a marriage of conveni , Meanwhile, France had rea consulting the  Chad Gover Libyan forces from Chad inSECRETARY said that the Treaty of jibya, Morocco and Chad in August amounted jich was unlikely to prove durable, agreement with Libya, without ?n the withdrawal of French and near future.d that the Royal Navy force s in the Red Sea hadeared to be a Soviet covery would not be rly identified.

Furthermore, the evidence suggested that his rettfr^fc Soviet Union had been voluntary:   he was much attached to daughter, who had not been permitted to leave the Soviet Unirfr join him.   The British authorities had made the fact of hisCONFIDENTIALHi
CONFIDENTIALdisappearance from the United Kingdom known in order to pre-empt Soviet publicity.   The story which Mr Bitov had given out in Moscow would command little credence.   An assessment of the implications of the disclosure of certain names, addresses and telephone numbers had concluded that this was embarassing, but not seriously damaging British security.    The main consequence of the episode might be eter other potential Soviet defectors.EIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that it was difficult ct how the Soviet Union would choose to pursue the matter: campaign of distortions could not be excluded. During ming meeting with the Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr Gromyko, he would himself adopt a dismissive line.   He considered ave been a genuine defector who changed his mind, possibly ure involving his family, and decided to return to the Soviet Union.Ns0thTHE SECRETARY 0: Operation LIONHEA publicity in Weste despite the dock str reinforcing the Briti smoothly.

CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, inviting the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary to open a discussion of the draft White Paper, explained that it had been decided that it would be helpful if she were to see the Unofficial Members of the Hong Kong Executive Council (EXCO), before the draft White Paper and draft agreement were formally )considered by Cabinet.   She had accordingly met the Unofficial &quot;smibers of EXCO   on the previous evening, 19 September.   It was this reason that, although it was not usual to disclose in ince the content of agenda for Cabinet, it had on thism been made known that Cabinet would be considering the lite Paper and agreement at its meeting on the followingCOMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the discussions with the Uno&amp;i tal Members of EXCO had been candid and comprehensive. Inevitably they still had some reservations about the draft agreement on the future of Hong Kong, but Sir S Y Chung and his colleagues had concluded that they could and would commend the agreement to the peoni^^pf Hong Kong in good conscience and would recommend that ti/tltyould be endorsed.   They had expressed their satisfaction wibtottS^Government&apos; s conduct of the negotiations with the Chinese and we^eiirticularly pleased that the key points?d by the Unofficial Members of the Executive 5LC0) in May had largely been met.

The Foreign and ulties still remained, the shape and form over that part of it f the proposed White Paper and especial&quot;!which explained the provisions of the agreement.

It was accepted tt c^ public disagreement with the Chinese over the contents of the Whit^a^fix would be Highly undesirable at this stage and, although h&quot;e^Wd to make one final attempt to secure the withdrawal of Chi^a^cAjections, he was prepared in the last resort to drop the explana^V^otes which made up the third part of the draft White Paper.   He v Unofficial Members of EXCO had recognised that the dri was a historic document, embodying a historic solution t colonial problem.   He believed that it could lead to sig improved relations between the United Kingdom and the Republic of China.   He hoped that members of the Cabinet, a one course Members of Parliament, would consider the draft to be acceptable, and that his colleagues would now agree thathat theCONFIDENTIAL

On a different point, concerning paragraph 7  f th^Jrrfat Declaration by the United Kingdom and Chinese Governm^jrvL^it was pointed out that its provision for &quot;free flow of oapital&apos;^af crucial and that there might be a risk of discrimination by the Cheese Government against Hong Kong Chinese who wished to move their capital out.   It was noted, however, that Section VII of Annex 1 to the agreement specifically provided that the Government  f the Hong Kong/ phoial Administrative Region (SAR) should safeguard the free flow of(capital within, into and out of the SAR.    It was noted that prelim?tt&gt;ry^discussions so far with most sectors of United Kingdom Parliamentfo^pinion offered substantial grounds for optimism as to how the draf t^g^ment would be received by Parliament as a whole.THE PRIME MINISTER, summin agreement represented a r which she and the Foreign the Unofficial Members of EX^ Members of the Legislative Co the consultation which had been&quot; Place on record the Government&apos;s and statesmanlike role which thethe discussion, said that the draft le achievement.
