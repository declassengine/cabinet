CONFIDENTIALIn discussion it was pointed out that there was nothing unprecedented about the nature of the increases in supplementary benefit payments or the deduction in respect of deemed strike pay, nor in the manner in vwhich it had been announced.    It was clear that the media (and some Jembers of Parliament) had not appreciated that the increase in theRuction was accompanied by an increase in supplementary benefit payments would leave over 99 per cent of the families of striking miners ivse off and give 85 per cent of them some increase in cash terms.  200 families might lose a small amount.    These changes were and provided for in legislation.   Over  20 million had already in supplementary benefit to the families of striking miners, ^ot appropriate for the taxpayer to make payments to strikers especially when their own union would not provide strike pay funds.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that there were two areas for concern.    The first was that the Government&apos;s action should bect light; for that purpose additional briefing should and to Members of Parliament.

CONFIDENTIAL3.     THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that there was likely to be a renewed outbreak of wrangling between India and Pakistan. The Indian Prime Minister, Mr Rajiv Gandhi, was evidently using the foreign ogey and anti-Pakis tani feeling for electoral purposes.   The deterioration Indo-Pakistani relations was therefore likely to continue until after Indian general election on 24 December.    So far as relations between and the United Kingdom were concerned, the British High Commissioner Delhi had reported continuing threats in Indian governmental circles de boycott in the event of behaviour by the Sikh community in the gdom which the Indians might regard as provocative.    This posed isk: export contracts worth  5 billion could be at stake.
