Their effect was to restrict _to stop and search to policemen in uniform, to disqualify irom confessions obtained improperly, and to make racial)n a specific disciplinary offence.   The last two had been  6rd Scarman.   It was essential to reverse the first of dments and to substitute a Government amendment for the second during the remaining stages of the Bill in the House of Commons.

CONFIDENTIAL2      THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that during a police search of the grounds of the French Ambassador&apos;s residence on Tuesday October, in preparation for the State Visit by the President of the vo^ench Republic, President Mitterrand, two small containers of high^losive had been discovered.    It had emerged that these were placed by a French security officer who was in London in connection with *&quot;2sident*s visit, apparently to test the efficacy of British security The officer had been interviewed by police at the Grosvenor :1 where he was staying.   He had been found to have more ^with him there, and these had been retained by the police. The &gt;een further questioned at West End Central Police Station and id.    The police had subsequently decided not to bring anyhim.    It appeared that he had avoided airport security travelling from Paris by revealing his status as a security libers of Parliament and others had expressed grave concern over what had happened.    So far the French Government had made no official statement.

CONFIDENTIALend, the three showed no disposition to leave.   As a result, criticism by the South African Government of the British Government&apos;s handling of the iffair had increased.   The four South African citizens facing charges jider United Kingdom customs and excise legislation had failed to appear veourt, in Coventry, on 22 October: the court had accordingly ordered their bail, amounting to  400,000, should be forfeited.   The South Ml Government had sought to demonstrate legal justification for its kto return the four defendants to the United Kingdom; the court in \had, in fact, ruled that the South African diplomat, Mr Pelser, }od surety for the four defendants had not been guilty of ^conduct.   The South African Ambassador had been summoned by of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Mr Rifkind), and ^Xp&amp;can Government had been urged to reconsider its position. It seemed {mlikely, however, that it would do so, and the outlook remained uncertain. Mfarious means of bringing pressure to bear on the South African Government to disgorge the four defendants had been considered and there had been^demands from Members of Parliament that the South African AmbassadoV^sn^uld be withdrawn.   However, the only realistic means  f expressing the\^g eiw2th of the British Government&apos;s disapproval of South African condu/c^^mild have been to expel Mr Pelser, and this option had now been made le&amp;S^re^sible by the court&apos;s personal exoneration of him.   Mr Pelser&apos;s expd^&amp;w&amp;would in any case lead only to retaliation in Kind by the South Af ricaj^tfvernment.   The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that his cnnvbrtion was that the overall interests of the united Kingdom&apos;s relations ^&amp;H&gt;^South Africa required that there should be no punitive action by the B*^jJJLX5overriment.   The Government&apos;s objective should continue to be to limrt^rfl^damage of the Durban episode to these wider interests; but the situas^pn^jnemained very difficult.that he had made an previous day of increased at ion of drought and famine following a Private Notice depth of Members&apos; anxietyTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY.^ announcement in the House of Commons . &quot;nited Kingdom aid to Ethiopia, where -had become desperate.

It had to be recognised, however, that relgKfea  J* order were wholly inadequate to the scale of the prob\&amp;^^^v% according to one estimate, at least 60,000 tonnes of reliefi^fcals m uth.   Relief on this scale far exceeded the cargo capacil Hercules aircraft available and the problem was compounded of roads in the region of Ethiopia worst affected and by the ^vil War in the country.   There was so far no evidence of the ^version by the Ethiopian authorities of aid for whose di, **d Cross and the Save the Children Fund were responsible althou^ was clearly a risk of this.

The Soviet Union, for its yt, was doing nothing whatsoever to help.rief discussion it was pointed out that the revelation through jon reports of the scale of the disaster in Ethiopia had inevitably central political issue and that there was already evidence of sition on the part of the Labour Party to make political capital situation.   Not least in view of the summer&apos;s record harvest of agricultural surpluses in the European Community, there public pressure for an adequate response to the situation fsh Government and any steps which might be taken should be given effective publicity.   There was agreement that it would be important to instigate a concerted and effective response from the European Community and that an appropriate message should be sent to the Irish Presidency as soo/^i^\possible.The Cabinet -2.

CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that the calling off of   the NACODS dispute was a serious blow to the NUM.   The strategy should continue to be one of ensuring that the NUM was isolated from effective support from other unions.   Any further initiatives, and the kandling of the media, should be considered in that context. The iate line to take should be to point out that one-third of NUM rs had voted, by a two to one majority, not to strike and were at that NACODS had reached a satisfactory understanding with the only on the matters of particular concern to its members but ai^o^^rv^he fundamental issues in the dispute, and that the remaining &quot;nic^^rf^he mining industry, the British Association of Colliery Manag6i j&lt;Rad remained at work throughout the dispute.   By contrast, the remainin^NjJM members who were on strike had been deprived of the opportunS&amp;rfpfor a ballot.   It would be deeply disturbing if the TUC now though^ fit to side with the NUM leadership and against those in the industry who wished to continue working.The CabineTook note,Cabinet Office 26 October 1984
