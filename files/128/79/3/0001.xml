It was by no means clear that rt was sensible, either initially or in the longer term, for elections for the new ILEA to be held at different times from the London borough elections^ -Furthermore there appeared to be particularly substantial disadvarrya^f^ in holding the first elections, as proposed, in October 1985.    On the\ had been clearly stated in the White Paper &quot;Streaml the intended date for the abolition of the GLC, the* elections were not due until May 1986 and it was in that the members of the new education authority should^ before the date of abolition in order to plan the 1986-S level of precept and other matters.    It was arguable that, dangerous to leave these matters in the hands of the exist: have to make interim arrangements for the period between the&quot;* the GLC and May elections.    There would also be substantial cTi in delaying the date of abolition, even though the decision foi elected ILEA had been made since the 1 April 1986 date had been One possibility might be for the non-GLC members of the existing^hand, 1 April 1986 the Cities&quot; as in borough ie desirable place wellCONFIDENTIAL

On the other hand it was likely that direct elections would produce an ILEA not very different in its political composition from the  ^/pexisting authority.    On this view the arguments for bringing the nev ILEA &lt;^^&gt;^ections forward to October 1985 were less strong, and it was forideration whether the borough elections due to be held in May 1986 be brought forward to coincide with an election for the new ILEA in 1986.THE /T^jtlMR MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that it was not Possibl^co reach an immediate decision.

It had therefore been decided to expel from London two members ofNigerian High Commission staff, a Counsellor and an Attache; tmeytyould be required to leave within seven days.    The High Commissioner h42n j*3S \ had been recalled to Lagos for consultations, and the Foreign and Conmojjwealth Secretary intended to make it clear, in his statement to Parlrsr^Ht: later in the day, that it would be inappropriate for the High CommWM^er to return to London.   Meanwhile, reactions in Nigeria to the episode-^a^\^een very strong.    The Federal Military Government (FMG) were threat&amp;p/j&amp;g to take action against the British Government in retaliation for aiP^geti (but nonexistent) official United Kingdom involvement in the recent\\ui4n horised departure from Nigeria of an HS 125 aircraft.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary &lt;^0\\ said that in an exchange of messages with the Nigerian Foreign Minister, ^/pMr Gambari, the latter had taken a relatively emollient line, stressing wish to maintain good relations with the United Kingdom; secret ~orts, however, indicated that his attitude was unlikely to be well y&apos;ved or endorsed by his colleagues in the FMG.    It was relevant that, weV^hefore this latest episode, there had been indications of anapproach on the part of the FMG to Nigeria&apos;s relationship with the/ttp/flQsd Kingdom.    Despite the adverse consequences, it was nevertheless right rp^o ahead with the course which had been outlined.In a br^^fe^Tzscussion the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary was congratula ed/j n adopting a position which had made it possible to take tough actr#fx&quot;against the offenders in London while not making it impossible 5$r the Nigerian Government to react moderately, if they were inclined to do so.    It would be important to represent the United Kingdom&apos;s reaction to the attempted abduction as part of its general response to such .rfJcitients following the episode of the Libyan People&apos;s Bureau rather tha(^^svaction specifically directed against Nigeria. It was pointed out thiT^eS^ous problems were likely to arise in the United,ship with Nigeria, although these did not ting a different course to that which the setary had outlined.

A strong protest was being made to the Iranian Government.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that he h3&amp;^ Kended a meeting in Madrid on 9 July, with the Defence Ministers of Fraf^ce/U Germany, Italy and Spain, to discuss the project for a new European f i gh-pe*/a ire raft.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the result of the debate in the House of Commons on 10 July about the agreement in the European Council had been satisfactory.    The debate had shown, however, some anxiety whether effective Community budgetary discipline would be established.    He had made clear that the British overnment would not be recommending an increase in the Community&apos;s resources until the discussions on budgetary discipline had been &quot;ed further forward.    On the 1983 refund for the United Kingdom d told the President of the European Parliament, Mr Dankert, that ^Jrobted Kingdom was looking for an early decison to transfer the buirgej^p^ovision from the reserve chapter to the operational budget line&lt;e^sjpice all member states had now agreed to this.THE CHAmJ z j0R OF THE EXCHEQUER said that at the Council of Ministers (Financey^H 9 July, it had been agreed that the high-level group of Community ^officials would now work out the arrangements on budgetary discipline resulting from the provisional conclusions of the European Council in March which had now been agreed by the European Council at FontaitfSMeau.    The approach had been business-like, and he considered th(at: tyaere would be some improvement on the existing system.    It was rm^rt^nt, however, to avoid building up too great expectations about ibud&gt;g^tary discipline.    It would be very difficult to get results in a j^dlly binding form.The Cabinet -Took note.4.

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he had told the Cabinet at their meeting on 5 July that, although prospects for output, inflation, investment and productivity were broadly satisfactory, eten t^e financia^ markets were going through a difficult period.

Further difficulties seemed likely to result . from the decision of the National Union of\Seamen (NUS) to prohibit movements of freight, but not passengers, by Sealink ferries in protest against the impending privatisation of Sealink.

The occasion for the dispute seemed totally inadequatTeXoyit was possible that the leaders of the TGWU had seized on it in^rp^r to call a strike in support of the National Union of Mineworkers&apos;T^tfl^) Alternatively, and perhaps more plausibly, their aim might be l /v exploit the situation created by the coalminers&apos; strike to extVncL^fteCONFIDENTIAL51
operation or interpretation of the NDLS.   Ministers should point out to the media and public opinion that the occasion for the present dock strike was flimsy; and that the NDLS itself made provision for the resolution of disputes.    They should also emphasise that a very small number of workers was jeopardising the jobs of many more workers in other parts of the economy.The NDLS was indefensible in principle.    If the aim of the TGWU to extend it to other areas outside the ports, it would probably ^cessary to run the risk of a continued dock strike in order to &quot; this aim.    But if the aim was only to achieve a continuation cheme, or even some reinterpretation of it, it might be encourage a settlement.   The Government&apos;s priority should eat the coalminers&apos; strike.   Many RDWs were afraid, partly ult of statements by representatives of the port employers, that the NDLS might be radically amended or abolished.    The leaders of the TGWU had played on such fears.    The Government should make it plain that it^j&amp;d no plans to introduce legislation to alter or abolish the N&lt;DLS).jc.      If the st of grain, anima less than in the likely that indust supplies if there were national dock strike previous occasions inread, problems might soon develop over supplies and bacon.    However, the country depended far ports covered by the NDLS.    It was also show considerable ingenuity in securing xtended strike.    For these reasons, a Id be much less damaging than on the &apos; 1972.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up .
