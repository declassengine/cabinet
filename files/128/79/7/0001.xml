The Cabinet would wish to put on record their warm ion of all the work which Lord Cockfield had done, and the^ gre^&amp;ntribution he had made to the development of the Government s pollc&gt; ?and the furtherance of its achievements, as Secretary of State%^)rrade and as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. _ The Cabinet^Vw also recognise the spirit of public service which had prompted his acceptance of nomination to be a member of the Commission of the European Community.    It was a measure of the importance which attached to this office that a Cabinet Minister of Lord Cockfield&apos;s standing and experience should be nominated; there was no doubt th^tTtk would make a very able and formidable Commissioner.The Cabinet1   Unanimous expressions of w of appreciation owarmly endorsed the Prime Minister&apos;s to the new members of the Cabinet and Cockfield&apos;s services.2.

CONFIDENTIALTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that Royal Navy ships, together with mine-sweepers  from  the French, United States and Italian navies, were continuing to help in the search for mines in the Red Sea, following the damage caused to a number of ships by explosions there before mid-August.   No mines had so far been &apos;iscovered.    It was possible that the explosions had been caused devices placed on the seabed and equipped with self-destruct anisms.

No Iranian^offensive had materialised and there had been no further attempts at mediation.   Attacks on shipping in the Gulf by both sides were continuing.   There was increasing evidence of lack of unity in the IrMaW leadership although the situation was not clear cut.

A further reduction in the ^e of the proposed supplementary budget for 1984 had been achieved, other issues, including the United Kingdom&apos;s 1983 and 1984  tes, the text of the revised Own Resources Decision and the &gt;n of budget discipline had not been finally resolved.

CONFIDENTIALfurther negotiation had taken place with a more satisfactory result; in particular, the increase in the permitted by-catch was now on a temporary basis until the end of May 1985.   The permitted by-catch was now 18 per cent but for the more sensitive species, such as cod, was only 8 per cent.    In his view this was a good result of the otiation.   Scottish fishermen, however, had criticised the results,TH^I&gt;V;TER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that the Comn^gii^i&apos;s report to the Council of Ministers on the implementation of th&amp;^JX quota system would be available next week.

The main matter of pot contention with NACODS arose from the fact that members of had recently been told that they would not receive pay unles were prepared to be in attendance at pits where any men, eventalks broke down, the NCB on pay, redundancy terms, development of the coal ts members on whether toThe President of the ge in order to be free, to maintain that he haduties and26 Septemberof two-thirds ; earlier rike action, takenCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALonly a handful, were at work.    In most areas this created no difficulty. However, in Yorkshire, where there was heavy picketing at certain pits at which only a very few men were working, members of NACODS had to pass through several thousand pickets of local members of the NUM and faced the prospect of intimidation both then and later.   The NCB would need to deal with this situation flexibly.HOME SECRETARY said that the situation regarding law and order had changed greatly since the Cabinet&apos;s previous discussion. There till heavy picketing in some areas, particularly Yorkshire; but imum number of pickets at any one place was about 3.000 and was ade up of local men.    In most places, the numbers were much er^&gt;This supported the view that the number of active pickets $* t*d&gt;:   as they withdrew to ooncentrate on pits in Yorkshire, o be available for picketing in other fields. Although 1ntimidavkjj &apos;&apos;continued, there were signs that the police action to counter ix\was beginning to bring results.   The number of arrests for serious offences against persons and property had increased substantially ln the week between 4 and 11 September.   There was, however, delay inyrious cases to trial. So far, there had been a Ithan 6,000 arrests;   about 5,000 of the resulting be tried.

CONFIDENTIALb.       The continued delay in bringing cases of serious alleged offences to trial was a matter for concern.   Violence appeared to go undeterred; both the Government and the legal system risked being brought into disrepute.   Consideration should be given to ways of bringing pressure on local magistrates&apos; committees to make more effective use of the services of stipendiary magistrates, who could readily be made available:    the Government might, for example, make it known that the cause of delay was at local level and challenge the magistrates&apos; committees to more co-operative.^e/\_ The effect of maintaining law and order on pickets&apos; lines &lt;0p^r&lt;tably reduced policing elsewhere.
