The appeal was being heard at present and of the Court of Appeal was expected shortly, but would probably not be available before he made his Business Statement to the House that afternoon.    He considered that it would be politically acceptable to hold^E&amp;e debate only if the Court of Appeal found in the Government&apos;s favcf/r styd refused Mr Smedley leave to appeal to the House of Lords (even thoSV^+t^v would be able to apply to the House itself for leave).

Even after the judgment, assuming it was in the nment&apos;s favour, there would be strenuous objections to a debate an appeal to the House of Lords was possible or pending.

He therefore proposed that exp allocations to English local authorities for 1985-86 shoul  3,031 million divided as follows:     1,576 million for hous  320 million for other services;  325 million for education;  640 million for transport;  70 million for personal social se and  100 million for supplementary allocations for those localwere likely to s because of of the housing to continue ubstantial econfidential

It would conflict with repeated assurances by Ministers that authorities would be able to use aantial proportion of their capital receipts to supplement their at ions.    It would unite against the Government the localies most generally disposed to support it; and the construction would see it as a direct attack on investment in ture.
