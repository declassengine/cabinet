CC(8&gt;&lt;0 2Ut\\ Conclusions  e 1HE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the Government had ered a serious defeat during the Committee Stage of the Local nment (Interim Provisions) Bill.    An amendment moved by lwyn-Jones, which would prevent the operation of the main &lt;^i^ons of the Bill until after Royal Assent had been given to B H\&gt;to abolish the Greater London Council and the Metropolitan CounVyje^uncils, had been agreed by 191 votes to 143.    The size of the d  *a^was largely due to a considerable number of Conservative Peers r^sys&gt; g to attend because they disliked the suspension of electionsVfreiore the passage of the main Bill was complete, and particularly the change in political control in London during the interim period which would result from the operation of the Bill&apos;s provisions.    They regarded this as a bad precedent and a procedure with which a Con^r5&gt;etive Government should not be involved.    In his view it was now (essential to produce a compromise policy which still postponed the May^3#5yelections in the authorities to be abolished, but which did not fltDVXj}  for councillors to be nominated by the lower tier author it le-^/in^the interim period.    After discussion and consultation he had co-Ac^y^ed that this could best be achieved by an amendment which would r^prewe\the.Elwyn-Jones amendment, but, in substitution, provide for th^period of office of the existing councillors to be ex t en de dentil April 1986, when abolition would take place.    This would, hovg^^X increase the time in which the existing councillors could, if^*heV wished, follow obstructive policies.    He considered that N^/ powers to the Bill to prevent nisr be possible to counter all forms &gt; obstruction would not necessarilyabolition authorities.   He felt that^f^ehould be possible to get such a package accepted by the House Vf^Xords and he therefore &apos; proposed that the necessary amendments (jfatfxdd be tabled at Report Stage in the House of Lords.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion,  said that the Cabinet agreed with the course of action propos^d^y the Lord President of the Council.

He had stressed the independent positions and attitudes of the individual Western leaders with whom the Soviet leadership had recently engaged in talks, but it was clear that the Russians were, for the time being, reluctant to evise their negative view of the West as a whole and that their inds were closed.    There had, however, been some indication ofembarrassment over the exchanges between the Soviet and United s Governments, which had coincided with his visit, aboute negotiations on arms control in outer space.    The condition o&apos;i /^pV^oviet President, Mr Chernenko, had seemed unchanged since his me^C^ng with the Prime Minister in February last.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s strictureg^on the puerile language in which his Soviet interlocutors occasional^&apos; indulged in attacking the United States had drawn something approaching an apology from Mr Chernenko.   Mr Gromyko was clearly pre-eminent in determining the Soviet Union&apos;s relations with the rest of the w^r5&gt;J, and the choice of Mr Chernenko to succeed Mr Andropov doublnlesjgowed much to his limited capacity for interference in this and other^^aVj of policy.

The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C(84) 17) on economic prospects; a memorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury (C(84) 18) on the 1984 Public Expenditure Survey; and a further memorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury (C(84) 16) on using private enterprise in Government.E CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the outlook for growth and &quot;ation in the United Kingdom remained much the same as at the of the Budget; but the pressures on the world economy from United States policies were a cause for continuing concern.    In the world economy, recovery was continuing.

SECRETTHE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY said that the baseline for the 1984 Public Expenditure Survey was  131.7 billion in 1985-86,  136.3 billion in 1986-87 and  139.0 billion in 1987-88.    For 1985-86 and 1986-87 this represented the planning figures in the White Paper &apos;The Government&apos;s Expenditure Plans 1984-85 to 1986-87&apos;  (Cmnd 9143) ess the savings resulting from the abolition of the National surance Surcharge.    For 1987-88 the baseline had been constructed dding 2\ per cent to the provision for 1986-87, excluding the arkland Islands and the local authority unallocated margin. His colleagues had put forward substantial bids for additional provision in all three years,  totalling,  in net terms,   5 billion in 1985-86 rising to  8i billion in 1987-88.

It also provided, more generally in the public sector, a much-needed incentive for increasing value for money and other benefits.    Progress so far had been disappointing.    The obstacles eluded union opposition, management inertia and,  in the case of e local and health authorities, politically-motivated obstruction. Secretary of State for the Environment was expected to report to Ministers collectively on the legislative options for extending contracting out in local government.    In September 1983 all health authorities had been asked to draw up programmes to implement compulsory tendering for cleaning, catering and laundry services.    The responses to this r^uest were being assessed by the Department of Health andSocial Service of that a for furth  18 million 1979 and Apr 2,000 could be represented the Government Depar contracting out a ran their top managementHe suggested that the Secretary of State for Social be invited to inform his colleagues of the conclusions nt as soon as it was completed, and to make proposals In central Government,  some 20,000 posts and ear had been saved by contracting out between Present plans assumed that only a further April 1988.   He could not believe that this pe for contracting out by Departments, ould be required to test the market for specified services; they should also use ystems to identify functions which could suitably be contracted out.    If his colleagues agreed, he would arrange for officials to consider how best and in what timescale to proceed, and would make -a further progress report to the Cabinet in the following year.In discussion, there was gener economic policy and public exp the Exchequer and the Chief Sec important that the Government had expenditure would not be allowed to time of the present Parliament; this must on no account be broken.The following points were also made -jement with the approach tooutlined by the Chancellor of Treasury.    It was particularly an expectation that public real terms over the life-it ion was still fragile anda. There were threats to the prospects for a continued fall in inflation from the decline in the value of sterling against the United States dollar.    It was reassuring that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was confident th^^ provided strict fiscal any   monetary disciplines were m^^^Pyied, the inflation forecast remained realistic.b. The continued high level of increases in the private sector was a major cause for concern, partly justified, as reflecting higher productivity a increase in hours worked.    Nevertheless, unit labour co in this country were moving unfavourably in comparison8SECRET31
SECRETmany of our competitors.    Moreover,  the difference in the rate of increase in earnings between the public and private sectors was bound to lead to demands for higher increases in the public sector.    It would be desirable to discuss the situation with the Confederation of British Industry.c.     The Government must bring home to public opinion that excessive pay increases reduced employment.    It was a striking fact that over the past ten years real earnings per head in the United States had fallen, and the numbers in employment had increased by some 15 million, while in Western Europe over, the same period real earnings had incr^fc^ed substantially and the number of people in work ..en.    There was less unemployment in the United Japan than in other industrialised countries increases there were related to output, public ;ook a lower proportion of the gross domesticha StS beca^ expenproduct,&quot;he labour markets were more flexible,d. These of European to present ce the European Cd as ways of incrshould also be brought to the attention s.    In this context it would be helpful the British proposals for developing ,y,  such as freer trade in services, ing employment.e.     Although the Government&apos;s economic strategy had brought about great improvements, there was no room for complacency. Much still remained to be JPfee to increase economic efficiency.    The Government&apos;s aim should be not merely to hold public expenditure constant in real terms, but to redui .   :t.that unemployment number of people in higher than ind women and part-mployment register, economically and socially, that large numbers of middle-aged men could not get a job and had little prospect of doing so.

SECRETh.     Table 2.4 of the 1984 Financial Statement and Budget Report showed a public expenditure planning total for 1987-88 of  141i billion instead of the  140.4 billion proposed by the Chief Secretary, Treasury.   The difference was partly due to technical factors and partly to the use of a different uplift factor.    It did not reflect an intention to impose a general squeeze on public expenditure.j.     Many of the problems of controlling public expenditure were due to local authority expenditure, both capital and current.    Relations between central and local government were strained; and many local authorities systematicallyMembers of Parliament and others to influence them  he Government&apos;s policies.

SECRET%TLordTHE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion,  said that the Cabinet wholeheartedly endorsed the approach to economic policy and public expenditure outlined by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Chief Secretary, Treasury and approved the specific proposals in (84) 16 and 18.    The Chief Secretary, Treasury should pursue ilateral discussions of expenditure programmes and manpowerocations with the Ministers responsible and then report further he Cabinet.    If necessary, a small group of Ministers, under the President of the Council&apos;s chairmanship, might have to be convened to consider any difficult issues which could not be resolved bilaterally.    The Chief Secretary, Treasury should also urgently investigate the point that had been made in discussion concerning Value Add^^Tax.
