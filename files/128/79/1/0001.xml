The sixth detainee had been absent but not necessarily for any sinister reason.    The consular visit had been &gt;receded by representations to the Libyans by the Italian Government, vd it seemed possible that exchanges in Athens between Greek and &apos;an Ministers had also been helpful.   He had himself discussed ^situation with both the Greek Prime Minister, Mr Papandreou, and tlian Foreign Minister, Signor Andreotti, in the margins of &gt;ean Council meeting in Fontainebleau; he had made it clear lat Her Majesty&apos;s Government were not thinking in terms of ^e of hostages.    A satisfactory resolution of the problem jtainees was clearly going to take some time to achieve.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that the Conference on Air Pollution^j&amp;Ld in Munich from 24 June to 27 June, had gone much better thaw repjorts in the British press would suggest.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that the agreement on the future financing of the European Community and United Kingdom refunds which had been reached in the European Council at Fontainebleau on 26 June was a very reasonable settlement.    There had been advantage in concluding during the French Presidency.    The agreement provided for fixed refund to the United Kingdom of about  600 million 000 million ecu) for 1984.    Thereafter the new system of refunds be in effect.    It had been strongly in the United Kingdom&apos;s st to avoid more than one year of ad hoc arrangements and this h^cf^tfe^n achieved.    The main features of the new system were:It would continue unless there were a decision to change Any such decision could only be made with the unanimous nt of member states and their Parliaments.    For the time there would be in place a system for correcting the t inequity which was linked with the level of the Community&apos;s own resources.ii .Unde new system, and even with an increase in theceiling orAVaVue Added Tax to 1.4 per cent, the United Kingdom&apos;s net contriro^3Toiy\to the Community would be less than if we had continued wiy^u&gt;es existing arrangements and the 1 per cent Value Added Tax/yejAing.

It was a cause for satisfaction that, at a period when many issues were the subject of prolonged and difficult disagreements, the question of Community financing and United Kingdom refunds had been resolved by negotiation.HE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that all the important ptiations on Community financing and United Kingdom refunds at the margins of the European Council had been conducted byGermany and the United Kingdom.    No other member state, except helpful interventions by the Dutch Prime Minister, had role.    It would now be important to ensure that the legal c.hed the agreement reached on the United Kingdom refunds and sures on budget discipline were also adequate.THE LORDv&lt;P$ SIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the Cabinet wished to congratulate the Prime Minister and the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary on the achievement of this agreement after long negotiation.In discussiona.

CONFIDENTIAL4.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY reported to the Cabinet on the latest position in the coal industry dispute.    The Cabinet&apos;s discussion is recorded separately.THE SECRETXW&apos;OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the Government had set up Enterprise 0^&gt;1 to own and manage the North Sea oil assets which had previously been owned by the British Gas Corporation.    It had decided not to allow those assets to be bought by existing companies.    Instead it had decided to vest th^Jrrsbri Enterprise Oil, and to privatise Enterprise Oil as an independent coiW^any/.    In order to ensure the continuing independence of the company&apos;s manaprtr^n&quot;tyi the Government had decided to create and hold a &quot;special share&quot; whicitaKm&gt;d allow it to block any takeover for a certain period.    In the offer :^^/sale of shares in Enterprise Oil earlier that week, the Government had/^v^h the agreement of the underwriters, taken power to control the allo^zt^bj* of. shares in order further to protect the independence of the company.X2^cause of the recent fall in the general level of share prices and ve^tpkeff in the price of oil, the offer for sale had not been well subscribedThe international mining group Rv^A^ihto Zinc (RTZ) had disclosed that it had, through a variety of nomineesV% d-\for 49-.5 per cent of the equity of Enterprise Oil.    The bid could not (beticked by invoking the powers of the &quot;special share&quot;, which came into&lt;J6rp &gt; only if there was a bid for 51 per cent or more of the company&apos;s e^^tv-v   Nevertheless, to accept the bid would clearly be incompatible with oyernment&apos;s repeatedlydeclared policy of safeguarding the independence of Enterprise Oil. He therefore proposed to limit the allocations^ shares to RTZ, under the terms agreed with the underwriters, to 10 per cent of the equity. His merchant bank advisers, Kleinwort Benson (KB), considered that this would be acceptable to the City.    If his colleagues agrp^rds he would announce the decision that afternoon to Parliament.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said (tfha about the possible implications of the course propo State for Energy on the flotation of British Telecom As it happened, KB were the merchant bank advising him and he had received advice from them that morning which reduce the allocation of shares in Enterprise Oil to RTZ b was likely to have serious adverse implications for the fid The flotation of BT was crucial to the success of the Governm privatisation policy.

CONFIDENTIALIn discussion the following main points were made -a.     There appeared to be a conflict of advice from KB, though it was fair to recognise that different pieces of advice had been given in different contexts.    However this might be, it was clearly necessary to clarify KB&apos;s views as soon as possible.An alternative to reducing the allocation of shares to RTZ to per cent would be to reduce the allocation to 20 per cent, to give the right to appoint a director to the Board of Enterprise Oil, DU^r/t^) require an undertaking from RTZ that they would not seek to rcqyiye further shares in Enterprise Oil.    This might have tax andantages for RTZ and so be attractive to them;  it would also inimise the risk of adverse repercussions on the flotation the other hand, it would be hard to reconcile with the t&apos;s policy of safeguarding the independence of the managementof Enterprise Oil,c.

They were however conscious that, if this were done, it would be difficult to refrain from seeking an injunction also against the rail unions in respect of the refusal of their members to drive coal and iron ore trains :o the steel works.    It was relevant that the Annual Conference of le National Union of Railwaymen (NUR) would be in session until-.middle of next week.
