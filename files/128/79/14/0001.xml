CONFIDENTIAL1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House of Commons in the following week.CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the underwriting of the ish Telecom share issue should be successfully completed on ay 16 November.   He suggested that a statement to this effect be made in the House of Commons at 11.00 am on that day.THE&lt;^(1Mb&gt;MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that an oral raf a ent might give an opportunity for comments to be made in the HoM^df. Commons which could have an adverse effect on the f lotatio&amp;y^ln any case, the sub-underwriting would not be completed until noot^  A statement after that time would be unusual.   The form of any statement would in any case need very careful wording because of the legal restrictions surrounding the Government&apos;s handling of the flotation.   Eer^these reasons no statement, oral or written, should be made aVtlys stage unless the Opposition pressed very strongly for onev^yAJ^lready planned, an oral statement should be made on 3 December((whejh^dealing would commence.The Cabinet -1.     Took note, wi summing up of the dival, of the Prime Minister&apos;s in.THE PRIME MINISTER said that tti inquiries into the expansion at of Terminal 5 at Heathrow Airport Such reports were published only whe Cabinet had previously decided that case also.   The Attorney General had ad;v Inspector&apos;s report was relevant to the p&quot; ^ and ought therefore to be disclosed in co f the BA prospectus in February.   It was not expected that the decision on Stansted and Heathrow Terminal 5 co February, and the Secretary of State for Transport suggested that the report should be published a received.   He also proposed that this should be a the Second Reading of the Civil Aviation Bill the was concerned that the Second Reading debate would as a vehicle for discussion of the Stansted and Heath issues.   The draft Written Answer announcing that publi before the decision justified the change in practice by r#* e4\ce to the flotation of BA and the importance of the issue.

CONFIDENTIALIn discussion, it was pointed out that the function of the Secretary of State in deciding on a planning application after a public inquiry was a quasi-judicial one.   Any discussion between the publication ^of the report and the taking of the decision involved the risklat new information could be made available which, strictly speaking, ild be referred back to the objectors and possibly to a resumed inquiry before the decision was taken.   Although there was leral subjudice   rule which forbade the publication of a report &lt;s reason, the practical and political objections to doing substantial.   The link with the flotation of BA was the only \ich could possibly justify special treatment for the Stansted though it was pointed out that a commitment had been given  Answer in the House of Commons to publication of Report before a decision had been taken.   Although there iction between the Civil Aviation Bill and the outcome of the Stansted inquiry, the former only provided enabling powers to allow the Secretary of State to restrict air traffic movements,which might have an impact on the operation of regional airports, would be contained in legislation.    It ought therefore to be possible e House of Commons anxious to raise this g of the Civil Aviation Bill was not o.    It was also recalled that, in the in 1978, the then Secretary of State d a device to enable the House offormally take the decision.

The Cabinet was unwilling to agree to that course of action at this stage.   The only justificatiori^or prior publication lay in the connection with the BA flotation; tfcfe issues themselves were not sufficiently important.   Further consr^eipfc^on needed to be given to the timing of publication and of any ann^un^ment. One Possibility was to consider whether the decision  W^eJ and Heathrow Terminal 5 could be taken before the flot rg2g?k place. An alternative course of action to be considered was ^eSf^m oi approval which was adopted for the Windscale inquiry.  gg^&quot;e&quot; should be considered urgently by a small group of Minis* chairmanship.CONFIDENTIAL187

CONFIDENTIAL2.     THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Indian Prime Minister, Mr Rajiv Gandhi, had decided to call a general election for 24 December.   Mr Rajiv Gandhi appeared to be making good progress in establishing his authority.   The principal cause for immediate concern lay in the possible repercussions of actions by Sikhs in the ited Kingdom.    The Attorney General was considering the strength therwise of the grounds for instituting legal proceedings against extremist Sikh leader, Dr Chauhan.    In the meantime, the position ing the planned march by Sikhs in central London, to mark the anj*lye ary of the founder of their religion, Guru Nanak, remained unc^rfaw^:    there was a possibility that it might be further postponed beyong/fjie-vdate currently envisaged, 18 November.   If the march were fe^Sce. place, it would create the danger not only of inter-communal violenceCo^xhe United Kingdom, but of profoundly serious repercussSrons on relations between the United Kingdom and India including, for example, a possible trade boycott.   The Indian High Commissioner in London had made pressing representations to emphasise the depth of Indi^Dxconcerns, including fears that inflammatory events in the U^ te$ Kingdom might increase the threat to Mr Rajiv GandhiIn discussion, it Commissioner of the were to go ahead, to might create and then to ban the march.

A further postponement of th^^imarch, which might take it into the period of the general el/freTfim in India, offered no satisfactory solution. \36thTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that no S aircraft had been delivered to Nicaragua although a reCen shipment had included military helicopters of an advance United States Government had stated that it had no intent mounting an invasion of Nicaragua, but the Nicaraguan Sandi.. was heightening the atmosphere of crisis for its own purpose United Kingdom had given public support to the United States opposition to the introduction of new armaments into the CentralIG fighter yietThe -egimeCONFIDENTIAL189

CONFIDENTIALTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that strikers were not entitled to unemployment benefit or supplementary benefit for themselves, but were entitled to allowances for any dependants they might have.   The allowances were reduced by a specified sum of strike ay which the striker was deemed to receive.   That specified sum was ly  15 a week.   Under the relevant statutory provisions it was to be uprated from 26 November in line with inflation, but rounded e nearest 50p a week.    In consequence, the amount after uprating ecome  16 a week.   The uprating could be cancelled or reduced only by regulations taking effect before 26 November and Affirmative Resolutions of both Houses of Parliament. th.e simultaneous uprating of benefits would ensure that only faced a reduction in their weekly payments, any increase ed sum would probably be attacked by both the Labour and the trade union movement generally, as well as by the ming was particularly unfortunate in that the change wasAltho a few in the Oppositio&apos; NUM.
