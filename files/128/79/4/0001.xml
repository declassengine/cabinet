The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House of Commons in the period up to the Summer Adjournment which was planned to take place on Wednedsay 1 August.-ORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that after much discussion Ministerial Sub-Committee on Local Authority Expenditure (E(LA)) :hed conclusions on the principal features of the English RaYe^S^p^ort Grant Settlement for 1985-86.   He would be reporting by mmjijr the details of what had been agreed, and the Secretary of StateC^r^the Environment would be making a statement in the House  f Covmoyyth^ following week.   While the settlement entailed an increase^i^public expenditure provisions, it would be attacked by the locally thorities as too severe, and would almost inevitably also give rise to difficulties with the Government&apos;s own supporters J-ti outer London and over the &quot;Pym commitment&quot;.THE SECRETARY OF Committee on Economic Report on Airline Cornp^ Civil Aviation Authorit recommendations were -i.     the transfer to G Airways&apos;    (BA) internati, Birmingham, Manchester a Harare and Saudi Arabia;R TRANSPORT said that the Ministerial Sub-irs (E(A)) had met on 18 July to discuss the n Policy which had been published by the ) on 16 July.

As a result of factors outside theirecommendations h the CAA of the s, and that the ot able to the CAA of BA. any of eh1CONFIDENTIAL
B Cal had lost their route to Argentina and had problems on their routes to Libya and Nigeria.    There was also some doubt whether B Cal could survive with its present weak structure.    The changes which the CAA Report recommended would require B Cal to find substantial new capital and it was clear that they would be able to do this.   He had explored the Chairman of BA, Lord King, the possibility of a compromise would give B Cal some additional routes without going as far full CAA recommendations.   Lord King was adamant that the re^^ C&gt;cUCCe S 0f BA and its forthcoming privatisation should not be pr^jtiiiced by route changes.    Staff numbers at BA had already been reduced^y AO per cent and he had given undertakings that there would be no^fef^r redundancies.    There appeared therefore to be no 0Pportu&quot;nYw/ or compromise.    The Sub-Committee had in consequence agreed to rejectvvnis group of the CAA&apos;s recommendations.    A majority of the Sub-Commit\ee had also favoured making an early announcement. Parliament would undoubtedly wish to debate the issue and there would be a suitable opportunity in the House of Commons during the passage of the Consolidat^ ^\Fund Bill on Wednesday 25 July.   He therefore proposed that heUshodld make a statement setting out the Government&apos;s Position on 23 or^^^iy.points were made -In discussion the foa.     The transfe itself increase compet.

Any transfer of routes whicfew^not agreed to by BA would require controversial primary legi^&amp;&lt;r$m.    This would immediately rule out the planned privatisation of BA early in 1985, and. might well prevent the privatisation of BA during this Parliament.    This would be a major political set-back for the Government.d.     On timing, although the need for an e recognised, the Report had been in the Gover only a very short time and it would be reason take some time over such important decisions before the Summer Adjournment should not therefo to be absolutely necessary.

CONFIDENTIALe.     The arguments pointed towards a compromise of a limited and agreed transfer of routes from BA to B Cal. Initial approaches on these lines to   Lord King had not been successful, but it was possible that, if the Government&apos;s difficulties were explained to him and a firm proposal put before him, he might be more accommodating.    One such compromise would be to transfer to B Cal the routes which BA currently operated from Gatwick .to the Iberian Peninsula.ME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that Cabinet the Sub-Committee&apos;s conclusions on the second and third the recommendations of the CAA Report, but on the transfer rom BA to other British operators considered that &lt;sVlution would be a compromise which would provide for an t^a^fer of routes from BA to B Cal.    The Government would have to cfe^cide how many routes it would be reasonable should be transferrer in this way, and then press BA and B Cal to acquiesce. If agreement could be reached within the next few days, the Secretaryrt could still make a statement to the House of mmer Adjournment.
