CONFIDENTIALTHE HOME SECRETARY said chat the law and order situation had not changed significantly since the Cabinet&apos;s previous discussion, though there had been one particularly serious and unpleasant incident at Grimethorpe in Yorkshire.   Recent appointments of stipendiary magistrates had allowed inroads to be made into the backlog of cases arising from the dispute, &apos;&quot;luding some of the most serious ones.   Over 50 people had now been tenced to terms of imprisonment.   The possibility of expediting ings after committal proceedings was being considered in suitable but the decision in each case was a matter for the judiciary.THE^^ETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that considerable Publr^^v&gt;iad been attracted by the revelation on the television Program^^&apos;Panorama&quot; broadcast on 15 October, that striking miners were receivl^tf^ yments from the Department of Health and Social Security in respect ojf/^k&amp;ir mortgage interest liabilities, and that many of themusing^rfhose payments to defray other living expenses.   The payments in accordance with the requirements of the law, which prescribed that they should be made to cover the liability of those receiving certain benefits topay mortgage interest.   He did not regard the situation as accwt&apos;aVi.e.   One possibility would be to make amendingow mortgage interest payments to be made direct Another possibility would be to argue that, if ot requiring mortgage interest to be paid - as if the payments to beneficiaries were being ^/^ ^xe was no liability to cover.OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY (MR LAMONT), al stocks held by industry (other than r weeks&apos; consumption.

CONFIDENTIALc. It would be helpful to discuss payments to social security beneficiaries to cover liability for mortgage interest with the Building Societies Association further before any overt action was taken.     It would be useful for those discussions to include, or even be conducted by, the Treasury, with whom the Association was in frequent and regular contact.d. One possible action in this context would be to make such ayments as loans rather than grants.MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the main points in public discussion of the coal industry dispute were as irst, ACAS had produced only one document setting out their %e proposals; that document had been accepted by the NCB but NUM.    Secondly, the particular grievances of NACODS had ed by the NCB: there was therefore no reason for the union ike.
