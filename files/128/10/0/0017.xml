1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.On 4th August, the twentieth allotted Supply Day, there wouldbe a debate on Germany and Austria. It was also proposed to takethe Report Stage of all outstanding Votes; the Committee and remaining Stages of the Isle of Man (Customs) Bill; a motion to approve the Purchase Tax (Charges) (No. 2) Order; the Lords&apos;amendments to the A griculture Bill, and the further Lords&apos; amend-ments to the Transport Bill.On 5th August the Lords&apos; amendments to the Electricity bill and the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Bill would beconsidered.On 6th and 7th August the Appropriation Bill would be taken and there would be a debate on the State of the Nation. The PrimeMinister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of theBoard of Trade would be the Government speakers.During the week any outstanding business would be taken as opportunity offered. On a convenient day the Prime Minister would propose a Motion of Thanks to the Civil and Military Services ofthe Crown in India.It was hoped that it would be possible for the House to adjournfor the Summer Recess on 8th August, and Parliament would thenstand adjourned until 20th October, when there would probably bea formal meeting for prorogation. Should it be necessary in thepublic interest to recall the House at an earlier date during the adjournment the Speaker would be able to do this on representa-tions being made to him by the Government.Report of the The Lord President drew the attention of the Cabinet to theCommittee of Report of the Committee of Privileges on the enquiry into the privileges. allegations against Members of Parliament made by Mr. GarryAllighan, M.P., in a recent article in the World&apos;s Press News. Thenormal procedure would be to afford time for an early debate onthe Committee&apos;s findings, but in view of Mr. Allighan&apos;s absenceabroad it would not be possible to hold a full debate before the summer Recess. The House should, however, have an opportunitybefore the Recess of deciding what action should be taken on theCommittee&apos;s findings in regard to the editor and political correspon-dent of the Evening Neivs, who had refused to divulge the name ofthe Member to whom that paper made a weekly payment in returnfor political and industrial information.Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.Absence of 2.   The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that in his prime absence on holiday the Lord President would act for him. Arrange-Minister. ments would be made to ensure that he was kept informed of mattersof importance, and for maintaining speedy communication with him.Palestine.Jewish IllegalImmigrantsfromS.S. PresidentTVarfield.(previous reference:CM. (47) 42ndConclusions,Minute 3.)3, The Foreign Secretary recalled that, in spite of our efforts to prevent it, the President War field had succeeded in sailing forPalestine from a French port with some 4,500 illegal immigrantson board. These Jews had secured forged Colombian travel docu-ments; and the ship itself had sailed without proper clearance.He had taken the matter up immediately with M. Bidault, who had agreed that, if we were successful in intercepting the ship, herpassengers might be returned to France. The President War fieldhad been intercepted off the Palestine coast by a naval patrol and her passengers transferred to three other ships, which were now in harbour at Port de Bouc. The illegal immigrants had, however,refused to disembark voluntarily and it was clear that, without theco-operation of the French authorities, it would be impossible to compel them to do so. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Paris had reported that the French Government were not prepared to afford[34133-3] B 2
such co-operation, and that further representations to them wouldbe unlikely to produce any successful results. In these circum-stances he had discussed with the other Ministers concerned whatalternative arrangements might be made for the disposal of the illegal immigrants. It had been agreed that there could be noquestion of sending them to Palestine or Cyprus, and the Secretaryof State for the Colonies was considering whether accommodationcould be found for them in a British colonial territory, while he himself was looking into the question whether any might be sentto the British Zone of Germany. Some of these Jews had in factcome from the United States Zone, and it might be possible toarrange for their return there. He had not yet been able to reachdefinite conclusions, and he proposed to consult with the PrimeMinister before a decision was finally taken. No harm would bedone by leaving the three transports at Port de Bouc for a few days;and there was a possibility that their passengers might decideeventually to go ashore peaceably.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;^ statement.Kidnapped The Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the cabinet british Non- that the High Commissioner for Palestine had not yet been able toCommissioned confirm or deny the report that two British non-commissioned officers. officers, who had been kidnapped some days previously, had beenexecuted by the Irgun Zvai Leumi.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement made by the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies.Iron and SteelIndustry Bill.(previous reference erence:CM. (47) 64thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord Presi-dent and the Minister of Supply (CP. (47) 215) summarising thealternative courses of action discussed at their meeting on 24th July.The Lord President recalled that the Cabinet, at their meetings on 24th and 28th April (CM. (47) 39th Conclusions, Minute 6, and40th Conclusions, Minute 2), had reached the conclusion that anycomprehensive acquisition of the physical assets of the iron and steelindustry on the lines adopted for the coal industry would involvegreat complications and could only be effected over a long period.They had therefore decided that the most practical method ofsecuring public ownership was by the acquisition of all the shares in selected companies on the lines suggested in CP. (47) 123. If theGovernment proceeded on these lines, however, the energies of manyof the active personalities in the industry would be diverted fromsteel output and development schemes to opposing the governments plans or considering their own future. There would thus be a danger that in the critical period ahead the national economy wouldbe seriously handicapped through a continued shortage of steel. Wecould not afford to run this risk, and it might therefore be argued that the Government should take no action at all for the time being.In his view there could be no worse course to pursue, since the prolongation of uncertainty would prejudice the efficiency of theindustry while at the same time encouraging the intransigence ofits leaders. Politically, inaction would be regarded as a sign of weakness and might prove damaging to the Government. In thesecircumstances he thought there was a strong case for the solutionoutlined in CP. (47) 212. Though the scheme there proposed was unlikely to lead to the acquisition by the Government of anysubstantial part of the industry in the lifetime of the present parliament, it would give the Government full control of theindustry and the necessary technical knowledge to enable completesocialisation to be effected, if it were thought desirable, during thenext Parliament.   Many Government supporters were doubtful
181G.M. 66 (M)about the advisability of pressing forward with complete soeialisa-tion at this stage, but would welcome proposals which would represent a definite advance towards socialisation without the riskof jeopardising steel output. If his proposals were accepted, it wouldbe necessary to define the agreement with the industry by an exchange of letters with the Iron and Steel Federation.The Minister of Health said that a decision by the Govern-ment to abandon their intention of introducing legislation in the1947-48 Session for the full socialisation of the iron and steelindustry would cause great dismay among their supporters inParliament, who were expecting them to show vigorous leadershipin dealing with the present situation. In his view, to attempt tojustify a departure from the Cabinet&apos;s earlier decision on theground that the economic conditions rendered it inopportune was anegation of the principles of the Party and was tantamount to an indefinite postponement of any real measure of socialisation. Thiswould have a deplorable effect on the workers in the industry andwas much more likely to lead to a loss of output than adherence tothe decision already taken together with a resolute use of the powersof control which the Minister of Supply already had. In any event,it would be unwise to agree to any departure from the schemealready approved until Ministers had had an opportunity ofstudying the full implications of the economic situation and of themeasures which would have to be taken to meet it.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said thatin present circumstances it would be unwise to proceed with the fullscheme of socialisation proposed in CP. (47) 123. He saw no reasonto suppose that the adoption of the proposals made in CP. (47) 212would open the Government to the charge of weakness. In theimmediate future there would be ample need for courageousdecisions in other directions, and it could be argued that the schemeset out in CP. (47) 212 constituted a definite step towards theultimate objective. The essential point was that no action shouldbe taken which might result in a fall in steel output.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, though he stillfavoured the scheme set out in CP. (47) 123, he had come to theconclusion that it would be inadvisable to introduce the necessary legislation in the 1947-48 Session, when the Government would be faced with many more urgent problems. He saw no advantage in adopting the proposals in CP. (47) 212, which would, in his view,be unacceptable to Government supporters. Moreover, it seemed probable that it would be necessary for the Government to seekemergency powers to meet the present economic situation, and, if so,there would be no advantage in introducing special legislation tocontrol the iron and steel industry. Again, there was no reason whythe transfer of highly qualified staff from Steel House, which wasone of the main elements in the compromise proposals, should notbe effected by administrative action.The President of the Board, of Trade said that he was in generalagreement with the views of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Ifthe proposals in CP. (47) 212 were adopted, they would be regardedas the Governments final solution of the problem of socialising theiron and. steel industry. They would also throw a heavier burden on the administrative machine than it could bear under existing conditions. He therefore thought that the Government could properly take the line that the necessary control of the industry could be secured by the use of general emergency powers.The Minister of Food said that he understood that the cabinet would have an opportunity of considering the question whetheremergency powers ought to be taken by the Government to meet thepresent economic situation. If such legislation were enacted, itwould no doubt render easier the effective control of the steelindustry on its present basis. Nevertheless, he disagreed with the compromise proposed by the Lord President. Drastic measures would shortly have to be introduced which would fall hardly on the
general mass of the population. The Governments position wouldbe greatly weakened if they appeared at the same time to beretreating in the face of the opposition of the Iron and steel federation. A further point was that the administrative difficul-ties involved in a full scheme of socialisation seemed to have been seriously exaggerated.The Minister of Agriculture said that in view of the need toobtain the maximum steel output it was essential to avoid any actionwhich would arouse serious controversy with the industry. For thisreason he supported the proposal put forward by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer that no legislation dealing with the iron and steelindustry should be introduced in the 1947-48 Session.The Minister of Defence said that inaction at this stage wouldbe read as meaning that the Government had abandoned their inten-tion to introduce legislation for socialising the industry during thecurrent Parliament. In his view, such a decision would have serious political consequences and, if it was felt impossible to introduce legislation on the lines originally contemplated, he hoped it wouldbe decided to adopt the solution put forward by the Lord president and the Minister of Supply. This would be an important step towards the ultimate socialisation of the industry.The Minister without Portfolio supported the views expressedb)^ the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The adoption of the compromise-mise solution would be a bitter disappointment to government supporters who would interpret it as final abandonment of thepolicy for the full socialisation of the industry.The Lord Chancellor said that he was in agreement with theproposals in CP. (47) 212, which represented an important advance towards the Governments main objective.The Home Secretary supported the views expressed by theChancellor of the Exchequer.The Secretary of State for India supported the proposals in cp. (47) 212 on the ground that they would give an incentive to higher production by the removal of the immediate threat ofsocialisation, while at the same time securing complete control overthe industry through the transfer of the technical experts from SteelHouse to the Ministry of Supply.The Minister of Education supported the views expressed bythe Minister of Health. A decision against the introduction oflegislation in the 1947-48 Session would cause grave disappoint-ment to Government supporters and give the Government no greaterpowers than they already possessed.The Minister of Labour supported the proposals in CP.(47) 212.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that, since the scheme for full socialisation bad been drawn up, conditions bad changed com-pletely. While, therefore, he saw no reason to depart from theoriginal scheme, he thought there were strong grounds for adopting the course proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, on theunderstanding that general emergency powers would be taken and used to the extent necessary to ensure the maximum output of steel.The proposals in CP. (47) 212 would, in his view, have noadvantages.The Secretary of State for the Colonies supported the views ofthe Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Minister of Transport said that, if emergency powers wereto be taken to meet the general economic situation, it would be preferable to defer special action in relation to the iron and steelindustry. He argued that the transfer of control over an industryto the Government inevitably involved some temporary administra-tive deterioration and that there was therefore the risk that steeloutput might be adversely affected if the scheme of full socialisationwere put into force.
The Minister of Supply pointed out that a decision to defer any action in the immediate future would leave the industry in a stateof prolonged uncertainty, which would be prejudicial to efficiency.It was to meet this difficulty that the proposals made in CP. (47) 212had been devised. Under existing arrangements the industry looked to Steel House for direction, and the Iron and Steel Board couldexercise no effective influence because it lacked the technicalexperience and knowledge. Until it was evident that real controlover the industry had been transferred permanently to the Govern-rnent, the staff at Steel House could not be expected to change theirloyalties.The Foreign Secretary said that the workers in the iron andsteel industry could be trusted to produce the maximum possibleoutput whatever decision the Government might reach. He felt thatthe arguments were evenly balanced. Any reduction in output ordelay in development would have deplorable consequences, and itwas clear that the administrative machine was seriously over-burdened. On the other hand, the proposals in CP. (47) 212 wouldbe regarded by Government supporters as amounting to the abandon-ment of the full socialisation plan in deference to the resistance ofthe Iron and Steel Federation. In his view, the next step should beto consult the trade unions concerned, who had so far had no oppor-tunity of commenting on the new proposals. The Government shouldnot retreat from the earlier decision, about which the unions hadbeen informed, without taking the unions into their confidence.The Prime Minister said that he could not agree that the post-ponement of legislation to give effect to the scheme approved by theCabinet would amount to a betrayal of the Governments politicalprinciples. In deciding on the Legislative Programme for eachSession the Government had to take full account of the prevailingcircumstances, and, since the Cabinets decision had been taken, the deterioration in the economic situation had created problems ofgreat complexity, which would call for drastic and far-reachingmeasures and impose new duties on an administrative machine thatwas already overburdened. Both the original socialisation scheme approved by the Cabinet and the compromise suggested by the lord president would impose additional responsibilities on the Depart-ments concerned, and both would leave the industry in a state of as much uncertainty as if legislation were postponed to a laterSession. The immediate need of increased production could be ensured by the use of existing or new emergency powers of a generalkind, and there would be justifiable criticism if the Governmentsattention appeared to be diverted from their main task of dealingwith the general situation in order to bring into effect a scheme ofsocialisation which could not be shown to be a necessary part of the plans for overcoming our economic difficulties. In view of the varying opinions expressed in the discussion, he agreed withthe Foreign Secretary that the next step should be to consult thetrade unions concerned. It should be made clear to them in the consultations that the Cabinet had not yet reached any decision.The Cabinet Invited the Lord President and the Minister of Supply toascertain the views of the trade unions concerned.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,31st July, 1947.
