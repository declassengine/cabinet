Balance ofPayments.(previous preference:CM. (47) 65thConclusions,Minute 2.)RawMaterials.2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP. 47) 221) on the balance of payments.The Cabinet first discussed the proposals for reducing expendi-ture on imports in paragraphs 23 to 30 of CP. (47) 221.The Cabinet were informed that it was proposed to make a cut of  10 million on imports of timber. There would be no cancel-lation of contracts and the cut would be divided between softwoodsand hardwoods. There would have to be some consequential slowing down of building.Railway 1.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of charges.        Transport (CP. (47) 214) submitting revised proposals for the(Previous       adjustment of railway charges.Reference: Minister of Transport recalled that on 6th May the CabinetCM. (47)44th Yt&amp;cl agreed in principle that from 1st October railway charges should conclusions, ^Q jnoreasejCi jn order to meet the full costs of operation, includingMinute 3.) a increase in costs due to the concession of any part of the railway workers&apos; claims for shorter working hours and higher wages. he now proposed that railway charges should be increased to 55 percent, over the pre-war level, and that railway dock charges shouldbe increased to 75 per cent, over the pre-war level, except for certaincharges on coast-wise ships and their cargoes, which should belimited to 25 per cent, above the pre-war level. These proposals had been endorsed by the Lord Presidents Committee and, if theCabinet approved them, he proposed to make an announcement inthe terms shown in Annex III to CP. (47) 214.The following points were raised in discussion : (a) The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the proposed increase in charges for the carriage of coal would mean on averagean increase of 4s. per ton in the price of coal. He also suggestedthat, if railway charges were increased in order to enable the british transport Commission to avoid incurring a deficit in their first year of operation, he might be open to criticism on the ground that theNational Coal Board were incurring such a deficit.In reply, it was pointed out that the enquiries made by the paymaster-General at the request of the Lord Presidents Commit-tee had suggested that an increase in the charges for the carriage of coal to 55 per cent, over the pre-war rate would not in itself entailan increase of as much as 4s. per ton in the price of coal. The factthat the British Transport Commission were only&apos;&quot; required to securethat their revenue was sufficient to meet their charges taking oneyear with another was no argument for not increasing the charges to a level sufficient to enable them to pay their way in their first year of operation, particularly since this meant no more thanbringing railway charges into line with the post-war level of prices.(&amp;) It was explained that the proposed flat Tate increase in charges did not bind the Minister of Transport and the british transport Commission to retaining for all time the existingstructure of charges.(c) The Lord President said he had certain suggestions foraltering the terms of the proposed draft statement annexed to cp. (47) 214 which he would communicate to the Minister ofTransport.The Cabinet Agreed that from 1st October railway and railway dockcharges should be raised to the levels proposed in para-graph 4 of CP. (47) 214, and authorised the Minister ofTransport to make an announcement on the lines of thedraft statement annexed to CP. (47) 214.
The President of the Board of Trade said that he would consult with the Minister of Health regarding the allocation of the savingbetween softwoods and hardwoods. It was necessary to maintain asuitable relationship between supplies of timber for housing andfurniture respectively.The President of the Board of Trade also explained that he waslooking into the question whether it would be possible to postponepart of our cotton purchases.Film The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, although theRemittances, expenditure on foreign films was not large, it was essential that itshould be substantially reduced. This might be done by imposing a heavy import duty, by an embargo on all new imports, or by anagreement with the American film interests under which they would leave their receipts in the United Kingdom until we were willing that they should begin to draw on them. He thought that the aim should be to save at least  7 million in 1947-48 out of a total of 15 million.The general view of the Cabinet was that an arrangement underwhich the American film interests were permitted to build up dollarbalances in this country would not satisfy public opinion and would expose the Government to pressure from the United States to freethe balances. Ministers also felt that, having regard to the drastic measures which would have to be taken in other directions, theGovernment ought to go considerably further than was suggestedin CP. (47) 221 in reducing dollar expenditure on films. they considered, therefore, that the possibility of securing a saving ofthe film remittances in full might be examined. It was recognisedthat this could not be done without imposing a complete ban on the exhibition of foreign films, including films from countries otherthan the United States. It would be necessary to consider whetherpowers were available to impose such a prohibition.Foreign The   Chancellor   of   the   Exchequer   proposed   that   fromTravel. 1st October the foreign travel allowance should be reduced from 75 for twelve months to  35 for fourteen months. He also proposed to limit business allowances more strictly. He would consider whether there could be any further limitation of the allow-ances payable in respect of children.Petrol. The Cabinet had already agreed (CM. (47) 64th Conclusions,Minute 3) that a saving of 300,000 tons of petrol should be achieved by a cut in the basic ration and that steps should be taken to obtain a further saving of 200,000 tons by reducing the amount of petrolconsumed by commercial vehicles and by the Services. The arrange-ments for securing this further saving of 200,000 tons had notyet been worked out, but it was desirable that every effort shouldbe made by the Ministers concerned to obtain an even larger savingfrom these sources.The Minister of Transport said that increased production would mean that more goods would have to be carried by road. Forthis reason, he doubted whether it would be wise to attempt tosecure a further saving from commercial users. Would it not bedesirable to cut the supplementary allowances to the owners ofprivate cars, which had been responsible for a large rise in petrolconsumption in 1947 ?The Minister of Fuel and Power pointed out that the supple-mentary allowances to private cars would be cut proportionatelywith the proposed reduction in the basic ration.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was satisfied thatthere would be no net saving in dollar expenditure by the UnitedKingdom if we were to draw additional supplies of petrol fromBritish sources. Nor would anything be gained by raising the retail price of petrol in this country.
Tobacco. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was satisfied with the saving in expenditure on tobacco resulting from the fall in consumption due to the increased duty and the running down of stocks.Miscellaneous The President of the Board of Trade explained that theConsumer proposed saving of  5 million a year could be achieved withoutGoods. impairing the capacity of other countries to buy our exports.Food Imports. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that his proposal wasthat an announcement should be made at once that we intended to stop buying over a large range of hard currency foods. Runningcontracts, such as the Canadian wheat and Argentine meat con-tracts, would not be affected. We should not commit ourselves-toany fixed period for the suspension of buying, but he estimated thatthe savings which could be effected by this means might amount to 12 million a month, nearly all in hard currency. He was convincedthat a reduction of this order in our hard currency expenditure on food was essential if we were to meet our difficulties and was notout of proportion to the other cuts proposed in CP. (47) 221.There was good reason to hope that the suspension of buying would bring down prices.The Minister of Food said that he supported the plan forsuspending the placing of new orders for food in hard currencyareas. The suspension of purchases of the non-rationed floodsmentioned in paragraph 30 (1) of CP. (47) 221 would mean that immediate changes would have to be made in the points values ofthese foods. The cessation of wheat purchases from the UnitedStates should not affect the bread ration, nor would it be necessaryto reduce the cheese ration below two ounces, though it would notbe possible to make the usual seasonal increase in the ration. Asregards meat purchases, he would not. in any event, have placedorders for meat from the United States until the autumn and therewas no question, therefore, of announcing an immediate cut in the meat ration on supply grounds. If. however, we stopped buyingmeat from the United States for as long as six months, a cut inthe ration would be necessary.In discussion the following points were made : (a) There was general agreement that if the increases in pro-auction proposed in Part III of CP. (47) 221 were to be secured,a further cut in the meat ration of manual workers was out of thequestion. On the other hand, it could not be assumed that weshould be able to resume purchases of United States meat in theautumn or to obtain alternative supplies of meat from softcurrency areas. It would, therefore, be necessary to contemplate the introduction of a scheme of differential rationing in favour ofmanual workers, and the preparation of a scheme of this kind should be put in hand at once.(b) The Chancellor of the Exchequer had proposed that the suspension of buying should be announced and the Minister ofFood supported this proposal. The general view of the Cabinet,however, was that no public announcement that we intended to stop placing orders should be made.(c) In the Parliamentary debate on 6th August it would benecessary to give an estimate of the saving in hard currencyexpenditure on food which the Government aimed at securing.(d) There was no objection to reducing imports of luxuryfoods, such as canned fruit.(e) Every effort would have to be made to obtain suppliesof food from alternative sources, such as the Dominions.(/) Any suggestion that rations would have to be reducedought to be coupled with a statement that concurrent steps wouldbe taken to impose restrictions on the consumption of food by thosewho were able to take meals in restaurants and hotels.(g) It would be necessary to ensure that the suspension of buying did not lead to serious difficulties in shipping supplies offood to this country, or to the loss of essential sources of supply.
Expenditureon CivilSupplies for germany.OverseasMilitaryExpenditure.Size of ;the armed Forces.Munitions and supplies forthe armed forces.The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that His Majestv&apos;sGovernment were liable for half the deficit in the balance of pay-ments of the combined Anglo-American Zone. The current estimateof this liability was  80 million a year, of which more than halfwould have to be met in dollars. He suggested that the UnitedStates Government should be informed immediately that HisMajesty&apos;s Government could not make available any furtherdollars for civil supplies for the Combined Zone.The Foreign Secretary said that he could not agree to theChancellor&apos;s proposal, which would involve a repudiation of theagreement made with the United States Government for the fusionof the two Zones.The President of the Board of Trade said that he had formed the impression from his conversation with the United StatesAssistant Under-Secretary of State on the previous day that thetime was opportune for an approach to the United States Govern-ment with a view to discussing with them what relaxations couldbe made in our non-discrimination and convertibility obligations under the Loan Agreement. It seemed to him urgently necessaryto take this matter up, and he suggested that the question ofsecuring some relief from the drain on our dollar resourcesresulting from the provision of civil supplies to Germany mightbe raised at the same time.There was general agreement with this suggestion.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that our gross liability in foreign currencies for the Armed Forces overseas was approxi-mately  140 million a year. He thought it essential that this expenditure should be cut by half, arid that the number of troopsabroad should be reduced by 150,000 by the end of 1947.The Minister of Defence said that, in consultation with theChiefs of Staff, he had prepared plans under which overseasestablishments would be reduced by 120,000 by the end of 1947,provided that adequate shipping facilities could be made available.It would: be very difficult to make a further reduction of 30,000 bythe end of the year but by 1st April, 1948, it should be possible to effect further withdrawals which would reduce the overseasestablishments by 200.000 in all. He would discuss with theChancellor of the Exchequer whether it would be possible toestimate what part of our overseas military expenditure was incurred in hard currency.The Minister of Defence explained that he had prepared a plan for accelerating the reduction in the size of the Armed Forces whichwould bring their numbers down to 1,007,000, instead of 1,087,000,by 31st March, 1948.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he hoped it wouldbe possible to make an even greater reduction in the size of the armed Forces by 31st March, 1948.The Prime Minister said that, while some further accelerationmight be possible, too rapid a reduction in the size of the armed forces would lead to complete disorganisation.The Minister of Fuel and Power asked whether it would notbe possible to slow down the production of munitions with a viewto releasing materials and man-power for civilian production.The Minister of Defence said that new production for theServices had already been severely cut; and the Minister of Supplypointed out that the diversion of steel to meet demands for theexpansion of fuel and power resources was automatically slowing down the production of many munitions.The Cabinet then discussed the proposals for increases in pro-duction and exports in paragraphs 11 to 22 of CP. (47) 221.
A n. rj102Coal.Steel.Engineering.FoodProduction.Directionof Exports.Volumeof Exports.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that it would be unrealistic to fix a target of 220 million tons for the coal year May 1947 toMay 1948, though it should be possible to obtain 220 million tonsin the calendar year 1948.In discussion it was suggested that the target might be expressed as an additional half million tons a week during theperiod from September 1947 to May 1948 and that the adoptionof this target should be linked with the proposal that miners should work an extra half hour each clay.The Minister of Supply said that it should be possible to pro-duce 14 million tons of steel in 1948, provided that the necessaryfuel and imports of iron ore were made available.The Minister of Supply said that, while he was in favour ofincreasing the percentage of motor-car production allocated to export, nothing would be gained by attempting to export more carsthan overseas markets would absorb. For this reason he suggestedthat it should be stated that exports of cars would be pushed to theutmost practical limit but that no commitment should be made asto the percentage of total production to be allocated to export. he agreed that steel supplies should be switched from the productionof cars to the production of agricultural machinery.The President of the Board of Trade pointed out that it mightbe desirable to stop altogether the production of certain types of cars and to require the manufacturers to produce agricultural machinery or other engineering products instead.The Minister of A griculture said that he would circulate to theLord Presidents Committee early in the following week a memo-randum setting out the requirements of the agricultural industry for the purpose of securing an increase of  100 million in net pro-duction by the year 1951-52. He emphasised that unless these requirements were met the target could not possibly be achieved.Though no cut had been proposed in the feeclingstuffs provided forin the import programme, the quantities obtainable were still insuffi-cient to enable the 1938 level of production to be restored. In any event, the restoration of livestock production was a slow process.The President of the Board of Trade explained that in directingexports account would be taken of the needs of the Dominions and colonies.The President of the Board of Trade said that, though it wouldbe impossible to raise the volume of exports to more than 140 percent, of the 1938 figure by the second quarter of 1948, it might bepossible to reach a figure of 160 per cent, by the end of that year.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposal to reduce imports of timber in1947-48 by  10 million and took note that the Presidentof the Board of Trade would discuss with the Ministerof Health the allocation of the proposed cut betweenhardwoods and softwoods.(2) Took note that the President of the Board of Trade would consider whether it would be. possible -to save hard currency by postponing part of our cotton purchases.(3) Agreed that the object should be to achieve immediately themaximum possible saving of dollar expenditure on films,and invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and thePresident of the Board of Trade, in the light of thediscussion, to prepare a scheme designed to achieve thisobject.(4) Agreed that foreign travel allowances should be reduced tothe extent proposed in paragraph 25 of CP. (47) 221and took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would consider whether there should be any further limitationof the allowances payable in respect of children.(5) Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power, in consultationwith the Minister of Defence and the Minister of
Transport, to make every effort to secure additional savings in the consumption of petrol by commercial and service users.(6) Agreed that for the present no further steps should betaken to reduce imports of tobacco.(7) Agreed that a saving of  5 million a year should be madeby reducing the import of miscellaneous consumer goods.(8) Agreed that the placing of new orders for food supplies from hard currency sources should be suspended to theextent proposed in paragraph 30 of CP. (47) 221.(9) Agreed that the statement on food imports to be made inthe Parliamentary debate on 6th August should be to theeffect that the Government felt it essential that thereshould be a saving on food purchases from hard currencysources and that they were planning to save something of the order of  12 million a month at present prices.It was proposed to stop importing luxury foods and every effort would be made to obtain alternative suppliesof essential foods from soft currency sources. If, liow-ever, stocks of food in this country were not to bereduced below the minimum safety level, there wouldhave to be an adjustment of points values and it wouldbe difficult to avoid some reduction in basic rations.- Should such a reduction have to be made, the Govern-ment would introduce a differential rationing schemedesigned to give a preference to manual workers, andwould take steps to impose restrictions on the consump-tion of food in restaurants and hotels.(10) Invited the Minister of Food to prepare, as a matter of urgency, a scheme for differential rationing designedto give a preference to manual workers, and for restricting the consumption of food in restaurants andhotels.(11) Took note that the Defence Committee would consider whatreductions might be made in overseas military expendi-ture and in the production of munitions and supplies for the Armed Forces, and to what figure it would bepossible to reduce the total size of the Armed Forces by31st March, 1948.(12) Agreed that the target for coal production during theperiod from September 1947 to May 1948 should be4  million tons a week.(13) Agreed that the target for steel production in 1948 shouldbe 14 million tons.(14) Agreed that there should be the maximum possible exportof engineering products.(15) Approved the proposal that textile production should beincreased to a level which would give exports of a valueof  250 million a year without a reduction in thepresent value of clothing coupons, and that every effort should be made to increase production beyond thispoint.(16) Agreed that steps should be taken to enable an increase of 100 million a year in net agricultural production to beachieved by 1951.(17) Agreed that &quot;exports should be concentrated on the most appropriate markets and that the aim should be to raisethe volume of exports to 140 per cent, of the 1938 levelin the second quarter of 1948 and to 160 per cent, bythe end of 1948; and invited the President of the Boardof Trade to circulate a memorandum setting out themeans by which these targets could be achieved.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,1st August, 1947
