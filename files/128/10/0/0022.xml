Balance ofPayments.(previous reference:C.M.(47)70thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP. (47) 233) reporting an acceleration in the drain on the United Kingdom dollar resources and recommendingfurther measures to meet this situation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that, by the end ofJuly last, $2,750 million had been drawn of the total United StatesCredit of $3,750 million. A further $150 million had been drawn on 11th August and he had hoped that it would not be necessary todraw more than a further $150 million for the remainder of August.A very serious situation had, however, developed during the past few days. Drawings in the five days up to 15th August hadamounted to $175-9 million, as compared with an average of$115 million a week in the previous six weeks and $77 million a week in the second quarter of 1947. It was evident that a dangerous run on transferable sterling had started and that, unlessprompt action was taken, the rate of drawing would continueto accelerate and the Credit would be rapidly exhausted. He pro-posed, therefore, that immediate action should be taken, as set outin CP. (47) 233, to limit the convertibility of sterling. The effectof his proposal would be to allow convertibility for any country onlyup to the amount of a ration to be fixed by the British Government.This would apply to all non-sterling area countries: differentmeasures would be adopted for the countries of the sterling areasince it would be undesirable to take unilateral action against them.The action proposed would involve a breach of the Anglo-AmericanFinancial Agreement and of the payments agreements which we had signed, but it was the only way of checking the present drain of dollars, which was far greater than anything that could possibly be attributed to the normal flow of current transactions. If theCabinet accepted his recommendations, he suggested that sir Wilfrid Eady (who had left for Washington on the previous day) should explain to the United States Government the natureof the action proposed by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and thereasons for it, at the opening of his discussions in Washington on18th August. There was a risk that, if we acted without consulta-tion with the United States Govrenment, they might stop furtherdrawings on the Credit. The Canadian Government should also beinformed, since their position would be seriously affected. Our action would have world-wide effects, but there had been a general expecta-tion that something of the kind might happen and it could not inany event have been avoided when the Credit was exhausted. Therewas an undoubted risk that there might be an interruption of sup-plies, which might involve some cut in rations, but that would depend upon the outcome of the negotiations with supplying countries which would have to be undertaken at once.The Cabinet first discussed the nature of the situation and themeasures proposed for dealing with it.The Foreign Secretary said that he was in general agreementwith the measures proposed in CP. (47) 233. He thought it impor-tant, however, that we should make it clear to the United StatesGovernment that it was not our intention to repudiate the terms ofthe Anglo-American Financial Agreement, but that we were com-pelled to take this emergency action, as a temporary precautionarymeasure under force majeure. We were confident that the UnitedStates Government would share our view that it was essential tothe well-being of the whole world that sterling should be maintainedas a strong and reliable currency.The Lord President also agreed that immediate steps must betaken to limit the convertibility of sterling, on the lines proposed bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer. He thought, however, that the distinction drawn in paragraph 5 of CP. (47) 233 between thetreatment to be accorded to sterling area and non-sterling area countries might have dangerous consequences; he believed that,unless the same degree of control was imposed forthwith on all
countries, there was a serious risk of a further heavy drain onour remaining dollar resources through the sterling area countriesbefore the special arrangements contemplated had been made withthem. He feared that the Government would be criticised for havingfailed to take drastic measures on these lines at an earlier stage;and it. would be argued that the need for such action should havebeen foreseen before Parliament adjourned for the Summer Recess.The United States Government might also complain that we haddelayed too long our approach to them. The Ministers concerned should be asked to keep the Cabinet informed of the effects on our import programme of the restrictions to be imposed on the conver-tibility of sterling. In view of the difficult negotiations which wouldhave to be undertaken with the supplying countries, might it notbe advisable to recall any directors of important commodity or rawmaterial divisions who might be on leave, and possibly to arrangefor the temporary return to Government service of some of the menwho filled these posts during the war ?The Minister of Health said that the approach to the UnitedStates Administration should be made on wider grounds than theimmediate difficulties of our balance of payments situation. Ourown problems should be set against the background of the steadycontraction of world trade caused by the shortage of dollars. Itshould be brought home to the United States Government that,unless the British Government took steps now to protect the residualsterling position, world trade would break down completely withina short period with results which would cause serious harm to theUnited States economy. For this reason the United States were equally interested in the maintenance of sterling as a strongcurrency. The United Kingdom Delegation should avoid discussing the principles of multilateral and bilateral trading systems; it was preferable that, where we had to resort to bilateral arrangements,we should be free to do so as a matter of practical necessity withoutrepudiating the multilateral principle.The Cabinet next discussed the procedure to be followed in giving effect to the proposals contained in CP. (47) 233.The Chancellor of the Exchequer proposed that Sir WilfridEady should, at the outset of his discussions in Washington on18th August, explain to the United States representatives the natureof the action proposed by the British Government and the reasons why such action had become necessary. He should make it clear to the United States Government that, in view of the situationwhich had developed, His Majesty&apos;s Government had decided with regret that they had no option, in the interests of securing multi-lateral world trade, but to make temporary arrangements to stop the run on the conversion of sterling into dollars by rationing con-vertibility for the time being. He should add that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were ready to enter into further negotiations in thematter at the highest level in whatever way might prove most con-venient to the two Governments. Sir Wilfrid Eady should makeit clear that he was not asking for the prior agreement of the UnitedStates Government to the course of action proposed; he was giving them advance information as a matter of courtesy but His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had no option but to initiate the measures proposed onthe evening of Tuesday, 19th August.The Minister of Defence doubted whether it was wise, in thecircumstances disclosed in CP. (47) 233, to defer the action proposeduntil 19th August. In the two weeks ending 9th August, the rateof drawings on our dollar resources had averaged only about$19 million a day; but in the week ending 15th August the averagedaily rate of drawings had risen to $25 million. There had thusbeen a substantial acceleration in the rate of drawings, and there seemed good reason to believe that this acceleration would continue.If, therefore, we intended to limit the convertibility of sterling, the34236-1 b 2
sooner we acted the better. If action were delayed for two or three days while conversations continued in Washington, we might con-tinue to lose dollars at the rate of 130 million a day or more. would it not be preferable therefore, to put into operation at once themeasures proposed in CP. (47) 233, and to explain to the UnitedStates authorities that circumstances had forced us to take this action without prior consultation %The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that all the members ofour Mission in Washington were most anxious not to have to con-front the United States authorities with a fait accompli; for they felt that this would substantially increase the difficulties of theirsubsequent negotiations. It must be remembered that, if we tookunilateral action, the United States Government might well retaliateby denying us the remainder of the Credit. The choice thereforelay between risking a daily loss of 125 million for two or three days or, on the other hand, risking the whole of the remaining$500 million of the Credit. He strongly recommended that action should be deferred until 19th August so that the United StatesGovernment might be informed in advance of the action which we proposed to take.The Cabinet endorsed the recommendation made by the Chan-cellor of the Exchequer.The Foreign Secretary said that, in his view, it would not be enough to inform the United States Government alone of our inten-tions. There were other countries which had strong claims to be similarly informed. He proposed to see, not only the United states ambassador, but also the Argentine Ambassador, and he wouldinstruct His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Paris to give full informa-tion to the French Government. Similar arrangements should bemade to inform the Acting High Commissioner for Canada inLondon. The timing of these interviews would be concerted withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Home Secretary agreed that the Acting High Commissionerfor Canada ought to be informed of the position. Canada wouldbe seriously affected by any action taken to limit the convertibilityof sterling and arrangements had been made for the Governor ofthe Bank of Canada to meet Sir Wilfrid Eady in Washington. TheUnited Kingdom High Commissioner in Canada would also be instructed to inform the Canadian Government. It would also benecessary to inform the Prime Ministers of Australia and NewZealand. The United Kingdom representative in Dublin wouldbe instructed to inform Mr. De Valera as soon as possible after thepublic announcement had been made. The position in regard to south Africa presented special difficulties. There was a possibility that our action might result in the breakdown of the current loannegotiations with that Dominion; and also that it might force SouthAfrica to leave the sterling area. It was proposed that Field-Marshal Smuts should be informed of our intentions by personal telegram; at the same time it should be made clear to him thatwe were studying the implications of these developments on theloan negotiations. The Dominions of India and Pakistan were dependent on dollars for the maintenance of their food supplies, andarrangements would have to be made to inform them of our inten-tions and of the arrangements contemplated for providing themwith dollars.The Cabinet next discussed the arrangements to be made forgiving publicity to these measures and to the reasons for the Govern-ment&apos;s decision.It was agreed that the announcement of the decision should bemade in a broadcast by the Chancellor of the Exchequer after the9 p.m. news bulletin on Tuesday, 19th August. The chancellor would consult with the Prime Minister and the Lord President onthe terms of the announcement.
Other points made in discussion were : (a) The Lord President said that in his view the Cabinet hadbeen handicapped by lack of up-to-date statistical information onthe balance of payments. He recommended that an enquiry shouldbe held into the possibility of improving the machinery for providingstatictics bearing on this matter, and he suggested that the Secretaryfor Overseas Trade should be invited to conduct the enquiry.The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained the difficulties ofobtaining a full statistical picture of the current claims on sterling.He would, however, be only too glad if means could be found of improving the existing machinery for this purpose, and he was willing that the Secretary for Overseas Trade should conduct an enquiry into&apos; this point.(b) The Lairl President also suggested that there was need for strengthening the existing Balance of Payments Working Party.He thought it would be advantageous to establish a joint staff onthe balance of payments comprising representatives of the Treasury,Board of Trade, Bank of England and Economic Section of theCabinet Secretariat: and he asked that, if such a staff were estab-lished, his office should be represented on it. It might be useful if the Secretary for Overseas Trade acted as Chairman of this body.(c) When limits were set to the convertibility of sterling, our prospects of obtaining imports from such countries as the Argentinewould depend more than ever before on our power to supply themwith the kind of goods that they most urgently needed. We shouldhave to relate our export programme more precisely to our importneeds; and it followed that a more detailed direction of exports would become necessary.It was suggested that further inter-Departmental machinery would be required for this purpose. This might perhaps beestablished under the auspices of the Central Economic planning staff. Its detailed work would, of course, have to be closely relatedwith that of the Working Party on the Balance of Payments.(d) The Lord President said that the Government might be pressed to ask for the recall of Parliament : if this would in any event be necessary, it might be advisable to take the initiative in thematter rather than to appear to be yielding to pressure.The general view of the Cabinet was that it would be prematureat this stage to reach any decision regarding the summoning ofParliament.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to take themeasures outlined in Annex II to CP. (47) 233 for limiting the convertibility of sterling;(2) Endorsed the instructions already given to the leader of ourmission to Washington, as summarised in the memo-randum annexed to CP. (47) 233; and agreed that atthe outset of his negotiations he should, inform theUnited States representatives that in view of the rapidacceleration of the drain of dollars His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had come to the conclusion that they hadno option but to make temporary arrangements (on thelines indicated in Annex II to CP. (47) 233) to limit for the time being the convertibility of sterling intodollars by a system of rationing;(3) Agreed that the action outlined in Annex II to CP. (47) 233should be taken at 9 p.m. on Tuesday, 19th August; andthat the recent developments in our balance of payments position, and the measures which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were taking to meet the situation, shouldbe explained in a broadcast to be made by the Chancellorof the Jixchequer after the 9 o&apos;clock news that evening;
(4) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would see the UnitedStates Ambassador in London during 18th August and give him a full explanation of the situation and an indication of the measures which were being taken tomeet it;(5) Took note that special arrangements would be made for the acting High Commissioner for Canada to be seen, andthe position explained to him, before action was taken;    I(6) Instructed the Commonwealth Relations Office to arrange,in consultation with the Treasury, for appropriate com-munications to be sent to the Governments of Australia,New Zealand, South Africa, Eire, India and Pakistan;(7) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would arrange, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, for communications to be made at the appropriate moment to the Governments of the Argentine and France andthe other foreign countries who would be most directly affected by the action outlined in Annex II to cp. (47) 233;(8) Invited the Prime Minister to consider the suggestions noted in paragraphs (a) to (c) above for strengthening theinter-departmental machinery for handling balance ofpayments questions and matters related to the directionof exports.Goal.Hours of Workin theCoalminingIndustry.(previous reference:C.M.(47)69thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. At a meeting with representatives of the National coal board and the National Union of Mineworkers on 30th July, 1947,the Prime Minister had asked that an extra half-hour a day shouldbe worked in the coalmining industry as a temporary measuredesigned to increase coal output during the current emergency. TheCabinet now had before them a memorandum by the Minister of fuel and Power (CP. (47) 232) reporting the results of the subse-quent negotiations on this matter between the National Coal Boardand the National Union of Mineworkers.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the Union doubted whether they could persuade the miners to work an 8-hour day;and the Coal Board, while estimating that an 8-hour day would yield a 5 per cent, increase in output, recognised that there wouldbe technical difficulties in introducing it. Alternative proposals forSaturday working had therefore been discussed. The Coal board had suggested that every miner should work a full shift on alternateSaturdays and should be paid time-and-a-half if he had alreadyworked five shifts during the week. The Union had claimed thatthe men should work only 6^ hours on a Saturday and should bepaid at overtime rates whether or not they had already workedfive shifts during the week.The Minister said that he had had a private conversation withMr, Horner, Secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers.Mr. Horner was satisfied, from enquiries in the districts, that theminers would be unwilling to work an 8-hour day. He also believedthat, in order to provide an incentive for Saturday working, it wouldbe necessary to pay time-and-a-half. While he was not preparedto agree that full payment should be made only to men who hadalready worked five shifts during the week, he was ready to agreethat mine managers should have discretion to refuse to admit toSaturday work men who had been absent without good cause duringthe week.Mr. Horner had also indicated that the Union would raise noquestion if the Coal Board took proceedings against men who broketheir contracts by absenteeism : this might mean that such men could be required to recoup the Coal Board for losses due to their absence from work. He also considered that the Coal Board wouldbe justified in proceeding for damages against men adoptingpractices restricting output. And the Union were prepared to agreethat men who adopted &apos;&apos; go slow &apos;&apos; tactics should be entitled to
receive only the amounts they had actually earned and should notbe entitled to the minimum under the Porter Award.The Minister said that on the main issue the Government should give some guidance to the Coal Board before their next meeting withthe Union on 20th August. In the circumstances which he had described the choice seemed to lie between alternative forms of saturday working. The Coal Board might be advised to press fora system of working alternate Saturdays at ordinary rates of pay.The objection to this was that it would afford no incentive to the mento work a sixth shift and it seemed doubtful whether it would leadto any increase of output. The alternative was to advise the coal board to persist in their proposal that each man should work a fullshift on every other Saturday and should be paid time-and-a-half on condition that he had already worked five shifts during the week.He recommended that the Coal Board should be advised to press that proposal.In discussion Ministers expressed disappointment at the reaction of the National Union of Mineworkers to the appeal madeto them by the Prime Minister on 30th July. It was unsatis-factory that, in response to this emergency appeal for increasedhours of work, the industry should reply that increased output was most likely to be achieved by increasing stints, stopping restric-tive practices and reducing absenteeism; for these had been theconditions attached to the grant of the five-day week and the Govern-ment were now asking for a further contribution towards theeconomic emergency. Moreover, having so recently acquiesced inthe view that a five-day week need not necessarily involve a reductionin output, Ministers were reluctant to accept the conclusion that, if additional hours were now to be worked, the best course would beto revert to Saturday working. It might be true that the workingof an additional half-hour on other days would not lead to increased output in pits where agreement had not vet been reached on anincrease of stints; but increased stints should have been introduced as a condition of the five-day week, and the proper remedy was to expedite agreement on the increased stints so as to make the extrahalf-hour profitable.It was the Cabinets conclusion that a firmer line must now betaken with the miners&apos; representatives. The Government should insist that the Union should promptly fulfil the undertakings whichthey had given in return for the five-day week and should expedite the conclusion of satisfactory agreements for increasing stints, stop-ping restrictive practices and reducing absenteeism. It should bemade clear to them that these measures formed part of the earlieragreement in respect of the five-day week. What they were nowbeing asked to do was to make a further contribution to assist thecountry in the present economic crisis by accepting a temporary increase in working hours; and they should be strongly pressed toagree that the industry should make this contribution by workingan extra half-hour on each working day.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power to advise theNational Coal Board, for the reasons summarised above,to press the request tbat, as a temporary measure, minersshould work an extra half-hour on each working day;(2) Agreed that, if the National Coal Board were unable toreach a satisfactory agreement with the National Unionof Mineworkers on this basis, Ministers should renewtheir representations at a further meeting with repre-sentatives of the Union.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,11th August, 1947.
