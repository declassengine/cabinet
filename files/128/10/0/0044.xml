133CM. 93 (17)1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary and the Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP. (47) 320)on the withdrawal of British authority from Palestine.The memorandum recommended that, while His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should do nothing to obstruct the carrying out of theUnited Nations decision in favour of the partition of Palestine,British troops and the British administration should in no circum-stances become involved in enforcing that decision or in maintaininglaw and order while the United Nations Commission enforced it.It was suggested that the withdrawal of the British forces and administration should be carried out in accordance with the plansummarised in Annex B of CP. (47) 320. This would mean thatthe civil administration would be terminated by 15th May, 1948,and the withdrawal completed by 1st August. 1948. No feasiblearrangement could be made for the division of authority betweenthe Palestine Government and the United Nations Commission :indeed, even the arrival of the Commission would probably provokeArab disturbances on a scale which would seriously affect the with-drawal plan and endanger the whole British position in the middle east. Everything possible should therefore be done to ensure thatthe arrival of the Commission was delayed at least until the begin-ning of May, by which time authority could be transferred withoutprejudice to the withdrawal plan; and the United Kingdom repre-sentative at the United Nations should be instructed to negotiate with the Commission accordingly. He would also have to negotiate with the Commission on financial, economic and other matters connected with the transfer of authority. Although it would notbe possible to maintain preventive measures in Palestine againstillegal immigration after 1st February, every effort should be made,so long as His Majesty&apos;s Government remained responsible for theadministration of the territory, to check this traffic by measures taken outside Palestine. If it proved impracticable to maintainthe present immigration quota, the first step should be to remove the legal immigrants now in Cyprus, who should in any event betransferred to Palestine before our withdrawal was completed.Parliamentary Counsel should be instructed to prepare the legisla-tion which would be necessary on the relinquishment of the Mandate.,. In discussion the following points were made : (a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that negotiations would have to take place with the United Nations Commission on some complex financial and economic questions, such as the exclusion of Palestine from the sterling area on the termination of the british administration. The United Kingdom representative at the united nations should be informed that instructions on these questions would be sent to him as soon as possible, and that expert assistance for the negotiations would, if necessary, be provided for him. Inthe first instance, the Overseas Negotiations Committee should prepare a comprehensive paper for consideration by Ministers.(b) The Minister of Defence said that paragraph 1 *(4) of cp. (47) 320 should be expanded to indicate the importance attachedby His Majesty&apos;s Government to the negotiation with the united nations Commission of suitable arrangements for the custody ordisposal of Service stores left in Palestine after our withdrawal.It was agreed that this matter should also be dealt with inthe paper to be prepared by the Overseas Negotiations Committee.(c) The Cabinet were informed that every effort would be madeby the Navy to maintain preventive measures against illegal immi-grants after 1st February, and that it was hoped that the trans-shipment of illegal immigrants, for transfer to Cyprus, could be managed without military assistance. These arrangements wouldnot, however, be effective if the traffic became heavy.(d) Some doubt was felt whether the local military authoritiesin Palestine would be competent to make a correct selection of storesfor evacuation in the light of the general supply position and ofneeds elsewhere. It was agreed that, in view of the magnitude ofthe task, it would be advisable to make a special appointment for34724-4 b 2Palestine.(previous reference:C.M.(47)90thConclusions,Minute 2.)
the specific purpose of supervising the collection and evacuation ofmilitary stores from Palestine.(e) Would the United Nations Commission have legal powerto assume responsibility for matters, such as the maintenance of contracts, which His Majesty&apos;s Government would wish to transfer to them in due course? It was pointed out thai, this question hadbeen raised during the discussions in New York, and that theGeneral Assembly had considered that the Commission would possess the necessary powers. The Commission would have the right to invoke the assistance of the Security Council.The Cabinet-(1) Endorsed the recommendations made in CP. (47) 320 on future policy in Palestine, and approved those recom-mendations as a basis for the negotiations with theUnited Nations Commission to be undertaken by theUnited Kingdom representative at the United Nations;(2) Invited the Minister of Defence to arrange for a specialappointment to be made for supervision of the collection and evacuation of military stores from Palestine.Situationin Aden.2. The Cabinet were informed that the Governor of Adenhad reported that anti-Jewish riots had broken out in the Colonyon the previous day, and that a state of emergency had beenproclaimed.It was agreed that immediate steps should be taken to reinforce the local security forces, if the latter proved unable to control thesituation. It was suggested that troops might be sent by air from egypt, and that the possibility of despatching one of KM. ships to Aden should also be considered.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with theSecretary of State for the Colonies, to consider urgentlywhat steps should be taken to reinforce the security forcesin Aden.Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.Business inthe House ofLords.ParliamentaryPrinting.3. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.It was expected that the House of Commons would complete their consideration of the Parliament Bill during the following-week. The Cabinet agreed that proceedings on this Bill in the Houseof Lords could be deferred until after the Christmas Recess.Attention was drawn to the danger that proceedings in theHouse of Lords on the Emergency Laws (Miscellaneous Provisions)Bill might be delayed by discussions on the Control of Engagementand Registration for Employment Orders. Some OppositionMembers might even seek to carry amendments to that Bill limiting the Governments power to direct labour. Every effort would bemade to persuade the House of Lords that these matters lay outsidethe scope of that Bill, which should be passed into law before31st December, 1947, and that other opportunities should be foundto debate these matters.The Cabinet were informed that the London Society ofCompositors had, in furtherance of an industrial dispute, orderedtheir members to suspend at once all working of overtime. the speaker had pointed out that, if this order were carried out, itwould seriously dislocate the work of the House of Commons. TheMinister of Labour informed the Cabinet of the history of this dispute and said that he was already in touch with the unions concerned. He undertook to draw their particular attention to the printing needs of the House of Commons and to see whether arrange -ments could not be made to ensure that those needs would continueto be met.
135CM. 93 (17)&apos;Government 4.   The Lord President said that at their meeting in the publicity following week the Parliamentary Labour Party would beService. discussing the Governments publicity services, and the suggestion(Previous would be made that a Minister of Information should be appointed.Reference: Subject to the Cabinet&apos;s views, he proposed to take the line that itCM (46) 17th was impracticable for a single Minister to assume responsibilityConclusions, ^or tne handling of all Government publicity, and to stress the dam-Minute 4.) &apos;     culties which would arise if a separate Minister dealt with the publicity aspects of policies  for which other Ministers  wereaccountable to Parliament.The Cabinet-Endorsed the line which the Lord President proposed totake in opposing, at the forthcoming meeting of the Parlia-mentary Labour Party, suggestions for the appointmentof a Minister for Information.Marriage ofH.R.H. thePrincessElizabeth.Civil ListProvision.(previous reference:CM. (47) 92ndConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Prime Minister recalled that on 2nd December theCabinet had approved the suggestion that the annual sum of  15,000hitherto paid to Her Royal Highness The Princess Elizabeth should now be raised to  30,000 and that a further  10,000 should be pro-vided for His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh. In the lightof the evidence given to the Select Committee on the previous dayregarding the probable cost of maintaining a separate household,he and the Chancellor of the Exchequer were now inclined to theview that it would be more reasonable to suggest that the annualsum paid to Princess Elizabeth should be raised to  35,000, makinga total provision of  45,000 a year.The Cabinet endorsed this view.The Cabinet Agreed that the proposals to be laid before the Select Com-mittee regarding the financial provision to be made forHer Royal Highness The Princess Elizabeth and His royal highness The Duke of Edinburgh, which they had approved on 2nd December, should be so modified as toprovide a further  5,000 a year for Princess Elizabeth.Land Require-ments of theServiceDepartmentsand theMinistry ofSupply.(previous reference:CM. (47) 58thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. On 1st July the Cabinet had approved in principle theproposals submitted to them in CP. (47) 184 for the use of land fortraining and other purposes by the Service Departments and theMinistry of Supply, but had asked that the draft White paper explaining these proposals should be revised.The Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by the Minis-ter of Defence (CP. (47) 318) covering a revised, draft, which hadbeen prepared in consultation with all the Departments concerned and took account of a reduction of 103,000 acres in the War Officerequirement. It was proposed that the White Paper should be presented by the Prime Minister on 10th December; and that theMinister of Town and Country Planning, with the Secretary of Statefor War, should explain its contents to a Conference of LobbyCorrespondents on that day. These Ministers would also speak onthe Governments behalf in any Parliamentary debate on the white paper.In discussion the following points were made : (a) Paragraph 20 of the draft White Paper, which set out thereasons why the remoter areas of Scotland were unsuitable fortraining purposes, should be so recast as to give more emphasis tothe remoteness of these areas and less to their disadvantages ofterrain and climate.(b) The figure of 32,000 acres given as the approximate require-ment of land for Ministry of Supply purposes in paragraph 33 neednot be altered because of a project for acquiring an additional 1,000acres for these purposes.
(c) The words &quot; and forestry &quot; should, be deleted from the heading of paragraph 31.(d) The Minister of Town and Country Planning hoped shortly to be able to communicate with the Home Secretary on the questionwhether any amendment of the Military Lands Act, 1892, or theRequisitioned Land and War Works Act, 1945, -was necessary inorder to preserve the right of access to common land acquired underthese Acts and subsequently released.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the draft White Paper annexed to CP. (47) 318,subject to the amendments noted in paragraphs (a) and(c) above, and to such other minor or drafting amend-ments as might be found, necessary; and agreed that itshould be presented by the Prime Minister on10th December;(2) Agreed that the Minister of Town and Country Planning,with the Secretary of State for War, should hold a Con-ference with Lobby correspondents on the day on whichthe White Paper was presented, and that these ministers should be the Government spokesmen in any Pariiamen-tary debate on the White Paper.inet Office, S.
