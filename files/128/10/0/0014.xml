Germany. 1.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (47) 209) regarding-(i) the revised plan for the German level of industry; and(ii) the treatment of the Anglo-American Zone in the planefor European economic co-operation.Level of The Foreign Secretary recalled, that agreement had beenIndustry.        virtually reached on a new level of industry for the Anglo-American(Previous       Zone of Germany.   The French Government had, however, been reference:      greatly disturbed to learn of the new proposals and had protestedCM. (47)49th   strongly against their adoption at the present time.   It was clearConclusions,     that if these proposals were to be approved and published the FrenchMinute 3.)      Government would find themselves in a position of great difficulty,which might result in their resignation, and that the success ofthe Paris discussions would be gravely threatened.  In spite, there-fore, of the objections, from the German point of view, to further delay, he thought it would be advisable to postpone the implement a-tion of the new plan.  He proposed to suggest to the United states secretary of State that the United Kingdom and the United states government should jointly inform the French Government that (i) no steps would be taken, before the beginning of Septem-ber, to implement the new plan for the level of industryin the Anglo-American Zone of Germany;(ii) in the interval, the United States and United kingdom governments would be prepared to consider any repre-sentations that the French Government might care tomake regarding the plan; and that(iii) any question relating to the plan should be raised direct with the United States and United Kingdom Govern-ments, and not at the Paris discussions.Western The Foreign Secretary said that the United Kingdom delega-Germany and tion in Paris had asked to be instructed whether Western germany the Plans for should be brought into the programme of European economicEuropean co-operation on the same basis as a full participating country or economic should be considered primarily from the point of view of the con-Co-operation, tribution which it might make to the needs of other countries. any suggestion that German reconstruction was being favoured in pre-ference to that of other countries would cause serious resentmentand would lend support to the Russian allegation that the main object of the United States offer had been to rehabilitate Germany.On the other hand, it was clear that the only satisfactory coursewould be to secure that the needs and resources of Western germany were integrated with the programme in the same manner as thoseof any of the other participating countries. He accordingly pro-posed that the United Kingdom delegation should be instructedto press for the treatment of Western Germany on this basis. Theyshould, however, make it clear that they were doing so for practical reasons and because this seemed to be the best way of ensuring that Germany would make the fullest contribution to the recon-struction of Europe. He also proposed that the British and american Commanders-in-Chief should be instructed that replies toany questionnaires received from the Paris Conference should bebased on the new level of industry plan.In discussion, it was pointed out that the proposals to be sub-mitted to the United States Government would aim at the rehabilitation-tation of Europe within four years. It seemed unlikely that eventhe revised level of industry plan would achieve this for western germany. Was it possible that the United States Government might wish to revise the level of industry plan again in order to bring it into line with the general basis of the plans for european recovery \ \The Foreign Secretary said that this was a possibility, but that,if coal output in the Ruhr could be increased to about 300,000 tonsa day and if the production of food could be raised to about 75 percent, of the 1938 level, Western Germany should be self-supportingby 1949.[34132-4] b 2
The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the proposals made by the Foreign Secretary in cp. (47) 209 for deferring the implementation of the revised plan for the level of industry in the Anglo-American Zone of Germany and for the treatment offcke Anglo-American Zone in the preparation of the plans for European economic co-operation.Coal The Cabinet then considered a note by the Foreign SecretaryProduction. (C.P. (47) 210) covering a record of a conversation which he had had with the United States Ambassador on the proposal that a UnitedKingdom mission should be sent to Washington for discussions on german coal production.The Foreign Secretary said that in reply to the original UnitedStates invitation he had pointed out that coal production was onlvone aspect of the economic recovery of Germany and that other aspects, such as finance and food supplies, also required considera-tion. He had subsequently been informed that the United StatesGovernment felt that any attempt to deal with the general economic problems of Germany apart from the plans for European economic co-operation would be unacceptable to Congress, and in the con-versation recorded in the Appendix to CP. (47) 210 the UnitedStates Ambassador, while acknowledging that additional food supplies and finance would be required if coal production was tobe increased, and that the United Kingdom could not undertaketo bear any further expenditure for this purpose, had pressed himto agree to send a technical mission to discuss the points relatingto coal production covered in the agenda which the United StatesGovernment had put forward. One of the main points in the agendawas the suggestion that uncertainty about the future ownership ofthe mines was adversely affecting production. There was probablysome truth in this and, from our point of view, the sooner the mines were brought under public ownership the better. On the other hand,it must be recognised that it might be difficult to secure agreementwith the United States on this matter, and there would also beopposition from the Belgian, Netherlands and French Governments,some of whose nationals had interests in German mines. He had asked the United States Ambassador to give him further informa-tion about the views of the United States Government on the items in the agenda which they had suggested and he would await this further information before despatching the proposed mission. Themembers of the mission would be mainly technicians and general robertson, who would lead it, would be able to deal with any questions about the future ownership of the mines which mightbe raised. He was anxious to meet the United States Secretaryof State in this matter in order to help him to bring discussions about the economic future of Germany within the ambit of the state department rather than that of the War Department.In discussion, the following points were made : (a) In view of the political situation in Germany it was of theutmost importance that there should be no departure from the UnitedKingdom proposal for bringing the German mines under public ownership.(b) There was no evidence that the United States Government,in the interests of finding a market for American coal, wished to hamper the recovery of coal production in the United Kingdom andand on the Continent.(c) It was essential that, in the discussions in Paris on the plans for European economic co-operation, the United Kingdom Govern-ment should be able to promise substantial exports of coal to Europe.This matter would be discussed by the Fuel Committee on thefollowing day.   &apos; .  j(d) More active steps should be taken to inform the UnitedStates public of the true state of affairs in the United Kingdomand to correct the misleading impressions created by some visitorsfrom this country.  The Foreign Secretary said that he fully realised
the importance of this, but that, in his view, the best moment forlaunching a campaign to educate opinion in the United States wouldbe about the beginning of September.The Cabinet-(2) Took note that the Foreign Secretary had asked the UnitedStates Government for further information about thepoints to be covered in the proposed discussions in washington on German coal production and authorised him, in the light of this further information, to make arrangements for the despatch of a suitable United King-dom mission to Washington.(3) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would consider whatwould be the most effective steps to educate opinion inthe United States about the situation in the UnitedKingdom.Burma.(previous reference:CM. (47) 5SihConclusions,Minute 7.)2. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that an anounce-ment would be made in Parliament on the following day regardingthe results of the recent conversations with the Burma GoodwillMission. The text of the announcement had been approved by the burma Executive Council on 18th July. He had ascertained thatthe Opposition would not press for any change of policy on accountof the assassination of U Aung San and his colleagues.The Cabinet-Took note,statement.with  approval,  of  the  Prime Minister&apos;cabinet Office, S.W. 1,23rd July, 1947.
