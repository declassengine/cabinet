Ministry of 1.   The Prime Minister said that, in view of the illness of theTransport. Minister of Transport, which was likely to last for some weeks,he had asked the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations toassume responsibility for the Ministry of Transport during theMinisters absence. The Lord Privy Seal would be able to give some assistance with the work of the Commonwealth Relations Officeduring this period.2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Cabinet also considered a suggestion that the country&apos;financial position should be discussed at an. early meeting of theParliamentary Labour Party. After discussion the conclusion wasreached that it would be inexpedient that a Party meeting shouldbe held for the purpose of discussing these matters so soon beforethe introduction of the autumn Budget. The Chancellor of theExchequer had already taken steps to ascertain by informal means the views currently held on these matters by Government supporters.It was unnecessary, and it might prove embarrassing, for this to be supplemented now by discussion at a formal Party meeting. TheParliamentary Labour Party should, therefore, be asked to refrain from discussing these matters until after the introduction of theautumn Budget; and if they should persist in holding a meetingfor this purpose the Chancellor of the Exchequer should notattend it.Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.Parliament.Amendmentof the parliament act.(previous reference:CM. (47) 81stConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president, the Lord Chancellor and the Home Secretary(CP. (47) 299) covering the draft of a Bill to amend the parliament act, 1911.The following points were raised in discussion of thismemorandum :  (a) Some adjustment of the Parliamentary time-table would benecessary, if this&apos;Bill were rejected by the Lords : for, in that event,if it were desired to pass an important Government measure underthe amended provisions of the Parliament Act, a short Session wouldhave to be held in addition to the remaining three normal sessions of the present Parliament. One possible method of adjusting theremaining Sessions for this purpose was outlined in paragraph 2of CP. (47) 299. This, however, was brought to the Cabinefs noticeat the present stage only by way of illustration : it could be left tothe Future Legislation Committee to consider in detail, when theneed arose, how the remaining Sessions of the present parliament could best be arranged.(b) Should the Bill include provisions limiting the powers ofthe House of Lords in respect of subordinate legislation ? The scopeof subordinate legislation was far wider now than it had been whenthe Act of 1911 was passed; and it was arguable that the Govern-menfs purpose could not be fully secured if the Bill left unimpairedthe existing power of the Lords to set aside Ministerial Orders and regulations. On the other hand, it was pointed out that the lords had not hitherto abused this power; and that, if thescope of the Bill were extended to cover subordinate legislation, thearea of controversy would be substantially enlarged. Moreover,provisions on this point could not be included in the Bill withoutdetailed research, which would involve postponing the introductionof the Bill.(c) The Lord Privy Seal said that, owing to his absence abroad,he had been unable to take part in the Cabinefs earlier discussions of this Bill. He understood, however, that at their meeting on20th October the Cabinet had agreed that in defending this measureMinisters should say nothing to imply that it reflected the viewsof the Labour Party on the broader question of House of lords reform, or that the Labour Party favoured the retention of are formed House of Lords.   He himself, while agreeing that the34527-1 B 2
powers of the Lords should be reduced in the manner proposed by theBill, felt that by introducing this measure the Government would imply that they accepted the continuance of the House of Lords as now constituted, subject only to this limitation of its powers to delay the passage of Government legislation. He would, therefore,have preferred that the introduction of this measure should be accompanied by proposals for reforming the constitution of theHouse of Lords, e.g., by abolishing the hereditary right to vote. Hethought there was some prospect of arriving at agreed proposalsfor reforming the constitution of the House of Lords on these lines.The general view of the Cabinet was that support of this measure need by no means imply acceptance of the existing consti-tution of&apos; the House of Lords. The promoters of the 1911 Bill hadnot accepted that constitution and had included a declaration tothat effect in the preamble to their Bill. This, however, was not asuitable moment for reforming the constitution of the House ofLords. And, in any event, the initiative in bringing forward pro-posals for such reform should be left with the Opposition. It was unlikely that any proposals which they put forward would prove acceptable to the Labour Party.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that no provisions limiting the powers of the Houseof Lords in respect of subordinate legislation should beincluded in the Bill to amend the Parliament Act before its introduction in the House of Commons; but invited the Lord Chancellor to circulate for the information ofthe Cabinet a memorandum on the question of limitingthose powers.(2) Authorised the early introduction in the House of commons of a Parliament Bill, in the terms of the draft annexed to CP. (47) 299, subject to such minor drafting amend-ments as might be approved by the Lord President, theLord Chancellor and the Home Secretary.(3) Invited the Future Legislation Committee to keep underreview the question how the remaining Sessions of thepresent Parliament could best be arranged if it became necessary to enact the Parliament Bill under the existing provisions of the Parliament Act, 1911.Law Reform 4.   The  Cabinet  considered  a memorandum  by  the Lord(Personal Chancellor (CP. (47) 285) covering a draft Law Reform (PersonalInjuries) Injuries) Bill.Bill.The Lord Chancellor said that the Bill gave effect to theconclusions reached by the Social Services Committee on the recom-mendations of the Monckton Committee on Alternative Remedies.The Bill departed from the recommendations of the majority reportof the Monckton Committee in providing that in actions for damagesfor personal injury the court, in assessing that part of the damagesrepresenting compensation for loss of earnings and profits, shouldtake into account only one-half of any national insurance benefits which the injured man would receive during five years from thedate of the accident and should take no account of constantattendance allowances or death benefits. This provision, whilegiving recognition to the insurance contributions made by theinjured man himself, took account of the fact that under a schemeof compulsory insurance the State and employers also contributed;and it was approved by the Trades Union Congress as a reasonablecompromise.The Monckton Committee had recommended that the period of limitation within which actions for damages for personal injurymight be started should be three years in all cases. It seemeddoubtful whether legislation on this matter could be justified onthe basis of a recommendation from a committee which had not
5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (47) 301) covering a draft Registration for Employ-ment (Street Traders) Order prepared by the Minister of labour in accordance with the Cabinefs request that he should consider what steps he - might take, without fresh legislation, to requirepersons engaged in street trading to register compulsorily.The Minister of Labour had proposed to make two Orders under defence Regulation 58a, one applying only to street traders anda second general Order covering unoccupied persons and employees of football pools and similar enterprises. The former Order differed from the general Order in that it imposed on street traders an obligation to produce their certificates of registration, and to give their names and addresses, to the police; and the Legislation Com-mittee had felt that the Cabinet should have an opportunity of considering the objections that might be made to this provision.The Cabinet were informed that both in the Trades UnionCongress and among workers in general there was a strong feeling that the proposed new controls over ordinary industrial workers should be accompanied by a determined effort to bring under controlpersons who were at present performing no useful service. It shouldbe possible to obtain a fairly effective registration of persons engagedin football pools and similar enterprises, since a duty would beRegistrationof StreetTraders.(previous reference:CM. (47) 77thConclusions,Minute 5.)heard the arguments of local authorities for retaining the existingperiod of one year under the Public Authorities Protection Act,had not examined the situation in Scotland and had been concernedsolely with claims between employers and workers. He therefore proposed that a committee should be appointed to consider thequestion of limitation of such actions as a whole. This committee might be able to make recommendations in time to enable the Billto be amended during its passage through Parliament.The following points were made in discussion :  (a) An alternative proposal, by which damages would be assessed in full but there would be some reduction in the amountof national insurance benefits payable, had been rejected by theSocial Services Committee on the ground that it would be undesirable to lay on the Minister of National Insurance the duty of reducingbenefit payments or initiating actions for damages.(b) In the past approved societies, in taking actions to protect their funds, had often been able to secure damages for injuredpersons who would not have been in a position to bring actions them-selves. Such persons would be in a worse position after the transferof responsibility to the Minister of National Insurance, and theonly satisfactory way of helping them would be through improvedarrangements for the provision of legal aid.(c) The Government would have to face a claim that service pensioners who obtained damages should be put in the same positionas persons entitled to damages as well as national insurance benefits.(d) Any proposal to increase the period during which actionsmight be brought against local authorities for breach of public duty would be opposed by the associations of local authorities, and itmight be unwise to attempt to deal with this question by amending the present Bill during its passage through. Parliament : it mightbe preferable to promise further legislation at a later date.The Cabinet (1) Approved the policy embodied in the draft Law Reform(Personal Injuries) Bill annexed to CP. (47) 285 and invited the Lord Chancellor to submit the draft Bill tothe Legislation Committee;(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with the lord president and the Secretary of State for Scotland, toarrange for the appointment of a committee to considerthe general question of the limitation of actions.
placed on the employer to furnish a return of his employees. Buta mere requirement that all street traders should register was unlikely to be effective without an obligation to produce a certificate of registration on demand. On the other hand, there were difficultiesin imposing on street traders an obligation which would not be imposed on unoccupied persons.In discussion there was general agreement that it would be inexpedient to impose on street traders an obligation to producecertificates of registration on demand.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Labour to arrange for streettraders to be dealt with on the same basis as unoccupiedpersons in the general Order which he proposed to makeunder Defence Regulation 58a, and to circulate a revised draft of this Order to the Legislation Committee.InternationalBill of HumanKights.(previous reference:S.M.(47)53rdConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofLabour (CP. (47) 296) on the compulsory labour clause in the draftBill of Human Rights which was to be discussed at the meeting ofthe Human Rights Commission of the United Nations inDecember 1947.The Minister of Labour said that, for the reasons stated inparagraph 4 of his memorandum, he could not advise the Cabinetto accept the clause on this subject which was to be proposed by theUnited States delegation. He suggested that the United kingdom representative on the commission should oppose it and should suggest that the International Labour Organisation should be askedto advise on the form of the provision relating to compulsory labour to be inserted in the Bill. It might then be unnecessary for our representative to suggest an alternative wording : if, however, heshould have to put forward a draft, he should use the form of wordsand the explanations given in paragraph 10 of CP. (47) 296.The following points wrere made in discussion : (a) Was the expenditure of effort in the preparation of a bill of Human Rights justifiable in present circumstances?In reply it was pointed out that the principles laid clown inthe Bill would constitute a standard by which the provisions forthe protection of human rights in the Peace Treaties could be measured. Moreover, though the States which approved the bill would not be obliged to pass domestic legislation to implement it,their acceptance of it would, on past experience, influence their conduct.(b) While there would be advantage in asking the InternationalLabour Organisation to advise on the terms of the compulsory labourclause, it would be important to ensure that the question of compulsory labour was fully discussed by the commission, when that advice was available. The Soviet Union was not a memberof the International Labour Organisation, but was represented on.the commission.(c) The Foreign Office should be consulted on the terms of thedraft clause and the explanations proposed in paragraph 10 of cp. (47) 296. and these should so far as possible be kept in line with the Convention concerning forced or compulsory labour adoptedby the International Labour Organisation in 1930. The language of this C^wmtion had, in. particular&apos;, the advantage of avoiding any difficulty over jury service or aid to the civil power.(d) In stating that it would be necessary to provide for recourse to compulsory labour in territories where exceptional conditionsprevailed, the United Kingdom representative should not referspecifically to colonial territories.(e) The terms of the proposed reference to compulsory militaryservice should be adjusted in consultation with the Ministry ofDefence.
(/) Dominion Governments should be informed of the line whichthe United Kingdom representatives proposed to take.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the United Kingdom representative on the human Rights Commission should support the inclusion in the Bill of Human Rights of a provision prohibitingJ the use, except in time of war or national emergency, of compulsory labour, and should recommend that the Inter-national Labour Organisation should be asked to advise on the form of the provision;(2) Invited the Minister of Labour to settle, in the light of thepoints noted in paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) above andin consultation with the Foreign Secretary, the Ministerof Defence, the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations and the Secretary of State for the Colonies,the terms of a clause which the United kingdom representative might, if necessary, propose to thecommission and of the explanations which he should give in putting this forward.trade negotiations.(previous kef erence:C.M.(47)79thConclusions,Minute 5.)7. The Prime Minister recalled that at their meeting on 9th October the Cabinet had agreed that in the resumed trade negotiations with the United States Government no concession should be made as regards the reduction of the margin of preferenceenjoyed by the United Kingdom in Colonial markets. It had,however, been found that in return for certain reductions in colonial preference the United States Government were preparedto increase the proportion of natural rubber used by United Statesindustry. This represented a valuable concession and in view ofthe urgency of the matter he had authorised the President of theBoard of Trade to offer these reductions without further referenceto the Cabinet.The Cabinet-Endorsed the instructions given bv the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,30th October, 1947.
