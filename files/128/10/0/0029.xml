Burma. 2.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of constitutional State for Burma (CP. (47) 275) on the progress of the negotiationsPosition. for a treaty regulating the transfer of power in Burma.(Previous The Secretary of State for Burma said that good progress hadBeference:       Deen made with these negotiations.   The financial and commercialCM. (47)63rd   clauses of the treaty were now under discussion with a FinancialConclusions,     Mission from Burma; and it was hoped that the treaty as a wholeMinute 2.)      would be ready for signature by 17th October.   The ConstituentAssembly in Burma had completed the preparation of the new con-stitution for an independent Burma, and this would come into force on the day appointed for the transfer of power in the legislation to be enacted by the United Kingdom Parliament.  The draft treatycontained a clause recognising the independence of Burma, and pro-vided that ratifications should be exchanged on the day appointed for the transfer of power.   The treaty would then come into force.The rights of the Parliament at Westminster had thus been fully safaguarded, since the ratification and coining into operation of thetreaty would be contingent on the passing of the necessary legisla-tion in the United Kingdom.The Prime Minister said that the progress of these negotiations had been kept under review by the India and Burma Committee;and he advised the Cabinet to approve the procedure outlined in cp. (47) 275.In discussion the Cabinet expressed their regret that the pro-visional Government of Burma had found themselves unable to resist the political pressure in Burma in favour of secession from theBritish Commonwealth. Though the treaty would provide close tiesbetween Burma and the United Kingdom, Burma would inevitablysuffer disadvantages through ceasing to be a member of the BritishCommonwealth.The Cabinet Approved the procedure proposed in CP. (47) 275 for theconclusion of the treaty regulating the transfer of power in Burma.34393-3Lord Mayors 1.   The Prime Minister said that he had been consideringDiane?. whether the Lord Mayor &apos;s Dinner should be held this year notwith-standing the Cabinefs decision that in the present economic situa-tion the numbers attending public banquets should not normallyexceed one hundred. The City authorities were prepared to limit the number of guests on this occasion to about three hundred, but ifa smaller number were insisted upon it would not be practicable tohold the Dinner. If it were not held, a long tradition would be broken. He was himself inclined to think that it would be right that the Dinner should be held on the reduced scale proposed.The Cabinet endorsed the Prime Ministers view.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Food to make the necessary arrangements to enable the Lord Mayor&apos;s Dinner to he held notwithstanding the Order limiting the number ofguests at public banquets; and to arrange for the Cityauthorities to issue in advance a public announcementexplaining the special circumstances which warranted the holding of this Dinner.
Strength of 3.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofthe Armed Defence (CP. (47) 272) reporting the conclusions reached by theForces. Defence Committee on the strength of the Armed Forces during the(Previous        period up to 31st March, 1949.reference: The Minister of Defence said that the recommendations nowCM. (47) 70th submitted to the Cabinet involved very substantial reductions, bothConclusions, in men and in money, as compared with the proposals orginallyMinute 2.)      pUt forward by the Service Ministers and the Minister of Supply.Between 30th September, 1947, and 31st March, 1949, there wouldbe a net reduction of 514,000 in the strength of the Armed Forces;and the original forecasts of a total strength at 31st March, 1948,of 1,087,000 in the Armed Forces and of 450,000 industrial workers engaged on production, research and development for the services would be reduced by 150,000 and 100,000 respectively. He was satisfied, for the reasons given in paragraph 9 of CP. (47) 272, thatit would not be possible to secure a more rapid reduction in thestrength of the Armed Forces over the period up to 31st March,1949. In paragraph 15 of the memorandum annexed to CP. (47) 272he had indicated that the total of the 1948-49 Defence Estimateswas likely to be  711 million. This figure would be the subjectof further examination and the Cabinet were not asked to approveit at this stage. If, however, the Cabinet approved his proposals regarding the strength of the Armed Forces it would be difficultto make any material reduction in the estimated expenditure. Atthe same time, it was his long-term aim to secure properly balancedand efficient peace-time Forces at an annual cost not exceeding 600 million. The proposal for reducing the strength of the armed forces to 937,000 by 31st March, 1948, was based on certain assump-tions with regard to the liquidation of overseas commitments and,as would be seen from paragraph 8 of CP. (47) 272, it was not byany means certain that the hopes on which the planned reduction was based would be realised. The Cabinet would note that theproposals for the period up to 31st March, 1949, involved theacceptance of serious political and strategic risks arising from the weakening of our Forces overseas on the lines indicated in para-graph 19 of the memorandum annexed to CP. (47) 272. There wasalso the possibility of considerable political difficulties at home ifit should prove necessary, for example, to put on a care and main-tenance basis one of the southern Dockyards.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he supported theproposals in CP. (47) 272, though he had been disappointed thatthe reduction in the strength of the Armed Forces to 713,000 couldnot be accelerated. He recalled that the Defence Committee had agreed that the possibility of reducing the numbers employed inthe Army on static duties and the numbers of civilians employedby the Services should be examined and pointed out that, pendingthe results of these studies, it should not be assumed that the con-sequences indicated in paragraph 19 of the memorandum annexed to CP. (47) 272 would necessarily flow from acceptance of theDefence Committee&apos;s recommendations. He must reserve his posi-tion with regard to the estimated cost of the Armed Forces in1948-49.The Foreign Secretary said that the foreign policy of HisMajesty&apos;s Government must be backed by adequate Armed Forces.For this reason the necessary reorganisation of the Armed forces must be carried out with all speed. Even if every effort were made,it looked as though it would be some years before the power ofdefence would have developed sufficiently to counter the new weapons of offence. Savings in man-power achieved by reducing the numbers employed on static duties or as civilians should be reflected in a strengthening of the combatant element of the Armed Forces. Whenthe proposals were made public the financial picture should be fairlypresented. For this purpose it was essential to show not merely the total cost, but also the dollar cost, of maintaining forces overseas.The Defence Committee had invited the Chancellor of the exchequer on 18th September to supply figures on this point.   Again, the
Services should be given credit for the contribution which they madeto the national economy by carrying out work which would other-wise have to be done by civilians. Account should also be taken ofthe receipts from the disposal of surplus Service stores and of thebenefits derived from our occupation of Germany and from theemployment of prisoners of war in this country.In further discussion the following points were made : (a) The First Lord of the A dmiralty pointed Out that the reduc-tion in the strength of the Royal Navy to a peace-time level wouldbe carried out in 6 instead of 18 months and this must involve, atleast for a time, a very large reduction in its. effective strength.In particular, there would have to be a heavy cut in the size of theBritish Pacific Fleet, which would seriously weaken the politicaland economic influence of the United Kingdom in the Pacific. Theinformation given in paragraph 19 of the memorandum annexed to cp. (47) 272 was, however, only designed to give a measure of theconsequences which would flow from acceptance of the proposals andhe wished to retain freedom to make such adjustments as wouldenable the man-power available to be used to the best advantage.(b) The Secretary of State for Air said that the acceleration of the reduction in the strength of the Forces would have the effectof increasing still further the disparities between the dates of release of men in the same age and length of service group but indifferent branches and trades.. (c) The Chief of the Air Staff emphasised that the proposals in CP. (47) 272 were based on the assumption that there would beno major war for the next five years. Moreover, the additional dis-iocation which the Armed Forces would suffer made it very doubtfulwhether they would be able, for some time to come, to undertakeany fresh commitments which were not now foreseen.(d) In presenting the proposals to Parliament it would be important to distinguish terminal from current expenditure and toavoid inflating the numbers of workers engaged on production forthe Services by including those who were making only a remote and indirect contribution or were employed on the production of supplies which members of the Armed Forces would consume if they werecivilians. It would also be desirable to show that the proposed reductions in the strength of the Armed Forces were not being obtained at the expense of an increase in the number of civiliansemployed by the Services.(e) The Service Departments and the Ministry of Supply wereconcentrating to the greatest possible extent on research and develop-ment and had cut their production to a minimum. It was difficultto plan the development of new weapons in the absence of a clearpicture of the lines on which any future war would be fought but such guidance as the Defence Research Policy Committee had beenable to give was being applied. Much of the research undertaken for the Services was of a fundamental character and its results were of benefit to industry.(/) If the planned reduction in the strength of the armed forces in the period up to 31st March, 1948, was to be carried out,an announcement about the age and length of service groups to be released in the first quarter of 1948 must be made by about the12th October; and, since during this period there would be wide dis-parities in the dates of release of men in the same group, anysuch announcement should give a full explanation of what was pro-posed, even though this meant anticipating to some extent thegeneral statement Avhich would be made in the Debate on the address. The announcement should make it clear that the newdecisions would not affect the dates of release of men due to be released before 31st December, 1947.(g) The Service Departments should ensure that any additionalhutted accommodation which might be released in consequence ofthe proposals in CP. (47) 272 was not occupied by squatters.
The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in CP. (47) 272 for reducing thestrength of the Armed Forces to 937,000 by 31st March,1948, and to 713,000 by 31st March, 1949;(2) Agreed that the planning assumptions and the strategic andpolitical risks indicated in paragraphs 4 and 5 of cp. (47) 272 should be accepted;(3) Took note that the planned reduction of the strength of the armed Forces to 937,000 at 31st March, 1948, was basedon certain assumptions with regard to the liquidation of overseas commitments which might not be realised;(4) Agreed that the National Service intake into the three services should be reduced to approximately 150,000in 1948-49 and took note that ways and means of achieving this reduction were being urgently considered;(5) Agreed that the points made by the Foreign Secretary inthe Cabinet&apos;s discussion and those noted in paragraph (d)above should be taken into account in presenting theGovernments proposals to Parliament;(6) Agreed that an announcement about the releases to be madein the first quarter of 1948 would have to be made byabout 12th October, and invited the Minister of Defence,in consultation with the Minister of Labour and theService Ministers, to settle the terms of that announce-ment.petrol rationing.allowances for Touristsand persons on Leave.(previous reference erence:C.M.(47)74thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Ministerof Fuel and Power (CP. (47) 274) on the question whether, afterthe withdrawal of the basic petrol ration, allowances of petrol shouldcontinue to be given to (i) tourists visiting the United Kingdom;and (ii) Service men and civilians on leave in the United Kngdom.There was general agreement that, as no basic ration was tobe given to motorists resident in this country, there was no justifica-tion for giving petrol allowances as of right to all Service men and civilians visiting this country on leave. The Secretary of State forWar asked, however, that members of the Services should not be deprived of the &quot; end of war leave &quot; allowance of petrol which ineffect formed part of their demobilisation benefits. The Cabinet con-sidered that even these allowances should not in future be given as of right : the grant of the allowances should be a matter for the discretion of the issuing authorities, though the discretion might beexercised fairly freely.As regards the allowances for tourists, it was pointed out thatthe disappointment felt by motorists at the withdrawal of the basicration would be increased if an allowance of petrol continued tobe available for foreign tourists. At the same time, there was astrong logical case for continuing this allowance as part of the campaign to attract foreign tourists for the purpose of increasing our invisible exports. And it would be particularly unfortunate ifthese allowances were withdrawn at a time when special effortswere being made to attract foreign tourists for the Olympic Gamesin 1948. In these circumstances it would be preferable that theexisting practice regarding the grant of petrol allowances totourists should remain undisturbed for the time being.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that Service men and civilians on leave in thiscountry should not in future be entitled, as of right, toany special allowances of petrol; but that the issuingauthorities should exercise a fairly free discretion indealing with applications by Service men for the grantof &quot; end of war leave &quot; allowances of petrol;
(2) Deferred a final decision regarding the petrol allowances to be given to persons visiting this country as tourists,on the understanding that in the meantime the existingrules governing the grant of petrol allowances to such persons would be continued in force.Steel. 5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Pay-Steel master-General (CP. (47) 269) covering the report of the enquiryDistribution made, in pursuance of the Cabinefs decision of 9th September, intoScheme. the working of the existing machinery for controlling the issue of. steel to manufacturers.(previous reference: The Paymaster-General said that the existing scheme had. (47) 75th broken down mainly because the total amount of the authorisationsConclusions, (&quot; M &quot; forms) issued by Departments was far in excess of the minute 5.) &apos; allocations made to Departments. A subsidiary cause had been the lack of any effective check on the use made of &quot; M &quot; forms by manu-facturers. To meet this situation, it was proposed that a new steelcurrency should be substituted for the &quot;M&quot; form, by 1st April,1948, that all orders for delivery by that date but undelivered atthat date should be cancelled, but that orders already placed for delivery after that date should be validated under the new currency.Any orders thus cancelled could be re-authorised by the sponsoringDepartment, but only within its existing allocation. departments should review ail outstanding orders in the light of the neweconomic situation. A number of selected officers would be appointedto supervise the working of the new scheme by visiting firms pro-ducing and consuming steel. All Ministers in charge of Depart-ments sponsoring steel-consuming industries should take special steps to see that the authorisations issued by their Departments didnot exceed their steel allocation. No scheme of control could work effectively without the collaboration of industry; and the majorsteel-consuming industries should appoint liaison officers to main-tain contact with the Iron and Steel Board and the Federation on steel delivery problems. Finally, the Paymaster-General drewspecial attention to paragraph 5 of his memorandum, in which itwas pointed out that the system of control over end-products mustbe fortified by a careful watch on the quantity of labour employedby less essential users of steel and, above all, by reducing the monetary demand for steel for less essential purposes.The Minister for Economic Affairs, The Minister of Supplyand The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Fuel and Power (as chairman of the Materials Committee), spoke in support of thenew scheme of control recommended in CP. (47) 269.In discussion the following points were raised : (a) It was unfortunate that the new form of authorisationcould not be introduced before 1st April, 1948. The Paymaster-General and The Minister of Supply said that they would have preferred to introduce the new scheme earlier, but were satisfiedthat it would be impracticable to do so.The President of the Board of Trade asked whether it wouldbe possible to enlist the assistance of the steel industry in securingspecial priority, in the intervening six months, for orders whichwere of special importance, e.g., for the export trade. The Chairmanof the Materials Committee said that he would discuss with theMinister for Economic Affairs and the President of the Board ofTrade how this point could best be met.(b) The Minister of Health suggested that, in working out thedetails of the new scheme, the Ministry of Supply might usefullyconsult with officials in his Department and in the Ministry ofWorks who had experience in the working of similar schemes for thecontrol of building materials.
(c) In discussion of paragraph 5 of CP. (47) 269, specialemphasis was laid on the difficulty of regulating distribution ofmaterials by physical controls under conditions of inflationary pres-sure. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had this pointin mind.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the report annexed to CP. (47) 269; and invited the Minister of Supply to arrange for the introductionof a new scheme for controlling the issue of steel to manufacturers on the lines recommended in that report;(2) Instructed the other Departments concerned to collaboratein the preparatory measures required to enable the new scheme to be brought into effect by 1st April, 1948, andto consider forthwith means of making bulk authorisation-tions as recommended in paragraphs 7 (d)-(f) of thereport annexed to CP. (47) 269;(3) Invited all Ministers in charge of Departments sponsoringsteel-consuming industries to review the arrangements in force in their Departments for ensuring thatauthorisations are not issued in excess of the Depart-menfs allocation;(4) Agreed that the Committee which had prepared the report annexed to CP. (47) 269 should continue in being, underthe Chairmanship of the Paymaster-General, to super-vise the preparation of the new scheme of control.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,2nd&apos; October, 1947.
