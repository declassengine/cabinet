Balance ofPayments.(previous reference erence:CM. (47) 71stConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Cabinet considered a telegram from Sir Wilfrid Eady(Washington telegram No. 4542 of 19th August) reporting thecourse of his discussions on 18th August with representatives of theUnited States Government regarding the decision of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to take immediate steps to limit the convertibility of sterling.After a preliminary meeting with Sir Wilfrid Eady, the UnitedStates Secretary of the Treasury had instructed his officials to draftan official statement according friendly recognition of the inevita-bility of His Majesty&apos;s Government^ action; and he had asked thatan attempt should be made to find an interpretation of the Anglo-American Financial Agreement which would justify his Govern-ment&apos;s attitude without raising the question of formal approval by congress. On the latter point it might be argued that our action was in accordance with Article 8 (ii) (b) of the Agreement; alter-natively, the United States Government might recognise that, whileit was not within the text of the Agreement, it was essential toensure that the dollars remaining were used, for the purposesenvisaged in Article 3 of the Agreement and in the Articles of theInternational Monetary Fund. At a later meeting, however, theUnited States representatives had proposed an exchange of letters,in which the British Delegation would notify the decision of HisMajesty&apos;s Government and urge that the measures to be taken werewithin the purpose and intention of the Agreement; and the reply would state that the United States Government had taken sympathe-tic note of the drain on the dollar resources of the United Kingdomand that they would consult at once with the British Delegation,on the understanding that meanwhile no further drawings on the credit would be sought beyond those already notified. Sir WilfridEady had protested strongly against this proposal. The UnitedStates representatives had, however, replied that no more helpfulattitude could be expected from them at such short notice. TheBritish Delegation strongly urged that, in view of the great impor-tance of securing at least the acquiescence of the United StatesGovernment, the announcement of the measures proposed for limiting the convertibility of sterling should be deferred for twen1&quot;1 four hours.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought it would be advisablein the circumstances to postpone action for twenty-four hours, onthe understanding that there could be no question of any further postponement and that Sir Wilfrid Eady should make every effort in the meantime to secure the most favourable declaration he couldfrom the United States authorities.The Chancellor said that there had been no further accelerationin the rate of dollar drawings since he circulated his memorandum cp. (47) 233 on 16th August. Drawings had totalled $60 million on 16th and 17th August, and $16 million on 18th August; and theBank of England estimated that drawings might amount to$30 million on 19th August, and $15-$30 million on 20th August.Postponement for twenty-four hours might, therefore, result in theloss of $30 million but, against that, there was the risk thatprecipitate action on our part might jeopardise our ability to draw the balance of the Credit, which, apart from the drawings alreadynotified, amounted to $500 million. Apart from this purely financialconsideration, there were strong political arguments in favour of waiting another day if we could thereby secure the acquiescence ofthe United States Government in the action we were proposing totake.The Foreign Secretary agreed that it would be advisable toaccept a postponement of twenty-four hours. He thought it wouldbe inexpedient to agree to an exchange of letters involving animmediate prohibition of further drawings on the Credit; for thiswould put the United States Government in a very strong bargaining position in the subsequent discussions.There was general agreement with the views expressed by theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Foreign Secretary.
Food. 2.   In the course of a general discussion on the balance of australian payments the Cabinet were informed that the Australian Govern-Wheat. ment might shortly be raising the question of a long-term contract(Previous       for the purchase of Australian wheat by the United Kingdom.Reference: It was recalled that, in earlier discussions on world supplies ofC.M.(47)4th cereals both in the Cabinet and the Food Supplies Committee,Conclusions, Ministers had agreed that it should be one of our long-term objec-Minute 3.) tives to resume the import of Australian wheat into the UnitedKingdom. They had contemplated that the diversion to India ofthe whole of Australia&apos;s exportable surplus of wheat should be atemporary measure; and the amount of our annual purchases underthe long-term wheat contract with Canada had been deliberatelyfixed at a level which left ample nicLrgiii tor imports from Australiaand elsewhere. In these circumstances overtures for a long-term contract for the supply of Australian wheat to the United kingdom should be welcomed. It would, however, be desirable that, before such a contract was concluded, we should obtain satisfactory assurances of a continuing market in Australia for exports of manu-factured goods from the United Kingdom.Food and RawMaterials.GovernmentBulkPurchase.(previous reference:CM. (47) 39thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. In the discussion recorded in the preceding Minute, it wassuggested that it would be advantageous if a somewhat larger proportion of the food supplies of the United Kingdom could be bought through the normal channels of trade. So long as a substan-tial part of our total requirements of a particular commodity was assured by Government bulk purchase, under long-term contractsor otherwise, there might be advantages in giving scope for commer-cial buying over the remainder of the field. While so much of our total needs were covered by Government bulk purchase, there wererisks of political pressure from foreign Governments, which wasspecially dangerous in time of economic crisis. It was worth considering whether there would be long-term advantages, tothis country and to the British Commonwealth as a whole, in encouraging the re-opening of the futures markets in certain commodities-commodities by seeking to obtain a proportion, say 30 to 40 per cent., ofour requirements of those commodities through commercial buying.The Prime Minister undertook to ascertain the views of thePresident of the Board of Trade and the Minister of Food on thepoints raised in this discussion.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that, at the Cabinet&apos;s previous discussion on 17th August, it had been suggested that therewas a serious risk of leakage of our dollar resources if, as suggestedin CP. (47) 233, the sterling area countries were treated differentlyfrom the non-sterling area countries. He had since ascertained,however, that in the past six weeks the dollar expenditure in respectof the sterling area (apart from the United Kingdom) had in fact been only a small proportion of the whole, and he was satisfied thatthere was no need to apply the same controls to the sterling area countries as to the others. Those countries would, however, be askedto exercise the utmost restraint in their dollar expenditure, and hehad no doubt they would do so.The Cabinet -  -Agreed that the leader of the British Mission in washington should be authorised to inform the UnitedStates Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government wereprepared to postpone for twenty-four hours, i.e., until9 p.m. on Wednesday, 20th August, the action outlined in annex II to CP. (47) 233 for limiting the convertibilityof sterling, but that there could be no question of anyfurther postponement.
TradeNegotiationsat Geneva.(previous reference:CM. (47) 70thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Secretary for Overseas Trade recalled that, as statedin CP. (47) 230, the British Delegation at Geneva had been instructed that the non-discrimination provisions of the draftCharter for an International Trade Organisation should be acceptedonly on the understanding that the provisions requiring the prior approval of the Organisation for discriminatory practices wouldnot become effective before 1952. The United States delgation had now accepted our view on tihis matter. They had also indicated to the French Delegation that they were prepared to agree thatthere should be complete freedom to discriminate up to the end of1948. Thereafter, until March 1952, there would be a right of subsequent challenge by the Organisation or by any Member, butthere was little risk of successful challenge in view of the fact thatduring this period the majority of Members would themselves belikely to wish to have recourse to discriminatory practices. Weshould always have the final safeguard of a right to resign our membership of the Organisation at sixty days&apos; notice. He proposedto circulate a paper to the Cabinet on the present position of the geneva discussions.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the secretary for OverseasTrade.Cabinet Office, S.W.
