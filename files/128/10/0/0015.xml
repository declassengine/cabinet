1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.On 28th July there would be a debate on Housing. TheOpposition would be informed that it would be for them to open the debate and the Minister of Health would consider whether theMinister of Works should intervene in it.On 29th July there would be a debate on Colonial Affairs, andthe Committee and remaining Stages of the Acquisition of Land(Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland,) Bill and the Local Government(Scotland) Bill would be taken.On 30th July there would be a debate on the Army until 7 p.m.and thereafter a debate on the allocation of the Grantham factories.The proposed Government of India and Burma Orders would beconsidered; there would be a Motion to approve the electoral registration Regulations, and the Lords&apos; amendments to the fire services Bill would be considered.On 31st July there would be a debate on Education, and at  -30 p.m. the questions on all outstanding Votes would be put fromthe Chair. The Second Reading of the Isle of Man Customs bill would also be taken.The Lords amendments to the Town and, Country Planning bill would be considered on 1st August and on the same day furtherconsideration would be given to the Government of India and BurmaOrders.Prorogation of The Lord President, said that in announcing the business for parliament. the following week he proposed to state that the Government hopedthat all necessary business would be completed by 8th or, at latest,9th August and to ask for the co-operation. of all Members in securing this. The question whether Parliament should beprorogued on 8th or 9th August had been considered. It was truethat there would be no difficulty in recalling Parliament afterprorogation in at most three days, but in the present state of affairs a proposal that Parliament should be prorogued would lead to opposition and misunderstanding. It therefore seemed preferable that Parliament should stand adjourned until 20th October, when there would be a formal meeting for prorogation, followed by theopening of the new Session on 21st October.The Cabinet -Endorsed the view that on the completion of the businessof the Session Parliament should be adjourned until20th October.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said thathe hoped that by 31st July the House of Lords would have disposedof all the Bills before them. He would see whether it would bepossible to take the Report Stage of the Agriculture Bill on29th July, leaving the Report Stage of the Electricity Bill to betaken on 30th July. This would allow a longer interval after theconclusion of the Committee Stage of the Electricity Bill and wouldalso give the House of Commons more time to consider the Lords&apos;amendments to the Agriculture Bill. It had been agreed that on28th July he should move a Motion that Government business shouldtake precedence during the remaining sittings. Any discussion ofLord Lay ton&apos;s Motion about newsprint supplies would take placeon 6th August.JrariiamoAiu.Business inthe House ofCommons.Business inthe House ofLords.Iron and SteelIndustry Bill.(previous reference:CM. (47) 58thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president and the Minister of Supply (CP. (47) 212) reporting theresults of the further discussions which they had had with repre-sentatives of the Iron and Steel Federation.The Lord President said that, in accordance with the Cabinetsdecision of 26th June (CM. (47) 57th Conclusions, Minute 5), theMinister of Supply and he, while making it clear that it was still
the Governments policy to bring appropriate sections of the ironand steel industry under full public ownership, had sought toascertain from the representatives of the Iron and Steel Federationfurther details of the possible alternative arrangements tentativelysuggested in the discussion with the Prime Minister on 21st May.It now seemed clear that the Federation would accept far-reachingstatutory control of the industry by the Government through thetranslation into permanent statutory form of emergency powers suchas those in Defence Regulation 55.   It was also agreed that these powers of control should be exercised directly by an Iron and steel board, and that, to enable the Board to exercise these powerseffectively, the necessary expert staff should be made available fromSteel House.   This would mean that the Federation would become an ordinary trade association; and the representatives of the Federa-tion had stated that in such an event they would not seek to buildup a fresh controlling organisation alongside the Iron and steel board, though they would expect that the Federation would begiven such information about costs and other matters as it requiredto facilitate its operation as a trade association.   With regard tothe acquisition of particular undertakings, the representatives had at first argued that the power to acquire should be exercisable only where justified by defence considerations or by default on the partof private industry.   Subsequently, however, they had agreed thatthe proposed Bill should give powers of acquisition in any case where this was reported by the Board to be expedient in the public interest.They had suggested that the power should not be exercisable except on the recommendation of the Board, and, when it had been pointedout that the Government could not be expected to refrain from theexercise of the powers merely because the Board&apos;s report wasadverse or non-committal, they had indicated that their diffi-culties  might  be met   if  the  Government  were prepared  toagree that in all oases the Minister should be obliged to publish the Board&apos;s report.   The Federation would not agree that theproposed Bill should itself bring particular undertakings under public ownership or that, as soon as it had been passed, ordersbringing such undertakings under public ownership should bemade.   If, therefore, the Government were to proceed on linesacceptable to the Federation, there would be little or no public acquisition of iron and steel undertakings during the lifetime of the present Parliament.   This would admittedly be a departure from the Cabinefs previous decision and from the announcedintentions of the Government, but in present circumstances, whenit was of vital importance to secure the maximum output of steel,it seemed to him to be the duty of the Cabinet to refrain from anystep which would jeopardise steel production.   There was no evidence that steel producers were at present showing lack ofco-operation, nor did he suggest that there would be deliberatesabotage by producers if the Government carried out the schemealready approved by the Cabinet.   It was inevitable, however, thatfirms which expected to be brought under public ownership should lose the incentive to carry out desirable developments, and therewas thus a real danger that in the critical year or two which layimmediately ahead the national economy would be crippled through a shortage of steel.  He believed that the proposals in CP. (47) 212would lay the foundation for bringing the steel industry into public ownership in a much more orderly manner than would be possible under the scheme already approved and that if they were properlypresented to Government supporters they would receive general approval.   If the Cabinet endorsed these proposals, the next step would be to send a communication to the Iron and Steel Federationsetting out precisely what the Government had in mind.The Minister of Supply said that the Government had hitherto been hampered by the fact that the real control over the iron andsteel industry had been exercised through Steel House and thatthe willingness of the Federation to transfer to the Iron and steel board the expert staff now at Steel House represented a very substantial change in their former attitude. Steel output at present was at the rate of 12-5 million ingot tons a year, which, after
priority demands had been met, barely satisfied 50 per cent, of other requirements. If the fullest possible co-operation were obtainedfrom the industry, output might be raised to 13f million ingot tonsin the next 12 months, but this could be achieved only if individual firms were willing to sacrifice their own interests. He could not hope to secure the necessary whole-hearted co-operation if con-controversial legislation was being forced through Parliament and individual firms were faced with the prospect that they might.,within a year or eighteen months, be broken up through the severance of those parts of their activities which the Governmentwould not wish to retain under public ownership. The loss of halfa million ingot tons of steel which might have gone into the pro-duction of machinery for export would be equivalent to a loss ofabout  100 millions of foreign exchange. Even though legislation authorising the Government to acquire the shares of iron and steelundertakings were to be passed in the 1947-48 Session, there wouldin fact be little physical change in these undertakings .during the lifetime of the present Parliament. This being so, it seemed to him that the right course was to proceed on the lines recommended in cp. (47) 212, which would carry the Government a long way towards public ownership of the industry and leave the way clearfor the completion of the process during the next Parliament.The Prime Minister said that in the present economic situation it would be inexpedient to proceed with legislation bringing theiron and steel industry under public ownership in the 1947-48Session. The Government would be judged by their handling ofthe difficult economic problems which they would have to face inthe next year or two and they could not afford to expose themselvesto the charge of having aggravated these problems by adopting ameasure which might make it impossible to secure the maximumoutput of such a vital commodity as steel.The Minister of Health said that he was strongly opposed tothe compromise proposals outlined in CP. (47) 212. Steel Househad been able to exercise effective control over the iron and steelindustry only because of its organic connection with ,the operatingunits of that industry. When the controlling staff were transferred from Steel House to the Iron and Steel Board their effectivenesswould rapidly diminish and the real power would continue to reside in the Federation. A decision not to proceed with the socialisation of the iron and steel industry in the 1947-48 Session would dis-hearten and divide Government supporters. He did not accept theview that the Governments programme of nationalisation shouldbe brought to a standstill because the economic situation was difficult and he believed that, if the Government, instead of strengthening the hands of the Iron and Steel Federation by indicating that theymight be prepared to compromise, were to press on with legislation to implement the scheme which they had already approved, theoutput of steel would not suffer. He also pointed out that it wouldbe impossible to reconcile a decision not to proceed with the nationalisation of the United Kingdom iron and steel industry withthe proposals for the nationalisation of the Ruhr iron and steelindustry.The President of the Board of Trade said that the proposals outlined in CP. (47) 212 would not in practice achieve the objectof securing a higher output of steel in the next two or three criticalyears. So long as the Governments intention to bring the industry under public ownership remained, the industry would continue ina state of uncertainty and, in order to discredit the plan fornationalisation, would put obstacles in the way of the successful operation of the scheme of control. He therefore felt that theGovernment must either proceed with the scheme already approvedor state that they did not intend to proceed with legislation to nationalise the industry in the 1947-48 Session.The Minister of A griculture said that the overriding need wasto maintain and, if possible, to increase the/output of steel during&apos;[34133--4] b 3
the next year or two. He believed that the proposals in CP. (47) 212were the best means of achieving this and that government supporters would recognise that in the national interest they shouldbe adopted.The Minister of Food said that, difficult as it would be toabandon any attempt to deal with the iron and steel industry inthe 1947-48 Session, it would, in his view, be better to do thisthan to adopt the proposals in CP. (47) 212. It was clear that under these proposals the Federation, though nominally yieldingtheir powers of control to the Iron and Steel Board, would continueto exercise effective control over the industry. Moreover, individual firms in the industry would operate under the threat of public acquisition and would inevitably lack the necessary incentives toenterprise. He accordingly felt that the right course was to proceedwith the scheme already approved by the Cabinet.The Foreign Secretary said that he was clear that the original proposal that the iron and steel industry should be nationalised bythe acquisition of the physical assets was unworkable. In the time which he had had to examine the proposals in CP. (47) 212, hehad not been able to consider all their implications, and he would prefer to see them worked out more fully before being called uponto make a choice between them and the scheme for acquiring the shares of iron and steel undertakings. Would it not be possibleto defer a decision until the autumn, when the international economicsituation might be clearer ? If the Cabinet were to depart fromthe scheme which they had already approved, it would be important to avoid giving the impression that this change had taken place as a result of pressure from the United States.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that when the cabinet had considered the provisional Legislative Programme for the1947-48 Session (CM. (47) 37th Conclusions, Minute 8) he had urged that an Iron and Steel Industry Bill should be included inthe Programme in preference to a Gas Industry Bill. Since then,however, the international economic situation had deteriorated andthe country would have to face an extremely difficult situation inthe autumn. He believed that, at a time when public attentionwould be focussed on the problem of our balance of payments, itwould be unwise to introduce controversial legislation for bringing the iron and steel industry under public ownership. On the otherhand, he was not satisfied that the alternative proposals in cp. (47) 212 were preferable to the scheme already approved bythe Cabinet and he felt that the right course was to abandon theidea of introducing an Iron and Steel Industry Bill early in the1947-48 Session. He realised that this was virtually equivalentto a decision not to proceed with the Bill until a later Session, andhe suggested that it might be possible to revive the proposal tointroduce a Gas Industry Bill in 1947-48.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he had alwaysbelieved that it would have been feasible to nationalise the iron andsteel industry by the acquisition of the physical assets broadly onthe lines adopted for the nationalisation of the coalmining industry.The proposals in CP. (47) 212 would merely expose the Governmentto blame for the shortcomings of the industry without giving anyof the advantages of nationalisation. The argument that output would suffer because of the disturbance arising from bringing theindustry under national ownership was unconvincing and he was satisfied that the right course was to revert to the original proposalfor acquiring the physical assets of selected undertakings. If thissuggestion were accepted, it would be possible to defer immediate action and explain to Government supporters that the detailed provisions of the nationalisation plan were still being worked out.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said thathe had always doubted whether any real gain would come from the nationalisation of the iron and steel industry. It seemed clear tohim that any scheme for acquiring the physical assets of the
industry would meet with insuperable difficulties, and he did notbelieve that the alternative of acquiring the shares of selectedundertakings would operate satisfactorily. He felt that, in presentcircumstances, it would be better for the Government to refrain from any legislation affecting the iron and steel industry. failing this, he would support the proposals set out in CP. (47) 212.The Lord Chancellor said that in the next few months thecountry would have to face a very grave economic situation. this being so, it seemed inexpedient to embark on controversial legis-lation which would bring no immediate results. If anything hadto be done he would prefer the proposals in CP. (47) 212 and he felt that the Government could properly take the line that, in viewof the economic situation, they had decided not to proceed withany scheme for the nationalisation of the iron and steel industry inthe lifetime of the present Parliament.The Lord President said that, while he would not press for animmediate decision on the proposals in CP. (47) 212, he felt thatthe Cabinet must come to some conclusion before the Summer Recess.To defer a decision until the autumn would delay unduly thepreparation of the necessary legislation, and it should be borne inmind that, if the proposals in CP. (47) 212 were approved, further negotiations with the Iron and Steel Federation would have to becarried out. He did not believe it would be possible to avoid legis-lation on the subject of the iron and steel industry during the1947-48 Session, and he remained convinced that a Bill on the lines indicated in CP. (47) 212 would be preferable to legislation basedon the scheme which the Cabinet had approved at an earlier date.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume consideration of CP. (47) 212 at ameeting to be held in the following week.3. At their meeting on 24th June the Cabinet had decidedthat there should be a reduction of 500,000 tons in the import of motor spirit in 1947-48.   The Cabinet now had before them : (i) a memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Power (CP.(47) 206) proposing a reduction of 33^- per cent, in the basic rationfor private cars and an effective cut of 5 per cent, in the supple-mentary allowances given for private vehicles, taxis, hire cars and commercial vehicles;(ii) a memorandum by the Minister of Transport (CP. (47)207) on the possibility of securing a reduction in the consumptionof petrol by public service and goods vehicles.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the saving requiredcould be achieved only by a reduction in civilian consumption, sincestocks of motor spirit, including Service stocks, had fallen to undersix weeks&apos; consumption and there was little prospect that largeeconomies would be made by the Services or the Control Commission.He proposed that rhe basic ration for private cars should be reduced from 1st October to the level from which it had been increased inJuly 1946. This should effect a saving of 300,000 tons in a full year. A further saving of about 200,000 tons should be possible by an effective cut of 5 per cent, in the supplementary allowances(which would save 100,000 tons) and by the reductions in consump-tion by goods vehicles suggested by the Minister of Transport in cp. (47) 207. The Cabinet should realise that there would be very strong criticism of the reductions in the basic ration and the sup-supplementary allowances. He had discussed with the Minister ofTransport measures for reducing the black market traffic in com-mereial coupons and he proposed to put these measures into effect.
His proposals would not prejudice the gradual reduction of the staff employed on petrol rationing.The Chancellor of the Exchequer supported the recommenda-tions made in CP. (47) 206 and CP. (47) 207. He pointed out that,even so, there would be no reduction in the total quantity of petrolimported in 1947-48 as compared with 1946-47.In discussion, the following points were made (a) Some doubt was expressed about the wisdom of announ-influencing the proposed reductions in petrol rations in isolation fromother measures to redress the adverse balance of payments.As against this, it was pointed out that if these reductions,which were consequential on decisions already taken by the Cabinet,were to be brought into force from 1st October, it would beimpossible to delay their announcement until the Cabinet had beenable to reach conclusions on other reductions in the import pro-gramme which might be proposed later.(b) The Lord President asked whether it would not be better to reduce supplementary allowances by 10 per cent, net rather than to impose a cut on supplies to goods vehicles.The Minister af Fuel and power said that it would be inexperienced-expedient to attempt to obtain more than a reduction of about 5 percent, in the supplementary allowances and that some reduction in supplies to goods vehicles was inevitable if the necessary savingwas to be achieved.(c) The Prime Minister said that special attention should bepaid to the terms of the announcement, which should explain fully the reasons which had made it necessary to reduce imports of petrolHe did not think the announcement need be made in Parliament.(d) The Prime Minister said that he would pursue the questionof securing reductions in the consumption of petrol by the Services.The Cabinet-(1) Endorsed the recommendations made in CP. (47) 206 and cp. (47) 207 for the reduction of petrol consumption.(2) Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power to ensure that theannouncement of the proposed reductions indicatedclearly the grounds on which they had been made.Statute Law 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordReform. Chancellor (CP. (47) 205) on the subject of statute law reform.The Lord Chancellor said that the present chaotic condition ofthe Statute Book was a public scandal and it was urgently necessaryto institute a systematic programme of consolidation and codifi-cation. Proposals for this had been prepared under his direction and were set out in CP. (47) 205. Their most important featureswere : (i) a separate consolidation branch should be established in theOffice of Parliamentary Counsel;(ii) the Statute Law Committee should be reconstituted on thelines indicated in Annex II to CP. (47) 205 and charged with thegeneral superintendence of consolidation and codification; and(iii) arrangements should be made for the recommendations ofthe Committee to be considered in connection with the legislative programme for each Session.The Legislation Committee had accepted this scheme inprinciple and a number of consolidation Bills would be ready for
introduction in the 1947-48 Session. If his proposals were approved he would wish to announce them before the summer recess.In discussion, the following points were made (a) The Rome Secretary asked that the proposed composition of the Statute Law Committee should be amended to permit thePermanent Under-Secretary of State, Home Office, to nominate arepresentative to serve in his place, if he so desired.(b) The Secretary of State for Scotland said the proposed announcement should cover Scotland. Lie also suggested that thereshould be an additional representative of Scotland on thereconstituted Statute Law Committee.(c) No announcement of the proposals need be made in theHouse of Commons.The Cabinet-(1) Endorsed the recommendations made by the LordChancellor in CP. (47) 205.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor to discuss with the Secretaryof State for Scotland the form of the announcement which he proposed to make and the question of the representation of Scotland on the reconstituted statute law Committee.5. At their meeting on 15th May the Cabinet had invited the Home Secretary to consider further whether means other thanthose outlined in CP. (47) 135 could not be devised for preventing the publication of Action.The Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by theHome Secretary (CP. (47) 201) reporting that the President of theBoard of Trade was of the opinion that his powers under thePaper Control Orders wrere wide enough to enable him to refuseto license the delivery of any paper for the publication of Actionbut that, even if he exercised his powers in this way, the papermight still be able to appear because the publishers might obtain,considerable quantities of paper from merchants&apos; and printers&apos;stocks. The President of the Board of Trade had pointed out thatit would be possible so to amend the Orders as to make it an offence to publish any periodical unless it had been published both before16th August, 1940, and also in, say, the month of May 1947. Thiswould effectively bar the publication of Action, but there were strong objections to the imposition of a political censorship in any form, and there could be no justification for employing for thispurpose a Defence Regulation the object of which was the saving of paper.The Home Secretary said that the objections to taking positivemeasures for preventing the publication of A ction were, in his view,insuperable unless Fascist activities as such were to be declaredillegal. A Ministerial Committee, which had investigated theproblem of Fascism, had reached the conclusion that it would notbe practicable to find a satisfactory definition of Fascist activities which would not at the same time place disabilities on the advocacyof other political, and even religious, opinions.The President of the Board of Trade said that the suggestedamendment of the Paper Control Orders would render illegal theappearance of certain periodicals which there wTas no good ground,for banning. He would thus be driven to establish a licensing system and this would mean throwing on the officials of the PaperControl responsibility for operating a kind of political censorship.
The Foreign Secretary said that the resumption of the publica-tion of A ction would have a deplorable effect on opinion abroad.The Cabinet Agreed to adjourn consideration of the question whethertihe President of the Board of Trade should grant theapplication of the proprietors of A ction for a supply 0fpaper.Cabinet Of/ice, S.W. 1,24:th July, 1947.
