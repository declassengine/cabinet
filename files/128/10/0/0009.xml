119CM. 58 (47) -Egyptian 1.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, after prolongedSterling and difficult negotiations, a temporary agreement had been reachedBalanoes. on the Egyptian sterling balances, which would Cover the positionuntil 31st December, 1947. The Egyptian Delegation had claimed that the total of the Egyptian sterling balances amounting to 400 million should be recognised, but he had made it clear thatthis figure was not accepted by the British Government and had suggested that, in view of the protection afforded by British arms to Egypt during the war, it was for the Egyptian Governmentto put foiward proposals for an equitable settlement. It hadeventually been agreed that for the present  360 million of thesebook debts would be blocked. It had also been agreed that weshould release  8 million at once for Egypt&apos;s current needs; while,on the other hand, the Egyptian Government would meet certainoutstanding sterling obligations. It was greatly to our advantage that Egypt would now leave the sterling area, with the result thather currency would become subject to our exchange control regula-lations; and time had been gained for the two Governments to explore further the prospects of reaching agreement on a long-termsettlement of the question of sterling balances.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the statement made by theChancellor of the Exchequer.Dominions 2.   The Prime Minister said that it was proposed that theOffice. titles of the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and theChange of Dominions Office should be changed to &quot; the Secretary of State forTitle. Commonwealth Relations &apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos; the Commonwealth relations office &quot; respectively. This proposal had been warmly welcomed bythe Dominion Governments, and the new titles would also be more acceptable to the Indian Governments after the transfer of power.The changes would be announced in Parliament immediately.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers state-ment.Iron and Steel 3. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that, in industry Bill, accordance with their decision of 26th June, he had asked the Lord(Previous President and the Minister of Supply to undertake further discus-Reference: sions with representatives of the Iron and Steel Federation.CM. (47) 57thConclusions,Minute 5.)Land Requirements of theServiceDepartmentsand theMinistry ofSupply.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (CP. (47) 184) reporting the conclusions reached by theDefence Committee on the proposals of the Service departments and the Ministry of Supply with regard to the use of land fortraining and other purposes, and covering a draft White Paperdealing with these proposals.The Minister without Portfolio, said that the needs of the armed Forces and the Ministry of Supply had been examined inthe first instance by the Committee on Services Land Usage, whoseconclusions had been broadly accepted by the Defence Committee.The possibility of reducing the amount of land required in theUnited Kingdom by training the Armed Forces overseas had been examined, and there had been a special enquiry into the extent towhich training might be carried out in the more remote areas of[34109-4] b 2
Scotland and Northern Ireland. It had not been possible by theseexpedients to reduce the demands of the Service Departments forland in England and &quot;Wales, but arrangements for the intensiveand continuous use of particular areas and for joint user by twoor more Services had enabled the original requirements of the service departments to be scaled down from about 1,100,000 to about800,000 acres. The draft White Paper had been revised on thelines suggested by the Defence Committee and, as a result of a visit which he and other Ministers concerned had paid to the Thet-ford and Stanford training areas, where the Forestry commission had important interests, satisfactory arrangements had been madeto meet the essential needs of forestry. This visit had convincedhim that throughout the country there should be closer contact between the military authorities and local officials of the Depart-ments concerned, and arrangements were being made for this.The Lord President said that the area of 800,000 acres to beused for training purposes represented a very heavy call on theavailable land in the United Kingdom. He realised that, so faras possible, the Services would avoid interference with agricul-ture, but the effect of their demands on the land available to thepubic for recreation would be considerable, and he feared that whenthe White Paper was published there would be a storm of prqtes,&apos;;which would force the Government to modif)r the proposals. would it not be possible to postpone taking some of the land at least solong as Army training could be carried out in Germany ?The Secretary of State for War said that he was satisfied thatthe amount of land required by the Army could not be reduced toany appreciable extent. The Army schools of instruction must be located in this country and though training with units couldbe carried out in Germany for the next few years, we should eventually have to rely on training areas in the United Kingdom.The process of acquisition was a slow one and it was vital thatthe War Office should at an early date be given sanction to pro-ceed with their proposals. About 270,000 acres of the land requiredby the War Office were in existing War Office estates, and theuse for training of much of the land proposed to be taken wouldnot be incompatible with giving the public access to this land oreven with its use for agriculture or forestry. The additional land which the Services required would be taken over a period of yearsand each proposal would be subject to a public local enquiry ifobjections were raised on grounds of public interest.In further discussion a number of Ministers supported theviews expressed by the Lord President and there was general agree-ment that the form in which the requirements of the Services were presented in Part VIII of the draft White Paper was unsatis-factory. Thus, the reader was given an initial impression that800,000 acres of land would be completely withdrawn from otheruses for training purposes, and would be apt to overlook thefact that over much of the area the use of land for training wouldnot be incompatible with its use for agriculture or forestry or withthe retention of the right of public access to it. Again the draftdid not sufficiently bring out the fact that little disturbance anddeprivation would be caused by the use of many of the individualsites included in the area of 314,700 acres required for purposes other than training. A truer picture would be given by dealingwith the requirements of each of the Services separately and by putting in the forefront an explanation of the limited extent towhich the use of much of the land required for training would affect its use. for other purposes. For example, the White paper should emphasise that the needs of the Services would affect only106,000 acres of arable land, of which no more than 60,000 acreswould be lost to cultivation; that all but 75,000 of the 505,000 acres of land classified as fit for grazing would remain available for Jthat purpose; and that the public would retain the right of access to much of the land used for training. The White Paper might also explain how far the Services had been able to avoid takingcommon land situated in the immediate neighbourhood of thickly
121 CM. 58 (*k7Jpopulated areas, and it would be useful to bring out the fact thata good deal of the land required by the Services was in areas suchas Salisbury Plain and Shoeburyness, the use of which for military purposes had long since been accepted.Other points in discussion were: (a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that para-graph 46 of the draft White Paper, which dealt with cases inwhich it was impossible to implement pledges of reinstatement,should be redrafted in consultation with the Treasury. It was important to avoid the implication ,that persons who could notbe reinstated would not receive compensation apart from anyspecial arrangements made under this paragraph. In fact manysuch persons would be entitled to compensation under the Com-pensation (Defence) Act or the Acquisition of Land Act as amended by the Town and Country Planning Bill.(b) The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries suggested that itwould be desirable to point out in paragraph 46 that, if the Govern-ment were to refrain from the use of a particular training areabecause a pledge of reinstatement had been given, they would be compelled to displace persons from some other area, which mightwell involve greater hardship.(c) It was suggested that Departments were not always givenadequate notice of proposals for the acquisition of land by service departments. For example, the Board of Trade had learnt only at a very late stage of a proposal to acquire land containing valuableclay deposits.The Minister of Town and Country Planning said that all pro-posals were considered by an official committee containing repre-sentatives of the Departments mainly concerned. He would,however, take steps to ensure that in future advance notice of allproposals was sent to all Departments which might have any interestin land which it was proposed to acquire.(d) It was important that the Services should avoid, so faras possible, retaining possession of land and buildings without making use of them.The Cabinet-(1) Approved in principle the proposals in CP. (47) 184 forthe use by the Service Departments and the Ministry ofSupply of land for training and other purposes;(2) Invited the Lord President, in consultation with theMinister without Portfolio and the Chancellor of theExchequer, to arrange for the draft White Paperannexed to CP. (47) 184 to be revised on the lines suggested in discussion, and agreed that the revised draft should be circulated to the Cabinet.(3) Invited the Minister of Town and Country Planning toensure that all interested Departments were notified in good time of any proposals made by the Service Depart-ments for the acquisition of land for training purposes.Aerodromes 5.   The Cabinet   had before them a memorandum by thein the United   Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (CP. (47) 168) reportingKingdom.       the conclusions reached by the Civil Aviation Committee on a pro-gramme drawn up by the Minister of Civil Aviation for theestablishment of aerodromes in the United Kingdom outside theLondon area.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that the CivilAviation Committee were satisfied that the proposals of the Ministerof Civil Aviation, which were set out in detail in the Annex to cp. (47) 168, could be accepted as a working programme. the aim had been to select pre-war or war-time aerodromes and to securejoint user with the Service and Supply Departments, and only sixentirely new sites were required.   Apart from these new sites, it
was proposed to acquire and convert for civil use some 59 existingaerodromes, 17 of which were already owned in whole or in partby the State, while 31 were on requisitioned land and 11 underprivate or municipal control. The Committee agreed that priority should be given to the development of seven aerodromes requiredfor direct services to the Continent and that, in the development ofother aerodromes, priority should be given to those required for internal air services which were necessary because of the lack ofother means of communication or commercially justified by existing or prospective demand. The estimated total cost of the programme was  37 million and the rate at which it could be carried out would depend on the extent to which at any given time resourcescould be devoted to this purpose. The Committee had speciallyconsidered the question of the choice of a site for the Bristol civilairport. The original intention had been that this airport shouldbe situated at Filton, where considerable expenditure had been incurred on the construction of a runway for the Brabazon I air-craft, but the Committee were satisfied that, for the reasons givenin Appendix V to the memorandum annexed to CP. (47) 168, analternative site at Lulsgate Bottom would be preferable.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the proposals of theMinister of Civil Aviation must be regarded as a long-term plan,the execution of which would depend upon the available resourcesof money and of men and materials. After discussion with theMinister of Civil Aviation, he had agreed to his proposal to make an announcement on the lines of^the statement in Appendix IV tothe memorandum annexed to CP. (47) 168, subject to the omission of the references to Exeter, Grimsby, Lossiemouth and Norwich,and on the understanding that the Minister would consult him about any proposed public references to places and aerodromes containedin Appendix I but not referred to in the proposed announcement.In further discussion the following points were made : (a) It should be clearly recognised that the carrying out of theproposed programme would be a gradual process. Thus, it was estimated that the constructional work involved would require60,000-man years, whereas for the period up to March 1948 thebuilding labour allocated to the Ministry of Civil Aviation for all purposes did not exceed 8,000 men.(b) The Minister of Civil Aviation undertook to consider thepossibility of developing an air service from the West of england to Ireland with a stop at Anglesey.(c) It was important that everything possible should be done to impress on those responsible for the management of the aero-dromes and for the running of air services the need for securingeconomies in operation and for making air travel more attractiveby eliminating delays and inconveniences.(d) The Secretary of State far Scotland drew attention to theimportance of reaching an early decision on the proposals for thedevelopment of the aerodrome at Prestwick. The delay in settling the plan of the aerodrome was holding up the planning of the area and the work of providing new houses.(e) The Minister of A griculture pointed out that there had been no prior consultation with the Ministry of Agriculture on a proposedroad diversion which would be consequential on the use of LulsgateBottom as the Bristol airport and would entail the loss of good agricultural land.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Ministry of Civil Aviation to treat the aerodromes and sites listed in Appendix I to thememorandum annexed to CP. (47) 168 as a workingprogramme;(2) Agreed that priority should be given to the development of seven. aerodromes required for direct services to the
123CM. 58 (47) ^Continent and that the rate at which the programme should be carried out should be determined in consul ta-tion with the Treasury and the Investment &quot;working party;(3) Approved the proposal to develop Lulsgate Bottom as themain civil airport for Bristol;(4) Subject to the modifications agreed on with the Chancellorof the Exchequer, authorised the Minister of CivilAviation to make a public announcement of his plans in the terms of Appendix IV to the memorandum annexed to CP. (47) 168.6. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that he had nowdiscussed the terms of the draft Indian Independence Bill withthe Opposition leaders. The only criticism of substance which theyhad made related to the title of the Bill, which, in their view,suggested that the Indian successor States were being grantedindependence outside the British Commonwealth.In discussion there was general agreement that there were no grounds for modifying the proposed title of the Bill, which wouldbe acceptable both to the existing Dominions and to Indian opinion,as indicating and confirming the real nature of Dominion status.It was felt, however, that special pains ought to be taken to explain the implications of the title and, as not less than a week wouldhave to elapse between the publication of the Bill and its SecondReading in the House of Commons, it was suggested that it wouldbe advisable for the Prime Minister to hold a Press Conferenceimmediately before the publication of the Bill, at which he couldexplain fully its purpose and meaning.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that it was desirable that the Bill should reach the House of Lords as soonas possible and, in any event, not later than the last week in July.The Cabinet-(1) Took note that the Prime Minister would hold a press conference on the Indian Independence Bill on the dayof its publication;(2) Invited the Lord President and the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs to consider what arrangements mightbe made to enable the Bill to reach the House of Lordsas soon as possible.7. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that it had not proved possible, in the discussions with the Burma Goodwill Mission,to secure their agreement to the proposal that power should be trans-ferred in Burma on the basis of the grant of Dominion status.The members of the Mission would themselves have been in favourof Burma&apos;s remaining within the British Commonwealth, but theyhad made it clear that they saw no prospect that either their own supporters or Burmese opinion generally could be brought to acceptanything less than independence outside the Commonwealth. TheMission had been informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government couldnot agree to the grant of Dominion status to Burma merely as adevice for expediting the transfer of power, and they had not pressed this suggestion.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Ministers statement.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,1st July, 1947. ,India.constitutional changes.(previous reference erence:CM.
