Budget.Disclosure ofInformationby Mr. HughDalton.1. The Prime Minister said that the resignation of Mr. HughDalton, as a consequence of his disclosing to a newspaper corres-correspondent information about the contents of his Budget, was a greatloss to the Government. The Cabinet as a whole would also sharehis feelings of personal sympathy with Mr. Dalton in the misfortunewhich had overtaken him.The Cabinet must now consider their attitude towards the pro-posal of the Opposition that a Select Committee should be appointedto enquire into the circumstances of this disclosure of information.In discussion it was pointed out that this proposal could be resisted on the ground that, as Mr. Dalton had already admittedthe facts and expressed regret for his indiscretion, there was no needfor any formal enquiry. In these circumstances pressure for an enquiry would seem to be due to motives of personal vindictiveness;and in resisting such pressure the Government could look for theapproval, not only of their own supporters, but of moderate opinion in all political Parties.The general view of the Cabinet was, however, that, if thedemand for a Select Committee were pressed, the Government wouldbe ill-advised to resist it. They should not risk giving the impres-sion that they had something further to hide. Mr. Dalton had him-self expressed the hope that, if the demand for an enquiry were pressed, the Government would accede to it without hesitation.The Cabinet therefore agreed that, when this matter was raised in the House of Commons later that day, the Prime Minister shouldtake the line that in view of Mr Dalton&apos;s admissions and his resignation there was, in the Governments view, no scope for any formal investigation; but that, if the Opposition still desired suchan investigation, the Government would readily agree to the appoint-ment of a Select Committee. If asked whether proceedings couldbe taken under the Official Secrets Acts against Mr. Dalton or against the journalists responsible for the publication, the PrimeMinister would reply that this was a matter for the Law Officers ofthe Crown.The Cabinet Agreed that the Government should accept, if it were pressed, the Opposition Motion for the appointment of a select Committee to enquire into the circumstances in which mr. Dalton had disclosed to a newspaper correspondentinformation about the contents of the Budget.industrial disputes.Savoy HotelStrike.2. The Home Secretary and The Minister of Labour informed the Cabinet of the latest developments in the strike at the SavovHotel.The management of this hotel had not been skilful in the handling of their relations with their workers, and this position was now being exploited by persons believed to be acting under the directions of the Communist Party. The present strike affected onlya proportion of the employees, and the hotel was still open. It couldnot remain open, however, unless it continued to receive supplies of oil for its electricity plant; and the strikers had recently sought to interrupt these supplies by obstructing the delivery of oil to the hotel. The organisers of the strike had arranged for sympathisersfrom other Trade Unions to act as pickets. The police had twicebeen called upon to intervene to remove pickets who were obstructingthe highway, and on the second of these occasions there had beena disturbance in which the police had drawn their truncheons anda few people had been slightly injured.It seemed likely that one of the objects of the Communist party was to cause inconvenience by continuing this strike throughout theweek of the Royal Wedding. The disputed issues had, however,been referred to a Court of Enquiry, and it was hoped that the court would submit its report within the next day or so.
Questions might be raised in the House of Commons about theaction of the police in the recent disturbances. If so, it would bemade clear that the police, while they must not take sides in an industrial dispute, had a duty to prevent breaches of the peace andobstruction of the highway.In discussion it was pointed out that, although the provisionsabout picketing in the Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act, 1927,had now been repealed, the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, still setlimits to the action which could lawfully be taken by pickets in an industrial dispute. It might be salutary if publicity could be givento an authoritative statement on the present law affecting picketing.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statements made by the Home secretary and the Minister of Labour.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to consider whether there wouldbe advantage in having an authoritative statement made about the existing law affecting picketing in industrial disputes and, if so, by what means publicity could best be given to such a statement.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,17th November, 1947.
