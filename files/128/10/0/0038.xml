Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.CivilAviation.(previous reference:C.M.(47)85thConclusions,Minute 3.)appointments to PublicBoards.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.The Cabinet had a further discussion about the proposed debate on the Adjournment regarding the flight of the Minister of CivilAviation to Australia and the Far East. It was agreed that, ifthis matter were debated in the House of Commons, questions wouldbe raised about the expenditure previously incurred on similarjourneys by the present Leader of the Opposition. It was pre-transferable that, these matters should not be publicly debated in an atmosphere of mutual recrimination. The Chief Whip undertook to put this consideration to the leaders of the Opposition, throughthe usual channels, with a view to securing that the question ofthe recent flight of the Minister of Civil Aviation should not beraised on the Adjournment.The Cabinet considered what attitude they should adopt ifopportunity were found to debate in the House of Commons thesuggestion that Ministers had exercised influence to secure for their political supporters appointments under Public Eoards. After dis-cussion it was agreed that the proper line for the Government totake, in reply to this allegation, was to accept the argument thatprevious experience as a Minister or Member of Parliament wasvaluable in such positions as these and to press the point that itwas irrelevant whether the individual had gained this experienceas a supporter of the Labour Party or as a supporter of some other political Party. It should be brought out that those who now alleged that the Government were practising &quot; political nepotism &quot; in themaking of these appointments had not objected on this ground to theappointment by Conservative Governments of persons with Parlia-mentary experience on the Conservative side. The Lord Presidentundertook to arrange for material to be collected for the use of theGovernment spokesman in any debate which might take place onthis subject.trade negotiations.Publication of draft Charterfor Inter-national trade organisation.(previous reference:C.M.(47)83rdConclusions,Minute 7.)2. The President of the Board of Trade said that the draftCharter for the International Trade Organisation was to bepublished by the United Nations on 18th November. He proposedto make a statement in the House of Commons on 17th November,in reply to a Question, announcing the publication of White Papersrelating to the Charter. There were to be four White Papers con-taining the text of the draft Charter, a summary of the results ofthe bilateral negotiations for tariff changes, an exchange of letterswith the Canadian Government and an exchange of letters with theUnited States Government. The last two of these would be presentedrespectively by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations and the Foreign Secretary.The Cabinet took the view that it would be preferable if these four subjects could be covered in a single White Paper presentedjointly by the Ministers concerned.The Cabinet-(1) Took note that documents relating to the draft Charter forthe International Trade Organisation would be presented to Parliament;(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to considerwhether all these documents could not be embodied in asingle White Paper to be presented jointly by theMinisters concerned.
Parliament.Amendmentof the parliament act.(previous reference:C.M.(47)83rdConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Cabinet were informed that Viscount Samuel intendedto ask, by Private Notice Question in the House of Lords on 18thNovember, whether the Government were prepared to convene aconference of all political Parties to consider proposals for reformingthe constitution of the House of Lords.The Cabinet considered what reply should be returned to thisQuestion. It was important that the reply should not weaken theGovernments position on the two following points : first, that theBill amending the Parliament Act, 1911, should be passed into law before any negotiations were opened for the reform of the House ofLords; and, secondly, that the Government were not prepared totake any initiative in seeking agreement on proposals for the reform of the House of Lords. The reply should, therefore, recall the con-ditions on which the Prime Minister, in bis speech in the House ofCommons on the Second Reading of the Parliament Bill on 11thNovember, had indicated the Governments readiness to look atproposals for the reform of the House of Lords, and. should statethat after the present Bill had received the Royal Assent the Govern-ment would be ready to consider any proposals complying with those conditions which might be put forward by representatives of theother political Parties in the House of Lords.The Cabinet-Took note that the Prime Minister would settle, in con-sultation with the Lord Privy Seal, the terms of the replyto be given to Viscount Samuel&apos;s Question.Marriage of 4.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in accordanceHer Royal with precedent, it was proposed that Parliament should be askedHighness to make further financial provision for Her Royal Highness PrincessPrincess Elizabeth on the occasion of her marriage.  The King was, however,Elizabeth. anxious that this provision should be made in such a way as notCivil List to impose a further burden on public funds at the present timeProvision. when the country was faced with grave economic difficulties; andhe had, therefore, offered to place at the disposal of parliamentary sum derived from savings on the Civil List made during thewar years, which could be offset against the additional provision which it was proposed to make in the Civil List for PrincessElizabeth. A Royal Message to this effect would be communicatedto the House of Commons during the following week, and a SelectCommittee would then be appointed to consider what additional provision should be made. The Committee would hear evidence fromthe Comptroller of The King&apos;s Privy Purse and, possibly, fromThe King&apos;s Private Secretary; and thereafter would consider pro-posals wdiich he (the Chancellor of the Exchequer) would put beforethem regarding the amount of the additional provision to be made.Effect would be given to the Committee &apos;s recommendations by a civil List Bill.The Leaders of the Opposition Parties would be informed inadvance of the procedure which was to be followed.The Cabinet (1) Took note with approval of the procedure proposed for making further financial provision for PrincessElizabeth on her marriage.Attendance of The Foreign Secretary said that he had been asked whether anyDon Juan. political difficulty would arise if His Majesty invited Don Juanto attend the Marriage of Princess Elizabeth. The Spanish Govern-ment had addressed a protest to him (the Foreign Secretary) aboutthe interviews which he had accorded to Gil Robles and Prieto onthe occasion of their recent visits to this country, and had complained that this action on his part constituted an intervention in the domestic politics of Spain. It was possible that, if Don Juancame to this country for the Royal Wedding, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-
merit would be said to be supporting the monarchist cause in Spain.The Foreign Secretary said, however, that he would find no difficultyin answering that criticism, if it were made; and he therefore pro-posed to advise that there were no political reasons why His majesty should refrain from inviting Don Juan to the Royal Wedding. DonJuan would, of course, be treated during his visit as a relative ofHis Majesty, not as the pretender to the Spanish Throne.The Cabinet-(2) Endorsed the advice which the Foreign Secretary proposedto give regarding the attendance of Don Juan at the marriage of Princess Elizabeth.5. The Cabinet considered memoranda on wages policy by theMinister for Economic Affairs (CP. (47) 303) and the Minister ofLabour (CP. (47) 304).The Minister for Economic Affairs suggested in his memo-ranclum that a Government statement should be issued to the effectthat the traditional relations between wages levels in different indus-tries must be abandoned in favour of new relations more consonantwith the national interest. The statement would set out the princi-ples to which, in the Governments view, those engaged in wage negotiations should have regard and would also propose theestablishment of a central tribunal to which appeals from existingarbitral bodies might be taken by either side, and to which decisionsarrived at by such bodies could be referred by the Minister ofLabour, after consultation with the National Joint AdvisoryCouncil, if he considered that the national interest had not beentaken into full account. A draft of the proposed statement was annexed to CP. (47) 303.In CP. (47) 304 the Minister of Labour, while expressingagreement with the purpose of this draft statement, criticised theproposals made in it on the ground that they would undermine theposition of the executive councils of the trade unions and destroy the authority of the existing arbitral bodies. He also pointed outthat there was no way of enforcing a limitation of wage payments to individual workers; that no effective measures were proposed for controlling salaries, profits and rents; and that the proposal for higher wages in the undermanned industries was in itself inflation-ary and ignored the fact that in many industries security of employ-ment was of more account than rates of wages. For these reasons,it was suggested that, before the Cabinet reached any firm decisions,the Trades Union Congress, who were now conscious of the need to devise some means of preventing wage increases which wouldinjure the national interests, should be allowed to make their ownsuggestions to the Government at their meeting with the PrimeMinister on 17th November.The Minister for Economic Affairs said that the earlier talks with the Trades Union Congress had, in his view, been largely fruit-less because Ministers had had no definite proposals to put forward for consideration; and he had circulated CP. (47) 303 in the hopeof securing agreement on some proposals which in the further talksmight be put forward on behalf of the Government. The suggestionthat a central appeal tribunal should be established was separablefrom the proposal that the Government should state the principles which ought to govern wage movements and could be discarded ifit were felt to involve too many difficulties. Nor did he think it essential that a Government statement should be published at once,and it might be preferable if the material set out in his draft statement were used in the first instance as a basis for the furthertalks with the Trades Union Congress. His main point was that theCabinet should accept the implications for wages of adopting apolicy of economic planning and should put forward sufficientlydefinite proposals to bring the discussions on wages policy to an issueat a relatively early date.
The Lord President said that it was unreasonable to leave itto the Trades Union Congress to bring forward proposals for a wage policy and that in the further talks Ministers should at leastput forward the proposals in CP. (47) 303 as possible ways ofdealing with the situation. They might at the same time canvassvarious alternative suggestions such cLS tii6 provision of full iriforma-tion about the economic situation to existing arbitral bodies and more active steps to disseminate this information among workers and employers.In further discussion the following arguments were used infavour of the course proposed by the Minister of Labour : (a) No evidence had been put before the Cabinet to show thatstandard wage rates, as distinct from earnings, were producing aserious inflationary effect; and it was suggested that in terms of purchasing power the standard rates were on average lower to-daythan in 1939.(b) Government intervention in the negotiation of wages settle-ments was in principle undesirable and would in the end lead to aclash between the workers and the Government.(c) The Government should think twice before abandoning, inorder to meet a temporary emergency, the principle of collective bargaining, subject to independent arbitration, on which thestrength of the trade union movement had been founded.(d) It was incorrect to suggest that every increase in wages inan undermanned industry had been followed by corresponding increases in related industries in order to maintain the traditionaldifferentials. Thus, though roadmen&apos;s wages had risen in conse-quence of the wage increases granted to agricultural workers, the differential had been greatly reduced.(e) The advantages of the existing system of wage regulationwere illustrated by the fact that even in the period of dislocationafter the war the turnover of labour in industry had been abnormallylow.(/) No comprehensive statement of the number of vacancies tobe filled in undermanned industries had been put forward, nor was it clear that higher wage rates, as distinct from improved conditionsof employment, would be effective in attracting labour to those industries.On the other hand, the following points were made in favourof the adoption of a more positive policy : (g) A continuance of the present movement towards higher wages and shorter hours would bring no benefit to the workers andwould seriously weaken the power of British industry to find marketsoverseas.(h) To achieve their aim of switching labour to essential work  the Government must be able to prevent unj ustifiable wage increases in unessential occupations.(i) Though the Cabinet had not been given figures of the vacan-cies in undermanned industries, it was clear that to reach the higherproduction targets in agriculture many more workers were needed.These would not be obtained if wages in other rural occupations were increased every time there was an increase in agricultural wages.(j) Even if it were undesirable for the Government to intervenewhere the issue was one entirely between workers and employers,how could they stand aside where the&apos;grant of increased wages wouldmean, directly or indirectly, an increased charge on the Exchequer ?If the principle were established that the Government should be heard, not only in claims by State employees, but where the employers were public boards or local authorities or, as in the buildingindustry, where the claims could be granted only at the expense of higher Exchequer subsidies, the Governments influence would be felt over a large part of the field and there would be a tendency for other wages movements to conform.The Prime Minister said that on the basis of the informationbefore them it was impossible for the Cabinet to formulate proposals
which could be put to the Trades Union Congress on their behalfat the meeting on 17th November. He therefore proposed that atthat meeting Ministers should merely take note of what the repre-sentatives of the Trades Union Congress had to say. Thereafter theCabinet would have to discuss wages policy further, and for thispurpose it would be useful if the Minister of Labour would circulate a factual note which would help Ministers to reach a decision onthe alternative proposals put before them.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that at the meeting between Ministers and repre-sentatives of the Trades Union Congress on 17th Novem-ber no proposals for a wages policy should be putforward on behalf of the Government;(2) Invited the Minister of Labour to circulate a memorandum giving information about past and prospective wagemovements in relation both to the general economic situa-tion and to the needs of the undermanned essential indus-tries, and dealing with the suggestion that the Govern-ment should adopt a more positive wages policy in caseswhere claims for increased wages were made by employees of public boards and local authorities, or where the grant of a wages claim would involve anadditional charge on the Exchequer.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,13th November, 1947.
