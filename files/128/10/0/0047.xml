1. The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations saidthat it would be appropriate for the United Kingdom to send giftsto the Prime Minister and Parliament of Ceylon on the occasion of Ceylon&apos;s attainment of Dominion status. The Chancellor of theExchequer had agreed that the United Kingdom Government should present a motor-car to the Prime Minister of Ceylon. And it hadbeen suggested that a Speaker&apos;s Chair and Mace should be presented to the Parliament of Ceylon either by the Parliament at Westminsteror by the Empire Parliamentary Association. The Cabinet con-sidered that, subject to the views of the Speaker, it would be prefer-able that this latter present should be made by the Parliament at westminster.The Cabinet (1) Authorised, the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Rela-tions to arrange for a present of a motor-car to be senton behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the PrimeMinister of Ceylon;(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations to suggest to the Speaker that the Parliament at West-minster should present to the Ceylon Parliament a speaker&apos;s Chair and Mace.Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in the House of Commons in the week following the Christmas Recess,the House of In order that the best use might be made of the ParliamentaryCommons. time available before Easter it was of special importance that the representation of the People Bill and the Gas Bill should be ready for introduction as soon as possible after the Christmas Recess. TheCabinet asked that the Departments concerned should make everyeffort to expedite the preparation of these Bills.3. The Foreign Secretary said that an agreement had now beenreached with the United States Government on the financing of theAnglo-American Combined Zone of Germany. The object of thenegotiations, which had been opened early in October, had been tosecure that His Majesty&apos;s Government would not in future be liable for any dollar expenditure on imports into the Combined Zone.Though this objective had not been fully achieved, the agreementnow reached would limit our total dollar liability in respect ofGermany to a maximum of  28 million in 1948, and there was good reason to hope that the dollar expenditure actually incurred by usin that year would not, in fact, exceed  10 million.The agreement represented a substantial contribution by theUnited States Government towards our balance of payments diffi-culties. Together with the earlier decision to release the balance ofthe United States Credit, it would be regarded in Washington as constituting assistance to the United Kingdom comparable to the interim aid which Congress was affording to France and Italy.The Cabinet 1Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Council of 4.   The Foreign Secretary said that in the House of CommonsForeign that afternoon he would make a statement on the breakdown of theMinisters.       recent meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers.

The statement would not deal with future policy in respect ofGermany; this would be reserved for the debate on foreign affairs which was to be held immediately after the Christmas Recess.The Foreign Secretary said that the Cabinet should take anearly opportunity of considering future policy in respect of europe as a whole, and he proposed to circulate a comprehensive memoran-dum as a basis for this discussion.The Cabinet-(1) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would settle with thePrime Minister the final text of the statement which hewas proposing to make in the House of Commons that afternoon on the breakdown of the recent meeting of theCouncil of Foreign Ministers;(2) Agreed to review at an early meeting the whole question of future policy in respect of Europe, on the basis of amemorandum to be circulated by the Foreign Secretary.Parliament. 5.   The  Cabinet considered a memorandum by  the HomeElectoral Secretary (CP. (47) 333) setting out the conclusions reached by the reform. Ministerial Committee on Electoral Legislation which had examined(Previous the recommendations in the Final Report of the Committee on reference: Electoral Law Reform, the Initial Reports of the Boundary Com-C.M.(47)6lst missions for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and conclusions, certain other matters connected with the proposed RepresentationMinute 3.) of the People Bill. Annexed to the memorandum was a summaryof the recommendations made in the Final Report of the Committeeon Electoral Reform.The Cabinet were informed that, subject to the qualificationsnoted in paragraphs 4-13 of CP. (47) 333, the Ministerial Com-mittee on Electoral Legislation proposed that effect should be givento the recommendations of the Committee on Electoral Reform. TheCabinet were also advised for the reasons given in para-graphs 15-20 of CP. (47) 333 that no change should be made inthe existing law governing voting by peers who were not membersof the House of Lords. The Cabinet were invited to endorse therecommendation of the Speaker&apos;s Conference and the Committeeon Electoral Law Reform that speakers&apos; expenses should be allowedand included under a separate heading in the election agents return of expenses; and to agree that county councils in England andWales and returning officers in Scotland should be required to review the division of rural areas into polling districts with a view to ensuring adequate provision of polling facilities, the results of thereviews being published locally and the Secretary of State havingpower to intervene if he thought the proposals inadequate. TheCabinet endorsed all these recommendations.Discussion then turned on the proposals in the Initial Reportsof the Boundary Commissions. The Ministerial Committee had recommended that these should be accepted without modification.This involved leaving as single constituencies eight boroughs withelectorates of between 80,000 and 88,000. But to divide theseboroughs would mean giving a further three seats to London, which under the Commission^ proposals was already being treated more favourably than the rest of England, as well as making it difficultto resist demands for additional representation from other boroughswhere the average electorate was high; and accordingly the Corn-mission, though they had in fact prepared and submitted informally to the Home Secretary a scheme for dividing the eight boroughs, had reached the conclusion that they should remain as singleconstituencies. The City of London had been excluded from thescope of the review made by the Boundary Commission, but thedecision that it should cease to be a separate constituency made itnecessary to amalgamate it with a neighbouring constituency andthe Committee recommended that it should be combined with the
155CM. 06 (17)boroughs of Finsbury and Shoreditch to form a new constituencywith an electorate of 60,815, to be known as &quot; the City of london with Finsbury and Shoreditch.&quot; It was also proposed that, as thenumber of London constituencies was to be reduced from 60 to 40,each new constituency should elect three, instead of two, members to the London County Council.The Cabinet recognised that there would be great advantages in putting the Boundary Commissions&apos; proposals&apos; before Parliamentwithout alteration and that disparities between the electorates ofdifferent areas could be justified on the grounds that boroughconstituencies were more compact and that local unities should be preserved. On the other hand, there was likely to be considerable criticism of the proposal that eight boroughs with electorates of between 80,000 and 88,000 should each have only one member. Therewould undoubtedly be pressure to give two members to Blackburn,since the neighbouring constituency of Darwen had an electorate of only 42,679. It was suggested in paragraph 25 of CP. (47) 333that, if each of these boroughs were allowed two members for a littlemore than 80.000 electors, it would be difficult to resist demands from other boroughs for representation on the same scale; and asan example Bradford was cited, where the Commission had recom-mended three members for a total electorate of 213,000. In theCabinet&apos;s discussion it was contended that this was not a goodexample, for Bradford, with three members for 213,000 electors,compared unfavourably with Hull, which had four members for anelectorate of 219,000. It was the general view of the Cabinet thatthe Home Secretary would be under strong pressure in Parliamentto modify this particular recommendation of the Boundary Corn-mission, and that he should therefore consider in advance whatrepercussions there would be on other constituencies if the Govern-ment felt obliged to yield to this pressure and give two members to each of these eight boroughs.The Cabinet (1) Approved the recommendations in the Final Report of theCommittee on Electoral Reform, subject to the qualifica-tions set out in paragraphs 4 to 13 of CP. (47) 333;(2) Approved the recommendations made in paragraphs 14 to 23of CP. (47) 333 with regard to voting by peers who werenot members of the House of Lords, speakers&apos; expenses and polling facilities in rural areas;(3) Agreed that the City of London should be combined withthe boroughs of Finsbury and Shoreditch to form a singleconstituency, but decided that this constituency shouldbe known as &apos;&apos; The City of London &apos;&apos;;(4) Subject to (3) above, agreed that the Initial Reports of the boundary Commissions for England, Scotland, wales and Northern Ireland should be scheduled to the representation of the People Bill without modification;but invited the Home Secretary to circulate amemorandum outlining a scheme for dividing into two-member constituencies the eight boroughs mentioned inthe footnote to paragraph 25 of&quot; CP. (47) 333, togetherwith a statement of the modifications in the representation proposed by the Boundary commission for other constituencies which would have to be made if such a scheme were adopted;(5) Agreed that the law should be amended to provide that each of the 40 London constituencies should elect three members to the London County Council and that this change should take effect for the London County Councilelections in 1949.
Oil Supplies.(previous reference:CM. (47) 90thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofTransport and the Minister of Fuel and Power (CP. (47) 330) onthe oil supply situation during the first quarter of 1948.The memorandum explained that the British oil companiesexpected . to be able to produce or buy enough oil to meet their programmes during the period, but that tanker capacity would beabout 13 per cent, short of their requirements. This represented a deficit of about 1,334,000 tons up to 31st March next. The position was expected to improve in the second quarter of the year as thetankers now laid up in the United States were gradually put into service. To meet the immediate situation, various measures were proposed. Additional tankers would be chartered in the UnitedStates, the building up of oil stocks in the United Kingdom wouldbe suspended, part of the coal/oil conversion schemes would be temporarily deferred, some saving of gas oil would be made by the reduced manufacture of carburetted water gas, and a 5 per cent,reduction would be made in British supplies to the Commonwealth.In addition, the Admiralty had agreed to make fifteen tankersavailable temporarily for commercial service. These measures would,however, leave a deficit of 515,000 tons, which would mean that.i.f. sales to foreign countries would have to be reduced by 40 percent, for the first quarter of 1948.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, since CP. (47) 330was circulated, the Admiralty had agreed to release a further fivetankers for temporary commercial use. This would reduce the deficitto 380,000 tons, which would mean a 30 per cent, cut in foreign sales.Of a total of thirty-four Admiralty tankers, four were under repairat the present time and three were already chartered out until31st December, 1947; the temporary release of a further twenty for commercial use would leave only seven for the current needs of theNavy, of which five were required for supplying the mediterranean fleet. Admiralty stocks of oil at present amounted to 940,000 tonsin the United Kingdom and 1,400,000 tons abroad; this was the equivalent of sixteen or seventeen months peace-time consumption and four months war-time consumption. The decisions already taken would reduce these stocks by 150,000 tons by 31st March, andany further reduction would prejudice the mobilisation of the Fleet.Ministers recognised that further contributions by theAdmiralty, whether by loan of tankers or by running downAdmiralty oil stocks, could not be made without incurring some measure of risk for which the Cabinet must assume responsibility.But they considered that the risk of needing Admiralty oil for the mobilisation of the Fleet within the next few months was small.And, on the other side, the danger to our balance of payments position if these c.i,f. sales of oil were curtailed by 30 per cent, wasimmediate and grave. Unless we were prepared for the time being to subordinate other considerations to the solution of this problem,our gold and dollar reserves would soon fall to a level at which our international position would be fatally undermined. In thesecircumstances, Ministers considered that the right course would beto call on the Admiralty to close the remaining gap of 380,000 tonseither by drawing on their oil stocks or by the diversion of furthernaval tankers, on the understanding that the consequential reduction&apos;in Admiralty stocks would be made good as soon as practicable.Further points made in discussion were :  (a) We now had 45 tankers under construction. Ten would come into service within three months,.and a further nineteen duringthe remainder of 1948. Under present conditions, the period of construction of a tanker was 1\ to 2 years. The oil companies hadnaturally hesitated to place more extensive orders for new tankerswhen large numbers of United States tankers were laid up.(b) The Admiralty should consider whether some of the stocksheld at Trincomalee and elsewhere in the Far East might be releasedlocally for commercial bunkers. This would save long hauls fromthe existing sources of supply.
157CM. 96 (47)(c) It was most important for political reasons that the PersianGovernment should not have grounds for complaining that we werenot fully exploiting the oil-fields at Abadan. Every effort should therefore be made to provide the tanker capacity required to shipthe full output of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company.(d) A sudden reversal of policy on coal/oil conversion would expose the Government to criticism. The Cabinet were informedthat for the present it was not proposed to do more than preventfirms from starting conversion schemes or placing orders for oil-burning equipment, and that this could be justified on the groundthat in existing conditions the programme should be properly phased.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the outstanding balance of 380,000 tons needed to maintain c.i.f. sales to foreign countries in the first three months of 1948 should be provided by theAdmiralty, either by running down Admiralty oil stocksor by the diversion of further naval tankers; and invited the First Lord of the Admiralty, the Minister ofTransport and the Minister of Fuel and Power to deter-mine how this contribution by the Admiralty could most effectively be made.(2) Agreed that the reduction in Admiralty oil stocks conse-quent upon Conclusion (1) should be made good as soonas practicable after the end of March 1948.Trade 7.   The Cabinet were informed that the current negotiations on negotiations. our balance of payments with Canada had resulted in an agreement,Canada. the terms of which would be announced in Ottawa and London that evening. The Canadian Government had been unwilling to commit themselves at this stage to any period longer than the first threemonths of 1948 : they were obviously waiting to see how far their financial difficulties and ours might be eased by the outcome of thediscussions in Washington on Marshall Aid. The broad effect ofthe agreement was that our existing contracts for food and rawmaterials from Canada would continue during these three months,with a resuting deficit in our balance of payments estimated by the canadians at $145 million, of which We were to pay $ 100 million inUnited States dollars and $45 million by drawings on the CanadianCredit. Our delegation believed that the deficit would prove in theevent to be larger than $145 million; and they had understood thatany excess over that figure would be met in equal proportions bypayment in United States dollars and drawings on the CanadianCredit. The Canadian Government had not, however, been willingto commit themselves to this method of meeting any excess, and theagreement would merely provide that the method of meeting any obligation in excess of the $145 million would be a matter fordiscussion between the two Governments.The Cabinet agreed that there was no alternative but to accept this agreement and seek to reach in March a more favourable settle-ment for the remainder of the vear.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,18th December, 1947.
