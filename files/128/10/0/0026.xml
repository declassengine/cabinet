Parliament. 1.   The Lord President recalled that, contrary to the advice ofBusiness m the Government, the House of Lords had decided to meet onthe House of 9th September, notwithstanding that the House of Commons stillLords. stood adjourned, for the purpose of reviewing any Orders madeunder emergency powers since the passing of the Supplies and services (Extended Purposes) Act, 1947, on 13th August. Althoughit had been the original intention that this meeting should be limitedto the review of these Orders, notice had subsequently been given oftwo motions which would enable the House of Lords to hold a wide-ranging debate on the current economic situation. With the PrimeMinister&apos;s concurrence he had written to the Leader of the Opposi-tion in the House of Lords stating that the Government thought it undesirable that the Lords should thus seek to debate the economicsituation at a time when the Commons stood adjourned; and, withthe First Lord of the Admiralty, he had subsequently discussed theposition with both Lord Salisbury and Lord Samuel. Lord Salis-bury had thought that the Government might have welcomed this opportunity to make some interim statement on the economic situa-tion; but, in view of the objections raised on behalf of the Govern-ment, he had undertaken to secure that the Motions on the economicsituation would not be pressed to a Division. He was not, how-ever, prepared to agree that at the conclusion of the debate theHouse of Lords should adjourn until the date already fixed for thereassembly of the House of Commons; and it seemed likely that, ifsuch an adjournment motion were proposed by the Government, hewould oppose it. In these circumstances it was proposed that theFirst Lord of the Admiralty should, at the outset of the debate,explain the grounds on which the Government declined to take partin a debate on the economic situation while the House of Commonsstood adjourned; and that, in replying to the debate, Lord Pakenhamshould confine himself to answering any questions of fact whichmight have been raised about the Orders made under emergency powers since 13th August.Discussion first turned on the question whether the Governmentshould oppose a motion to adjourn the House of Lords, after that day&apos;s debate, until a date earlier than that fixed for the reassemblyof the House of Commons. It was agreed that the Governmentshould resist such a motion, even though they would be defeated ifit were pressed to a Division. It was further agreed that- theGovernment spokesman might say that, if the Lords decided to meet again for a further debate on the economic situation before the commons reassembled, no Government spokesman would attend onthat occasion. -In further discussion the question was raised whether theinsistence of the Lords on meeting while the Commons stoodadjourned might not affect the rights of the Commons to pray forthe annulment of Orders made under emergency powers. the attorney-General was invited to consider this point. Later in themeeting the Prime Minister read to the Cabinet a note which the attorney-General had written after consulting the relevant statutes.This pointed out that, under Section 4 of the Supplies and Services(Transitional Powers) Act, 1945, it was provided that, in reckoningthe period of 40 days during which either House might pray forthe annulment of an Order made under that Act, no account shouldbe taken of any period during which both Houses of Parliament areadjourned for more than four days. Thus, the effect of that day&apos;smeeting of the House of Lords would be to deprive the House ofCommons of one of the 40 days within which they might otherwisepray against any Orders laid before Parliament before the adjourn-ment. No fresh Orders could be laid before Parliament while either house was adjourned; and the rights of the House of commons would not in practice be seriously affected if the House of Lordsmet for one or two days while the other House stood adjourned. in theory, however, the House of Lords might, by meeting continuouslyduring the adjournment of the House of Commons, substantiallv
reduce, or even exhaust, the period during which the Commons could otherwise have prayed for the annulment of an Order made under emergency powers before the adjournment of the two Houses.The Minister of Health said that the opinion now given by the attorney-General confirmed the view, which he had expressedearlier in the discussion, that a Government with a minority in theHouse of Lords could not afford to allow the Lords to establish aright to meet, contrary to the wishes of the Government, while the commons stood adjourned; and he still thought it would be inexpedient for Government spokesmen to give any information orassistance to the House of Lords at their meeting that day.There was general agreement that the Government should atonce consider whether legislation should not be introduced, earlyin the following Session, to ensure that the House of Lords would infuture be unable, by meeting while the House of Commons stoodadjourned, to limit in any way the rights of the House of commons to pray for the annulment of Orders made under emergency powers.Meanwhile, at the meeting of the House of Lords that day LordPakenham should not,, as originally proposed, give information on points of fact about the Orders made under emergency powers since13th August; and the First Lord of the Admiralty should state in his opening speech (which would otherwise be confined to theGovernment&apos;s objections to debating questions of policy while theHouse of Commons stood adjourned) that he was not proposing tomake any statement on behalf of the Government about the economicsituation and that information about the Orders made under emergency powers had already been made available in the Press.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that in the debate in the House of Lords that day no statement should be made on behalf of the Government,either about the economic situation as a whole or aboutthe Orders made under emergency powers since 13thAugust;(2) Invited the Prime Minister to consider whether legislation should be introduced to ensure that the House of lords should not be able, by meeting while the House of Com-mons stood adjourned, to limit the rights of the House.of Commons.2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Home Secretary(OP. (47) 222) covering the draft of a Bill to amend the british nationality law.The Home Secretary explained that the principles of the schemeembodied in this Bill had already been approved by the Cabinet on 9th September, 1946, and by the conference of experts from Com-commonwealth countries held in February 1947. It had further beenagreed that the Bill should be included in the Legislative Pro-gramme for the 1947-48 Session of Parliament. It was hoped thatthis measure would serve as a model for corresponding legislation in other Commonwealth countries; and his purpose in submittingthe draft to his colleagues at this stage was to obtain their authorityto communicate the text to the Governments of those countries.In discussion the question was raised whether the Governmentsof India and Pakistan, which had not been represented at the con-ference of experts in February 1947, would prefer to be treated underthe scheme on the same basis as Eire or be willing to come into it on the same footing as the other Commonwealth&quot; countries. Itwas agreed that the first approach to the Governments of Indiaand Pakistan should be made on the assumption that they would wish to be treated under this scheme on the same basis as themajority of the other Commonwealth countries.       -   -.-BritishNationalityLaw.(previous reference:CM. (46) 80thConclusions,Minute 5.)
Man-Power.Control ofEngagementOrder.(previous reference:CM. (47) 69thConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister ofLabour (CP. (47) 244 and 248) on various points connected with theuse of powers of direction as a sanction for the new Control of engagement Order.The Minister of Labour said that the Trades Union Congresshad now accepted the Governments view that the Control of engagement Order could not be effectively applied without a limiteddirection of labour. This removed much of his objections to theimmediate use of the power of direction for this purpose; but itwould be necessary to meet the points raised by the Trades UnionCongress about the need for (i) safeguarding the conditions ofworkers affected and (ii) bringing into essential work men andwomen who were at present making no contribution to the nation&apos;sproductive effort. His proposals for this purpose were set out inparagraphs 3 and 4 of CP. (47) 248.In discussion of the proposed safeguards the following points were made : &apos; (a) In presenting this policy to the public it should be made clear that an element of compulsion was to be applied to employersas well as to work-people. For example, the Government shouldproclaim their intention of withholding supplies of raw materials from manufacturers who were not prepared to produce the typeof goods required in present circumstances for the home market orfor export.(b) Further steps should be taken to prevent abuse of the provi-sion by which persons employed in a managerial capacity wereexempt from the Control of Engagement Order. It might be practicable to place on the individual the onus of proof, to anindependent tribunal, that he was in fact engaged in a managerialcapacity.(c) Building workers should not be allowed to avoid direction to essential work by setting up in business on their own account.To prevent this the Ministry of Works were considering, in consulta-tion with the Ministry of Labour, means of tightening up theexisting control over the registration of new building firms. in strengthening this control, however, care should be taken to ensurethat vested interests in the building industry would not thereby be enabled to protect themselves against competition. It was forconsideration whether this control should not be administered bysome authority independent of the Ministry of Works and thebuilding industry.(d) Provision might have to be made to prevent an employerfrom transferring to less essential work labour supplied to him under the Control of Engagement Order. This had been securedduring the war by the Restriction of Transfer Order. The broadprinciple should be that compulsory powers should be used only forthe purpose of directing workers to essential work.(e) Women with family responsibilities should not be requiredto accept employment which would involve their living away from home or working at unreasonable distances from their homes.The Cabinet-.(1) Approved in principle the proposals outlined in para-graph 3 of CP. (47) 248 subject to the modification noted in paragraph (e) above, and subject to further considera-tion of the points noted in paragraphs (b), (e) and (d)above;The Cabinet Authorised the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations to communicate to Dominion Governments the text of the draft Bill annexed to CP. (47) 222.
(2) Invited the Minister of Labour to complete, in the light ofthe Cabinefs discussion, the detailed arrangements, forthe introduction of the Control of Engagement Order;and asked that when the details of the Order were announced special stress should be laid on the measures. proposed for applying an element of compulsion to employers as well as work-people.Unproductive The Cabinet next considered the proposals outlined in para-Employments, graph 4 of CP. (47) 248 for combing out the unoccupied and those engaged in wholly unproductive occupations.   In a preliminary discussions the following points, were made :- (/) Footballs Pools. Some Ministers thought that in presentcircumstances football pools should be prohibited. An alternativesuggestion was that more useful employment (e.g., textiles) shouldbe provided in Liverpool, so that the large numbers of women employed there by the football pools might be diverted to that other employment. The general view of the Cabinet was that theright approach was to make an Order under Defence Regulation 58arequiring the managements of football pools and other gamblingenterprises to register particulars of themselves and their employeesso that they might be submitted, or if necessary directed, to more essential work. This initial step might be followed at a later stageby measures for compulsory concentration of firms operating foot-ball pools.(g) Clubs. There was general agreement that it would be inexpedient to introduce legislation controlling employment in clubs.The Home Secretary said that he would deprecate any proposals which involved the exercise of a discretion by the police in deciding whetheror not a particular club was to be classed as undesirable. past experience had shown that such a discretionary power would exposepolice officers to bribery on a scale which he was not prepared to contemplate. If it was desired to identify the less desirable types of club with a view to combing out employees from them, theMinistry of Labour should set up for this purpose their ownmachinery, both for registration and for enquiry.(h) Street Trading. If legislation on street trading were tobe introduced, the opportunity should be taken of bringing withinthe definition of street trading sales made from a motor vehicle.Ministers., were, however, inclined to doubt the expediency ofdifferentiating against street trading in the manner proposed inparagraph 4 (2) (a) of CP. (47) 248. Would it be justifiable to take powers enabling the Ministry of Labour to prevent a man fromestablishing himself in business as a street trader so long as others were free; without such restrictions, to open a shop for similarretail business ?(i) Unoccupied Persons. Ministers doubted the wisdom of attempting to register compulsorily all unoccupied persons withinthe ages of control, as suggested in paragraph 4 (2) (d) of cp. (47) 248. The number of effective workers who would be recruited to industry by this means would not be large enoughto warrant the administrative effort required in making such aregistration effective.The Cabinet (3) Invited the Man-Power Committee to consider, in the lightof the points raised in this preliminary discussion, the detailed proposals put forward in the report annexed to CP. (47) 248 for combing out the unoccupied and those engaged in wholly unproductive occupations.In paragraph 6 of CP. (47) 248 it was proposed that men inthe Polish Resettlement Corps who declined to take work availablefor them should be deprived of their military pay and, if necessary,directed into employment.PolishResettlementCorps.
Housing andLodgingAecommoda-tion.Housing. 4.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord PresidentPriority for (CP.

Thisment Areas. report had been made in pursuance of a decision taken by the FuelCommittee on 11th July (F.C. (47) 19th Meeting, Minute&quot; 5).The Minister of Agriculture said that he feared that themeasures recommended in this report would not be sufficient to securethe required expansion in the provision of houses for agricultural workers.After some further discussion, the Cabinet Invited the Lord President to arrange for the report annexed to CP. (47) 249 to be considered in the firstinstance by the Minister of Health, the Minister of Agri-culture and the Minister of Works.export programme.(previous reference:CM. (47) 74thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (CP. (47) 250) containing detailed proposalsfor a revised export programme.The President of the Board of Trade said that the export programme of each industry had been revised with a view to securing an expansion of exports to a level of 140 per cent, of the1938 volume by mid-1948 and 160 per cent, by the end of 1948. the detailed proposals annexed to CP. (47) 250 could be accepted as a practicable task for British industry, but only on conditions thatwould involve drastic limitations on the calls made upon man-powerand materials for the manufacture of capital goods or consumer goods for the home market. Industrial requirements of fuel anc&apos;/power must, for instance, be met in full. Steel production mustreach a level of 14 million ingot tons in 1948, since the exportIn a preliminary discussion it was stated that the extent of therecalcitrance among members of the Polish Resettlement Corps was generally exaggerated. The Cabinet endorsed the general principlethat members of this Corps who were unwilling to work should bedeported to Poland.The Cabinet (4) Invited the Minister of Labour to work out, in consultationwith the Foreign Secretary and the Service Ministers,detailed proposals for ensuring that men in the PolishResettlement Corps should not be allowed to remain inidleness on military pay when work was available forthem which they declined to take.In paragraph 7 of CP. (47) 248 it was suggested that theexisting scarcity of housing and lodging accommodation for industrial workers might be eased (i) by providing that profits made by pensioners from taking in lodgers should not be taken intoaccount in assessing the pensioners income; and (ii) by modifying the existing restrictions on the building of new hostels and campsfor the accommodation of industrial workers.The Cabinet (5) Invited the Minister of Labour to discuss with the Ministerof National Insurance and the Chancellor of theExchequer his proposals for encouraging pensioners toprovide lodgings for industrial workers;(6) Asked the Minister of Labour to discuss with the Ministerof Works his proposals for relaxing the existing restric-tions on the building of new hostels or camps for the accommodation of industrial workers.
programme would be dependent on a supply of 3 million tons of finished steel; in addition, a revision of the priority steel allocationswould be necessary and steps should be taken to bring deliveries into line with allocations. The labour required for the programme would no doubt be forthcoming as the result of the proposed reductions inthe investment programme and in the manufacture of supplies forthe home market. The most important reduction in consumer goodswould be in textiles. The revised export target of  350 million would mean a reduction in the clothes ration to 3-j coupons a monthas from 1st March, 1948; if, however, the output of textiles couldbe increased by more than 5 per cent, the need for reducing the ration would be to that extent diminished. Other important cutsin domestic consumption would be necessary, but their contribution towards the export drive would be less important than the reductions in the investment programme which were under separate considera-tion. The proposed expansion of exports would involve a heavy additional demand for drums, containers and packaging materials of all kinds, and he suggested that the Materials Committee should report as soon as possible on the arrangements necessary to ensurean adequate supply of such materials.The programme outlined had been prepared in consultationwith the production Departments and would be discussed in detail with the industries concerned. It would be kept under review bya newly appointed inter-departmental committee under the Chair-manship of the Secretary for Overseas Trade. In each Region acommittee of senior officers of the production Departments shouldbe set up, under the chairmanship of the Board of Trade RegionalController, with a view to co-ordinating the efforts of those Depart-ments in assisting the export drive.In a general discussion of the revised export programme, thefollowing points were made : (a) Colonial production, for which consumer goods were often agreater incentive than money, was seriously hampered by existingshortages, especially of textiles. The Colonial Empire could makea major contribution towards the solution of our present economic difficulties, and special attention should be given to its needs, both for consumer goods and capital equipment.(b) The Lord President pointed out that no mention was madein CD. (47) 250 of the capacity of overseas markets to absorb our exports on the expanded scale proposed; nor was there any referenceto the measures which would be taken to ensure that the exportsflowed, at competitive prices, to the most profitable markets.The President of the Board of Trade said that the revised programme was based on the best possible estimate of the overseas markets in 1948; such estimates were necessarily tentative and, forthat reason, the programme would have to be kept flexible. any additional powers necessary to direct exports to specified countries would have to be taken, but, as far as possible, satisfactory arrange-ments would be made in agreement with industry in the light ofthe forthcoming trade negotiations.(c) It was suggested that the announcement at this stage ofprecise export targets for individual industries for 1948 shouldbe avoided in view of the uncertainties of the economic position. Itwas pointed out, however, that the Federation of British industries had in fact asked that definite targets should be laid down, andit was the general view of the Cabinet that it was essential at thisstage that the Government should specify a concrete task for theexport industries.The Cabinet then considered the specific conditions, summarised in paragraph 24 of CP. (47) 250, on which the revised export programme was based : (i) The Minister of Fuel and Power said that, if industry wasto receive the full requirement of 24^ million tons of coal next winter, as proposed in CP. (47) 250, it would be necessary to draw
on stocks to the extent of 1-48 million tons. In consequence stockswould be reduced to a dangerously low level between 2-7 and 4-7 million tons by the end of the winter. He would be reluctant toreduce the allocations to gas companies in view of the importanceof maintaining coke output for steel production. He would alsobe most reluctant to reduce at this stage the allocation of coal for domestic consumption.Ministers thought it would be premature at present to reach any definite decisions as regards the reduction of approved coalallocations. The position should be kept Under review during thewinter.(ii) Reference was made to the difficulties encountered in meeting the essential needs of the steel industry for scrap. Effortsweie being made to import up to 1J million tons from Germany.Doubt was, however, expressed whether adequate arrangements hadbeen made for the disposal of surplus scrap in the hands of theService departments and the Ministry of Supply. Ministers were also doubtful whether it was expedient that the responsibility for collecting scrap should be left with the industry.(iii) The Lord President said that the revision of steel alloca-tions proposed in CP. (47) 250 would raise very difficult questions;for instance, the output of coal and steel was already adversely affected by shortage of railway wagons and a reduction in thegeneration of electricity would reduce industrial production both for export and for the home market. Pie suggested that theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Paymaster-General might beauthorised to arbitrate on any points arising from the re-allocationwhich could not be settled by the Materials Committee.Some Ministers were doubtful whether the export programme should be given an overriding priority in the allocation of steel.The Minister of Health suggested that this would prejudge thecurrent review of the investment programme. The general view ofthe Cabinet was, however, that, in the present economic situation,the export programme should be accorded the degree of priorityasked for in CP. (47) 250.(iv) The President of the Board of Trade suggested that an urgent investigation should be made into the working of the existing machinery for controlling the issue of steel to manufacturers.The Lord President said that this point had been raised at themeeting which Ministers had held on 5th September with repre-sentatives of the Federation of British Industries (see Minute 7below). The Ministers present at that meeting had agreed thatsucn an investigation should be made and that industry should be associated with it.The Prime Minister said that this joint investigation shouldbe carried out without delay and a report submitted within a fortnight.(v) Ministers endorsed the proposal in CP. (47) 250 that theControl of Engagement Order should be so operated, in the appro-priate districts, as to give the textile industries the maximumopportunity for recruiting additional workers. They considered,however, that this matter might more appropriately be handled bythe Minister of Labour in connection with the other matters dealtwith in CP. (47) 248.(vi) The Cabinet supported the recommendation that the exporttarget for textiles should be raised to  350 million a year. they considered, however, that it would be a psychological mistake tocouple the announcement of this revised target. with a negativethreat of a further reduction in the clothing ration. An increasein production of 10 per cent, would make it unnecessary to reducethe clothing ration, and the emphasis should, therefore, be on the positive need for expanding production in ordef to enable theexisting ration to be maintained.-5 c
(vii) The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the proposedexemption of the textile industries from the obligation to staggerworking hours would stimulate similar claims from other industries.He thought it should be possible to devise alternative arrangements which would be equally satisfactory.It was agreed that the President of the Board of Trade would consult further with the interested Departments on this point.(viii) The Minister of Transport said that the proposal toincrease the percentage of commercial vehicles exported from 40 percent, to 50 per cent, would increase the existing difficulties of passenger transport services in this country.(ix) The Minister of Health opposed the suggestion in cp. (47) 250 that the development of the clean milk policy shouldbe subordinated to the needs of the export programme, and it wasagreed that this point should be further considered.(x) It was agreed that representatives of the Ministry ofLabour should be included in the regional committees suggested bythe President of the Board of Trade for supervising the carryingout of the export programme.(xi) It was agreed that the President of the Board of trade should be at liberty to disclose the details of the export programme,as set out in CP. (47) 250, at the meeting arranged for 12thSeptember, and that he should also broadcast on the same subject.It was felt that stress ought to be laid in these announcements on theneed for increased production, not only to achieve the targetsmentioned, but also as a means for avoiding shortages in the home market.The Cabinet (1) Approved the revised export programme set out in the&quot;Annexes to CP. (47) 250;(2) Endorsed the recommendations made in paragraph 24 of cp. (47) 250, subject to the modifications noted inparagraphs (vi) (vii), (ix), (x) and (xi) above;(3) Invited the Minister of Supply to submit a report to thePrime Minister on the existing arrangements for thecollection of scrap from both Service Department and ministry of Supply dumps and from other sources;(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Paymaster-General to arbitrate on any points arising from theproposed revision of steel allocations which could notbe settled by the Materials Committee;(5) Invited the Minister of Supply to arrange, in consultationwith the Federation of British Industries, for a jointexamination to be made into the working of the existing machinery for controlling the issue of steel to manufac-turers, and asked that the report of this investigationshould be submitted within a fortnight.Coal.Hours ofWork iu theCoalminingIndustry.(previous reference:CM. (47) 74thConclusions,Minute 1.)6. At their meeting on 17th August the Cabinet had invited the Minister of Fuel and Power to advise the National Coal board to press the request that an extra half-hour a day should be worked in the coalmining industry as a temporary measure designed toincrease coal output during the current emergency. The Cabinetnow had before them a memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and power (CP. (47) 254) on the situation created by the continuedrefusal of the National Union of Mineworkers to meet this request.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that a speedy settlementought now to be reached. In the light of the Grimethorpe strike,he thought it would be inadvisable to press any proposal, such asthat for an extra half-hour a day, which rested on an early reassess-ment of stints. If increased hours were to be worked, the alternative proposal of Saturday working was to be preferred.   He therefore
Economic 7    The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord r/residentSituation. (CP. (47) 252) covering (i) a memorandum submitted to the PrimeViews of Minister by the Federation of British Industries outlining theirFederation recommendations for remedying the present economic situation;of British and (ii) notes prepared for the use of the Ministers who hadindustries. discussed this memorandum with representatives of the Federationat a meeting on 5th September.The Lord President said that a note (Gen. 179/28) had since been circulated to Ministers summarising the proceedings at thismeeting with representatives of the Federation; and steps werebeing taken to ensure that the various specific proposals put forward at the meeting were followed up by the Federation and by theDepartments concerned. In their earlier discussion that day on export policy the Cabinet had already approved one of those proposals, viz., that the Government should initiate an enquiry (withwhich industry should be associated) into the working of the existing machinery for controlling the issue of steel to manufacturers (see minute 5 above). No further decisions by the Cabinet were required at this stage on the other proposals which had been put forward atthe meeting.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the memorandum by the Federation of BritishIndustries annexed to CP. (47) 252.(2) Authorised the Lord President to send a written reply tothe Federation of British Industries informing them ofthe procedure proposed for following up the variousspecific suggestions made in their memorandum and atI the meeting which their representatives had held with% Ministers on 5th September.suggested that he should be authorised to inform the Coal Boardand the Union that the Government would not object to a solutionunder which the miners would work two Saturdays out of everyfour, that Saturday working should be remunerated at time and a half, and that a full shift should be worked on Saturdays where practicable.The Lord President and The Foreign Secretary pointed out thatthe proposal now made by the Minister of Fuel and Power involved a significant departure from the line they had taken at their meeting with the National Executive of the Union on 21st August, whichhad been confirmed by the Cabinet on 25th August. After that meeting of the Cabinet the Union had been informed that, if recoursewas to be had to Saturday working, the Government must insist thatthe attendance bonus should be conditional on working the fullnumber of six shifts a week where required under the new arrange-ments. It would be interpreted as a sign of weakness on the partof the Government if insistence on this condition were now with-drawn.The Cabinet endorsed the views expressed by the lord president and the Foreign Secretary on this point.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power to inform theNational Coal Board that His Majesty&apos;s Government werenot prepared to modify the views communicated to theNational Union of Mineworkers on 25th August about theconditions to be attached to Saturday working in the coal-mining industry.
international bank andInternationalMonetaryFund.8. The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that the annualmeetings of the International Bank and the International monetary fund would be opened in London, under his Chairmanship, later in the week. It was likely that in the course of these meetings itmight be suggested that these two bodies might do more to help in overcoming the current difficulties of international trade; and he,as Chairman, would propose to give a sympathetic welcome to anysuch suggestion. It was unlikely that any practical progress couldbe made in following up such suggestions in the public formalmeetings of these bodies; but he hoped that, as financial representa-tives of the principal countries concerned were present in london for these meetings, the opportunity might be taken of exploringin private conversations with them practical suggestions for over-coming current economic difficulties. He had already had a briefconversation with Mr. Snyder, the Secretary of the United states treasury, and had been pleased by his co-operative attitude. he hoped to have further talks with Mr. Snyder and would report theresults to the Cabinet in due course.The Cabinet-Took note of exchequer.the statement by the Chancellor of the india.Food Supplies.(previous reference:CM.
