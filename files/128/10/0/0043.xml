1. The Lord President said that he had considered, in consulttation with the Lord Chancellor, the Home Secretary and the solicitor-General, the question whether the Speaker would be ableto give his certificate under Section 2 (2) of the Parliament Act,1911, where the House of Lords, having received a Bill for the thirdtime, had not rejected it but had merely refrained from passing it.He had reached the conclusion that it would be inexpedient to dealwith this point by amendment of the Parliament Bill. Such an amendment, by drawing attention to the point and emphasising suchdoubt as might be entertained about it, would make it more difficult for the Speaker to give his certificate for the current Bill if that bill had to be enacted, under the existing provisions of the Parlia-ment Act and was not specifically rejected by the House of lords on the third occasion. He was also satisfied that it would be inexpedient to seek the views of the Clerk of the House of Commonswho, if he felt any doubt on the point, was bound to recommend thatit should be removed by amending the current Bill and would be under no obligation to take account of the political difficulties inwhich this course might involve the Government in securing thepassage of that Bill. The Lord President therefore recommendedthat the Government should not propose an amendment of thepresent Bill designed to put this point beyond doubt for the future.In discussion some anxiety was expressed lest the Governmentshould find themselves in difficulty on this account over subsequentBills which might have to be enacted under the amended provisionsof the Parliament Act. It was pointed out, however, that the Houseof Lords would expose themselves to damaging criticism if theyadopted tactics which were clearly designed to frustrate the pro-cedure prescribed in the Parliament Act, and that on this accountthey were unlikely to try to take advantage of a possible flaw in that procedure.The Cabinet Agreed that the Government should not propose any amendment of the Parliament Bill designed to assist the speaker to.give his certificate under Section 2 (2) of the parliament Act, 1911, in respect of a Bill which had notbeen specifically rejected by the House of Lords.2. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP. (47) 309) covering the first of a new series of periodical reports on the economic situation.The Cabinet were informed that, according to the calculationsof the Ministry of Labour, the number of workers employed on export orders in manufacturing industries was now 74 per cent,higher than in June 1939. The Ministry therefore considered thatit should be possible to attain the mid-1948 export targets even ifthe additional 150,000 workers, mentioned in paragraph 2 of cp. (47) 309, could not be obtained. Since the introduction of theControl of Engagement Order, there had been a marked increase inthe rate of recruitment for the textile industries. In general, theTrade Unions in the cotton industry were prepared to accept ascheme for over-time working, and it was hoped that the resistance of the one Union which was opposing this would be overcome.It was suggested that future reports in this series might include some information about agriculture and food. They might alsocontain a table recording progress towards approved productiontargets. Further consideration might also be given to the possibilityof fixing production targets for industries for which no targets had yet been set.The Cabinet agreed that there should be a change of emphasisin the general publicity on production.  The sombre theme of &quot; work or Want&quot; could give place in 1948 to publicity for the increased output achieved in 1947 as an encouragement to further effort.-3 B 2
stocks- On 8th November distributed coal stocks amounted to 16-3 million tons, as compared with the target of 14-7 million tonsLimited quantities of coal could therefore be made available forexport. Foreign Exchange was being saved by exporting more coal for bunkers, and it was proposed to allocate about ,30,000 tons amonth for export to countries with whom we had concluded satis-factory trade agreements. The stocks of scrap and pig-iron gavecause for anxiety. We looked to Germanv to provide the major partof our outstanding needs, but supplies from that source depended on the conclusion of the negotiations with the United States Govern-ment for the revision of the Bi-Zonal Agreement, The organisation for collecting scrap in this country had been overhauled and allpossible sources of supply were being used. The possibility ofsecuring additional supplies of scrap from Italy was also being examined; and, if necessary, an approach would be made to theItalian Government through the diplomatic channel.Overseas The Cabinefs attention was drawn to the serious situationEconomic revealed by the latest import and export figures. Our trade withPosition. the Western Hemisphere showed a large and increasing adverse balance on visible account, due largely to the disparate movementof import and export prices. A disturbing feature of the presentsituation was the influence on prices exerted by the free markets for primary food-stuffs. These markets were becoming veryrestricted, and were in consequence increasingly sensitive to pressure. Nevertheless, supplying countries quoted the prices inthose markets as criteria in negotiating bulk purchase agreements.This position would not be eased until increased supplies became available. The pressure of demand for manufactured goods wasnot comparable with that for primary food-st, ffs, with the resultthat the prices obtained by our exports had not increased propor-tionately. It was becoming increasingly difficult to market our exports in some countries against competition from the UnitedStates.It was pointed out that public opinion both in this country andin the producing countries was largely ignorant of the pricesdemanded for primary food-stuffs under present conditions and ofthe factors which determined these prices. Ought not the Govern-ment to arrange for further publicity to be given to these matters,both here and in the countries from which we bought our mainsupplies ? Some Ministers thought that closer examination of thisproposal might reveal serious objections. To some extent, the policy to be adopted might depend on the probable duration of worldshortages of primary products; for publicity on the lines suggestedmight stimulate demands for wage increases -which would seriouslydelay any recession of prices. Such publicity might also prejudice the efforts of Dominion Governments to restrain their farmers from pressing for higher prices in bulk-purchase contracts.Drain on The Cabinet were informed that the drain on our reserves inReserves. November had been  57 - 3 million, of which the rest of the sterling-area had been responsible for about one-third. Our object was toreduce this drain to  25 million a month in 1948. Since that targetwas adopted, certain adverse factors had emerged which would greatly complicate the task. Thus, we were now committed tofurther dollar expenditure on Germany. In order to preserve theCanadian wheat agreement, we might be compelled to make avail-able to the Canadian Government the dollar equivalent of about 100 million in excess of the original estimate. Certain unforeseenpayments in gold and dollars had to be made to European countries under existing agreements. Finally, there was a risk that underthe pressure of famine India might make extensive dollar purchases of food. It was important that our reserves of gold and dollarsshould not be reduced below  500 million. At the present rate of drawing, they would be reduced to  550 million by 31st december next. If the rate could be reduced to  34 million a month, the reserves would not fall below  500 million until the end of June1948.
It was recalled that, at their meeting on 17th August (CM. (47)71st Conclusions, Minute 1), some doubt had been expressed aboutthe adequacy of the machinery in the Treasury and the Bank ofEngland for recording movements of sterling The Cabinet were now informed that the President of the Board of Trade had carriedout an investigation and had submitted a report to the then Chan-cellor of the Exchequer in September. He had made a number of suggestions for improving the machinery which had been adopted,A difficulty lay in the slowness of other sterling area countries in providing statistics of sterling movements, but some improvement inthis respect could now be expected through the medium of the newLiaison Committee which had been established to maintain contactwdth sterling area countries. It was suggested in discussion thatthe Service Departments were also slow in. reporting details of their overseas expenditure.; and the question was raised whether some special machinery ought not. to be set up to ensure that overseas expenditure by the Service Departments was kept in line with thegeneral balance of payments policy.As regards possible demands by India on the sterling areareserves, the suggestion was made that an attempt might be made tomove Indian opinion in favour of the mobilising of the immensereserves of gold known to exist in the country.Attention was drawn to the recent fall in the prices of Govern-ment securities and to the reduction in the numbers of notes in circulation. The Cabinet were informed, that there was no singleexplanation of either of these movements. There had been a sub-stantial increase in National Savings in November. It was suggestedthat the Chancellor of the Exchequer might, at a suitable oppor-tunity, give some advice to the public on the best form of investment in National Savings.The Cabinet were informed that the railways had made a remarkable effort to expedite the turn round of wagons, and it wasagreed that the Prime Minister should make an appreciative public reference to this on some suitable occasion. There was also a marked improvement in the repair of wagons : the possibilities of usingprivate repair capacity were being fully explored.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of CP. (47) 309;(2) Invited the Lord President, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to review the plans for production publicity, in the light of points made in theCabinet&apos;s discussion;(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Lord President, the Foreign Secretary, and theMinister of Health, to consider whether publicity shouldbe given at home and in the foreign countries concerned to the high prices of primary food-stuffs;(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Minister of Defence, to consider whetherspecial machinery should be set up to ensure that over-seas expenditure by the Service Departments was kept in line with the Governmenfs general balance of paymentspolicy.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (47) 316) covering a copy of a note from the SovietGovernment to the Chinese Government on the subject of theJapanese peace settlement,The Foreign Secretary said that the Soviet Government had now proposed that a special session of the Council of foreign ministers should be held in China early in 1948 to prepare the peace settlement for Japan. He considered that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should adhere to the policy approved at the preliminary Com-commonwealth meeting at Canberra, where it had. been agreed that theJapanese peace treaty should be drawn up by a conference of the
main belligerent Powers. The Dominion Governments immediately concerned would greatly resent the adoption of any procedure whichexcluded them from participation in the preparation of the treaty.The Cabinet Reaffirmed the view that the preparation of the japanese peace treaty should be undertaken by a conference of themain belligerent Powers on the basis approved at the pre-liminary Commonwealth meeting at Canberra.Marriage of 4.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had. been con-H.R.H. the sidering what advice he should give to the Select Committee on the princess Civil List, which had been appointed to consider what furtherElizabeth. financial provision should be made for Her Royal Highness theCivil List Princess Elizabeth on the occasion of her marriage.

This would be sufficient to cover for seven years the increased provision of   15,000 a year for PrincessElizabeth.The Chancellor said that if the Cabinet endorsed these sug-suggestions he would commend them to the Select Committee.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the suggestions which theChancellor of the Exchequer proposed to make to the SelectCommittee on the financial provision to be made for HerRoyal Highness The Princess Elizabeth and His royal highness The Duke of Edinburgh.India. 5.
