Goal.Hours of Win theCoalminingIndustry.(previous reference:cm. (4:1 ) I 1!conclusions minute 2.)1. The Lord President said that the National Coal Board andork the National Union of Mineworkers had failed to reach agreement on the method of securing increased working hours in the coal mining industry during the economic emergency and, in pursuance of the cabinets decision of 17th August, he had arranged to discuss theposition with the Executive of the Union at a meeting on21st August. He had been accompanied at that meeting by thet Foreign Secretary, the Minister of Defence and the Minister of fuel and Power. &apos; The Union had rejected the proposal for iengthen-ing the working day by half an hour, and had proposed the alter-native of Saturday working. They were willing to agree that everypit should work a shift of 6  hours each Saturday during theemergency; but they were not prepared to accept the condition thatthe attendance bonus should be payable only to men who had worked,when required, six full shifts in the week. As an alternative to thatcondition, they had suggested that pit managers should have discre-tion to refuse to admit to Saturday work men who had absentedthemselves from work without due cause on any earlier day in theweek. Ministers had felt bound to reject that alternative, as itwas likely to lead to friction and possibly to stoppages of work.They were satisfied that, if recourse was to be had to Saturdayworking, full attendance could not be secured unless the conditions for payment of the attendance bonus were applied to the six-day week as they now applied to the five-day week. Thus, in spite ofprotracted discussion, the meeting on 21st August had broken up without any agreement being reached on the method of increasingworking hours during the emergency.The Lord President said that the Executive of the Union were still considering the position and, from information which he hadreceived, he thought it might be helpful if a letter were now sentto them stating that the Government still favoured the proposal of extending the working day by half an hour.The Minister Fuel and Power said that, although a substantial number of the members of the Executive of the Union might favour the proposal for an extra half-hour, he doubted whether thisreflected the balance of opinion in the coalfields. He doubted whether the miners would be willing either to work the extrahalf-hour or to agree to Saturday working on the basis proposedby the National Coal Board. The best hope of securing increased output lay, in his view, in persuading the miners to implement theagreements, already accepted by the Union, for increasing stints,removing restrictive practices, and reducing absenteeism.In discussion there was general agreement that, if recourse wasto be had to Saturday working, the Government must insist thatthe attendance bonus should be conditional on working the fullnumber of six shifts a week where required under the new arrange-ments. It was desirable that the Government should confirm theline taken on this point by the Ministers who had interviewed theNational Executive on 21st August.Further discussion turned on the question whether the Govern-ment should also express their preference for the alternative methodof preserving the five-day week and lengthening the daily shift toeight hours. It was recognised that in some pits no increase in output could be secured by working an extra half-hour a day; butthere were many pits where the extra half-hour would increase output, especially if agreement were reached on the lengthening ofthe stints. The balance of advantage seemed to lie on the side of pressing for the extra half-hour, on the understanding that this wassuggested as an emergency measure for the next nine months andwould not be continued thereafter without further consultation withthe Union.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power to send a letter tothe Secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers con-firming the views expressed by Ministers at the meeting with the Uniorts representatives on 21st August, and34238-4 B 2 &apos;
adding that, after reviewing the whole matter, the Govern-ment still adhered to the view that their original proposalfor adding an extra half-hour to the working day wouldbe the most effective method of increasing coal output during the present economic emergency.Balance ofPayments.(previous reference:CM. (47) 73rdConclusions.)general position.2. The Cabinet had before them memoranda (noted below) ona number of suggestions, which had been put forward at an informalmeeting of Ministers on 20th August, for further adjustments inthe national economy following the decision to limit the converti-bility of sterling.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the immediate effectof this decision had been less serious than had been feared; and none of the countries from which we drew substantial imports had so far proved intransigent. The latest figures of drawings on theUnited States Credit were $17 million on 21st August and821 million on 22nd August; and the estimated drawings forMonday, 25th August, were $54-5 million. The Mission to washington deserved great credit for the skill with which they hadhandled the negotiations and, in particular, for their success in persuading the United States Government to accept formal notifica-t-ion of our intention to draw a further Si50 million on 29th August.This would leave $400 million of the Credit on which, in accordancewith our promise in the exchange of letters with the Secretary ofthe United States Treasury, no further drawings would be madepending further consultation between the two Governments.The position regarding Canada and the Argentine was atpresent uncertain; discussions had been opened with the canadian government with the object of securing their agreement to ourdrawing on the residue of the Canadian Credit at a greater rate than hitherto, but he had not yet had a report on the canadian government&apos;s attitude.&apos; First reports from the Argentine were notunhopeful; it seemed likely that that Government would be readyto continue supplies of meat and would not propose any variation in the terms of the Railway Transfer Agreement. As regards the sterling area, all the Governments concerned had been pressed toreduce their dollar claims to a minimum, and it seemed likely that their response would be satisfactory. Representatives ofAustralia and India were due to visit London in September for theannual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and Bank; andhe proposed that New Zealand and Eire should be invited to send representatives to London at the same time. There would be noobjection to making public the intention to hold such discussionsonce the necessary arrangements had been made. In addition, therewould be opportunity in September for discussions in London withthe Secretary of the United States Treasury. In general, he hoped the Cabinet would agree that the Government should take a strongline in resisting attempts by countries other than United Statesdollar countries to obtain payment in dollars in respect of imports to this country.The Cabinet were in general agreement with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer on this point, and wdth his suggestion that the NewZealand and Eire Governments should be invited to send represen-tatives to London for discussions in September.The Chancellor of the Exchequer then handed round copies ofa note summarising the effect on our balance of payments of thevarious measures authorised or proposed. This showed that the monthly savings which would be secured by the decisions announced by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons on 6th august and by the further proposals contained in the various memorandanow under consideration by the Cabinet would amount to 26^ million. As regards trade with the American continent,however, it was estimated that between mid-1947 and mid-1948 the deficit between  imports  and  exports  would  be  approximately
ExportPolicy.(previous reference:CM. (47) 67thConclusions,Minute 2.)PoodConsumption.(previous reference:CM. (47)67thConclusions,Minute 2.) 600 million. Under the conditions existing up to 20th Augustthat deficit would have been wholly in dollars; and until negotiations had taken place with the Governments of Canada, the argentine and other South American countries it was impossible to say whetheror to what extent we should persuade these countries to sell us goodsin future for sterling. The nearer we could get to attaining a balance of payments, the greater the likelihood that countries would accept sterling.The Cabinet then discussed future export policy.The President of the Board of Trade said that a review of theexport programme of each industry had recently been completed;this had shown that exports should reach by the middle of 1948 a level of 140 per cent, of the 1938 figure. In view of recent develop-ments, however, he was considering the possibility of expeditingthis programme with a view to reaching the target of 140 per cent,by the end of 1947. He hoped it would be possible to submit a reporton this question to the Cabinet in about a fortnight. He proposedto set up a committee, under the chairmanship of the Secretary for overseas Trade, to keep the export programme continually underreview; and he also had in mind the. appointment of a chief executive with general responsibility for the carrying out of theexport programme. It should not, however, be overlooked that, inorder to achieve the agreed export targets, substantial reductions would have to be made in domestic investment projects and in theprovision of consumer goods for the home market. As against this,an increase of exports to 160 per cent, of the 1938 figure would mean that the gap between our imports and exports had been bridged.The Minister of Health said that there would be general agree-ment about the need to diminish our dependence on the UnitedStates. He thought, however, that it would be inadvisable to adoptequally drastic measures in an attempt to secure a balance of pay-ments with the non-dollar countries. Our object must be to expandour trade with them to the maximum extent possible, and the appli-cation to them of measures suitable for the United States would havethe opposite effect. In these circumstances considerable risks shouldbe taken to revive trade, even if this involved acquiescence in an adverse balance of trade for a year or two. Great attention wouldhave to be paid to the most effective direction of exports. He wouldnot oppose such reductions in the domestic capital investment programme as might be shown to be necessary and effective; but these should be presented to the public, not merely as negative cuts, butas a redeployment of the nation&apos;s productive effort rendered necessary by the present economic situation.The Minister of Fuel and Povjer said that this country couldnot avoid a continuing dependence on the United States. Hethought it would be a mistake to try to secure an immediate expan-sion of exports at the expense of the much-needed capital re-equip-ment of this country. At any rate, the Cabinet should have anopportunity to consider the implications of such a diversion before final decisions were taken.The Prime Minister said that in all recent public statementsthe Government had emphasised the fact that our financial difficul-ties must be met partly by increasing exports, partly by reducingimports and partly by the increased production of food and other products which would otherwise have to be imported from hard-currency areas. It was necessary to maintain a proper balance between these three aspects of the Governments policy.The Cabinet then considered a note by the Secretary of theCabinet (CP. (47) 234) covering an exchange of minutes betweenthe Prime Minister and the Minister of Food on cuts in food con-sumption, and a memorandum by the Minister of Food (CP. (47)&apos;239) on the considerations which should govern changes in basicfood rations.
The Minister of Food said that in CP. (47) 239 he had made certain proposals for reducing food consumption, in addition to thereduction in the monthly allotment of points from 32 to 28 whichhad already been made.   His proposals were as follows : (i) A reduction should be made in the supplies of the principalrationed foods to commercial catering establishments;(ii) The period during which a guest might, stay at an hotelwithout surrendering his ration book should be reduced from fournights to one;(iii) The meat ration should be reduced from 14th Sepemberfrom Is. 2d. to Is.;(iv) The tea ration should be maintained at the present reducedlevel of 2 oz. a week; and(v) The importation of certain luxury foods should be prohibited.He also suggested that the gravity of the economic situation might be effectively brought home to the public by an increase inthe price of certain heavily subsidised rationed foods. Thus, anincrease of 2d. a pound in the price of tea and sugar would save 23 million and would to that extent relieve the inflationary pressure on other commodities. As regards the future, preparations were in hand against the contingency of further serious cuts in ourbasic rations. Consultations had been held with the Trades UnionCongress Rationing Committee with a view to working out an acceptable system of differential rationing. He had been advised by two nutritional authorities that, if further reductions in the basic rations became necessary, it would be necessary to bring bread rationing to an end. He would submit recommendations to theCabinet on this point in September.In discussion, the following points were made : (a) The Minister of Food undertook to consider re-imposingthe price control on game;(&amp;) It was the general view of Ministers that the period forwhich guests might stay in hotels without surrendering ration booksshould be reduced to two nights rather than one;(c) The Prime Minister suggested that a limit should be placed&apos;on the numbers of guests at public luncheons and dinners;(d) The Minister of Food said that he had proposed that theexisting scale of allowances for catering establishments should bereduced by (i) a cut of 20 per cent, in all rationed and points goodsexcept bread and cooking fats; or (ii) a cut of 25 per cent, in the meat, bacon, ham, cheese and points foods. These proposals hadbeen strongly resisted by the catering trade, but there seemed some prospect that agreement might be reached on reductions of 15 percent: and 17^ per cent, in place of the percentages he had originally proposed. He thought it might be advisable to decide on reductions which would be accepted by the trade. In addition, he suggestedthat the cheap catering establishments (i.e., those which did notcharge more than 2,?. 3d. for any meal) should be exemptedaltogether; for the imposition of the proposed reductions on these establishments would affect many workers who had no canteenfacilities.The Cabinet endorsed these proposals.(e) It was considered that the proposed reduction in the meat ration should take effect earlier than 14th September, e.g., ifpossible, from 1st September.(/) The Minister of Food said that he was consulting theChancellor of the Exchequer about the prohibition of the import ofcertain luxury foods. An important saving could be achieved bythe reduction of imports of French wines, and he would consult theForeign Secretary also on this point.
135ForeignTravelAllowances.(previous reference:C.M.(47)69thConclusions,Minute 2.)(g) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he accepted theviews of the Minister of Food on the need for increasing the priceof certain subsidised rationed food-stuffs. He thought it wouldbe better tactics to make gradual reductions from time to time ratherthan to attempt any spectacular cut in food subsidies.The Foreign Secretary thought that, in addition to the sugges-tions made by the Minister of Food, the price of bread should beincreased to IQd.The Minister of Health said that the gradual reduction of food subsidies on the lines suggested by the Chancellor of the exchequer would expose the Government to the criticism of reducing thestandard of life of the workers without any compensatory socialprogramme. The Minister of Fuel and Power was also opposedto the reduction of food subsidies on the ground that these would throw an excessive burden on the poorer element of the community.The Minister of Labour suggested that any such reductions should be linked to the abolition of bread rationing.(h) Ministers hoped that it might prove possible to abolishbread rationing in the near future.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals made by the Minister of Food in cp. (47) 239 for reducing food consumption, subject tothe modifications noted in paragraphs (&amp;), (d) and (e)above and to the additions noted in paragraphs (a) and(c) above;(2) Agreed in principle that the price of some subsidised food-stuffs should be increased, and invited the Chancellorof the Exchequer, in consultation with the Minister ofFood, to submit detailed recommendations.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that on 5th August(CM. (47) 69th Conclusions, Minute 2 (5)) the Cabinet had agreedthat as from 1st October, 1947, foreign travel allowances should bereduced from  75 for 12 months to  35 for 14 months, and thatthe proportionate allowance for a child should be reduced to  20.In view of subsequent developments in the financial situation, hethought that more drastic reductions should now be imposed. he therefore proposed that, the approved reduction should take effect atonce, and that from 1st October, 1947, no foreign exchange shouldbe made available for pleasure travel abroad. In addition, he proposed that the authority of the commercial banks to approveexchange applications on behalf of business men should at once bedrastically limited. His proposals, which were set out in CP. (47)238, would result in a saving of about  30 million a year.In discussion the following points were made : (a) The Lord President suggested that travel agencies wouldbe seriously affected by these proposals and should be encouraged to concern themselves with arrangements for holidays in the UnitedKingdom, particularly for foreign visitors.(b) The Prime Minister suggested that any public announce-ment on this subject should discourage avoidable travel abroad forpleasure purposes even before the ban became effective on1st October.(/-&apos;) The Cabinet thought that visits abroad by Members ofParliament should also be reduced as far as possible.The Cabinet  .(3) Approved the proposals made by the Chancellor of theExchequer in CP. (47) 238 for the reduction of foreigntravel allowances.
Petrol.(previous reference erence:CM. (47) 69thConclusions,Minute 2.)Prices of gas and electricity.agricultural machinery.(previous reference:CM. (47) 67thConclusions,Minute 2.)  . ^^/i ......1u1 ujgciiThe Cabinet next discussed a memorandum by the Minister of fuel and Power (CP. (47) 235) examining the implications of thesuggestion that the basic petrol ration should be abolished from30th September, 1947.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the main argumentsnst this proposal were summarised in his memorandum.The abolition of the basic petrol ration would give rise to some political and administrative difficulties; but it would save about 5 million in dollars, and if his colleagues thought that in ourpresent economic situation this consideration was decisive he was ready to agree that the basic ration should be abolished.The Minister of Transport said that the abolition of the basicpetrol ration would increase the strain on public transport; but inpresent circumstances he was not prepared to object to the proposal on that account.The Cabinet were informed that there would be a consequentialdrop in the demand for new cars for the home market; but thisshould not create unemployment in the motor industry since for thepresent there should be no difficulty in increasing the export of cars.Later on, surplus capacity might be used for the manufacture ofagricultural machinery.The Cabinet-(4) Agreed that the basic petrol ration should be abolished from30th September, 1947.The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of fuel and Power (CP. (47) 240) on the suggestion that an immediate increase should be made in the prices of gas and electricity, in orderto reflect the forthcoming increase in coal prices and to check con-sumption during the coming winter.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that, although theincreased price of coal would necessitate some increases in gas prices,it would not be possible to assess the scale of these until theapplica-tions of the various gas undertakings had been considered. Asregards electricity, there would be no grounds for any general increase in price; but he was proposing to consider whether restric-tions should be imposed on the use of the two-part tariff.The Cabinet (5) Agreed that there should be no immediate announcement ofan increase in the prices of gas and electricity.The Cabinet next considered a memorandum by the Ministry ofAgriculture (CP.. (47) 241) on the possibility of expanding theproduction of agricultural machinery for the home market and forexport. This stated that there could be a substantial increase inthe manufacture of agricultural machinery, if larger allocations ofsteel could be made for this purpose and if agricultural machinerycould be added to the list of products for which over-riding prioritywas to be given under the Prime Minister&apos;s directive (CP. (47) 92(Revise)).The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet could not properlydecide that the amounts of steel specified in paragraph 4 of cp. (47) 241 should be allocated for the production of agricultural machinery before knowing what effect such a decision would have on other important programmes. Nor would ib be expedient that over-riding priority should be given for agricultural machinery, asproposed in- paragraph 5 of CP. (47) 241; for further additions tothe short list of projects contained in CP. (47) 92 (Revise) woulddefeat the objects of that list. The proposals put forward in cp. (47) 241 should be considered in the first instance by the materials Committee.
In discussion questions were raised about the efficacy of theexisting system.of allocating steel. The Cabinet were informed that,owing to the drop in steel production on account of the fuel crisisduring the past winter, the total amount of the authorities issued for the acquisition of steel exceeded the supplies of steel now available; and it had become necessary to overhaul the w-hole ofthe existing system for authorising manufacturers to acquire steel.This review had been put in hand by the Ministry of Supply.It was also suggested in the discussion that manufacturers weresometimes able to obtain steel without proper authority; and it wasagreed that Ministers who obtained any evidence in support ofthis suggestion should communicate it to the Minister of Supply.The Cabinet were informed that, for the forthcoming allocationperiod, an additional amount of 200,000 tons of steel was availablefor allocation. It was important that this extra quantity shouldbe allocated to purposes, such as the production of agricultural machinery, which would be of special value in redressing our adverse balance of payments.The Cabinet 1(6) Invited the Chairman of the Materials Committee toconsider what could be done to meet the essential steelrequirements of the expanded programme for agricul-tural machinery outlined in CP. (47) 241; and asked that a further report should be made to the Cabinet ifthe essential needs of this programme could not be met without serious interference with other importantprogrammes.(7) Agreed that, in allocating the additional quantities of steelavailable for the next allocation period, the Chairmanof the Materials Committee should pay special attentionto projects which would help to redress our adverse balance of payments;(8) Asked the Lord President to consult with the Minister ofSupply and the Chairman of the Materials Committeeon the adjustments required in the existing machineryfor allocating steel.Expansion The Cabinet next considered a memorandum by the Parliamen-of Colonial      tary Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies&apos; (CP. (47) 242)Production.      regarding the possibilities of increased production of dollar-earningcommodities in the Colonies.The Parliamentary Under-Seeretary of State for the colonies said that before the war the Colonies in general had a largefavourable balance with dollar countries which they spent mainly inthe sterling area. The only important commodity of which increased supplies could be rapidly made available for sale to the UnitedStates was rubber. United States imports of rubber were beingartificially restricted by the Government regulation requiring that50 per cent, of the rubber used by American manufacturers shouldbe synthetic rubber. If this requirement could be removed, therewas a prospect of substantial additional dollar earnings.Increased supplies of certain other commodities could be sold to the United States if United Kingdom purchases were restricted.Of these, the most important was cocoa. There were longer-termpossibilities in the expansion of Colonial output of tin, rubber, lead and other minerals. Progress was, however, in some cases held upby the lack of necessary capital equipment; for instance, the malayan tin industry was seriously *short of dredgers, and thedevelopment of the lead deposits in Tanganyika was dependent uponthe supply of railway track. 100,000 tons of ground nuts were held up at Kano awaiting the supply of locomotives to the NigerianRailways.
Points in discussion were:--(a) The President of the Board of Trade said that the UnitedStates Government had now agreed to reduce to 33^ per cent, the compulsory proportion of synthetic rubber to be used by Americanmanufacturers. Unfortunately, this coincided with a recession inthe demand for tyres in the United States, so that it might not result in additional imports.(&amp;) The Minister of Food deprecatedthe suggestion that a proportion of the cocoa supplies for the United Kingdom shouldbe diverted to the United States in view of the recent reduction inthe tea ration.(c) The Prime Minister said that immediate steps should betaken to ascertain whether the railway equipment required for thedevelopment of Colonial primary products could be made available from surplus War Department stock.(d) The Prime Minister undertook to consider whether a singleindividual should not be appointed with full powers to enquire into stocks of surplus stores held by the Ministry of Supply andthe Service Departments and to make recommepdations regarding their disposal.The Cabinet-(9) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider whether anyfurther approach should be made to the United StatesGovernment with a view to inducing them to increase their imports of natural rubber, whether for current con-sumption or for stock-piling.(10) Asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Minister of Food and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, to consider the possi-bility of diverting to the United States some proportionof our existing imports of cocoa from colonial territories.(11) Asked the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State forthe Colonies to consider whether a foreign firm, e.g.,from Belgium, could not be invited to accept a contract for building the railway required to exploit the Tanganyika lead deposits.The Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary (CP. (47) 236)embodying the comments of the Ministry of Health on certain sug-suggestions for adjustments in the Government housing programme.The Minister of Health said that, after the parlimentary debates on the economic situation, he had cancelled existing licences for the building of houses for sale. He had also arranged that theapproval of tenders for the erection of houses by local authoritiesshould be restricted for the time being to rural and mining areas.He had recently suggested to the Minister of Works that steps shouldbe taken to prevent the establishment of new firms of builders. these measures would suffice to hold the position until the comprehensive review of the housing programme could be completed. It was his intention that, without dishonouring existing contracts, the pro-gramme should be allowed to run down to a maximum figure of200,000 houses a year. He hoped, however, that when a revised programme had been authorised, as a result of the review now being held, the Government would adhere to that programme for a sub-stantial period. Meanwhile, he would deprecate any furtherannouncement about the housing programme.The Cabinet-(12) Agreed that no further announcement need be made aboutthe Government housing programme until Ministers had
national and LocalGovernmentStaffs.(previous reference:C.M.(47)49thConclusions,Minute 5.)DepartmentalMachinery.(previous reference:CM. (47) 71stConclusions,Minute 1.)decided what adjustments must be made in that pro-gramme as a result of the review which was being madeof the investment programme as a whole.The Cabinet next discussed a memorandum by the Lord Presi-dent (CP. (47) 237) containing various suggestions for adjustment of machinery and methods in economic matters.The Lord President suggested that the Ministerial Committeeon Civil Service Man-Power should again consider, in the light ofour current economic situation, whether further reductions couldnot be made in Civil Service staffs; and that the Minister of health and the Secretary of State for Scotland should thereafter press fora corresponding reduction in local government staffs. The Com-mittee should invite Ministers to reconsider, in the light of thepresent emergency, the possibility of reducing staffs through cur-tailing or postponing projects to which they had hitherto feltcommitted by pledges previously given.The Cabinet-(13) Asked the Prime Minister to arrange for the ministerial committee on Civil Service Man-Power to be recon-intervened, with extended terms of reference, for the pur-pose of conducting a further review of Civil Servicestaffs on the basis proposed in paragraph 2 of cp. (47) 237: and to invite the Minister of Health andthe Secretary of State for Scotland to press for a corres-ponding reduction in local government staffs.After considering paragraph 3 of CP. (47) 237, the Cabinet (14) Invited Ministers in charge of Departments concerned witheconomic affairs to satisfy themselves that effective machinery was available in their Departments for theexecutive action required, in conjunction with theCentral Economic Planning Staff and the industries con-cerned, in such matters as progressing deliveries, &amp;c.International The Lord President suggested that a further effort should nowMeetings. be made to restrict international conferences to matters essentialto world security and economic rehabilitation. He also suggestedthat the delegations sent from the united Kingdom to such inter-national conferences as continued to be held might be substantially reduced.There was general agreement that the first of these proposals should be reviewed by the Official Steering Committee on Inter-national Organisations. As regards the second, while the size ofour delegations might be reduced, Ivlinisters were not prepared to commit themselves to the 50 per cent, reduction suggested in theLord Presidents paper.The Cabinet (15) Instructed the Official Steering Committee on Inter-national Organisations to submit, through the foreign secretary, a report on the possibility of securing the postponement of the less essential internationalmeetings, on the lines suggested in paragraph 4 (a)and (b) of CP. (47) 237; and on the possibility of limiting the size of the delegations sent from the United King-dom to such international conferences as continued tobe held, and on the procedure to be adopted for thatpurpose.
After discussing paragraph 5 of CP. (47) 237 the Cabinet-(16) Took note that the Lord President would discuss with theChairman of the Materials Committee whether anyadjustments were required in the existing machineryfor the allocation of raw materials.In paragraph 6 of CP. (47) 237 the Lord President suggestedthat discussions with the two sides of industry on the preparationof all administrative schemes should in future be initiated by the planning Board and thereafter be submitted for ratification, where necessary, by the National Joint Advisory Council and the national production Advisory Council for Industry.The Cabinet-(17) Invited the Lord President to discuss this suggestion withthe President of the Board of Trade and the Minister ofLabour.The Lord President thought it important that the closest linkshould be maintained between the Treasury and the Chief PlanningOfficer, in order to ensure that the requirements of planning were taken fully into account in the formulation of advice to the Chan-cellor of the Exchequer on fiscal policy.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he shared the lord presidents views on this point and had already taken steps toimprove the liaison between the Treasury and the Central economic planning Staff.The Lord President suggested, that the Minister of labour should reconsider the existing arrangements for the central reviewof the distribution of man-power.In discussion it was pointed out that this was a function ofthe Ministerial Man-Power Committee, of which the Minister ofLabour was now Chairman.The Minister of Labour undertook to consider and report tothe Prime Minister whether any adjustments were required in the composition and terms of reference of the Man-Power Committee.After discussing paragraph 10 of CP. (47) 237, the Cabinet (18) Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to consider whether any further machinery was required to ensure that thearrangements for following up and progressing decisions by Ministers were adequate to the needs of the present emergency.The Lord President said that there were indications that the planning Board would have wished to be consulted about some of the short-term measures which the Government were proposing to take to meet the current economic emergency. He thought it would be expedient that, wherever practicable, the Planning Board should atleast be informed of important measures which the Governmentwere proposing to take in economic matters. He recognised thatthere were certain types of proposal, e.g., impending cuts in foodrations, of which it would not be practicable to inform the board in advance. He would, however, be glad if he could have a measureof discretion in deciding on what matters the Board should beinformed.The Cabinet-(19) Authorised the Lord President to keep the Planning Boardinformed of the measures which the Government were proposing to take to meet the economic emergency, subjectto the need for maintaining special secrecy on certain ofthese proposals (e.g., impending cuts in rations) untilpublic announcements had been made.
standardisation-tion in theMotorIndustry.Publicity forCab met&apos;decisions.(previous reference:CM.
