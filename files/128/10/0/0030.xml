Parliament. 1.   The Lord President recalled that Mr. Arthur GreenwoodDeputy Leader had hitherto acted as Leader of the House of Commons on occasionsof House of      when he was himself unable to be present.   In view of Mr. Green-Commons.       wood&apos;s resignation from the Government, another Minister must now be nominated as Deputy Leader of the House.   The PrimeMinister had agreed that the Home Secretary should undertake this duty.The Cabinet took note of this statement.Budget. 2.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the inflationary(Previous       pressure would inevitably be increased by the steps which were nowReference:      being taken to reduce imports and increase exports, and he was satis-C.M.

To avoid encroachingMinute l.)      unduly on the Parliamentary time available for other legislation, he undertook that this Finance Bill should be as short as possible andshould not include any routine or supplementary provisions whichcould be left over for enactment in the normal Finance Bill in the spring.   He would inform his colleagues at a later stage of the detailed measures which he proposed to introduce in this furtherFinance Bill.   At present, he only asked the Cabinet to agree thatsuch a Bill should be introduced and thatto make an early  announcement to that effect.should be authorised the Cabinet-Took note that a further Finance Bill would, be introduced in the autumn and authorised the Chancellor of theExchequer to make an early  announcement to that effect.Iraq. 3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ForeignAnglo-Iraqi Secretary (CP. (47) 277) recommending that further informal andTreaty of secret talks should be held with the Regent and Government of IraqAlliance with a view to the revision of the Anglo-Iraqi Treatv of Allianceof 1930.There was general agreement that discussions with a view tothe revision of the Treaty should be continued on the basis described in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s memorandum.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he presumed thatany new financial points which might emerge in the&quot; course cf thediscussions would be taken up with the Treasury. The foreign secretary said that this would be kept in mind.The Cabinet Agreed that informal conversations with a view to the revision of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty should be continued on the basis indicated in CP. (47) 277.InternationalMeetings.(previous reference:CM. (47) 74thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (47) 271), covering a report by the Official steering committee on International Organisations on the possibility ofsecuring the postponement of less essential international meetings,and of limiting the size of United Kingdom delegations to such meetings. This report had been prepared in accordance with theCabinet&apos;s decision of 25th August.The Foreign Secretary said that he was in agreement with theCommittee&apos;s recommendations. It would, however, be a mistake toadopt too rigid an attitude towards this question, and he thought the Committee&apos;s report should be regarded as providing general34393providing geneguidance for Departments rather than as laving down hardfast rules.b 2illd
The Lord President regretted that the Committee had not found it possible to make more drastic proposals for limiting the numberof international meetings; for instance, he thought that the numberof meetings to be convened by the United Nations Educational,Scientific and Cultural Organisation was excessive. He hoped that every effort would be made to postpone all but the essential meetings and that the size of the United Kingdom delegations would in future be drastically reduced.The general view of the Cabinet was that no precise rulescould be laid down on this question. It was, however, undesirable that in present conditions international meetings should be undulymultiplied. It was also important, as regards both finance andman-power, that the size of the United Kingdom delegations tosuch meetings should be subject to careful scrutiny. On the otherhand, the United Kingdom had gained great prestige and securedimportant objectives as a result of the policy of sending strong and well-informed delegations to international conferences, and itwould be false economy unduly to weaken such delegations in thefuture. These considerations should be carefully balanced whendetermining the composition of a particular delegation, but theTreasury should check any tendency to send unduly largedelegations.The Cabinet (1) Approved the recommendations in CP. (47) 271 for the postponement of less essential international meetings andfor limiting the size of United Kingdom delegations tosuch meetings;(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for theTreasury to watch for any tendency to send unduly largedelegations to international meetings.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Presi-dent of the Board of Trade (CP. (47) 278), discussing certain pro-posals made by the head of the United States delegation at Genevafor further concessions in respect of the preferences enjoyed by theUnited Kingdom in Commonwealth markets.The President of the Board of Trade recalled that the cabinet had decided on 25th September to refuse any further concessionswith regard to the elimination of preferences unless the scope ofthe United Stater, offers were widened. Mr. Clayton&apos;s deputy in geneva had now put forward informally certain proposals for additional concessions on both sides which would, in his view, enablethe negotiations to be successfully concluded. His suggestion wasthat we should agree to the elimination of certain comparativelyunimportant preferences at present provided by Canada and India;that the margin of preference enjoyed by the United Kingdom inthe Colonies should be reduced by a quarter; and. that the existingUnited Kingdom preference of Is. Q\d. per pound for tobacco from southern Rhodesia should be progressively reduced to Is. if andwhen the pre-budget rates of tobacco duty in this country wererestored. In return, the United States Administration would endeavour to meet the United Kingdom request for a modificationof the statutory requirements governing the&quot;use of synthetic rubberin domestic manufacture. The President said that he had now con-suited the Ministers immediately concerned regarding these pro-posals, and they were disposed to think that the prospect of securingimmediate and substantial additional dollar earnings from rubberexports to the United States constituted a strong argument for acceptance. They did not, however, consider that it would be justifiable to agree to the proposed reduction in the margin ofpreference which we enjoyed in Colonial markets, and this wouldhave to be made clear to the United States Government. On theother hand, he was now satisfied that the objections to the proposalTradeNegotiations.United StatesRequests onPreferences.(previous reference:CM. (47) 77thConclusions,Minute 1.)
economic recovery ofEurope:United states assistance.(previous reference:CM. (47) 76thConclusions,Minute 5.)6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister for economic Affairs (CP. (47) 279) covering notes prepared for the guidance of Sir Oliver Franks in connection with his discussions in Washington on the report of the Committee on european economic Co-operation.The Minister for Economic A ffairs said that, while the main purpose of Sir Oliver Franks&apos;s visit to Washington was to assistthe United States Government in their study of the report, it mustbe expected that he would be pressed to give some indication of theviews of His Majesty&apos;s Government on the question whether theUnited Kingdom required aid from the United States under the marshall plan and, if so, at what date and in what form. The notesattached to CP. (47) 279 had been prepared by he London Com-mittee on European Economic Co-operation, and he had made certainadditions with a view to strengthening the case.The Cabinet Agreed that the memorandum attached to CP. (47) 279,with the additions proposed by the Minister for economic affairs, should be communicated to Sir Oliver Franks forhis guidance in the forthcoming discussions in Washing-ton on the report of the Committee on European economic co-operation.Food and Kaw 7.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Prime MinisterMaterials, (CP. (47) 258) covering memoranda which, in pursuance of theGovernment  - Gabinefs decision on 19th August, he had received from the Presi-Bulk dent of the Board of Trade and the Minister of Food on the sugges-Pm-chase. tion that a larger proportion of food supplies and raw materials(Previous might now be bought through the normal channels of trade ratherReference: than by Government bulk purchase.C.M.(47)72nd The Minister of Food said that, when world economic conditionsConclusions, were normal, the extent to which it would be advantageous for usMinute 3.) to buy our overseas supplies by Government bulk purchase wouldbe a matter for argument.  In present circumstances, however, whenfor the reduction in the preference on Southern Rhodesian tobaccocould be adequately met by the negotiation of a long-term agree-ment for the purchase of future supplies. The United StatesGovernment would, of course, be informed of our intention tonegotiate such a contract, but there was no reason to suppose thatthey would raise objection to it. It would be necessary to providefor the possibility that, after we had made the concessions proposed,the United States concession on rubber might fail to materialise.As regards procedure, it was proposed that His Majesty&apos;s Ambas-ambassador in Washington should be instructed to inform the UnitedStates Secretary of State of the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment towards these proposals. Dominion Governments would beinformed in advance.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the proposals put forward informally by thehead of the United States delegation at Geneva, as setout in CP. (47) 278, could be accepted, with the excep-tion that no concession should be made as regards thereduction of the margin of preference enjoyed by theUnited Kingdom in Colonial markets;(2) Invited the Foreign^ Secretary to instruct His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Washington to inform the United states secretary of State accordingly;(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations to inform the Dominion Governments concerned inadvance of the communication which was to be madeto the United States Government.
there were acute shortages of supplies and strict control had to bemaintained over the volume and sources of our imports, a wide useof Government bulk purchase was inevitable, in recent weeks hehad been compelled to extend this method of buying to commodities which he had previously been able to leave to the free market. Inthe current economic situation it would be impracticable to reducethe area over which supplies were secured by Government bulk ipurchase.The Minister for Economic Affairs and The President of theBoard of Trade said that the same considerations applied to thepurchase of raw materials.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of the memoranda annexed to cp. (47) 258.Food.Bacon Ration.(previous reference:CM. (47) 74thConclusions,Minute 2.)8. The Minister of Food said that exports of bacon to theUnited Kingdom had been interrupted by a strike in Canadianbacon factories and it-would be necessary to reduce the bacon rationfrom 2 oz. a week to 2 oz. a fortnight from 19th October. Thedistribution of bacon could be maintained on this scale until themiddle of December, by which time it was hoped that the strike would have been settled.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Food to announce that the bacon ration would be reduced to 2 oz. a fortnight from19th October, making it clear that the reduction was dueto the interruption of supplies caused by a strike inCanada-allocation of Resources.(previous reference:CM. (47) 74thConclusions,Minute 2.)9. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (CP. (47) 273) proposing that the existing system of priorities, based on the directive contained in CP. (47) 92 (Revise),should be reviewed in the light of the new food production and export programmes and of any decisions taken by the Cabinet withregard to the investment programme. The memorandum suggestedthat, meanwhile, allocating authorities for labour, materials andother essential supplies should go as far as practicable to meet thenecessary requirements of agriculture and exports, and raised thequestion whether a public announcement should be made to this effect.The Minister for Economic Affairs said that a review of thepresent arrangements was clearly necessary and could be completed within a very short time. If priorities were granted on a wide scalethey lost their value and a solution of the problem should be sought by improving the machinery for allocation, restricting priority to afew particular items of special importance and making betterarrangements for progressing.The Minister of Fuel and Power supported the proposal madeby the Minister for Economic Affairs. He urged that no announce-ment should be ma.de until the results of the proposed review wereavailable.The Minister of agriculture and Fisheries said that the omission-sion of agricultural requirements from CP. (47) 92 (Eevise) wasfrustrating his efforts to secure the approved expansion of homefood production. While he would not press for an announcementpending the results of the proposed review, it was important thatan announcement clearing up the position should be made at a very early date.
Prize Money. 10.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the FirstLord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State for Air (CP. (47)216), seeking authority to introduce legislation to implement thedecision to grant prize money in respect of the proceeds of sale of enemy merchant ships and cargoes captured in the 1939-45 war.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that a decision to grantprize money had been taken in principle and announced in 1945.This decision could not be implemented without legislation, and he hoped that a Prize Bill on the lines of the Annex to CP. (47) 216could be included in the 1947-48 Legislative Programme. The shareof the Royal Air Force in the prize money would be used for thebenefit of Air Force Charities or Air Force Welfare, but the shareof the Navy would be distributed to individuals. The DominionGovernments and Colonial sailors and airmen would participate.The following points were made in discussion :  (a) It should be made clear in the Bill that the distribution ofprize money would be abolished for the future.(6) The amount of Droits of the Crown should be settled byagreement with Dominion Governments and the Departmentsconcerned, and should not be left to be determined by theChancellor of the Exchequer.(c) The question whether the Bill could be included in the1947-48 Legislative Programme would have to be considered whenthe Programme as a whole was reviewed.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in CP. (47) 216, subject to thepoints noted in paragraphs (a) to (c) above.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,9th October, 1947.Other points in discussion were : (a) The Minister of Supply said that it would not be prac-ticable to extend to the wide range of products included in theexport programme the special priority given by CP. (47) 92 (Revise).(b) The Minister of Works said that the rural housing pro-gramme and the production of concrete sleepers were being held upbecause under the existing directive steel could not be obtained forthese purposes.(c) The Minister of Health suggested that a solution should besought through better arrangements for progressing and direct government purchase where suppliers were failing to implementapproved allocations.(d) The Minister of Transport said that he hoped that theproblem of matching allocations by deliveries would be included inthe review.It was explained that the failure to secure deliveries was partly due to over-authorisations by Departments and that, so far as con-cerned steel, this difficulty would be met by the new scheme for controlling the issue of steel approved by the Cabinet on 2nd October (CM. (47) 78th Conclusions, Minute 5).(e) The Minister of Labour pointed out that, whatever decision might be reached with regard to materials and other essential supplies, it would still be necessary to apply a system of priorities in the supply of labour.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister for Economic Affairs to arrange forthe present system of priorities to be reviewed as a matterof urgency in the light of the discussion; and agreed that,pending the results of this review, no change should bemade in the existing arrangements.
