1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons before the Adjournment for the summer recess.On 7th August the Prime Minister would propose a Motion of thanks to the Civil and Military Services of the Crown in India;the debate on the State of the Nation would be continued, and theproceedings on the Consolidated Fund (Appropriation) Bill wouldbe completed. The Procedure Motion on the Supplies and Services(Transitional Powers) Bill would also be taken.On 8th August the Second Reading of the Supplies and Services(Transitional Powers) Bill would be taken.On 11th August it was proposed to take the Committee and remaining Stages of the Su/pplies and Services (transitional powers) Bill, and any Lords&apos; amendments to Bills that might bereceived.On 12th August the House would consider what action shouldbe taken on the findings of the Committee of Privileges in regard tothe editor and the political correspondent of the Evening News, whohad refused to divulge the name of the Member to whom that paper had made a weekly payment in return for political and industrialinformation. There would also be a debate on Palestine; and any outstanding Lords&apos; amendments to Bills would be taken.On 13th August Questions would be taken at 11 a.m.; airy out-standing Lords&apos; amendments to Bills would be considered; and theHouse would adjourn for the Summer Recess until 20th October.2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in his speech inthe Parliamentary debate later in the day he would have to deal withthe question of the size of the Armed Forces. The statement madeby the Prime Minister on the previous day that the numbers in the armed Forces would be reduced to 1,007,000 by 31st March, 1948,had given rise to some dissatisfaction, and he thought it would bedesirable to supplement it by indicating that, though releases couldnot be further accelerated in the period up to 31st March. 1948, itmight be possible to reduce the total size of the Forces by some measure of deferment of call-up.In discussion it was pointed out that the enquiries so far madesuggested that any acceptable scheme of deferment was not likelyto yield a reduction in the total size of the Armed Forces-of muchmore than 10,000 by 31st March, 1948, wdiereas those who hadcriticised the Prime Ministers announcement were looking for areduction of the order of 100,000. Moreover, any suggestion that theGovernment were considering the deferment on an extensive scale ofmen due for call-up would have a bad effect on men already serving in the Forces and undermine the whole scheme of compulsory national service. For these reasons, it would be better to say nothingabout the possibilities of a scheme of deferment; nor should any reference be made to releases under the age and length of serviceplan. The Chancellor of the Exchequer might, however, give separately -ately the numbers in each of the three Services at 31st March, 1948,in order to dispel the belief that the great majority were in theArmy. He should also make it plain that the problem of securing a reduction in the size of the Armed Forces had been faced long before the present critical situation had developed ; that the Govermments efforts to secure reductions in the current financial year wereby no means ended, and that whatever further economies could beachieved would at once be put into effect. No estimates of the size of the Forces at the end of 1948 should be given, since these were bound to be affected by the current enquiry into the peacetime shape and size of the Armed Forces.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that in the Parliamentary debate later in the day the Chancellor of the Exchequer should deal with thequestion of the size of the Armed Forces on the lines indicated in discussion.[34134-3] B 2Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.Balance ofPayments.(previous reference erence:CM. (47) 69thConclusions,Minute 2.)
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it had been sud--gested by certain Government supporters that an autumn Budgetwould be desirable. In his view, it was far too early to take adecision on this matter and he would like to have the authority ofthe Cabinet to say so in theThe Cabinet (2) Agreed that in the Parliamentary debate later in the day the Chancellor of the Exchequer should neither promise that there would be an autumn Budget nor rule out thepossibility of such a Budget.Anglo-Soviet 3    The President of the Board of Trade recalled that it hadTrade keen necessary to break off the negotiations for an Anglo-soviet negotiations,    trade agreement because agreement could not be reached on the(Previous        revision of the repayment terms of the Civil Supplies Agreement ofReference:       1941. It had been made clear to the Soviet Government at that stageC.M.(47)62nd   that the financial concessions which His Majesty&apos;s Government had conclusions,     been prepared to offer were withdrawn, and that the original termsMinute 4.)      Gf the 1941 Agreement, including the obligation of the SovietGovernment to make regular quarterly repayments of advances made on their behalf, remained in force.     In the course of thenegotiations, however, it had been suggested by M. Mikoyan thatthis obligation might cease to be honoured if agreement was not reached on the concessions desired by the Soviet Government, andat the last meeting this statement had been repeated in terms which came very near to a declaration of an intention to default.  He had,therefore, on 29th July, handed to the Soviet Ambassador in Londonan aide-memoire asking for a definite assurance that there was nosuch intention on the part of the Soviet Government.   At the sametime he had intimated to M. Zarubin that an agreement on financialconcessions, if signed before 1st November, would be made retro-spective to a date prior to 1st August.    H.M. Ambassador at moscow had now reported (Moscow Telegram No. 1757 of 3rdAugust) that he had received a letter from M. Vyshinski sayingthat, in view of the latter assurance,&apos; he for his part hoped that negotiations could be recommenced.  Meanwhile, the Soviet Govern-ment had made a payment of  1 million on account of the full sumof  2-4 millions due on 1st August under the 1941 Agreement.The President of the Board of Trade said that no further pro-gress could be made unless the Soviet Government paid in full theinstalment due on 1st August. If, however, that payment wasmade, he suggested that we should reopen negotiations on the basis that, provided that the Soviet Government would agree to increasesubstantially their offer of barley and course grains for the presentcrop-year, we should be ready to make further concessions in regardto the repayment terms of the 1941 Agreement. He accordingly proposed that the Soviet Ambassador in London should be informed that once that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to reopendiscussions once the instalment due on 1st August under the 1941Agreement had been paid in full. An early decision was desirablesince an offer of 300,000 tons of coarse grains had been received fromthe Argentine. The price quoted was  25 10s. a ton, which was 2 10s. in excess of the Russian price. Moreover, freight costs forArgentine wheat were  2 a ton higher than for Russian wheat.The Minister of Food strongly supported the proposal that negotiations should be resumed, provided that the Soviet Govern-ment paid in full the outstanding amount due under the 1941 Agree-ment. The proposed expansion of agricultural production in thiscountry was dependent upon an adequate supply of feeding-stuffs,and the Argentine and Russia were the only countries to which wecould at present look for additional supplies. Failure to obtaincoarse grains from Russia would gravely jeopardise the building up of our livestock.  On the other hand, if the Russian negotiations
4.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Presidentations    of the Board of Trade (O.E.P. (47) 29 and 30) seeking guidance onie?a.     certain questions which had arisen in the discussions at Geneva onthe terms of the draft Charter for the establishment of an Inter-national Trade Organisation, and in the parallel negotiations on tariffs and preferences.In the course of discussion, the following points were raised : (a) The Secretary for Overseas Trade said that it was proposedin O.E.P. (47) 29 that acceptance by His Majesty&apos;s Government ofthe draft Charter should be dependent on the adoption of a textwhich would, so far as the Charter was concerned, give the UnitedKingdom no less freedom to use discriminatory import restrictions in order to obtain additional imports than would be given to anyother country in balance of payments difficulties; and that we shouldbe prepared only in the last resort to modify our view that the useof such restrictions ought not to be subject to the prior approval ofthe Organisation. He suggested that even if we had to concede thispoint we should keep our hands completely free for at least twoyears. In order to meet our difficulties about the non-discrimina-tion provisions of the Charter, the United States Government had proposed that, in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Tradeembodying the result of the tariff negotiations and some of theprovisions of the draft Charter, it should be laid down that these provisions should not take effect until 1951.The Foreign Secretary and The Secretary of State for Com-monwealih Relations urged that we should not enter into any freshcommitments with regard to non-discrimination, even though the[34134-3] B 3were successful, the result might be to force dowri the Argentineprice and thus to facilitate further purchases from that source also.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that we hadalready made numerous financial concessions under the 1941 Agree-ment in an effort to secure agreement. He doubted whether further concessions could be justified. It had also to be remembered thatpurchases in Russia were now, in fact, hard currency transactions.Again, account must be taken of the effect which renewed negqtia-tions might have on the United States Government under presentconditions.The Foreign Secretary urged that a hasty decision should be avoided. There should, in any event, be no question of reopeningdiscussions until the Soviet Government had paid in full the out-standing instalment due under the 1941 Agreement.In further discussion there was general agreement that there could be no question of resuming negotiations until the SovietGovernment had paid in full the instalment due on 1st Augustunder the 1941 Agreement. In view, however, of our need for cereals and coarse grains, it was thought that we should be preparedto resume negotiations, if payment was made, and that some further relaxation of the repayment terms of the 1941 Agreement should notbe ruled out if the Soviet Government were for their part preparedto make some corresponding concession.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to inform theSoviet Ambassador in London that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be prepared to reopen the negotiationsfor a trade agreement once the Soviet Government hadpaid in full the instalment due on 1st August under theCivil Supplies Agreement of 1941.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in consulta-tion with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the foreign secretary and the Minister of Food, to consider the termson which negotiations might be reopened.
United States Government were willing that they should not take,effect for some time to come; and there was general support for thisview.(6) The Secretary for Overseas Trade said that agreement had now been reached in Geneva on the inclusion in the draft Charter ofa new provision safeguarding the position of any country which hadcomplete control of its external trade. He understood that thisprovision was satisfactory to the New Zealand Minister of Finance.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said thatit was most important that the New Zealand Government should notbe driven to refuse to participate in the Organisation. He would,therefore, wish to see the terms of the new provision and to be assured tbat it was acceptable to Mr. Nash.(c) The Minister of Fuel and Power pointed out that it was proposed to agree to some modifications of the Imperial Preferencesystem in return for certain reductions in the United States tariff.In his view there was very little prospect of any substantial increasein the quantity of manufactured goods which we might hope to export to the &quot;United States, and it was therefore essential that weshould make sure of securing substantial advantages in return forany concessions that we might make.The Foreign Secretary supported the recommendation made inO.E.P. (47) 29 that preferences which we enjoyed should not bereduced in any case where serious damage to an important exportwould result. It was also necessary to take special care that theadvantages obtained in return for any concessions that we might make were of corresponding value. It was not enough to acceptpercentage reductions of tariffs which afforded only illusory benefits.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said that,where the United States Government asked for some modificationof an existing preference, it was essential that the Dominion Govern-ment affected should also receive a compensatory concession of real value.(d) The Cabinet disagreed with the recommendation made inO.E.P. (47) 29 that His Majesty&apos;s Government should concede free entry for fresh apples, provided that the Canadian Governmentconsented. Such a concession would for some time be incompatible with the measures announced in Parliament on the previous day,and it was undesirable to enter into any long-term commitment onthis subject at the present time.(e) The Secretary of State for the Colonies drew attention tothe recommendation made in O.E.P. (47) 29 that an attempt shouldbe made to settle the question of boycotts at this stage rather thanat the forthcoming World Conference. He suggested that a further attempt might be made to reach agreement by negotiation with theArab League countries.   This was agreed.The Cabinet-Subject to the points raised in discussion, endorsed therecommendations made in O.E.P. (47) 29.5. At their meeting on 15th July the Cabinet had invited theHome Secretary to ascertain whether the title of the criminla justice Bill might be drafted in such a way as to exclude any amendment for the abolition of capital punishment and to circulate a memorandum on the suggestion that it might be possible to distin-guish between certain types of murder for which capital punish-ment would be retained and other types for which it would be abolished.The Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (47) 217) dealing with these points.criminla justice Bill.ProposedAbolition ofCapitalPunishment.(previous reference:CM. (47) 61stConclusions,Minute 2.)
The Home Secretary said that he was satisfied that it wouldnot be possible to argue that an amendment to abolish capital punish-ment would be outside the scope of the Criminal Justice Bill, and accordingly, even if the long title could be drafted in such a way as to exclude the subject of capital punishment, such an amendment would, nevertheless, be in order. He had also reached the conclusionthat, for the reasons set cut in CP. (47) 217, any system of gradingmurders would be undesirable. In these circumstances, he felt thatthe right course was for the Government to declare, when the bill was introduced, that they would resist any amendment to providefor the abolition of capital punishment.The Lord Chancellor said that he agreed with the conclusion reached by the Home Secretary that a scheme for the grading ofmurders would be unworkable.The Attorney-General said that he still remained in favour ofproviding for the abolition of capital punishment in the Bill andhe was satisfied that the majority of Government supporters wouldtake this view.The Cabinet-(1) Took note that an amendment providing for the abolitionof capital punishment could not be ruled out of order onthe ground that it did not come within the scope of the criminal Justice Bill.(2) Agreed that it would be impossible to grade murders intothose for which capital punishment would be retainedand those for which it would be abolished.6. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the joint memo-randum by the Lord President and the Minister of Supply (CP. (47)215) on the reorganisation of the iron and steel industry.The Lord President recalled that at their meeting on 31st J ulythe Cabinet had invited the Minister of Supply and himself toascertain the views of the trade unions concerned. It had unfortun-ately been impossible to arrange a meeting with the Iron and SteelCommittee of the Trades Union Congress, but at a meeting duringthe previous week the alternative courses which the Cabinet had considered had been put before a_ fairly representative group ofmembers of the General Council. He had since received a messagestating that the conclusion of the General Council was that theywere not yet in a position to say that the policy of the Trades UnionCongress on the nationalisation of steel had changed from what had.been agreed at the meeting between the Minister and the deputation from the Trades Union Congress at which the scheme outlined in cp. (47) 123 had been approved. The matter had, moreover, hadto be considered by the Council at very short notice, and the council had indicated that their representatives would be available for afurther discussion with the Minister of Supply if necessary.Government supporters in Parliament were now pressing forinformation about the Governments attitude, and in his view itwould be difficult to take the line that the Government were not yetable to state their intentions. He still believed that the right course was to introduce legislation in the 1947-48 Session on the lines pro-posed in CP. (47) 212. To attempt to control the industry throughthe exercise of the powers which were being taken under the supplies and Services (Transitional Powers) Bill would expose the Govern-ment to damaging criticism, and to proceed with the original schemeset out in CP. (47) 123 would lead to a loss of steel output at acritical time. If, however, it was the general view of the Cabinetthat the Government could not commit themselves as to their inten-tions during the 1947-48 Session in anticipation of The King&apos;sSpeech, he felt that it would be wrong for them to announce at thisstage that they would introduce legislation to implement the scheme in CP. (47) 123 during the lifetime of the present Parliament.Iron and SteelIndustry Bill.(previous reference:CM. (47) 66thConclusions,Minute 4.)
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he remained infavour of the policy of full nationalisation. He felt, however, thatit would be most unwise for the Cabinet to attempt to decide at thepresent time what, if any, legislation on the subject of the iron andsteel industry should be included in the 1947-48 Legislative Pro-gramme. The Government should, therefore, inform their sup-porters that it was very doubtful whether it would be possible to legislate on the subject in the 1947-48 Session. At the same time,it should be made clear that a measure to nationalise the iron andsteel industry would remain part of the Governments programmeof legislation for the present Parliament; and he believed there wasa good chance of the Governments being able to deal with the matter in the 1948^9 Session. Meanwhile, any necessary control over theindustry could be exercised under the Supplies and Services (Tran-transitional Powers) Bill.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that in principle he favoured the complete nationalisation of the iron and steel industry.He recognised, however, that nationalisation would not produce anybeneficial result in increased steel output for some considerable timeand that the introduction of legislation to carry out the scheme in cp. (47) 123 would have a disturbing effect. On the other hand,the reply which bad been received from the Trades Union Congressmade it difficult to abandon any proposal for legislation in the1947-48 Session, and he accordingly suggested that the right coursewould be to introduce a Bill to carry out the scheme of control out-lined in CP. (47) 212, at the same time making it clear that this wasonly a step towards the nationalisation scheme outlined in CP. (47)123. Looking to the circumstances in which the Supplies and services (Transitional Powers) Bill had been introduced, he thoughtit would be most unwise for the Government to expose themselves tothe charge that they were using powers granted by that Bill to carryout a measure of nationalisation.The Foreign Secretary said that, after further consideration,he remained opposed to the scheme of control outlined ill CP. (47)212. On the other hand, he did not think that the Governmentshould commit themselves to legislation to nationalise the industryin the 1947-48 Session. He did not see why the Government shouldbe forced to state their intentions at this stage, and he would prefer to leave the position open for at least a few weeks. The cabinet might then consider the matter afresh, possibly after taking furthersoundings among their supporters.The Minister of Health urged that the Government should forthwith state that they intended to introduce legislation to carryout the scheme outlined in CP. (47) 123 in the 1947-48 Session. in previous discussions it had been rightly assumed that, if the neces-sary legislation was not introduced in this Session, there would beno hope of carrying out the nationalisation of the industry in the lifetime of the present Parliament. It would be difficult, if not impossible, for the Government to avoid making some statement oftheir intentions in view of the Conservative amendment to theSupplies and Services (Transitional Powers) Bill providing that noregulation might be made under the Bill for the purpose of bringing the iron and steel industry under public ownership. To announce that legislation would be introduced in a later Session would merelyleave the industry in a state of prolonged uncertainty. No satis-factory evidence had been produced to show that, if the Governmentproceeded with the full scheme of nationalisation, output would be adversely affected.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said thatto proceed with the scheme in CP. (47) 123 would lead to reducedoutput of steel, which would be disastrous in the present criticaleconomic situation. Accordingly, if it was felt to be impossible toproceed with the scheme set out in CP. (47) 212, the right courseseemed to him to be to introduce no legislation on this subject inthe 1947-48 Session.
The Minister of Food suggested that the liovernment should use their powers under the Supplies and Services (transitional powers) Bill to gain the effective control over the industry whichwould have been secured by the legislation proposed in CP. (47) 212.They should then follow this up by introducing in the 1947-48Session legislation to carry out the scheme set out in CP. (47) 123.This course would avoid any risk of loss of output and, at the sametime, make it clear that the Government were not to be turned asidefrom their intention to nationalise the industry.The Lord Chancellor said that, in view of the advice which theCabinet had been given by the Minister of Supply that to proceedwith the scheme in CP. (47) 123 would jeopardise steel output during the next year or eighteen months, he was strongly opposedto proceeding with legislation in the 1947-48 Session. He thoughtthat the Government should forthwith decide that there should beno legislation to deal with the iron and steel industry in that session and that this decision should be announced. Nothing need be said about the Governments intentions with regard to the introductionof legislation in a later Session.The Minister of Defence said that, though he was personallycommitted to a policy of full nationalisation for the iron and steelindustry, he believed that nothing would be gained by saying that themeasure to nationalise the iron and steel industry would be brought forward in a later Session. He accordingly supported the lord presidents suggestion that legislation on the lines proposed in cp. (47) 212 should be introduced in the 1947-48 Session.The Minister of Education said that&apos; the Cabinet should take account of the effect that their decision might have on the workersin the iron and steel industry. He supported a solution on the lines proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Home Secretary said that during the next six months theGovernment would be faced with tremendous administrative tasks.Tor this reason he was opposed to the introduction of a Bill to nationalise the industry in the 1947-48 Session.The Minister without Portfolio said that he feared that theproposals put forward in CP. (47) 212 would create bitter dis-appointment. Accordingly, if the Cabinet could be assured that output would not be adversely affected, he would favour the intro-duction in the 1947-48 Session of legislation to implement thescheme outlined in CP. (47) 123.The Minister of Supply said that it was impossible to say cate-goricaliy that the introduction of legislation to nationalise theindustry would inevitably have an adverse effect on output. Itwould, however, undoubtedly increase the risk that the target of14 million tons output of steel in 1948 would not be reached.. On thewhole, he was inclined to suggest that the proposal for fullnationalisation should be retained as part of the programme for thepresent Parliament, but that no decision should be taken as towhether it should be introduced in the 1947-48 Session.The Minister of Labour said that he had now come to the con-elusion that it would be impossible to abandon the idea of intro-ducing legislation to give effect to the scheme in CP. (47) 123 duringthe lifetime of the present Parliament. He suggested, however,that a decision on whether such legislation should be introduced inthe 1947-48 Session might well be deferred.The Minister of Agriculture said that in the present critical situation the Government could not afford to proceed with legisla-tion in the 1947-48 Session, if they were advised that by doing so they would affect adversely the output of steel in 1948. A failure to secure the maximum output of steel would do far more harm thanthe postponement of the proposed Bill until the 1948-49 Session.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet were bound to take account of the administrative tasks which they had undertaken in
IndianSterlingBalances.(previous reference:CM. (47) 58thConclusions,Minute 1.)7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP. (47) 213) outlining the terms on which itwas proposed to make an interim settlement of the question of theIndian sterling balances.The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that, as a result ofthe recent negotiations, the Indian Delegation had advised their government to accept an interim settlement covering the period upto the end of 1947, under which all but  35 millions of the out-,standing Indian sterling balances, amounting to  1,160 millions,would be blocked. Only about  15 millions of the  35 millionsreleased would be spent in dollars^ the rest being used to meetsterling expenditure on Indian imports from Australia and theUnited Kingdom. No commitment for further releases after theend of 1947 had been or would be made in the present negotiations,nor Were His Majesty&apos;s Government committed to recognise the totalof  1,160 millions. Moreover, the rate of interest on the balanceswould not be allowed to increase. In the exceptional politicalcircumstances of India at the present time, he did not regard theproposed settlement as too generous, and he hoped the cabinet would authorise him to announce it within the next few days.The Secretary of State for India supported the proposals madein CP. (47) 213. India badly needed food imports and, if HisMajesty&apos;s Government did not agree to the use of a reasonableamount of the accumulated sterling balances for the purchase offood, the prospects of retaining the Indian Dominions within theCommonwealth would be jeopardised.The Cabinet &apos;Approved the interim settlement of the question of theIndian sterling balances proposed in CP. (47) 213 and took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would announce the terms of the settlement at an early date.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,7th August, 1947.order to deal with the present economic situation. To proceed withthe original scheme might lead to considerable disturbance in theindustrj^ and would add substantially to the heavy burdens alreadyimposed on the Ministry of Supply. For these reasons he would favour an announcement that the Government did not intend toproceed with the scheme in the. 1947-48 Session. He realisedhowever, that any such announcement would cause disappointmentamong Government supporters, and he felt that the predominantview m the Cabinet was in favour of stating that, while the schemestill remained in the programme for the present Parliament, it was doubtful whether it would be possible to introduce the necessary legislation in the 1947-48 Session.The Cabinet Agreed that Government supporters should be informedthat the Government adhered to their intention to bringappropriate sections of the iron and steel industry under public ownership, that it was doubtful whether it wouldbe possible to introduce the necessary legislation in the1947-48 Session, and that, before coming to a finaldecision on this point, the Government required more timeto consider it in the light of the present economicsituation.
