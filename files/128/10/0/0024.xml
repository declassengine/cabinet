Balance of The Cabinet had before them telegrams from Sir Wilfrid EadyPayments. (Washington telegrams Nos. 4566-4569 of 20th August) reporting(Previous the outcome of his further discussions on 19th August with repre-Eeferenee: sentatives of the United States Government regarding the decisionCM.(47)72nd of His Majesty&apos;s Government to take immediate steps to limitConclusions, the convertibility of sterling. They also had before them tele-Minute l.) gram No. 4570 of 20th August from His Majesty&apos;s ambassador in Washington commenting on the latest developments.Sir Wilfrid Eady had reported that, after further discussion,drafts had been prepared for an exchange of letters (telegrams nos. 4568 and 4569) on lines which were considered to be acceptableby the British Mission. The Mission had been informed, however that the exchange of letters must be accompanied by a secret under-standing that His Majesty&apos;s Government would not draw on theUnited States Credit for some unspecified period beyond thedrawings already notified, the intention being that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment might at a later stage, which might be comparativelysoon, ask the United States Government for permission to resumedrawings whereupon the United States Government &apos;&apos; would haveto make up its mind.&quot; The British Mission had protested strongly against this proposed condition, but it had subsequently been con-firmed by the National Advisory Council, who had stipulated thatthere must either be a secret understanding to this effect or an openassurance in the proposed exchange of letters that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would refrain from drawings for an unspecified period.In spite of further protests by the Mission, the National AdvisoryCouncil had adhered to their attitude that, in view of theirfiduciary responsibility to Congress for the management of the Loan,they must ask for such an agreement for the suspension of drawings.In these circumstances Sir Wilfrid Eady had suggested that therewere four possible courses of action :-- -(i) The United States proposal for an agreement on the suspension of drawings might be accepted in one of thealternative forms suggested.(ii) His  Majesty&apos;s  Government might  undertake,  in  theexchange of letters, to refrain from drawing on the credit for a period of two months, if the United StatesGovernment would include in their reply an undertaking that at the end of that period His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment could resume drawings on the Credit at any timeunless the United States Government gave notice thatthey had ground for complaint that British procedure and policy had not been in accordance with the assurances given in their letter and were in breach oftheir obligations under the Agreement.(iii) Ministers might proceed to Washington for discussions.(iv) His Majesty&apos;s Government might take their proposed action unilaterally: this would no doubt involve theimmediate suspension of drawings on the Creditincluding those already notified but not yet drawn.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had no objectionto the proposed texts of the exchange of letters contained in Wash-ington telegrams Nos. 4568 and 4569. As regards the possible courses of action suggested by Sir Wilfrid Eady, he could not recom-mend acceptance of the second. This would mean that our actionswould be under the constant surveillance of the United states administration during the next two months; and it seemedinevitable that during that time we should be forced to act in a manner which the United States Government might claim as giving them justification for complaint. He also thought that for thereasons given by Sir Wilfrid Eady the United States proposal fora. secret agreement regarding the suspension of drawings was whollyunacceptable. He recommended that the Cabinet should hold totheir previous decision to take action at 9 p.m. on 20th August to limit the convertibility of sterling, but that a paragraph should beadded to the proposed exchange of letters saying that His Majesty&apos;s
Government were ready to make no further drawings on the Credit,beyond those already notified, pending further consultations. Ashe had informed the Cabinet on 19th August, $150 million had been drawn on 11th August and notification had been given for furtherdrawings of $150 million on 21st August and $150 million on25th August. In addition, the Treasury representative in Wash-ington had been informed on the previous day that the government wished to draw a further $150 million on 1st September, but in viewof the delicacy of the present position it had been left to his discr -tion whether such notification should be made at the present stage.If drawings were made, as proposed, up to 25th August, the balanceof the Credit remaining would be $550 million.The President of the Board of Trade thought that the time had come for discussions at a Ministerial level. Provision was made inArticle 8 (ii) (b) of the Financial Agreement for consultation priorto agreement to continue to invoke the provisions of Article XIV,Section 2, of the Articles of Agreement of the international monetary Fund. He suggested that the Government should statethat they would not propose to notify any further withdrawals until such consultation had taken place. There should be no suggestionat this stage of a formal approach on the lines contemplated inArticle 12 of the Agreement, since this implied that any modifica-tions agreed upon would have to be presented to the legislatures ofthe two countries.The Lord President said that any statement regarding suspension-sion of drawings on the Credit should be so worded as to indicatethat His Majesty&apos;s Government had had no alternative but to adoptthe course proposed in view of the attitude of the United StatesGovernment. Public opinion in this country should not be left withthe impression that the Government had taken the initiative in suggesting suspension of drawings.The Minister of Fuel and Power supported the view that further discussions with the United States Government ought nowto be conducted by Ministers. It was important to remember that forsome time to come we should be greatly dependent on United Stateshelp, and our objective should therefore be to reach a satisfactorylong-term settlement with them. For that reason it was important that we should avoid any action at this stage which would heed-lessly antagonise the United States Administration.The Cabinet. -(1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to authorise theBritish Mission to Washington to agree that lettersshould be exchanged in the terms of the drafts set outin Washington telegrams Nos. 4568 and 4569, subjectto the addition, in the letter from His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, of a paragraph in the following terms : &quot;As we appreciate that, in such circumstances as have arisen,provision is made in the Financial Agreement for con-sultation prior to agreement to continue to invoke theprovisions of&quot; Article XIV, Section 2, of the Articlesof Agreement of the International Monetary Fund, wewould not propose to notify any further withdrawals,beyond those already notified, from the line of credit,until such consultation has taken place &apos;&apos;;(2) Asked^the Chancellor of the Exchequer to verify* that theUnited States Government accepted the&apos; proposed exchange of letters, with the modification set out in Con-elusion (1) above, before announcing that evening theCabinet&apos;s decision to limit the convertibilitv of sterlingby the means approved at their meeting on 17th AugustCabinet Office, S. W. 1,20th August, 1947.* Later in the day a message was received notifying the concurrence of the United StatesGovernment m the course proposed in the above conclusions.
