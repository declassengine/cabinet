India.constitutional changes.(previous reference erence:CM. (47) 58thConclusions,Minute 6.). 1. The Plume Minister informed the Cabinet that difficulties had arisen over the appointment of Governors-General for the newIndian Dominions. The Indian Independence Bill had been draftedon the assumption that, at least for an initial period, it would befound convenient for India and Pakistan to share a commonGovernor-General, and that the present Viceroy would continue to service in India in this post in order to help the new DominionGovernments through the difficult period of transition. The Con-gress leaders had invited Lord Mountbatten to accept nominationas the Governor-General of India, but the Muslim League had now put forward Mr. Jinnah&apos;s name for the post of Governor-General of Pakistan. The Muslim League leaders had, however,expressed the strong hope that Lord Mountbatten would becomeGovernor-General of India; and the Congress leaders, on learningof the Muslim League&apos;s proposal, had renewed their invitation tohim.Lord Mountbatten was in some doubt whether to accept theCongress invitation. He was afraid that, if he should decide to associate himself in this way with the Union of India, hisimpartiality as Viceroy might be subsequently impugned, and hehad had in mind the attitude adopted by the Governors of Bengaland the Punjab, each of whom had announced that he would notbe prepared to accept office in one part of his Province after parti-tion. On the other hand, it was clear that Lord Mountbatten&apos;departure from India on 15th August would seriously endanger the process of transferring power. If Lord Mountbatten were notavailable it seemed inevitable that a Hindu would be appointedGovernor-General of India, and the prospects of conflict over suchmatters as the division of assets between the two Dominions would thus be greatly increased. It was, moreover, in the interests of pakistan that Lord Mountbatten should remain, since it seemed likely that he would be able to ensure a fairer division of assets.It would be necessary to make some statement on this matter on the Second Reading of the Indian Independence Bill. In parti-cular, Lord Mountbatten was himself most anxious that the earliest opportunity should be taken to make public the development ofevents so that, if he accepted the Congress invitation, he could notlegitimately be charged with partiality. Moreover, parliament would reasonably assume from the terms of the Bill that, at the outset, the two new Dominions would share a common Governor-General, and it ought not to be left under a misapprehension. Inthese circumstances, the best course seemed to be to make a state-ment on the Second Reading to the effect that both Congress andthe Muslim League had made recommendations regarding the governors-General of the new Dominions which had been conveyed to The King by His Majesty&apos;s Government. While a formalannouncement would have to await the enactment of the Bill, HisMajesty had intimated that he would be prepared to accept these recommendations as soon as the Bill had been passed. The namescould then be given. The Prime Minister said that he had felt it advisable, after discussing the matter at the India and BurmaCommittee, to consult the Opposition leaders about this procedure,and he intended to submit the proposal to His Majesty later inthe day.The Cabinet-Took  note,  with  approval,  of  the  Prime Minister&apos;sstatement.Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in     the House of Commons in the following week.the House of It had originally been intended that the Committee andCommons. remaining Stages of the Indian Independence Bill would be taken on 14th July, but the Opposition had represented that there shouldbe an interval between the Report Stage and the Third Reading[34132-1] b 2
and it was now proposed that the Third Reading should be deferred until 15th July. This would leave time on 14th July for a debate on the report of the Committee of Privileges on a complaint madeto the House on behalf of Mr. W. J. Brown, M.P., and it might bepossible to agree with the Opposition that Supply business shouldbe taken on 15th July after the Third Reading of the IndianIndependence Bill had been taken.The Report Stage of the Finance Bill would be concluded on16th July.17th July would be a Supply day and it might be necessary toagree to a debate on the Army.The Third Reading of the Finance Bill would be taken on18th July.In the course of the week the Lords amendments to the NationalService Bill and a Motion to approve the Purchase Tax (Exemptions)(Certain Woven Fabrics) (No. 1) Order, 1947, would be taken.The Lord President recalled that on 3rd July the Cabinet had invited him to circulate a memorandum on the issues raised in the motion put down by certain Opposition Members relating to thereport of the Committee of Privileges on the complaint made tothe House on behalf of Mr. W. J. Brown, M.P. It had not yetbeen possible to prepare this memorandum and, as it would benecessary to deal with the Motion on 14th July, the Cabinet mustreach an immediate decision on the line to be taken by the Govern-ment spokesman.In discussion there was general agreement that the right coursewould be for the Government to put down a Motion proposing thatthe report of the Committee of Privileges should be accepted butdeprecating contracts between Members of Parliament and outside bodies which might restrict the freedom of Members in carryingout their Parliamentary duties. It was also agreed that in the debate the Minister without Portfolio might move that the reportof the Commitee of Privileges should be considered, leaving it tothe Lord President to move the Government Motion. If necessary,the Attorney-General might also speak in the debate.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord President, in consultation with the LordChancellor and the Attorney-General, to draft a Govern-ment Motion proposing that the report of the Committeeof Privileges should be accepted but deprecating contractswhich might restrict the freedom of Members of parliament in carrying out their Parliamentary duties.Eeport of theCommittee of privileges.(previous reference erence:CM. (47) 59thConclusions,Minute 1.)Economic 3.   The Minister of Health said that, in his view, it had beenPlanning unfortunate that the Cabinet had had no opportunity of consideringBoard. the constitution of the Economic Planning Board before theannouncement which had been made by the Lord President in theHouse of Commons on the previous day. He himself was not satisfiedthat it was wise to include in the membership of the Board thePermanent Secretaries of individual Departments.It was explained that the lines on which the Economic PlanningBoard would be constituted had been announced by the Presidentof the Board of Trade in the debate on the Economic situation on 10th March. It had been considered desirable to include inthe membership the Permanent Secretaries of the Board of Trade,the Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Supply, since these departments were closely concerned with the matters which would come before the Board. The Permanent Secretaries of these Depart -ments had already been involved in the work of economic planningthrough their membership of the Steering Committee and the new
economic recovery ofEurope.(previous reference:CM. (47) 56thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Foreign Secretary said that he had circulated to theCabinet a memorandum (CP. (47) 197) giving an account of theproceedings at the meeting of Foreign Ministers which had discussed the United States offer to assist the economic recovery of Europe.It was clear that the Soviet Government had not intended to collaborate on any acceptable basis and he was convinced that thedecision to go ahead at once without Soviet participation would prove to have been justified. The response to the invitations sentto other European countries had been encouraging and it was parti-cularly gratifying that the Government of Czechoslovakia shouldhave accepted. Though it seemed probable that the Governmentsof Poland and of other Eastern European countries would feel unableto accept the invitations addressed to them in the first instance,they might possibly agree to participate later. The firm stand whichhad been taken would, he believed, have a good effect on the trade negotiations now in progress with the Soviet Government and wouldalso increase the likelihood of reaching a satisfactory settlement atthe meeting of Foreign Ministers in November.The Foreign Secretary said that he proposed to travel to Parison 11th July and that a meeting of the representatives of the Govern-ments who had accepted the invitation would be held on 12th Julywith a view to setting up working parties to deal with the differentaspects of the reconstruction plan. We should have to consider urgently what contribution the United Kingdom could make tothe recovery of Europe and, in particular, whether we could, byspeeding up the development of new coal mines, undertake to exporta substantial quantity of coal to the Continent from 1949 onwards.There was a surplus of labour in Italy, and the possibility of bringing Italian labour to the United Kingdom on a contract basis for employment on the development of new coal mines should beconsidered. An urgent study of the whole question of currencywould have to be undertaken since it was most important that any proposals under this head should be submitted to the United StatesGovernment at an early date. There was a reasonably good chance that a special session of Congress would be held in October ifreconstruction proposals could be presented to the United StatesGovernment by September, and Ave should do everything possibleto secure this in view of the critical dollar situation which we shouldhave to face towards the end of the year.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the arrangements which werebeing made to prepare the proposed European reconstruc-tion plan.ForeignAffairs.Indonesia.(previous reference:CM-(47) 56thConclusions,Minute 2.)Egypt.5. The Foreign Secretary said that he had been continuing his efforts to secure a peaceful settlement in Indonesia and that the differences between the Netherlands Government and the Indonesianshad now been narrowed down to the single issue of the creationof a joint gendarmerie. He had proposed to both sides that thepresent arrangements should be maintained until the whole question could be discussed with the proposed Interim Government, and that,if agreement could not then be reached, the advice of a police mission from some country such as Sweden should be obtained.The Foreign Secretary said that he was still hopeful that asettlement would finally be reached on the lines of the Bevin-Sidkydraft of 1946 and that the Egyptian Government might be preparedf 34132-1 ]b 3arrangements would, if anything, lighten the burden falling on them. The precise constitution of the Economic Planning board would in any event be open to revision in the light of experienceof its working and it was, of course, an advisory body whose recom-mendations would be subject to approval by Ministers.
ooto acquiesce in the continuance of the provisions of the 1936 treaty in regard to the Sudan,   in the meantime, he proposed to initiatediscussions with the Governments concerned, including the UnitedStates Government, on the Lake Tana scheme.Manchuria. The Foreign Secretary said that developments in Manchuriawere&quot;&quot;causing him great concern. If the United States, Soviet and chinese Governments failed to reach early agreement, world peacemight be gravely endangered. The Soviet Government was undoubtedly lending support to the Communist forces in Chinaand there was reason to suppose that Soviet aircraft had been involved in hostilities. The prospects of agreement between theNanking Government and the Chinese Communists were negligible,and he understood that the United States Government had nowresumed the supply of arms to the Nanking Government.Palestine.The Mufti of jerusalem.(previous reference:CM. (45) 56thConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The Cabinet had before them a joint memorandum by theForeign Secretary and the Secretary of State for the Colonies(CP. (47) 194) reporting that the High Commissioner for Palestinehad asked to be instructed what action he should take if the Muftiof Jerusalem should come within the jurisdiction of the palestine government at Haifa while on .the way from Egypt to the Lebanon.The alternatives were to arrest and deport him under the PalestineDefence (Emergency) Regulations, or to deny him permission to land and permit him to continue his journey. His arrest would be strongly resented by the Arabs of Palestine and the Arab Statesand would further enhance his prestige in their eyes. On the otherhand, it was most undesirable that he should once again be ableto direct Arab operations in Palestine from the security of the lebanon and there would be violent Zionist criticism of the british authorities as well as damage to British prestige if he were notarrested while he was in a Palestine port.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to instruct the High Commissioner for Palestine that, if the Muftishould come within the jurisdiction of the palestine government, he should be arrested and deportedimmediately to the Seychelles for detention as a politicalprisoner;(2) Invited the Foreign secretary i to instruct His Majesty&apos;minister at Beirut to repeat the warnings already givento the Lebanese Government against their allowing the mufti to enter the Lebanon and to say that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment counted on the Lebanese Governmenttaking all possible measures to prevent this fromhappening.Food. 7.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofTea Ration Food (CP. (47) 199) on the tea ration and the purchase of teaand Purchase from Ceylon.of Tea from The minister&apos; of Food said that bulk stocks of tea had fallenCeylon.from 15 weeks&apos; supply at the end of January to 6-k weeks&apos; supply(Previous       at the end of June, and would fall to 3^ week&apos;s supply by the endReference:      of July.   This fail in stocks was due to dock strikes in ColomboC.M.(47)39th   and Calcutta, which had held up shipments; and, though every -Conclusions,     thing possible was being done to accelerate the movement of supplies,Minute 5.)      it was clear that, if a breakdown in the tea ration was to be avoided,there should be a reduction of 1 oz. in the weekly 3 oz. ration whichwould be due for the period 20th July to 16th August.   This would save approximately 13 million lbs., and&apos; with a similar saving forthe period 14th September to 11th October should enable the 2 ozrat-ion to be maintained without serious shortage in the retail shops.
The long-term prospects for tea supplies were better. TheGovernment of India had agreed that 260 million lbs. should beobtained by bulk purchase from the 1947 crop and we should inaddition obtain 40 million lbs. in the Calcutta auctions. As regardsCeylon tea, tenders so far received amounted to only 95 million lbs.,but the Government of Ceylon would be willing to help us by per-suading producers to offer additional supplies, if we agreed to thebulk purchase of 150 million lbs. in 1948 at the same price as in1947. He did not think that prices would fall before the end of1948, and he sought authority to make a contract on this basis.The following points were made in discussion :. (a) It would be advisable to restrict the reduction of the tearation to the period 20th July to 16th August in the first instance.The need for a second reduction in the next 3 oz. ration periodcould be considered later.(b) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he could not agree to the proposal to make a contract to buy Ceylon tea in 1948on the basis of 1947 prices. Such a step would merely retard thefall of world prices which we were anxious to encourage. More-over, the Ceylon price, which was 5d. a lb. above the Indian price,had risen from Is. lid. a lb. to 2s. S^d. a lb. in the past year, Id. ofthe increase being on export levy. In view of the economic assistance given to Ceylon by the British Government, he suggested that the ceylon Government should be pressed to adopt a more reasonable attitude.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he would take up the matter with the Governor of Ceylon and Sir OliverGoonetilleke.(c) The Minister of Defence asked whether it might not be advisable to revert to an open market for tea in this country.The Minister of Food said that there might be substantialadvantages in restoring the Mincing Lane tea auctions, but thatthe Governments of India and Ceylon insisted on our buying inthe Calcutta and Colombo markets. Under these conditions Govern-ment bulk purchase had been successful in securing supplies atsubstantially lower prices than those in the open market.(d) The Minister of Food said that he had in mind thepossibility of drawing on Indonesian stocks as soon as a settlement was reached between the Netherlands Government and the indonesians and that, for this purpose, he would arrange for arepresentative of the Ministry of Food to be available in Indonesia.The Cabinet^-(1) Agreed that the usual increase in the tea ration from 2 oz.to 3 oz. should not take place in the period 20th July to16th August;(2) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in consulta-tion with the Minister of Food, to bring pressure to bearon the Ceylon Government in order to secure a reductionin Ceylon tea prices.8. The Foreign Secretary drew attention to the Press reportsof representations made by the National Road Transport Federa-tion about the shortage of rubber tyres. He understood that theoutput of tyres had fallen because of a strike in the United states which had affected the supply of carbon black to this country andhe felt that it was important that it should be made clear to thepublic that the shortage of tyres was due to causes outside thecontrol of the Government. He also hoped that urgent steps wouldbe taken to develop new sources of supply of carbon black within our owm control in order that we should not be dependent on theUnited States for this commodity.
The President of the Board of Trade said that he had takenspecial steps to get additional supplies of carbon black from theUnited States as soon as possible and that as from the end ofJuly the position should be satisfactory. Carbon black could notbe produced in the United Kingdom by the ordinary process, since we had no supplies of natural gas, but experiments were being madewith a view to devising an alternative process. There were abundantsupplies of natural gas in Persia and the possibility of erectingplant there for the production of carbon black had been discussed with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. It had been felt, however,that it would be inexpedient to use labour and materials for thispurpose until the plans for new housing and other amenities in theproperties of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company had been carried out.The Cabinet (1) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to consider,in consultation with the Lord President, whether special steps should be taken to explain to the public the causeof the shortage of rubber tyres;(2) Took note that the President of the Board of Trade would do everything possible to develop new sources of supplyof carbon black.transport bill.(previous preference:O.M.(47)53rdConclusions,Minute 1.)9. The Cabinet were informed that the Opposition in theHouse of Lords were pressing for the inclusion in the transport bill of a new Clause embodying the code of compensation to begranted to officers and servants of railway companies. It had beenagreed at a meeting of the Committee on the Socialisation ofIndustries (S.I. (M) (47) 7th Meeting) that this pressure should be resisted and that the Government spokesman should adhere to theview that the code of compensation should be laid down by regula-tions, which should be laid before Parliament in accordance withthe procedure set out in Section 62 (2) of the Coal IndustryNationalisation Act, 1946. It was clear, however, that, if this line were taken an amendment to insert the code of compensation in the Bill would be carried and the Government would find thisextremely embarrassing when the Lords amendments came to be con-sidered in the House of Commons. Viscount Swinton had indicated that the Opposition might be satisfied if the Bill were to provide that the regulations laying down a code of compensation shouldbe laid before Parliament in draft, and the Secretary of State for commonwealth Relations and the Minister of Transport agreedthat the right course would be to follow the precedent of the &quot;CivilAviation Act, 1946, and the National Health Service Act, 1946, bothof which provided that regulations should be laid in draft andshould be approved by resolution of each House of Parliament. Ifthis were done a corresponding change would have to be made inthe Electricity Bill.The Minister of Fuel and Power recalled that the Governmenthad resisted the demand of the Trades Union Congress and the tradeunions that compensation codes should be set out in full in socialisa-tion Bills and pointed out that he had, with considerable difficulty,secured agreement to provisions in the Coal Industry Nationalisa-tion Act and the Electricity Bill which enabled codes of compensa-tion to be determined by regulations not subject to affirmative resolution. It would be extremely embarrassing to him if theprovisions governing compensation in the Transport Bill were tohe assimilated to those in the Civil Aviation Act, 1946, and theNational Health Service Act, 1946, and he felt that, in practice,it. would be much more difficult to operate provisions under whichregulations, the terms of which had been agreed on with the interests concerned, would be open to revision as a result of pressure inParliament.
In discussion it was pointed out that there were considerablepractical advantages in laying regulations in draft, since thisenabled the Government to ascertain the views of Parliament before they were irrevocably committed to the regulations. Moreover, the laying of regulations in draft did not necessarily entail their approval by affirmative resolution and, in view of the serious con-sequences of making no concession to the Opposition in the Houseof Lords, it seemed desirable that the Secretary of State for Com-commonwealth Relations should agree to a provision requiring theregulations to be laid in draft, though he should, if possible, seek to avoid making the draft regulations subject to affirmative resolution.The Cabinet-Authorised, the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations and the Minister of Transport to inform theOpposition that the Government would be prepared toagree to a provision requiring the regulations setting outthe code of compensation to officers and servants of railwaycompanies to be laid before Parliament in draft, and agreedthat, if possible, the draft regulations should not be subjectto affirmative resolution.Cabinet Office.
