1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Report Stage of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland)Bill would be taken on 7th July.On 8th July there would be a debate on the Import Programme.The Lord President would speak at the beginning of the debate andthe Chancellor of the Exchequer would wind up.9th July would be the first day of the Report Stage of theFinance Bill.It was hoped to take the Second Reading of the IndianIndependence Bill on 10th July and the remaining stages on14th July. In view of the difficulties in maintaining the interim government in India, it was most desirable that the Bill should become law as soon as possible, and the aim was to secure its passageby 20th J uly.The Third Reading of the Town and- Country Planning (Scot-land) BUI would be taken on 11th July. It had been agreed that the debate should occupy only two hours in order that progress mightbe made with other business.Report of the The Lord President, said that he proposed to resist any sugges-Committee of tion that there should be an immediate debate on the Motion putPrivileges. down by certain Opposition Members relating to the Report of theCommittee of Privileges on the complaint made to the House onbehalf of Mr. W. J. Brown, M.P. It would, however, be impossibleto avoid a debate on this Motion later in the month, and the cabinet ought to consider the issues raised by it.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord President to circulate a memorandum onthe issues raised in the Motion relating to the Report of theCommittee of Privileges on the complaint made to theHouse on behalf of Mr. W. J. Brown, M.P.Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.Town andCountryPlanningBills.Constitutionof the CentralLand Board.(previous reference:CM. (46) 107thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Scotland (CP. (47) 192) about the constitution of theCentral Land Board which it was proposed ,to establish for thepurposes of the English and Scottish Town and Country PlanningBills.The Secretary of State for Scotland explained that the EnglishBill provided that the Minister of Town and Country planning and he should jointly appoint the Board and the Scottish Billprovided that in carrying out their functions in Scotland the board would be subject to directions given by himself. During the Com-mittee Stage he had resisted an Opposition amendment providingfor the appointment of a Scottish Committee of the Board to whomthe Board might delegate any of their functions under the ScottishBill, but had undertaken to amend the Bill to provide that the board should maintain in Scotland a staff sufficient for the proper per-formance of Scottish business. The proposal for a Scottish Com-mittee had been pressed again during the Committee Stage of theEnglish Bill in the House of. Lords and the Lord Chancellor had stated that if, when the Scottish Bill was before the House of Lords,he received instructions to accept an amendment of this kind hewould do so very readily. The case for the appointment of a scottish Committee of the Board was very weak and if the proposal made by the Opposition were accepted it Avould be extremely difficultto resist pressure for similar arrangements under the transport bill and the Electricity Bill. Moreover, an amendment providingfor the appointment of a Scottish Committee would make itnecessary to recommit the Scottish Bill, which would involve delay.For these reasons he proposed to resist the proposal for a ScottishCommittee of the Board. He would, however, like to be able to announce that there would be appointed to the Board at least two[34109-5]b 2
Malaya. 3.   Xhe Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of future State for the Colonies (CP. (47) 187) about the future constitutionConstitution,    of Malaya.(Previous Secretary of State for the Colonies recalled that onEeference: 5th December, 1946, the Cabinet had provisionally approved certainCM. (46) 103rd revised proposals for a new federal constitution for Malaya. these conclusions, proposals had since been discussed with both the non-Malay and the minute 5?) Malay communities, and broad agreement had been reached. It hadnot been necessary to suggest any departure from the basic aim of creating a strong central government with a common citizenshipopen to all who had adopted Malaya as their true home, but itwas proposed to modify in certain respects the proposals relatingto the introduction of elections, the acquisition of citizenship andthe composition of the Central Legislature. It had not been possiblefully to reconcile Malay and non-Malay views on the last two matters, and agreement with the Malays had still to be reached on the question of the control of immigration policy, while their demand that the Malay Rulers should in future have the right ofconcurrence in the appointment of successive High Commissionerswould have to be rejected. It was not proposed that Singaporeshould form part of the Federation of Malaya at the outset, thoughit might be found desirable to include it later. He proposed that,as soon as agreement had been reached with the Malays on out-members with special knowledge of Scottish conditions and thathe hoped that the qualifications of one or other of them wouldmake him suitable for appointment as Deputy Chairman.The Minister of Town and Country Planning said that, in his view, the establishment of a separate Scottish Board or of a ScottishCommittee of the Board could be justified on administrativegrounds. He recognised, however, that to yield to the opposition in this matter would embarrass the Minister of Fuel and Powerand the Minister of Transport and he had no objection to the course which the Secretary of State for Scotland proposed to follow.In discussion it was urged by some Ministers that the demandfor separate administrative arrangements for Scotland in this andother fields could not be justified on merits and was not backed by any substantial body of Scottish opinion. Moreover, any con-cessions made were likely to lead to demands for similar treatmentfrom Wales.On the other hand, it was pointed out that, while it would be undesirable to have a separate Board for Scotland or even a ScottishCommittee of the Board, the arrangements proposed by theSecretary of State for Scotland for the maintenance in Scotland ofa staff sufficient for the proper performance of Scottish business andfor the appointment to the Board of two members with specialknowledge of Scottish conditions were reasonable in view of the differences between the English and Scottish systems of land tenure.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, in resisting any pressure from the Oppositionfor the establishment of a Scottish Committee of theCentral Land Board, the Secretary of State for scotland should announce that there would be appointed to theBoard at least two members with special knowledge of scottish conditions, but should not suggest that one orother of these members might be appointed as deputy chairman.(2) Agreed that in the selection of members of the Central Land&quot;Board the possibility of appointing a member withspecial  knowledge  of  Welsh   conditions   should  beconsidered.
standing points, an announcement of the Governments decisions should be made in Parliament and a summary of the proposals shouldbe published as a White Paper.The Secretary of Stats for India asked that the Government ofIndia should receive advance information of the announcement.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the results of the further consultations in Malaya on the future constitution, and invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to proceed as proposed in paragraph 7 of CP. (47) 187.Wages Policy.agricultural wages.(previous reference:CM. (47) 44thConclusionsMinute 4.)4. The Minister of Agriculture drew the attention of theCabinet to the decision of the Agricultural Wages Board in favourof increasing the minimum wage of agricultural workers from  4to  4 105. a week. It had been estimated that the last increase of10s. in the minimum wage would add  18-J million a year to farmers&apos;costs and it was clear that the Government would be asked to reviewagricultural prices in order to take account of this fresh increase.In discussion it was pointed out that the increase in theminimum wage of agricultural workers was likely to lead to appli-cations for higher wages from other rural workers, such as roadmen,and would make it difficult to resist the claims of building workers.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of Labour to consider what steps mightbe taken to prevent the decision of the agricultural wages Board from leading to increases in the wages ofother rural workers.(2) Agreed to discuss the general question of wages policy attheir meeting on 8th July.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,3rd July, 1947.
