The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Committee Stage of the Finance Bill would be continued and concluded on 16th and 17th June.18th and 19th June would be the fifth and sixth allotted Supplydays. The subjects to be debated on these days had not yet beendecided.The Second Reading of the A griculture (Emergency Payments)Bill and the Committee Stage of the Financial Resolution wouldbe taken on 20th June.During the week it was also hoped to obtain the Committee and remaining Stages of the Public Offices (Site) Bill and the SecondReading of the Probation Officers (Superannuation) Bill, and tomake further progress with the Penicillin Bill.The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet that,after consultation with the Ministers mainly concerned, with government supporters and with representatives of motor manu-facturers, he had reached agreement on a new form of motor taxa-tion which, without appreciable loss of revenue, would remove the restrictive effect of the present scheme of taxation on the development-ment and design of engines. Briefly, his proposal was that all carsregistered before 1st January, 1947, should continue tc pay thelicence fee provided for under the existing system, but that allcars registered after that date should pay a flat-rate licence fee of 10 a year. There would be no additional petrol tax, but it was proposed to impose a higher purchase tax on luxury cars.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that provision for the new scheme of motor taxationoutlined by the Chancellor of the Exchequer should bemade in the Finance Bill.The Minister of Health said that the purchase tax of 66-f rds percent, which had been imposed on electric and gas cookers addedabout  10 to the cost of new working-class houses. Almost all theproduction of cookers went into new houses and, since every housemust have a cooker, no saving of gas or electricity accrued from the tax, which merely added to the already rising cost of new houses.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was disposed tothink that there were good reasons for reducing the tax on cookersand he would discuss the matter with the Ministers concerned.The Cabinet (2) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would discuss wuth the Health Ministers and the Minister of fuel and Power the- question of amending the finance bill so as to reduce the purchase tax on gas and electriccookers.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs informed theCabinet that in Committee on the- Transport Bill the opposition had sought to restrict the powers of the British Transport Corn-mission to manufacture vehicle chassis and vehicle bodies. The viewof the Minister of Transport was that where the Commission took over undertakings already manufacturing chassis it should havepower to continue the manufacture of chassis for its own use, though not for sale, provided that the number manufactured did notexceed the aggregate previously manufactured by the undertakings.He.also felt that there should be no limitation on the power to manufacture bodies. The Opposition, however, relying on a state-ment made by the Minister in the Second Reading debate in theHouse of Commons to the effect that the Commission would not beable to manufacture chassis at all, had pressed their point strongly,and it might be necessary to go some way to meet it. The matter would be discussed with the Minister of Transport.[34108-4]b 2
. The general view of the Cabinet was that, so far as possible,the powers which the Minister of Transport wished the Commissionto have should be preserved and that, in particular, no; concession should be made which would afford a precedent for limiting thepowers of manufacture conferred on other boards&apos; responsible forsocialised industries. For example, it would be very undesirable to restrict the power of the Electricity Authority to manufactureelectrical equipment.The Cabinet were also informed that the Opposition were likelyto press to a division an amendment providing that the membersof the Executives should be appointed by the Commission, in ccn-sultation with the Minister, instead of by the Minister. This pointhad been considered by the Committee on the Socialisation ofIndustries, who had recommended that appointments should con-tinue to rest with the Minister.The Cabinet&apos;s view was that for the present at any rate no concession to the Opposition should be made on this point.India.constitutional position.(previous reference erence:CM. (47) 51stConclusions,.Minute 1.)2. The Prime Minister read to the Cabinet a letter from theUnited States Ambassador giving the text of a statement which theState Department proposed to issue to the Press, expressing the satisfaction of the United States Government at the receptionaccorded to the proposals made by His Majesty&apos;s Government for effecting the transfer of power in India.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement on India tobe issued by the United States State Department.ForeignAffairs.The Saar.Situationin Europe.Hungary.3. The Foreign Secretary said that the French Governmentwould shortly announce the introduction of a new currency in the saar and that for this purpose it would be necessary to decide ona provisional definition of the frontiers of the area. The originalFrench frontier proposal had been unacceptable, but it had nowbeen modified to embrace an area, which could, in his view, beregarded as a satisfactory economic entity. It was not proposedthat the Saar should be incorporated into France or into the Frenchpolitical system; and the French Government were anxious to makethe proposed change for economic reasons. So far neither the SovietGovernment nor the United States Government had commented onthe proposal, but he had not felt that it was necessary to delay our reply until the attitude of those Governments was known and hehad accordingly informed the French Government that HisMajesty&apos;s Government saw no objection, provided that it was under-stood that the final delimitation of the frontiers of the Saar wouldbe a matter for the^ Peace Conference and that a consequentialadjustment of the  Tench reparations account would have to bemade in due course.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the action taken by the foreign secretary.The Foreign Secretary said that he had been much concerned at recent developments in Europe, where the situation seemed to havedeteriorated. The delay in the ratification by the United Statesof the Peace Treaties with the ex-enemy States in Eastern europe was, at least to some extent, responsible for this.The position in Hungary was very obscure and he had not feltthat at this stage it would serve any useful purpose to adopt theproposal of the United States Government that formal representa-tions should be made to the Soviet authorities through the allied control Commission and to the Hungarian Government.   He had
therefore informed the United States Government that he wasinstructing His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Moscow to take up thewhole question with M. Molotov and to seek clarification of theSoviet Governmenfs attitude.Poland and The Foreign Secretary said that he had been much disturbedCzecho- by the reports of the arrest of leading members of the Polish SocialistSlovakia. Party and of attacks on the co-operative movement in Poland; andthat he was investigating rumours of similar developments in czechoslovakia. The Cabinet should know that he had felt it rightto agree that the Polish Resettlement Corps should be represented at the funeral of M. Raczkiewicz who had been President of theexiled Polish Government during the latter years of the war.France. In France the Communists had withdrawn from the Govern-ment when a food shortage was seen to be unavoidable, and theywere actively fomenting the labour disputes now taking place. Hewas informed, however, that there were signs of a sharp reactionagainst the strikers and, if the Government could control the situa-tion until after the coming harvest, there was a good prospect of greater stability in France.Italy. If the Peace Treaty with Italy were ratified in June, we shouldbe able to withdraw the bulk of our forces from Venezia Giuliain July, though forces amounting to about 5,000 men would haveto remain in Trieste for some time longer during the establishmentof the new regime there.Germany. The Foreign Secretary reported that in Germany difficulties had recently arisen with the Soviet Government over two points. Inthe discussions on the future strength of the military garrisons inthe three Zones, the Soviet Government had proposed that thestrength of the garrison in their Zone should be 200,000, whilethe British and United States Governments had proposed a strengthof 145,000 for the garrisons of each of their Zones. The SovietGovernment had argued that the combined strength of the Britishand United States troops should not exceed 200,000. We couldnot, however, accept this limitation, for the forces in our Zone wouldhave a heavy task in enforcing a reparations policy involving the dismantling of factories and the removal of plant. Secondly, while we had agreed to dismantle war factories by 1948, our policy hadbeen to convert the buildings themselves for use either as residencesor as factories for peane-time production. The Soviet Governmenthad objected to this, but in view of the grave shortage of housing in the British Zone, he proposed to ignore their objections.Indonesia. The Foreign Secretary said that he had been maintaining a close watch on developments in the Dutch East Indies. The latest proposals for a settlement put forward by the Dutch Governmenthad seemed reasonable and he had instructed the acting Consui-General to get into touch with President Soekarno and Dr. Shahririnformally in order to urge that they should be accepted. As aresult of this approach, the Indonesian leaders seemed disposed toaccept the proposals, but they had expressed anxiety lest the Dutchmilitary authorities in Indonesia might refuse to implement themand might, indeed, carry out a military cozip. He had taken thispoint up at once with the Dutch Government and had received an assurance that such a situation would not be permitted to develop.The Minister of Food said that he warmly welcomed the pros-pect of a settlement in the Dutch East Indies, which was animportant source of food supplies. He understood that 100,000 tonsof fats and 1 million tons of sugar were awaiting export, and itwas vitally important to reach early agreement with the Dutchon the raising of the blockade and on financial arrangements whichwould enable us to purchase food supplies there.International The Foreign Secretary said that the Drafting Committee of bill of Human the United Nations Commission on Human Rights were now engagedEights. in preparing a draft of an International Bill of Human Rights. Ithad seemed desirable that His Majesty&apos;s Government should submit their own proposals for such a Bill to the Drafting Committee.   A
draft had accordingly been prepared and, after consideration by the steering Committee on International Organisations, had been published in the form of a non-Parliamentary paper.The Cabinet-&quot;(2) Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement regardingthe publication of the United Kingdom draft of anInternational Bill of Human Rights.Burma.(previous reference:CM. (47) 12thConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that theGovernor&apos;s Executive Council in Burma had asked that termssimilar to those granted to India should now be extended to Burma.Their proposal was that power should be transferred immediately,on the basis of the grant of Dominion status, and that this shouldbe done without prejudice to the ultimate decision of the Con-stituent Assembly on the future constitution. This request had beenconsidered by the India and Burma Committee, who agreed thaithere could be no question of granting Dominion status to Burmamerely as a device for expediting the transfer of power. TheGovernor had been instructed to inform the Executive Council thatthere were two possible courses of action : either Burma might haveher full independence outside the Commonwealth as soon as the newconstitution had been drafted and the necessary legislation enactedhere; or power might be transferred on the basis of the grant ofDominion status, on the understanding that this status would haveto remain unaltered for a period of time. The Executive council had proposed that U Tin Tut should visit the United Kingdom todiscuss ways and means of effecting the transfer of power-; and theGovernor had been instructed to suggest to Aung San that it mightbe advantageous if U Tin Tut could be accompanied by Thakin I\hior some equally prominent political personality. In the meantimeit was hoped that the Constituent Assembly would not commit itselfirrevocably to a decision in favour of full independence.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement on the present political situation in Burma.Developmentof ColonialResources.(previous reference:CM. (47) 5thConclusions,Minute 3.)5.   The Cabinet had before them : (i) a memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies(CP. (47) l75)&apos;outiining proposals for the establishmentof a Colonial Development Corporation to promote andundertake the expansion of supplies of food-stuffs, rawmaterials and other commodities; and(ii) a memorandum by the Minister of Food. (CP. (47) 176)proposing the establishment of an Overseas food corporation which would be immediately responsible forthe East African Groundnuts Scheme and for other schemes for the expansion of food production for export to the United Kingdom.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that the funds madeavailable under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act hadnecessarily had to be used for the provision of basic social servicesand public works and utilities. It was, however, important toencourage the expansion of supplies of food-stuffs, raw materials andother commodities in the Colonies, and the Colonial Economic andDevelopment Council were satisfied that the best instrument for doing this would be a Colonial Development Corporation. Therewould clearly be considerable scope for a body of this kind and he proposed that its functions should not be confined to the expam-sion of supplies of food-stuffs and raw materials but should also include industrial development in suitable cases. The main dutiesof the Corporation would be to enquire into new projects, to operate
85CM. 53 (47)&apos;new industries itself where this was appropriate and to develop and assist particular undertakings by financing them, either alone or in association with Colonial Governments or Governments of otherparts of the Commonwealth. The Corporation would have to workin close collaboration with the Overseas Food Corporation proposedby the Minister of Food in CP. (47) 176, and he was satisfied that adequate arrangements could be made to prevent overlapping. Thenecessary capital would be obtained mainly by the raising of moneyby public issues under Treasury guarantee and he suggested thatthe total borrowing power might be of the order of  100 million,with provision for some initial contribution from the Exchequer.New undertakings would normally be operated by subsidiary organi-sations and both the Corporation and its subsidiaries would berequired to conduct their operations on public utility principlesunder which they would aim at earning enough to pay their capitalcharges over a period of years without seeking to make large profits.Legislation would be necessary to establish the proposed corporation and it had been arranged that the necessary powers both for thispurpose and for the establishment of the proposed Overseas food corporation should be obtained in a Bill to be introduced early inthe 1947-48 Session.The Minister of Food said that he had already announced the names of the members of the Corporation which would be respon-sible for the East African Groundnuts Scheme. It was clear, how-ever, that, if it was to operate efficiently, this Corporation would need powers to grow other foods than groundnuts and to operate in other Colonial territories and possibly even outside the colonial empire. He accordingly proposed that the Corporation should begiven these wider powers and should be known as the Overseas food corporation. To ensure the necessary co-operation between thisCorporation and the Colonial Development Corporation the Chair-man of each Corporation would be a member of the other. It had originally been suggested that the maximum investment of public money in the East African Groundnuts Scheme would be about 25-1 million. I^j however, the Overseas Food Corporation were tobe able to undertake further schemes, this sum should be increasedto  50 million. There would be prior consultation with the treasury on any schemes, other than the East African Groundnuts Scheme,which it was proposed to entrust to the new Corporation.The following points were made in discussion : -(a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, though he strongly supported the proposals made by the Secretary of State. for the&quot; Colonies and the Minister of Food, he did not wish to be committed to the precise financial proposals put forward in cp. (47) 175 and CP. (47) 176 until he had been able to discuss them further with these Ministers. He also suggested that, whilethe Bill should be so framed as to enable the Overseas Food Corpora-tion to operate outside the Colonial Empire, any specific proposalto do this should be submitted to the Cabinet or the appropriateCabinet Committee for approval.(&amp;) The Foreign Secretary pointed out that the members of theColonial Development Corporation would not have the necessaryqualifications to undertake the management of all the widelydifferent activities which might be carried on. Nor would it bedesirable, on political grounds, to have a single organisation directly responsible for a large number of different undertakings, since this might expose it to the criticisms which had been levelled at the chartered Companies. For these reasons it would be important togive a substantial measure of independence to the separate com-panies which would work under the Corporation.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that his proposals would s;ive the necessary degree of independence to the subsidiary companies.
(c) The Minister of Fuel and Power asked whether there wasnot a danger that the requirement that the Corporation and the subsidiary companies should pay their way would lead them to disregard the welfare of their employees.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that the welfare ofthe workers employed would be amply safeguarded by the exerciseby Colonial Governments of their existing powers under the colonial development and Welfare Act.The Cabinet Subject to further discussion between the Ministers con-eerned and the Chancellor of the Exchequer on finance, and between them and the Lord President on the socialisationaspects, approved the proposals in CP. (47) 175 and cp. (47) 176 for the establishment of a Colonial Develop-ment Corporation and an Overseas Food Corporation, and agreed that the necessary powers should be obtained in anOverseas Resources Development Bill to be introduced earlyin the 1947-48 Session.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,Wth June, 1947.
