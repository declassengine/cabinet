1. The Cabinet had invited the Lord President, on 15th July,to take soundings among Government supporters with a view to determining whether those who favoured the abolition of capital punishment could be persuaded to refrain from pressing for this change in the law in the interests of securing the passage of the criminal Justice Bill (CM. (47) 61st Conclusions, Minute 2).The Lord President said that this question had been discussed at a recent meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party, at whichhe and the Lord Chancellor and the Home Secretary had spoken.It was clear that Government supporters would make no difficulties over the fact that the Criminal Justice Bill, as introduced, containedno provision for the abolition of capital punishment. It was equallyclear, however, that an amendment to abolish capital punishmentwould be moved in the course of the proceedings on the Bill in theHouse of Commons and that it would be strongly pressed by asubstantial number of Government supporters. A majority of thoseattending the meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party hadfavoured the abolition of the death penalty; and the strength oftheir feeling on this issue was such that it was most unlikety thatthey could be persuaded to refrain from voting for the amendment.The Cabinet agreed that in these circumstances it was inevitable that the decision on this issue should be left to a free vote.Discussion then turned on the question whether the Governmentshould give any guidance to the House on the merits of the issue,and whether Ministers should also be free to vote in accordance withtheir personal convictions. On this question opinion was divided.Some Ministers felt that this was wholly a matter for the conscienceor the judgment of the individual, and that Ministers who heldstrong views on the moral issue should not be asked to subordinatethose views to a collective decision of the Cabinet. Other Ministersargued that, while the moral issue might be a matter of personalconviction, the Government as such had a duty to advise parliament on the probable consequences of abolishing the death penalty. TheGovernment were responsible for the preservation of law and order,and must assume the responsibility of a collective decision on the risks to law and order which the abolition of the death penaltvmight involve.In further discussion two alternative possibilities werecanvassed : (a) Would it be practicable to ascertain what view was taken onthis issue by the House of Commons as a whole, by means of a debate on a Private Member&apos;s Motion ? If the issue could be brought before the House in this way, and left to a free vote, it would be easier for the Government to refrain from offering guidance thanit would be if the issue were presented by wray of amendment to aGovernment Bill. After discussion, however, the Cabinet concluded that this was not a practicable course, since it would be regardedas an admission that the Government had not been justified in taking over all Private Members&apos; time during the Session.(b) The suggestion was made that, even though the Cabinet felt obliged to take a collective decision on the advice to be given to theHouse on the Governments behalf regarding the abolition of capital punishment, they might agree that any Ministers who dissentedfrom this advice should be free to abstain from voting in the division.. After further discussion the Cabinet agreed that no finaldecision should be taken on the handling of&quot; this matter in theHouse of Commons until they had had a further opportunity of considering memoranda on the merits of the question. The cabinet should know, in particular, how far the recommendations of theSelect Committee of 1930 had been unanimous.
Food.Supplies ofCereals.(previous reference erence:C.M.(47)82ndConclusions,Minute 3.)Wheat.2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofFood (CP. (47) 298) on prospective supplies and stocks of cereals forthe United Kingdom in 1947-48.The Minister of Food recalled that the Cabinet had invited him on 23rd October to submit an early report on the possibility of de-rationing bread simultaneously with the introduction of a schemefor controlling the consumption of potatoes.   In the light of theErospects disclosed in the memorandum which he had now submittede could not recommend that bread rationing should be dis-continued unless additional imports of wheat could be secured. Atthe same time, he agreed that, if potatoes had to be rationed andhe regarded that as inevitable it was highly desirable that breadshould be de-rationed as soon as possible thereafter. He therefore asked for authority to buy an additional 400,000 tons of wheat for delivery in this country over the next nine months, at a cost of 8-13 millions, and asked that convertible sterling or other dollarequivalents should, if necessary, be used for this purpose. this additional wheat might be obtained from three possible sources Russia, the Argentine or the United States. The conclusion of asatisfactory trade agreement with Russia would greatly ease the cereals supply position, for Russia was in a position to providecoarse grains as well as wheat. The Argentine Government wouldprobably be unwilling to negotiate for the sale of wheat until theend of 1947; and this meant that, if the additional supplies neededhad to be obtained from this source, bread rationing would haveto be continued for some time after the end of the year. The UnitedStates Government would find difficulty in supplying us with additional wheat for the purpose of de-rationing bread, at a timewhen they were under strong pressure to provide supplies for Euro-pean countries whose needs were even greater than our own. Inthese circumstances Russia seemed to be the best source of additional supplies; but he thought that the other possibilities should not atthis stage be excluded.The Cabinet first discussed the possibility of obtainingincreased supplies of wheat from Canada. The figures of arrivalsof wheat in Table II of the Annex to CP. (47) 298 were based onthe assumption that 330,000 tons of the wheat which Canada hadcontracted to supply would not be shipped until after the end ofthe contract year. This prospective short-fall in deliveries was due partly to shipping difficulties; and, if more shipping could be madeavailable, especially on the western seaboard of Canada, the rateof import of wheat could be increased. With this in view it wassuggested that shipments of timber from Western Canada might be suspended for a time and that the shipping earmarked for thispurpose should be diverted to the carriage of wheat. Large ship-ments of timber had arrived in the United Kingdom recently: ourtimber stocks were now high : and a switch-over from timber to(1) Agreed that the question of abolishing the death penaltyshould be left to a free vote, and that this vote shouldbe taken on the Report Stage of the Criminal justice bill in the House of Commons;-(2) Invited the Home Secretary to consider whether, in additionto the memoranda (CP&quot;. (47) 200 and 217) which he had previously circulated, he could usefully submit a furtherpaper summarising the main arguments for and againstthe abolition of capital punishment, as a basis for afurther discussion by the Cabinet;(3) Agreed to resume at a later meeting their discussion of thequestion whether the Government, as such, should tenderadvice to the House of Commons on the abolition of the death penalty.
wheat would help to relieve congestion in the docks. No reductionof the programme of timber imports was involved : it was merely aquestion of adjusting the timing of the shipments.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Ministry of Transport should arrange, inconsultation with the Ministry of Food and the Board ofTrade, that wheat should for a time have a higher priority than timber in the claims on shipping availablefor cargoes from the western seaboard of Canada.The Cabinet next discussed the possibility of obtainingincreased supplies of wheat from Australia. The main points madein discussion were :  (a) The Australian Wheat Board were holding out for an excess-sively high price, and Australian Ministers should be asked to bring pressure to bear to induce them to adopt a more reasonable attitude.It would be useful if the Prime Minister would send a personal message to the Prime Minister of Australia, after first discussing the matter with the Australian High Commissioner in London.(b) There was some reason to believe that the Australian WheatBoard were also taking too conservative a view of the quantity ofwheat which might be made available to the United Kingdom.Paragraph 3 (b) of Annex II to CP. (47) 298, stated that about million tons (75 million bushels) might be available for the UnitedKingdom and the Colonies, and that on this basis only 900,000 tons(about 33 million bushels) would be available for the United King-dom. The Lord Privy Seal had, however, understood, when he wasin Australia, that a minimum figure of 50 million bushels should beavailable for the United Kingdom.The Prime Minister undertook to take up with the AustralianHigh Commissioner, and thereafter with the Prime Minister ofAustralia, the question of quantity as well as price.(c) An increase in the size of the Australian contract wouldnot ease our supply position in the early part of 1948 unless ship-ments from Australia could by some means be expedited. TheMinistry of Transport should consider all possible means of expediting shipment, including the use of cargo space in passengerliners and even the chartering of United States ships. If dollarshad to be spent on chartering ships, it was clearly preferable thatthose ships should be used to carry supplies from non-dollar countries. Closer collaboration between the Ministries of Food andTransport might be required to ensure that no opportunities were lost of expediting the shipment of food supplies.The Cabinet (2) Took note that the Prime Minister, after discussion withthe Australian High Commissioner in London, would send a personal message to the Prime Minister ofAustralia urging the importance of an early conclusionof the Australian wheat contract; and that this mes-sage would cover the question of quantity as well asprice;(3) Invited the Minister for Economic Affairs to review theinter-departmental organisation for co-ordinatingprocurement and shipment of food [supplies; and toarrange that the Ministry of Transport should take all practicable steps to expedite the shipment of wheat from australia.The Cabinet next considered the question of supplies from theArgentine. It was agreed that the first need was to negotiate ageneral trade and financial agreement with the Argentine Govern-ment, and that for this purpose there should be no further delay in despatching a strong Trade Mission to the Argentine. TheCabinet were informed that a temporary arrangement had beenmade under which the Argentine were continuing their exports of
food supplies to this country and adding to their sterling balances,with a view to accumulating sufficient sterling to complete theirpurchase of British railway and tramway holdings in the Argentine.This had enabled us to postpone the opening of trade negotiationsuntil the Board of Trade were able to form a clearer picture of the exports which we could guarantee to deliver to the Argentine in payment for our imports from there. The Board of Trade were now ready to open the negotiations, and a Trade Mission was toleave for Buenos Aires within the next few days. The composition of this Mission had been settled and the Cabinet were assured thatit would be a strong and effective team.The Cabinet were informed that negotiations for a trade agree-ment with Russia were to be reopened towards the end of the present month. The Minister of Food had suggested, in CP. (47) 298, thatin these negotiations we should offer to buy 400,000 tons of wheatwith convertible sterling. The Cabinet were, however, informedthat such an offer would not assist towards the conclusion of a,nagreement, for there were indications that the Soviet Governmentwere not anxious to obtain dollars. The Chancellor of theExchequer said that our general policy must be to secure our importsfrom Europe without promising payment in either gold or dollars.In the light of this general review of the supply position, theCabinet reached the conclusion that, even though the position dis-closed in CP. (47) 298 might be improved to some extent by theadoption of some of the expedients which had been suggested intheir discussion, our prospective supply position for cereals in1947-48 was not sufficiently satisfactory to warrant the view thatbread rationing could be discontinued before, at least, the end of1947. The Minister of Food should, therefore, take all practicable steps to secure additional supplies of wheat, up to a total of 400,000tons by the end of the current crop year; but these additional supplies should be sought primarily by securing expedited deliveries from Canada and Australia or fresh supplies from Russia, and theCabinet were not at this stage prepared to commit themselves to payment for additional supplies in dollars or convertible sterling.The Cabinet-(4) Agreed that bread rationing must be continued for the timebeing;(5) Authorised the Minister of Food to seek additional suppliesof wheat, up to a total of 400,000 tons by the end of thecurrent crop year; and agreed that these additional supplies should be sought primarily by expeditingdeliveries from Canada and Australia and by securingfresh supplies from Russia, so that further expenditureof dollars or convertible sterling on these additional supplies might be avoided.Coarse The Cabinet then considered the forecast, in Part II of theGrains. memorandum annexed to CP. (47) 298, of future requirements and supplies of coarse grains.The Minister of Agriculture stressed the importance of securingsupplies of coarse grains adequate to support the Governmenfsagricultural programme. The confidence of the farmers and thegeneral public would be seriously shaken if the livestock programme had again to be revised for lack of sufficient feeding-stuffs.The Cabinet were informed that the main hope of offsettingthe failure of our home crops of barley and oats lay in concludinga satisfactory trade agreement with Russia which would enable usto obtain substantial supplies of barley. There were also smallerexport surpluses of coarse grains in Yugoslavia and Roumania; butboth those countries were demanding in return supplies of steel and capital equipment in quantities which we could not provide. Wehad some prospect of driving a bargain with Yugoslavia whichwould secure us a relatively small amount of coarse grains, but therewas little hope of our getting coarse grains from Roumania.
3. In the light of the discussion recorded in the preceding-Minute the Cabinet resumed their consideration of the proposalsof the Minister of Food (CP. (47) 295) for controlling the consump-tion of potatoes.There was general agreement that the Minister of Food should now be authorised to introduce without further delay a scheme ofcontrol on the lines indicated in CP. (47) 295.If the amount of the weekly allowance were fixed at 2\ lbs. per head, there was a reasonable prospect that this could be maintainedthroughout the winter. If, on the other hand, 3 lbs. per head were allowed at the outset of the scheme, it would probably become neces-sary to reduce the allowance to 2 lbs. in the spring. The view ofthe Cabinet was that it would be preferable not to start the scheme with a weekly allowance of less than 3 lbs. per head.The Minister of Food said that it might be possible to import100,000 tons of potatoes from Canada at a cost of about  1^ millions.He asked whether the Cabinet would authorise this dollar expendi-ture, to be offset against his earlier proposal that 400,000 tons ofwheat should be bought for dollars or convertible sterling. TheCabinet asked that this question should be discussed in the firstinstance between the Minister of Food and the Chancellor of theExchequer.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Minister of Food to introduce at an earlydate a scheme for controlling the consumption of potatoeson the lines indicated in CP. (47) 295; and agreed thatthe amount of the weekly allowance under this scheme should be fixed at the outset at 3 lbs. per week, eventhough this might involve reducing the allowance to2 lbs. a week in the spring of 1948;(2) Invited the Minister of Food to discuss with the Chancellorof the Exchequer the proposal that 100,000 tons of potatoes might be imported from Canada;(3) Invited the Minister for Economic Affairs to determine, inconsultation with the Ministers of Agriculture and Food,the minimum acreage to be sown to potatoes in 1948-49.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Food (CP. (47) 300) setting out the detailed adjustmentsrequired to give effect to the Cabinet&apos;s decision of 20th October thatthe use of sugar in manufacturing should be reduced by 25 per cent.In discussion it was pointed out that it had not been the cabinets intention that a cut of 25 per cent, should be imposed on each of the different manufacturing uses of sugar. So long as a saving of 25 per cent, was secured in manufacturing use as a whole,the proportions could be varied, as between one use and another,in the manner calculated to cause least inconvenience to the manu-facturers and the public.In this connection the view was expressed that it would be convenient if the distribution of the cut could be so arranged as toenable the jam ration to be maintained at its prevent level, possibly by making a larger reduction in the use of sugar in confectionery.The Minister of Health said that his scientific advisers thoughtit dangerous, on nutritional grounds, to make this reduction in thesupply of an energy food during the winter months.(6) Took note that the Minister of Food, in consultation withthe President of the Board of Trade, would continue their efforts to secure additional imports of coarse grains.
Cabinet, Office, S W. 1,3rd November. 1947.Authorised the Minister of Food to use his discretion in arranging that the total reduction of 25 per cent, in theuse of sugar in manufacturing should be distributed,between the various manufacturing uses, in the mannercalculated to cause least inconvenience to the manufacturers and the public.
