LocalAuthorityMeetings.Voting byMembers ofCo-operative societies.1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Ministerof Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. (47) 319)on the statutory restriction preventing members of co-operative societies from taking part in the discussion at local authoritymeetings of questions affecting their society.The Minister of Health said that, if a local councillor or his wife was a member of a co-operative society, he could not under theexisting law take part in any business of the council affecting thesociety. This restriction gave rise to practical difficulty in view ofthe large number of co-operative society members now serving on local councils: and this difficulty could not adequately be met bythe power of the Minister to remove the disability, since that power was exercisable only in respect of specific occasions and could notbe exercised without delay. The co-operative societies had maderepeated representations in favour of the removal of this restriction,and he believed there was a good, case for yielding to their request for amendment of the law. He therefore asked for authority toaccept an amendment to the Local Government Bill, to be movedon behalf of the co-operative societies, which would provide thatthe existing restriction should not apply to a member of a society-registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1893.This Act, under which co-operative societies were registered, limiteda niember&apos;s shareholding to  200 and the interest on that holdingto 5 per cent. As there was no restriction on the membership ofco-operative societies, and their membership was in fact large, it followed that a member could have only a remote financial interestin any contract affecting his society. This afforded good ground fordifferentiating him from a shareholder in an ordinary profit-makingcompany, where a holding of  200 might represent a major interestin the company.The Lord President said that this proposal had been considered on 28th November by the Lord Presidents Committee, who had been disposed to favour it but had thought the Cabinet should considerit in view of its political implications. There was a risk that, ifthe Government accepted such an amendment, they would be chargedwith discriminating in favour of their political supporters.In discussion stress was laid on the practical difficulties towhich the existing restriction gave rise in areas where a largeproportion of the local councillors were members of co-operative societies. Instances were quoted of occasions when the efficientdespatch of local authority business had been prejudiced by this restriction. It was also emphasised that the restriction was unneces-sary, since the financial interest of an individual member of aco-operative society in a particular contract was so small as to be negligible.On the other hand it was felt that there would be great political difficulty in defending a proposal to relax this restriction only inrespect of members of co-operative societies. The Government wouldcertainty be charged with discriminating in favour of their politicalsupporters, and it would be difficult to meet that criticism. If this concession were to be made to the members of societies registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1893, it shouldalso extend to shareholders with a comparable interest in limited liability companies. The point that a holding of  200 might repre-sent a major interest in an ordinary company might be met bylimiting the concession to persons whose shareholding did not exceed 200 or one-hundredth of the total capital of the company, whicheverwas the less.It was the view of the Cabinet that an amendment to the LocalGovernment Bill on the lines suggested in CP. (47) 319 should beaccepted only if it were extended so as to cover persons having a comparable holding in limited liability companies.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Health and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland to consider, in consultation with the Lord34725-1 b 2
President, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the LordChancellor, how section 76 of the Local Government Act,1933, could best be amended so as to enable members ofco-operative societies and shareholders with a comparableinterest in limited liability companies to take part, afterdisclosing their interest, in proceedings of a local council which affected the interest of their society or company.(2) Agreed that, if in pursuance of Conclusion (1) above, aprovision were devised which held the balance evenlybetween members of co-operative societies and share-holders in limited liability companies, and if it were brought forward by a private member as an amendment to the Local Government Bill, the amendment might beaccepted by the Government,Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in     the House of Commons in the following week,the House of The Cabinet took note that Parliament would be adjourned forCommons.       the Christmas Recess on 19th December and would re-assemble on20th January, 1948.Parliament. 3.   The Lord President said that the Select Committee which members&apos; had been reviewing the working of the Pensions Fund for MembersPensions of the House of Commons had recommended that the legislationFund. governing the administration of the Fund should be amended so as toextend its scope and provide for increased benefits. They had alsocontemplated that the annual contribution to the Fund might bereduced. Among Government supporters there was some feeling that the present rate of contribution should be maintained and thebenefits still further increased. The Government Actuary was,however, of opinion that the increased benefits recommended by theSelect Committee could only be assured if the annual contributionwere raised from  12 to  21. While the decision on this matter should be left to a free vote of the House, it was desirable that theFund should be placed on a sound actuarial basis and it had therefore been arranged that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should present for the information of the House a White Paper embodying theviews of the Government Actuary.The Lord President said that he was inclined to think thatthe annual contribution should be raised and that there mightbe general support in the House for increasing it to  15. The HomeSecretary, who would be replying to the debate, should, however, beleft to decide in the light of the opinions expressed in the debatehow far he should go in advising the House to increase the annual rate of contribution.The Cabinet-Took note of the Lord Presidents statement and endorsedhis recommendation regarding the line to be taken by theGovernment spokesman in the forthcoming debate on theReport of the Select Committee.Scotland. 4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of legislative State for Scotland (CP. (47) 323) submitting various proposals and designed to meet the demand for a greater measure of ScottishAdministrative control over Scottish affairs.Devolution. ^ The memorandum proposed that on agreed occasions scottish bills should be referred to the Standing Committee on scottish bills for consideration in principle before their Second Reading wastaken, without debate, on the floor of the House of Commons; andthat, in addition to the normal Supply Days, four days should be allocated for the discussion of Scottish Estimates by the Standing
Committee on Scottish Bills. It was also proposed that a ScottishEconomic Conference should be. established under the chairmanship of the Secretary of State; that an annual review of Scottish economic affairs should be presented to Parliament; and that special attention should be given to the possibilities of decentralising executive responsibility in relation to Scotland.The main points raised in discussion were : (a) The discussion of Scottish Estimates by the Standing Com-mittee on Scottish Bills would not make it possible to surrenderone of the two Supply Days normally set aside for the discussionof these Estimates on the floor of the House.(b) The establishment of a Scottish Economic Conference underthe chairmanship of the Secretary of State for Scotland, with repre-sentatives of industry as well as of Government Departments, was likely to provoke a demand for a similar conference for Wales in place of the quarterly Conference of Departmental officials. TheGovernment would have to resist this demand, which was likelyto be pressed in the debate on the White Paper on Wales and monmouthshire (Cmd. 7267) after the Christmas Recess, and itwould be helpful if in announcing the establishment of the ScottishEconomic Conference the Secretary of State would avoid any statement that might encourage the Welsh demand.(c) Though the Scottish Trades Union Congress would not be directly represented on the Scottish Economic Conference, itsinterests would be covered by the representation given to the Scottish Council (Development and Industry) and the Scottish Board ofIndustry. The members of the Conference had not been selected as individuals but as representatives of the various Departments and organisations, including the socialised industries, concerned witheconomic matters in Scotland.(d) The Scottish Economic Conference would be treated, on the analogy of the National Production Advisory Council for Industry,as a body with which Ministers could discuss general economic questions. It would not deliberate in public, nor was it contem-plated that it would pass formal resolutions. The terms of reference of the Conference would be agreed with the Chancellor of theExchequer.(e) The annual review of Scottish economic affairs proposed inparagraph 22 of CP. (47) 323 would be designed to supplement and bring up to date the information given in the White Paper on industry and Employment in Scotland (Cmd. 7125).(/) Though it might be desirable at some future date to bring up to date the return of revenue and expenditure in Scotlandpublished in 1932. the advantages to be obtained from a fresh returnwould not at present justify the effort required to produce it.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in CP. (47) 323, subject to thepoints noted in paragraphs (b) and (d) above.Food Prices.(previous reference:CM.(47)91stConclusions,Minute 7.)5. On 27th November the Cabinet had invited the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Minister of Food to reconsider, in thelight of the Cabinets discussion, the proposals submitted in CP.(47) 312 for increasing food prices in order to stabilise the annualtotal of food subsidies at about  400 million. The Cabinet now considered a further memorandum (CP. (47) 324), in which theChancellor of the Exchequer recommended, with the concurrence ofthe Minister of Food, that the Cabinet should approve the- price increases proposed in paragraph 2 (B) of Appendix B to CP. (47)312 on the understanding that their introduction would be spreadas widely as possible over the period from the beginning of january to the end of March 1948.In discussion it was suggested that the public would be ready toaccept a larger increase in the price of shell eggs than that proposed
in CP. (47) 324. It would not be unreasonable to advance the priceof eggs to 3,9. a dozen. The increases in the prices of bacon and teacould then be substantially less than those proposed in CP. (47) 324.The further suggestion&apos; was made that, so long as eggscontinued tp be subsidised, there would be advantage in eliminatingseasonal variations in price and fixing a stable price of 3s. a dozenthroughout the year.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the price of shell eggs should be increased to3s. a dozen, and that the price increases proposed in cp. (47) 324 for bacon and tea should be correspondingly reduced.(2) Subject to the adjustment noted in Conclusion (1) above,approved the price increases recommended in CP.(47) 324.(3) Agreed that the introduction of these price increases shouldbe spread as widely as possible over the period from january to March 1948, and that every opportunity should be taken to associate them with any increases which could be made in the quantity of food-stuffsavailable.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,11th December, 1947.
