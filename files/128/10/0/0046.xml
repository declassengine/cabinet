Marriage ofH.R.H. ThePrincessElizabeth.Civil ListProvision.(previous preference:CM. (47) 93rdConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The Cabinet discussed the line to be taken on behalf of theGovernment in the forthcoming debates on the Report of the SelectCommittee on the Civil List.The Cabinet had agreed that the Chancellor of the exchequer should suggest to the Select Committee that the total provision to bemade to Her Royal Highness The Princess Elizabeth and. His royal highness The Duke of Edinburgh should be  45,000 a year. TheSelect Committee had in the event recommended, by a majority, atotal provision of  50,000 a year. Of the nine Labour members ofthe Committee five had voted in favour of the suggestion originallymade to the Committee by the Chancellor of the Exchequer with the cabinet&apos;s approval : three, including the Prime Minister, had voted for the larger figure : the Chancellor of the Exchequer, as Chair-man, had not voted.The Cabinet were informed- of the proceedings in the SelectCommittee and the circumstances attending the taking of this vote.The Prime Minister had desired to&apos; avoid dividing the Committeeon Party lines, and had thought that a unanimous recommendationcould be obtained on the basis of the higher figure.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Government should, commend to Parlia-ment (with the support of the Government Whip*) therecommendation made by the majority of the Select Com-mittee on the Civil List regarding the financial provision to be made for Her Royal Highness The Princess Elizabethand His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh.*Note. In the light of views expressed by the Parliamentary Labour party on 17th December, the decision was in the event left to a free vote.34725-2Death of Earl 1. The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet would have heardBaldwin. with regret of the death of Earl Baldwin. In accordance withprecedent the leaders of the political Parties would pay tribute tofiis memory when Parliament met that afternoon; and he had been considering whether Parliament should thereafter be adjourned until the following day. The weight of the precedents was in favourof adjourning; but, as the Christmas Recess was so near, it mightbe thought inconvenient to lose a whole day of Parliamentary time.In discussion there was general support for the view that, asthe pressure on Parliamentary time was now so great, there was much to be said against any automatic practice of adjourning bothHouses of Parliament for a whole day on the death of a formerPrime Minister. This was not, however, a matter on which anycontroversy should be allowed to develop between the Parties; and,if there was any substantial body of opinion among ConservativeMembers in favour of adjourning the House oh this occasion, theGovernment should meet their wishes.The Cabinet Invited the Chief Whip to take soundings about theprobable views of Conservative Members; and. agreed that parliament should not be adjourned for the day as a mark of respect for the memory of the late Earl Baldwin unless there was reason to believe that a substantial body ofopinion among Conservative Members would prefer &quot;that course. **note. In the event both Houses of Parliament were adjourned for one dayas a mark of respect for the memory of the late Earl Baldwin the House ofCommons on 15th December, and the House of Lords on 17th December.
economic affairs.(previous reference:CM. (47) 92ndConclusions,Minute 2.)Man-Power.Production.Stocks.OverseasEconomicPosition.Drain onReserves.Publicity.3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP. (47) 332) covering the second of his periodical reports on the economic situation.The following points were raised in discussion : Was there not scope for a more sustained and better co-ordinateddrive to recruit labour for the textile industries ? The Cabinet were informed that Regional Officers of the Departments concerned were now examining the possibility of diverting female labour from otherindustries in the textile areas. The suggestion was made thatrecruitment might be assisted if additional day nurseries were pro-vided in these areas either by the local authorities with increasedGovernment grants or by the factories. Against this, it was argued that any substantial increase in the rate of Government grant would seriously weaken the local authorities&apos; sense of financial respon-sibility; and that the provision of day nurseries in factories mightbe dangerous from the point of view of the children&apos;s health.It was suggested that the production targets set for the textile industries might be raised.It was suggested that the production of anthracite might be stimulated by a suitable publicity campaign in the anthracitedistricts in South Wales designed to bring home to the miners the relation between the export of anthracite and the import of canadian wheat and other food-stuffs.Anxiety was expressed, about the continued decline in stocksof pig iron and scrap, and. the question was raised whether effective measures had been taken to ensure the efficient collection of scrap.Had every effort been made to release surplus shipping for con-version into scrap ? Ministers recalled that when the future ofRosyth Dockyard was discussed by the Defence Committee on 8th August (D.O. (47) 19th Meeting, Minute 3), it had been sug-gested that H.M. Dockyards should be employed on the breaking upof ships. Had any action been taken on this suggestion ? TheCabinet were informed that the Defence Committee were shortly to consider whether five capital ships should now be scrapped.Should special efforts be made to export additional tractorsimmediately to European countries in time for the spring ploughing?It was pointed out that 25 per cent, of the total United. Kingdomtractor output was allocated for export, and that this figure couldnot be increased without prejudice to home agriculture. It wasagreed, however, that the Board of Trade should consider whetherthe export of tractors during the next two months might be adjusted to the immediate needs of the European countries in time for the spring ploughing.There had been no improvement in the rate of drain on theGovernments gold and dollar reserves. Import prices had con-tinued to rise, and the disparity between import and export prices had further increased. Discussions with the Indian and PakistanGovernments would start early in January. A satisfactory agree-ment might still be reached with the Canadian Government, whowere, however, anxious to ease their own dollar position by sellingto the United States food-stuffs and raw materials which we wishedto obtain.At a recent meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party it hadbeen suggested that the Government should provide Members ofParliament with periodical reports on the economic situation. Wouldthere be any objection to the circulation to Members of a document on the lines of the Economic Bulletins prepared by the economic information Unit? It was agreed that this proposal should befurther examined.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Health, in consultation with theMinister of Labour and the President of the Board ofTrade, to consider whether additional day nurseriesmight be provided as a means of encouraging recruit-ment to the textile industries;

The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP. (47) 334) and the Minister of Health (CP.(47) 329) regarding a decision of the Production Committee that.B.A. priority for building labour should in future be limitedto a very small number of building projects of national urgency.The Minister of Health said that the proposal put forward inhis paper was that local authority housing schemes should continueto enjoy W.B.A. priority for a further period of at least six months.He now believed, however, that the essential needs of the localauthority housing programme might be met by other means; andhe would prefer to discuss his revised proposals in the first instancewith the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister of Labour andthe Minister of Works.The Cabinet-Took note that the Minister of Health would discuss withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister of Labourand the Minister of Works proposals for safeguarding thesupply of labour for the local authority housing programme.Ci5il 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theAviation. Minister of Supply and the Minister of Civil Aviation (CP. (47)(Previous 331) covering a proof of an interim Report on the Tudor I aircraftReference: by a Committee appointed to enquire into the development andC.M.(47)38th production of Tudor aircraft for the British Airways Corporations.Conclusions, The memorandum stated that in Parliament and the press keenMinute 7.) interest was taken in the outcome of this Committee&apos;s enquiry, andEnquiry recommended that the Report should be presented to Parliament atinto Tudor once without any statement of the Governments attitude towardsAircraft. its findings.In discussion there was general support for the view that thisReport should not be published until the Government had had timeto define their attitude towards its findings and to consider whetherthe situation which it disclosed called for any modifications ofGovernment policy. The Report provided material for criticism which would be directed, not merely against the British overseas airways Corporation, but against the Ministries of Civil aviation and Supply and against the Government; and it was expedient thatthe Government should have time to consider, before the Report was published, what could be said to forestall or mitigate such criticism.Opportunity should also be taken to consider what could be saidto offset the prejudicial effects which the publication of the Report
might have in foreign countries. There was the further point thatsome of the specific recommendations (e.g., that the Governmentshould hire Tudor I aircraft to the Corporations) should not be thrown open for public discussion long in advance of the expression of the Governments views upon them.The Cabinets conclusion was that the publication of the report should be delayed so that they might have an opportunity to formu-late their views on it and to decide Avhat statement should be madeon their behalf simultaneously with its publication. Meanwhile,the Minister of Supply should say, in reply to enquiries, that theReport had been received and was being considered.Discussion then turned on the relations between the airways corporations and the Ministries of civil Aviation and Supply, asreflected in this Report, The Cabinet were informed that the responsible Ministers were not satisfied with the existing procedure by which the Ministry of Supply ordered civil aircraft from manu-facturers as agents of the Corporations, and that they were alreadyconsidering how this procedure should be modified. The suggestion was made in discussion that much of the existing difficulty mightbe obviated if civil aircraft were ordered by the Government or bya Government Corporation and leased to the operators. Under theexisting distribution of responsibilities one of the inherent difficul-ties was that the first concern of the Corporations was the most efficient operation of their services, while the Government had alsoto have regard to the future of the British aircraft industry.The Cabinet were also informed that the Minister of CivilAviation was concerned at the relations between the airways corporations and the Ministry, as established by the Civil AviationAct, 1946, and was already considering whether there was a case for amending legislation which would create a Board corresponding to the Boards for socialised industries. In this connection variousarguments were used for bringing the Corporations under closersupervision and control by the responsible Minister. Thus, it wasembarrassing that the Corporations should be free to issue, without consultation with the Minister, statements bearing on government policy. It was also suggested that the British Overseas airways corporation had not always been the willing agents of government policy and had on occasion sought to frustrate the execution of decisions taken by the Government.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that publication of the Interim Report of theCommittee of Enquiry into the Tudor Aircraft shouldbe delayed until they had had an opportunity of definingtheir attitude towards its specific recommendations andtheir views on the relations, as reflected in the Report,between the Ministries of Civil Aviation and Supply, theAirways Corporations and the aircraft manufacturersin respect of the ordering of aircraft for operation bythe Corporations.(2) Invited the Lord President, the Chancellor of theExchequer, the Lord Privy Seal and the Ministers ofCivil Aviation and Supply to consider the immediateissues raised by the Report, and to submit to the cabinet a draft statement of the Governments views on these issues for publication simultaneously with the Report.(3) Took note that the Lord President would arrange for theCommittee on the Socialisation of Industries to considerthe statutory relations of the Minister of Civil Aviationwith the Airways Corporations and such other questionsof long-term policy in respect of civil aviation as might arise from the examination of the Report by theMinisters named in Conclusion (2) above.
149 CM. 95 (17)White Fish 6.   The Cabinet had before them Industry. ... A memorancium by the Minister of Agriculture and theSecretary of State for Scotland (CP. (47) 328) outliningproposals for the establishment of a White Fish Produc-tion Board to reorganise, regulate and develop the whitefish industry; and(ii) A memorandum by the Minister of Food (CP. (47) 325)setting out his objections to these proposals and sugges-ting that a Fish Executive should be established tosecure improvements in the trawling fleet for near and middle waters and in the facilities for handling and marketing fish, and that plans should be prepared fornationalising the wholesaling of fish in the nextParliament.The Cabinet were informed that the conflicting views of the fisheries Ministers and of the Minister of Food had been consideredby the Lord Presidents Committee, who had remitted the matter to a sub-committee under the chairmanship of the Minister ofTransport. The recommendations of this sub-committee, which were broadly in line with the proposals in CP. (47) 328, had beenapproved by the Lord Presidents Committee on 12th August, theMinister of Food alone dissenting.It was explained that the primary object of the proposals of the fisheries Ministers was to create conditions in which trawler-ownerswho fished in the near and middle waters could make a living.Though their earnings had been high since the war, many of themneeded new vessels which would provide better methods of catchingand handling fish, and better accommodation for the crews. More-over, without some measure of reorganisation and regulation oflandings, the market would again be flooded with inferior fish fromthe more distant waters and those fishermen who caught the betterqualities of fish would be driven out of business. The proposedProduction Board would consist of independent members and wouldbe subject to the directions of the Fisheries Ministers, who could see that it did not pursue a restriccionist policy.In discussion the following points were raised : (a) A White Fish Production Board, even though it consisted of independent members and operated subject to the direction ofthe Fisheries Ministers, would tend to look at the problems of theindustry too much from the point of view of the producer. Forthis reason some Ministers were inclined to favour a scheme underwhich any necessary powers for reorganisation, regulation anddevelopment of the industry would be exercised by the FisheriesDepartments themselves or by a body similar to the developmentcouncils under the Industrial Organisation and development act, 1947.(b) Instead of attempting to improve the fishing fleet by the merger of trawler-owners and by granting loans for the building of new fishing vessels, would it not be better to set up a government organisation which would build trawlers and hire them to fishermen?(c) Though some of the vessels fishing in the middle and nearwaters were obsolete, the Admiralty had transferred to fishermensince the war a large number of newly-built motor vessels and had given substantial financial assistance for the reconditioning oftrawlers which had been taken for war service.(d) The Fisheries Ministers had suggested that, as the Ministerof Food would retain complete control of the quantities of foreign-caught fish landed in the United Kingdom, he could by adjustingimports prevent any exploitation by United Kingdom producers. Itshould, however, be noted that once we had overcome our presentbalance of payments difficulties we should probably have inter-national obligations which would make it impossible to make suddenchanges in the quantities of foreign-caught fish admitted to theUnited Kingdom.23
(e) The United Kingdom fishing industry would have to faceincreasing competition from the fleets of other European countries,including Russia.(/) The maximum fish prices originally fixed by the Ministryof Food had perhaps not allowed sufficiently for differences in quality, but the price schedules had recently been adjusted to remedythis defect.The general view of the Cabinet was that, in the light of thepoints made in discussion, a further attempt should be made toevolve a scheme which would improve the efficiency of the fishing industry and safeguard the position of fishermen fishing the middle and near waters without incurring the risks which Ministers sawin the establishment of a Production Board on the lines proposedin CP. (47) 328. The aim should be to devise a system which would ensure to the public ample supplies of fish of good quality at reason-able prices and the problem should be considered primarily from thisangle.The Cabinet-Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for aCommittee of Ministers to re-examine, in the light of thediscussion, the proposals made in CP. (47) 328 and cp. (47) 325.Council of foreign ministers.(previous reference:CM. (47)90thConclusions,Minute 2.)7. The Foreign Secretary said that the present meeting of theCouncil of Foreign Ministers was unlikely to lead to agreementbetween the Four Powers on the main issues outstanding in respectof Germany. Unless there was a radical change in the present attitude of the Soviet Government, he saw no purpose in continuing the discussions through the medium of the Council ofMinisters.JeoreignThe Cabinet took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,15th December, 1947.
