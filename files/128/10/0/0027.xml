1. The Foreign Secretary said that the United states authorities had j k notified him in advance of their intention to propose the establishment of an Interim Standing Committee ofthe Assembly and of a committee to study possible changes in theprovisions of tha Charter relating to the veto. He had asked theMinister of State to make this clear to the Assembly and had suggested that the Minister of State should support the proposed appointment of a committee on the question of the veto with a viewto the preparation of a report for the meeting of the Assembly in1948. As regards the proposed Interim Standing Committee, hehad advised the Minister of State to indicate that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were willing that the proposal should be studied duringthe present Session of the Assembly, but had asked him not at thisstage to commit His Majesty&apos;s Government to support of it. Hehad also suggested to the Minister of State that in his speech tothe Assembly he should point out that there was no foundation forthe charges made against His Majesty&apos;s Government by M.Vyshinsky.The Cabinet Endorsed the instructions given to the Minister of State&apos;by the Foreign Secretary.2. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that the Inter-Parliamentary Union had arranged for a Delegation from theUnited Kingdom Parliament to visit Roumania early in October.In accordance with the usual practice, the members of the Delega-gation had been selected by the Speaker. The Speaker had not included Mr. Piratin, M.P., Mr. Pritt, M.P., or Mr. Solley, M.P.,in the Delegation, but notwithstanding this these Members of Par-liament had received invitations to visit Roumania. It had beensuggested to him that he should attempt to dissuade the members from accepting the invitations, but he felt that any such attemptwould be fruitless.The Minister of Health suggested that the Roumanian Govern-ment should be informed, through His Majesty&apos;s Representative in roumania, that the selection of members of Parliamentary Delega-tions was a matter for the United Kingdom Parliament itself andthat any additions to the selection made by Parliament would beregarded ar. an unwarranted interference. Accordingly, theRoumanian Gc &quot;eminent would be well advised, in their own interests, to a .. *nge for the invitations to the three additional members of Pa ^ment to be withdrawn. It should be made clear at the same time that there would be no objection to their visitingRoumania at some other time.The Cabix,r lvited the Foreign Secretary to handle the matter on theLnes suggested by the Minister of Health.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C.P. (47) 261) covering a joint report by the UnitedKingdom and United States Delegations which had discussedquestions connected with the problem of increasing coal productionin the Ruhr.The Foreign Secretary explained that the report did not inany way prejudice the position of His Majesty&apos;s Government withregard to the future ownership of the Ruhr mines. In the courseof their dibcussions and investigations, the members of the UnitedStates Delegation had come to realise the difficulties with whichthe British authc &quot;i ties had had to contend, such as the large number-1 b 2
Level ofIndustry.(previous reference erence:O.M.(47)63i&apos;dConclusions,Minute 1.)of inexperienced workers, the high average age of the skilled workers and the inadequate food supply. It was proposed to bringthe pits under a German coal management, which would work underthe joint control of the United States and United kingdom authorities. This would make it possible to reduce substantially the size of the British supervisory staff. The transport difficultiesin Germany imposed a severe.handicap on coal production; but itwas hoped that United States equipment would be forthcoming to ease the railway position.The Cabinet Agreed that the recommendations in the report annexed to cp. (47) 261 should be accepted.The Foreign Secretary said that the new level of industry plan would enable progress to be made in settling the question of Germanreparations and would, together with the agreement on coal pro-duction, clear the way for the talks on the finances of the bizonalarea which were due to begin on 6th October. The main feature of the new plan was that the maximum steel output would be fixed at 10-7 million tons a year. It would also make it possible to retainmanv factories which were to have been dismantled under the f ormerplan, but ought to be kept in being if Germany was to be able topay her way. Though the French Government had been opposed tothe new figure for steel output, their opposition had been to someextent mitigated by an arrangement under which, as steel produc-tion rose from its present level towards the maximum, additional supplies of coal and coke would be made available to France.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of proposals for a revised levelof industry for Germany.Trade 4.   The Minister of Food said that he had been informed that negotiations. the Argentine Government had intimated that no more permits forA^nfcine exP0I&quot;t Q* feeding-stuffs would be issued until trade negotiations had been opened wdth them. He understood that the argentine government regarded the failure to send a United Kingdom mission to the Argentine as damaging to their prestige and he hoped thatsome representative of His Majesty&apos;s Government would be sent tothe Argentine at an early date with a view to opening thenegotiations.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had already made arrangements with the President of the Board of Trade for theappointment of a United Kingdom mission to undertake trade negotiations with the Argentine Government. The President ofthe Board of Trade had, however, felt that the departure of themission should be delayed for a short time.The Foreign Secretary suggested that it would improve relations with the Argentine Government if United kingdom ministers would take the Argentine Ambassador into their con-fidence on suitable occasions, as was done with the United states ambassador.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of Food to consult with the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the President of the Board ofTrade with regard to the date on which the UnitedKingdom mission should proceed to the Argentine;(2) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would arrange to see the Argentine Ambassador in connectionwith the forthcoming trade negotiations with theArgentine Government.
Committeeof EuropeanEconomicCo-operation.(Previous.Reference ,CM. (47)60thConclusions,Minute 4.)- 5. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Foreign Secre-tary (CP. (47) 260) covering a copy of the general report of theCommittee of European Economic Co-operation.The Foreign Secretary said that some amendments had beenmade in the text annexed to CP. (47) 260. In particular, thechapter dealing with economic co-operation had been altered so asto make more definite the resolve of the participating countries to abolish as soon as possible the abnormal restrictions at presenthampering their mutual trade and to aim at a sound and balancedmultilateral system. The chapter had also been amended so as tosafeguard the position of the United Kingdom with regard to tradewithin the Commonwealth. Other amendments were designed toset a time limit on the study of the customs union proposal and tom^et the criticisms made by the Swiss and Swedish representativesof the pz^proposal to set up a joint organisation to review the executionof the programme by making it clear that this organisation wouldnot continue beyond 1951. The report reflected credit on the Com-mittee of European Economic Co-operation and on the british delegation which had played so large a part in preparing it, andhe hoped the Cabinet would authorise him to sign it on behalf ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government on 22nd September. He understood thatthe intention of the United States Government was to ask congress to vote a lump sum to meet the needs set out in the report and toleave the distribution of this sum to be settled in the course of bilateral negotiations with the Governments of individual countries.The Cabinet-Authorised the Foreign Secretary to sign the general reportof the Committee of European Economic Co-operation.Palestine.(previous reference:CM. (47) 41stConclusions,Minute 2.)6.   The Cabinet had before them (i) a memorandum by the Foreign Secretary (CP. (47) 259)summarising the main recommendations of the United NationsSpecial Committee on Palestine and suggesting the line to be takenby the United Kingdom delegate when the Report of the SpecialCommittee came before the General Assembly; and(ii) a memorandum by the Minister of Defence (CP. (47) 262)covering an appreciation by the Chiefs of Staff of the military and strategic implications of the plans proposed in the Majority andMinority Reports of the Special Committee.The Foreign Secretary said that when the Report of the SpecialCommittee came before the General Assembly the representatives1 other countries might be tempted to put forward unworkable pro-posals, relying on the fact that it would be for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to implement them. To obviate this, it was essentialthat the United Kingdom delegate should make the attitude of HisMajesty&apos;s Government clear from the start. His own view was thatthere would be grave disadvantages in any decision by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to undertake the task of carrying out either the recom-mendations of the Majority Report or any alternative plan of par-tition which might be proposed, or the recommendations of the minority Report. He had therefore been reluctantly driven to theconclusion that the right course was for His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto announce their intention to surrender the Mandate and, failinga satisfactory settlement, to plan for an early withdrawal of theBritish forces and of the British administration from Palestine.He did not wish to express any opposition to the recommendations in either Report, but he was satisfied that, unless His Majesty&apos;sGovernment announced their intention of abandoning the Mandateand of withdrawing from Palestine, there was no prospect of an agreed settlement; and he was not willing that British forces shouldbe used to enforce a settlement which was unacceptable to either the Arabs or the Jews.34393-1b 3
The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he&apos;was ingeneral agreement with the views expressed by the Foreign Secre-tary. It was to be hoped that the proposed announcement would produce an agreed settlement, but it had to be realised that no suchsettlement might be forthcoming, in which event His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would have to face the prospect of leaving palestine in a state of chaos which would make it difficult to safeguard Britishinterests, such as airfields and oil installations.The Minister of Defence said that if the proposed announce-ment were to induce the Arabs and the Jews to co-operate and invite His Majesty&apos;s Government to assist them in drawing up anew Constitution for the country, it should be possible to^satisfy the strategic requirements of the United Kingdom in Palestine. If,however, there were no agreement His Majesty&apos;s Government wouldbe faced with the choice between (i) ceasing to administer Palestineimmediately and merely maintaining such order as was necessaryto ensure the withdrawal of British forces and civilians, and (ii)announcing a date after which British administration in palestine would cease and the withdrawal would begin, but attempting tomaintain law and order throughout the whole country until thatdate. The former course could be adopted without further military reinforcements, but it would no doubt involve loss of life and property. On the other hand, to maintain law and order over thewhole country until a specific date for withdrawal would requiresubstantial reinforcements.The Minister of Health said that the first task of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should be to convince all concerned that they did not wish to retain forces in Palestine for imperialist reasons. If this were made clear it would have a very great effect on opinion in theUnited States. He suggested that the draft statement annexed to cp. (47) 259 should be recast in such a way as to emphasise that,whatever decision were reached, it was the&apos; intention of HisM-ajesty&apos;s Government to relinquish the Mandate. This might befollowed by an offer to co-operate with the Jews and the Arabs incarrying out any settlement agreed between them. It might also bedesirable to offer to co-operate in carrying out any settlement agreed on by the United Nations, provided that other members of the united nations shared adequately in this task by sending forces to palestine.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that if the proposal to relinquish the Mandate and withdraw the British administration and British forces from Palestine was being put forward seriouslyand not merely as a threat to induce the contending parties to agreeor other members of the United Nations to provide us with assistanceto enforce the Majority Report, every effort should be made toenable the withdraAval to be carried out in an orderly way and toavoid its being interpreted as a confession of weakness on &quot;the partof His Majesty&apos;s Government. Otherwise, there was a clanger thatthe withdrawal of British forces from Palestine would seriouslyundermine our position in the Middle East. He felt that, if theUnited Nations Assembly accepted the Majority Report and if the member nations were willing to co-operate fully in enforcing it,His Majesty&apos;s Government should not withhold their co-operation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that it should be made clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government intended to relinquish theMandate finally. He also felt that a date for the withdrawal of theBritish administration and British forces should be announced assoon as possible, though he realised that it would be impolitic toname a date before the Assembly had been able to give full considera-tion to the Report of the Special Committee. If an agreed settle-ment could not be reached in Palestine, that country was of nostrategic value to His Majesty&apos;s Government and the maintenanceof British forces in it merely led to a heavy drain on our financial resources and to the creation of a dangerous spirit of anti-Semitism.He was strongly opposed to the despatch of any further British
7. The Minister of Fuel and Power recalled that on 9th Sep-tember the Cabinet had decided to adhere to the view communicatedto the National Union of Mineworkers on 25th August that, if inany area arrangements were made for Saturday working, a workershould not qualify for attendance bonus if he had not worked thefull number of six shifts a week where required under the new-arrangements. He had subsequently received a minute from thePrime Minister reminding him that the Cabinet were anxious tosecure increased working hours in the coalmining industry duringthe present emergency, and adding that if, as appeared to be thecase, the National Union of Mineworkers were prepared to allowtheir members to work systematic organised overtime on the fiveCoal.Hours ofWorking intheCoalminingIndustry.(previous reference:CM. (47) 75thConclusions,Minute 6.)forces to Palestine, and he did not believe we could rely on anyother members of the United Nations to provide forces to help in enforcing a settlement.The President of the Board of Trade supported the proposals made in CP. (47) 259, but suggested the omission of the second sentence of paragraph 8 of the draft statement annexed to CP. (47)259, which stated that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be ready to hand over the administration of Palestine to any authority 1esig-nated by the Assembly as soon as that authority declared itself in aposition to assume full responsibility. An offer of this kind might lead to His Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs being forced to retain respon-sibility for the administration for an indefinite period.The Secretary of State for Air said that he was convinced that acceptance by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the recommendations that the Mandate should be terminated and that independenceshould be granted in Palestine at the earliest practicable date wouldhave a marked effect on public opinion, both among Jews and arabs and in the United States. It might well be that in the course of thediscussion in the Assembly neither the majority nor the minorityplan would be accepted, and something approaching the schemesuggested by the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State forthe Colonies in 1946 would be approved. He suggested that thestatement by the United Kingdom delegate might include semereference to the eleventh recommendation of the Special Committee,which contained an appeal against acts of violence, and should stress the fact that unless Jews and Arabs were willing to co-operate inan agreed settlement the cause of Zionism was doomed.The Prime Minister said that in his view there was a closeparallel between the position in Palestine and the recent situationin India. He did not think it reasonable to ask the British adminis-tration in Palestine to continue in present conditions, and he hopedthat salutary results would be produced by a clear announcement that His Majesty&apos;s Government intended to relinquish the Mandateand, failing a peaceful settlement, to withdraw the British adminis-tration and British forces. The draft statement annexed to cp. (47) 259 should be revised in the light of the Cabinefs discus-sion. The revised statement should include the amendment suggestedby the President of the Board of Trade, but it should not commitHis Majesty&apos;s Government unconditionally to co-operate with othermembers of the United Nations in implementing any policyrequiring the use of force, nor should it refer to the points men-tioned by the Secretary of State for Air.The Cabinet-(1) Approved generally the proposals outlined by the foreign secretary in CP. (47) 259;(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies to revise the draft statement annexed to CP. (47) 259 on the lines indicated by the PrimeMinister;(3) Authorised the Minister of State for Commonwealth Bela-tions to arrange to communicate copies of the revised draft statement to Dominion Governments.

working days, on a basis to be arranged locally, tbis should be triedout. As a result of further discussions between the National coal board and the National Union of Mineworkers a provisional agree-ment had been reached and this would come before the JointNational Negotiating Committee on 23rd September for final approval.  The main features of this agreement were : (i) Full implementation of the five-day week agreement,including regular attendance, full effort and the abolition -tion of restrictive practices. Arrangements for workingorganised overtime at any pit not to be considered untilthe normal shifts we:re being satisfactorily worked there.(ii) Divisional Boards and Area Executives of the NationalUnion of Mineworkers to collaborate in arranging that,in pits where the conditions mentioned in paragraph (i)had been attained, as many Saturday shifts should be worked as practicable or, alternatively, that an addi-tional half-hour overtime should be worked daily,(iii) Any additional shift worked to be of the length previouslyworked in the district before the five-day week agree-ment. Arrangements to be made locally for the atten-dance of a full complement of coal producers to clear allfaces which it had been agreed to work on the additionalshift.(iv) Additional time worked under the agreement to be paid as overtime.(v) Any local or area agreement to be designed to ensure thatthe number of workmen and the proportion of each classof workmen attending for work on any additional shiftwould ensure that the pit was worked with reasonableefficiency and economy.(vi) The terms and conditions to be attached to the overtime,including the number of additional shifts to be workedand the time of commencement of each shift, to be fixed by agreement between Divisional Boards and AreaExecutives.(vii) Any agreement made under these conditions to be termin-able by the National Coal Board at any time after thefirst month&apos;s operation if, for any reason, it was not practicable in the Board&apos;s opinion to work with reason-able economy and efficiency.His Department took the view, with which he agreed, that an agree-ment on these lines offered the best chance of obtaining an increasein output.The Prime Minister said that in his minute to the Ministerof Fuel and Power of 12th September he had emphasised that, ifSaturday working were resorted to, it must be so Organised as not to encourage absenteeism on other days of the week and that accordingly it was necessary to adhere to the decision that anybonus payment to a worker should be conditional on his havingworked the full number of six shifts a week where required underthe new arrangements. He could not understand why in the negotia-tions the National Coal Board had abandoned a condition whichthe Government had so clearly laid down.In further discussion reference was made to the followingpoints : (a) The Government had indicated clearly that they preferredthe adoption of a longer working day to Saturday working, and,though a section of the National Union of Mineworkers was opposedto the longer working day, it was noteworthy that the Union hadconceded that certain areas and pits would prefer it. Yet thedraft agreement between the National Coal Board and the NationalUnion of Mineworkers reversed the Governments preference by placing Saturday working in the forefront and mentioning the longer working day merely as a possible alternative.
Balance ofPayments.Housing.(previous reference:C.M.(47)74thConclusions,Minute 2.)8. The Minister of Health said that local authorities were pressing for a statement of the Governments intentions with regardto the housing programme and he would be seriously embarrassedif any announcement had to be delayed until the examination ofthe investment programme as a whole had been completed. It wouldnot be enough merely to say that the Government proposed to con-concentrate more on the construction of houses for miners and agricul-tural workers, and he hoped he might be authorised to announce that any houses already contracted for would proceed and that therewould be no reduction of the total programme announced for 1947.The President of the Board of Trade said that he understoodthat the report on the investment programme would be ready bythe end of September. Any announcement on.the lines suggested,by the Minister of Health would prejudice the decisions which ministers would have to take when the examination of the pro-gramme had been completed.The Cabinet-Invited the President of the Board of Trade and theMinister of Health to discuss what, if any, announcementcould be made about the housing programme in anticipation of the review of the investment programme as a whole.(6) The proposal that the Divisional Boards and the AreaExecutives of the Union should decide where the working of normalshifts was sufficiently satisfactory to justify the introduction of saturday working or of organised overtime would be a fertile source of disputes, and more coal might be lost through the resulting stop-pages than would be gained by the extra hours worked. TheGovernments proposal that the individual miner should receiveextra payment in respect of Saturday working only if he had workedsix shifts was simpler and more easily applied.(c) There were already indications that in some areas, even under the five-day week, a number of miners absented themselvesbecause they were content with four days&apos; pay. This suggested thatthe introduction of a system which would give workers overtimefor Saturday working without the conditions laid down by theGovernment would lead to widespread absenteeism on other days of the week.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power to inform theNational Coal Board that the Government adhered totheir view that additional output should be sought bythe working of an additional half hour on the existingworking days wherever this was possible, and that, whereresort was had to Saturday working, the workers shouldnot be entitled to the attendance bonus unless they had worked the full number of six shifts where required under the new arrangements;(2) Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power to take a suitable opportunity to inform the National Union of Mine-workers that the Government regretted the attitude adopted by the Union in this matter and hoped theywould be prepared to accept conditions which would secure an increased output of coal without, at the sametime, encouraging absenteeism.
Economic 9.   The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that it had beenPlanning decided to add a representative of the Treasury to the EconomicBoard. Planning Board.(previous reference:CM. (47) 60thConclusions,Minute 3.)India.(previous reference:CM. (47) 60thConclusions,Minute 1.)10. The Prime Minister said that the Pakistan Governmenthad asked that a conference of representatives of Dominion Govern-ments should be summoned immediately to consider the question ofthe protection of Muslims in India. It would be impossible forHis Majesty&apos;s Government to refuse to communicate with DominionGovernments on the matter but, in his view, it would be undesirable to encourage these Governments to accept the proposal for aconference.The Cabinet-Endorsed the views expressed by the Prime Minister and agreed that the terms of the communication to DominionGovernments should be settled by him in consultation withthe Ministers immediately concerned.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,20 A September, 1947.
