The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that the governor of Ceylon had reported that the announcement made in Parlia-ment on the previous day on the question of further constitutional progress in Ceylon had been very well received by the State Council.Mr. D. S. Senanayake, the Vice-Chairman of the Board of Ministers,had expressed, on behalf of the Council, warm appreciation of theaction taken by His Maiesty&apos;s Government.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the statement made by thePrime Minister.DoubleBay-shift working in factories.3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Ministerof Labour (CP. (47) 180) on the report of the Committee on DoubleDay-Shift Working.The Minister of Labour said that the Committee had beenappointed in March 1945. Their report, a copy of which was annexed to CP. (47) 180, stressed the economic importance ofmaking more use of the double day-shift system in future, and pointed out that its social inconveniences would be largely offset by compensating advantages and could be mitigated in various ways.The Committee recommended that the normal finishing time forthe second shift should be extended from 10 pum. to 11 p.m. andthat double day-shift working by young persons under 18 should in general be prohibited, though some latitude in this matter mightbe allowed for a period not exceeding two years. He had agreed with the President of the Board of Trade that, before the Govern-ment announced their final views on the questions raised, the report should be published with a view to giving the interests concerned anopportunity of submitting representations on its recommendations.It seemed desirable, however, that, when the report was published,it should be accompanied by a preliminary statement indicating that, while the Government endorsed some of its findings, they werenot satisfied that ail the recommendations were sound and proposedto consult the National Joint Advisory Council for Industry about[34109-1] b 2
them. A draft of this preliminary statement was contained in annex II to CP. (47) 180, and the provisional propositions on thebasis of which it was proposed to consult the National joint advisory Council were set out in paragraph 4 of CP. (47) 180.The International Labour Conventions about night work by women and young persons in industry would not permit the substitution of 11 p.m. for 10 p.m. as the normal finishing hour for double day-shift work, and it was proposed that, when these Conventions came up for review at the International Labour Conference in 1948, anattempt should be made to secure amendments which would permitan extension to 11 p.m. Unless, however, the Conventions weredenounced before November 1947 we should be bound by them fora further 10 years, and, in order to keep the position open, it was proposed that we should denounce the Conventions before that date.The following points were made in discussion (a) The Minister of Fuel and Power said that while he wasnot opposed to the proposals in CP. (47) 180, he feared that theextension of double day-shift working would aggravate the coalsupply problem by increasing the consumption of electricity owingto longer machine-running time and extended space-heating.In reply it was pointed out that the new system would not inany event come into operation for a year or two, and that it wouldnot in all cases lead to an increase in the load.(b) The Minister of Education pointed out that paragraph 4 (c)of CP. (47) 180 put no limit on the time for which consideration ofthe question of prohibiting the employment of persons under 18 ondouble day-shifts might be postponed. Since it would be verydifficult to provide for the education of young persons employedon double day-shifts, it was desirable to adhere to the recommenda-tion of the Committee that any postponement should not be&quot; for aperiod of more than two years.(c) There was general agreement that the Ministers concerned,should give special consideration to the measures necessary to mitigate the educational and social inconveniences which wouldresult from the adoption of the double day-shift system.(d) In the proposed discussions with the National joint advisory Council it should not be implied that it was the Govern-menfs view that a working week of 37^ hours would be adequate.-(e) The draft statement in Annex II to CP. (47) 180 shouldbe re-written in simpler language.:    The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Minister of Labour to present to parliament the report of the Committee on Double Day-shift working, and invited him to prepare a revised pre-liminary statement of the Government&apos;s views for publi-cation simultaneously with the report;(2) Agreed that, after the report had been published, theMinister of Labour should consult the National joint advisory Council for Industry on the basis of the pro-visional propositions set out in paragraph 4 of cp. (47) 180, as modified to take account of the points raised at (b) and (d) above;(3) Agreed that the International Labour Conventions aboutnight work by women and young persons in industry should be formally denounced;(4) Agreed that the Social Services Committee should consider what measures would be necessary to mitigate the educa-tional and social inconveniences of an increase in doubleday-shift working in factories.
4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (47) 182) covering a memorandum which he had circulated to the Lord Presidents Committee indicating the mainlines of the Criminal Justice Bill which he proposed to introduce in the 1947-48 Session.The Home Secretary said that, when the Lord Presidents Com-mittee had considered his memorandum (L.P. (47) 8th Meeting,Minute 4), the Lord Chancellor had expressed misgivings about someof the proposals. In subsequent discussions with the Lord Chan-cellor he had been able to reduce the extent of disagreement andthe only substantial point on which there was still a divergence ofopinion was the proposal to abolish the powers of Courts to passsentences of corporal punishment. He was convinced that thisproposal was right on merits and he was satisfied that, if it werenot included in the Bill as introduced, the Government supporters would undoubtedly carry an amendment to include it when the bill was before Standing Committee. The Bill in general followed thelines of the measure introduced in 1988, subject to certain modifi-cations which were set out on page 7 of the Annex to CP. (47) 182.Apart from the provision relating to corporal punishment, it wouldnot make any substantial change in the penalties provided for under the existing law. -It would, however, by enabling prisoners to be classified in a more rational way, lead to very desirable reformsin the treatment of offenders, though its full effect would not be felt until more could be done to replace out-of-date prison buildings.It was probable that, when the Bill was before the House of Com-mons, an amendment would be moved to abolish capital punishment.He proposed that any such amendment should be resisted on theground that it was inappropriate that such a far-reaching changeof the law should be included in the Bill.The Lord Chancellor said that, though he was still of opinionthat it would be unwise to abolish the powers of courts to passsentences of corporal punishment and would have favoured theretention of the use of the birch, he realised that for political reasons it would be very difficult to do less than had been proposedin the Bill introduced in 1938. As regards the other provisions ofthe Bill, he felt that it was important to avoid improving the con-ditions under which prisoners were treated to such an extent asto destroy completely the deterrent effect of imprisonment.Discussion concentrated first on the question of corporal punishment.There was general agreement that the powers of courts topass sentences of corporal punishment should be abolished. some ministers felt, however, that the Home Secretary&apos;s proposal toretain the power to impose corporal punishment for certain graveoffences against prison discipline could not be justified, and it wassuggested that warders sometimes provoked prisoners to commitsuch offences in the knowledge that they could be punished byflogging. Against this it was pointed out that, if the power toimpose corporal punishment for offences against prison disciplinewere withdrawn, there would be no effective legal sanction againstprisoners who assaulted their warders and there would be a strongtemptation for the warders to take the law into their own hands.Corporal punishment for offences against prison discipline wasinflicted only with the express consent of the Home Secretary on therecommendation of the prison visiting committee.The Cabinet then discussed the question of capital punishment.It was agreed that it would be impossible to draft the title ofthe Bill in such a way as to exclude an amendment to abolish capital punishment, and that it would be unconvincing to argue that theinclusion in the Bill of a provision for the abolition of capital punishment would be inappropriate.On the question whether on merits it would be desirable to abolish capital punishment Ministers were divided.It was urged, on the one hand, that public opinion was notyet ready for the abolition of capital punishment and. that it would
be particularly unwise to abolish it at the present time when therewas an abnormal amount of robbery with violence. The Judgeswere convinced that the fear of capital punishment was a realdeterrent, and it was difficult to see what effective alternative punish-ment could be inflicted on murderers. Moreover, if capital punish-ment were abolished in this country, it would be difficult to justifyits retention in the Colonies and in the British Zone of Germany.On the other hand, it was argued that the infliction of capital punishment was degrading to the public and that there was no realevidence of its deterrent effect. Thus, almost all the murders whichthe Home Secretary had had to consider during the past two years had been unpremeditated. The attitude of the Bench to past pro-posals for the reform of the criminal law did not suggest that their judgment in such a matter was reliable, and those government supporters in Parliament who had given most study to the matter were unanimously in favour of abolition.In further discussion the suggestion was made that the best course would be to introduce the Bill without any provisionabolishing capital punishment and to explain in the Second reading debate that, since the question of capital punishment was one onwhich there were differences of opinion transcending Party lines,the Government felt that the matter should be left to a free vote.It should be made clear, however, that, since the matter was obviously one which should be considered by the &quot;House as a whole,it would have to be dealt with at the Report Stage.The Prime Minister suggested that the Cabinet should resume their discussion of the question of capital punishment at a further meeting. This would not preclude the Home Secretary from com-completing the preparation of the rest of the Bill.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals for a Criminal Justice Bill outlined in the memorandum annexed to CP. (47) 182 and, inparticular, agreed that the Bill should abolish the powersof courts to pass sentences of corporal punishment, butthat corporal punishment should be retained for graveoffences against prison discipline;(2) Took note that the Home Secretary would discuss the finance of his proposals with the Chancellor of the Exchequer;(3) Agreed to consider further at a later meeting what attitudethe Government should adopt to the proposal that capital punishment should be abolished.Economic 5    The Foreign Secretary gave the Cabinet a report of hisRecovery of discussions in Paris about the proposed European reconstructionEurope. plan.  These discussions had shown that the Governments of France,(Previous       Belgium and the Netherlands were in substantial agreement withReference:      our proposed method of handling the United States offer.  He had,CM. (47)54th   however, agreed with the French Ministers that it would be pre-Conclusions,     mature at this stage to attempt to reach firm decisions on futureMinute 2.)      procedure and that, as a first step, it would be necessary to ascertain the views of the Soviet Government and to find out whether theywould genuinely co-operate in working out a plan.   M. Molotovhad accordingly been invited to meet M. Bidault and him in thefollowing week.  The French Ministers had been emphatic that everyeffort should be made to secure Soviet co-operation, and it would gravely prejudice the prospects of European recovery if not onlythe Soviet Union but also the countries within the Soviet sphere of interest should stand out.  He had, however, made it clear that,should this happen, His Majesty&apos;s Government would neverthelesspropose to continue their efforts to prepare a plan, in collaboration with other European Governments, and he had been assured thatthe French Government would adopt the same policy.   He hopedthat the necessary machinery for drawing up the plan could be set
Trade 6.   The President of the Board of Trade informed the CabinetDelegation that arrangements had been made for the United Kingdom Tradeto Moscow. Delegation to return to Moscow on 20th June to resume negotiationsfor an Anglo-Soviet trade agreement. The Soviet Ambassador inLondon had been informed that we were not willing to considerthe Soviet request for a revision of the repayment terms of theCivil Supplies Agreement of 1941 except in return for real, sub-stantial and immediate trade advantages, and that it was on this basis alone that the Secretary for Overseas Trade was prepared toreturn to Moscow, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Moscow had been instructed to ensure that the Soviet Minister for Foreign Tradeclearly understood and accepted our point of view; and the replygiven by M. Mikoyan (Moscow telegram No. 1362) appeared to be reasonably satisfactory.The Foreign Secretary said that, in his view, M. Mikoyan&apos;reply was unsatisfactory, since it gave no firm assurances on thepoints which His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador had been asked to raise.He thought that it would be preferable to insist on a reply to these points and he feared that if the Delegation left for Moscow before this had been obtained, there might be prolonged delay beforenegotiations were resumed.The Cabinet Agreed that the United Kingdom Trade Delegation should return to Moscow forthwith with a view to resumingnegotiations for an Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement.Madame 7.   The Cabinet were informed that the wife of the PresidentPeron. of the Argentine Republic intended to visit the United kingdom from 16th July to 19th July. In view of our dependence on the goodwill of the Argentine Government for food supplies, it wouldbe inexpedient not to offer her some form of Government hospitality.On the other hand, the character of her husband&apos;s Government and her conduct during her visit to Spain would make it extremelyembarrassing for the Foreign Secretary to entertain her.The Minister of Food said that it had been suggested that heshould entertain Madame Peron. He felt, however, that it wouldbe invidious were he alone to receive her.up by 5th July, and that discussions with the United States Govern-ment could be started in September. The provisional view reached in Paris was that a Steering Committee, which would sit in London,should be set up to establish, direct and co-ordinate the work ofa number of special functional and technical committees; and ithad been agreed that the Economic Commission for Europe wouldin due course have to be associated with the work of the Committee.The Foreign Secretary added that his impression was thatthe present French Government were tackling their problems withresolution and good sense. They were, however, faced with a very grave situation owing to the exhaustion of their dollar resources and the adverse effect of the severe winter on their home foodproduction.The Minister of Food said that it was important that nothing should be done to prejudice the plans on. which the Ministry ofFood had been working for the development of non-dollar sources of food supplies for this country.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Foreign Secretary&apos;sstatement.
There was general sympathy with the view expressed by theMinister of Food and it was agreed that some form of officialreception attended by more than one Minister and, if possible, bythe Foreign Secretary should be provided for Madame Peron.The Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider whether it wouldnot be possible to arrange for some form of official Govern-;ment reception for Madame Peron at which both he andother Ministers might be present.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,19th June, 1947.
