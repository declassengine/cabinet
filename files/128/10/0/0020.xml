Supplies and services(transitional powers) Bill.(previous reference erence:CM. (47) 68thConclusions.)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (47) 223) covering a draftSupplies and Services (Transitional Powers) Bill.The Cabinet were informed that the effect of the Bill was toenable the powers conferred by Defence Regulations continued inforce by the Supplies and Services (Transitional Powers) Act, 1945,Lo be used for the additional purposes defined in Clause 1 (1). Itthus removed any risk that the Government might be challenged inthe courts for using, in order to deal with the present situation,powers conferred by Regulations continued in force primarily todeal with conditions in the transition from war to peace.The Bill did not confer power to make new Defence regulations or to revive Defence Regulations which had been revoked, and itwould not maintain in force Defence Regulations which would lapsewith the expiry of the Emergency Laws (Transitional Provisions)Act, 1946. Nor would the Bill provide statutory authority for thepayment of subsidies such as acreage payments to farmers or grants for the reconditioning of rural houses. The question whether theBill should include power to make new Regulations had been care-fully considered, but it had been felt that it would be unwise to ask parliament to grant powers which could not be shown to be needed;and, so far as could be seen, all that the Government might wish todo in order to deal with the economic situation could be done underthe Regulations continued in force by the Act of 1945. As regardsthe question of statutory authority for the payment of subsidies, ithad not been the practice to use Defence Regulations for this pur-pose during the war and there seemed to be no justification for doing so in peace.The Cabinet were also informed that the consultations whichhad taken place with the Opposition suggested that they would press for a full day for the Second Reading Debate on the Bill and might wish to move amendments in Committee. In these circumstances itmight be necessary to postpone the adjournment of Parliament untilthe following week.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the draft Supplies and Services (transitional powers) Bill annexed to CP. (47) 223;Took note that notice of presentation of the Bill had alreadybeen given and agreed that the Bill should be publishedforthwith;(3) Agreed that, in order to enable the Bill to be passed beforethe Summer Recess, the adjournment of Parliament forthe Summer Recess should, if necessary, be postponed.Balance ofPayments.(previous reference:CM.(47)68thConclusions.)2.   The Cabinet had before them (i) a memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP.(47) 223) covering a note reporting the results of further examination of the proposals with regard to food pro-duction, economies in petrol, and foreign travel aliow-ances which had been considered by the Cabinet at their meeting on 1st August (CM. (47) Q7th Conclusions,Minute 2);(ii) a memorandum by the Prime Minister (CP. (47) 226)reporting the conclusions reached by the Defence Com-mittee on the proposals made in CP. (47) 221 withregard to overseas military expenditure and the size ofthe Armed Forces; and(iii) a memorandum by the Minister of Food (CP. (47) 224) sug-suggesting the lines of the statement to be made by thePrime Minister on the subject of food imports in the[34134-2]debate on 6th August.b 2
The Minister of A griculture said that he had circulated to theLord Presidents Committee a memorandum (L.P. (47) 137) setting out the requirements of the agricultural industry for the purposeof securing an increase of  100 millions in net production by theyear 1951-52. This expansion was technically possible, but it couldbe achieved only if all the necessary resources, incentives and stimuliwere made available and applied. Exceptional action would haveto be taken by the Government to provide additional labour, houses,hostels, machinery, feeding-stuffs and other requisites, together with substantial financial aid. Thus it would be necessary to recruit140,000 additional British agricultural workers, of whom 60,000would be required by mid-1948, and 30,000 foreign workers wouldbe needed in addition. He proposed that this increase in the labour force should be achieved by a variety of measures, such as the defer-ment of call-up of agricultural workers, the continuance of the Con-trol of Engagement order, and other means which were set out indetail in L.P. (47) 137.In discussion some doubts were expressed whether the Govern-ment would be wise to commit themselves to such an extensive and long-term programme as was proposed, since it might absorb more of the national resources than we could afford to devote to agricul-ture, and would, in any event, be dependent on our being able tosecure the necessary supplies of imported feeding-stuffs.As against this, it was pointed out that an expansion of homefood production would be one of the most effective means of con-serving foreign exchange. There was no reason to suppose that the target proposed would involve an excessive allocation of our national resources to agriculture; and there would be no possibility ofsecuring the necessary co-operation from the farmers for a pro-gramme covering a lesser period.The Cabinet-(1) Eeaffirmed their decision that steps should be taken toenable an increase of  100 millions a year in net agricul-tural production to be achieved by 1951-52.Coal. The   Lord   President  recalled  that   at  their  meeting  on1st August (CM. (47) 67th Conclusions, Minute 2), the Cabinet had agreed that the target for coal production during the period from september 1947 to May 1948, should be 4-i- million tons a week for both deep-mined and opencast output. In his view, it would not bepossible to achieve this target; and, if it were made public, we mightbe involved in export commitments which we should have to honourat the expense of our own needs. He thought that the maximumtarget for the period in question should be 4^ million tons a week for both deep-mined and opencast production.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that under present con-ditions we could not look for production of deep-mined coal in excessof 3,800,000 tons a week. On the assumption that agreement wouldbe reached on longer hours, production might be increased to4 million tons, but the industry would only be discouraged if ahigher target were set. In addition, he thought it conceivable that250,000 tons a week of opencast coal might be obtained.The Foreign Secretary and the President of the Board of Tradesuggested that an average weekly output of 4,200,000 tons of deep-mined coal might reasonably be adopted as the target; but thegeneral view of the Cabinet was that the target should be 4 million tons for deep-mined coal and 250,000 tons for opencast coal.The Cabinet-(2) Agreed that the target for coal production during theperiod from September 1947 to May 1948 should be4 million tons a week of deep-mined coal and 250,000 tonsa week of opencast coal.FoodProduction.
The President of the Board of Trade recalled that at theires. meeting on 1st August (CM. (47) 67th Conclusions, Minute 2), theCabinet had been inclined to favour a scheme under which allremittances in respect of foreign films, including films alreadyimported into the United Kingdom, should be stopped. Any such scheme would mean prohibiting the exhibition of all foreign filmsin this country; and the effect of this would be to reduce by 80 percent, the number of new films available for exhibition to the public.The result would be that many cinemas would have to close downcompletely, and that independent exhibitors would be forced out ofbusiness. In these circumstances he suggested that it might be wiser to impose a 300 per cent, duty on all new imports, which wouldenable us to retain 75 per cent, of the earnings of these films. Thenecessary powers had already been secured in the Finance Act.The Cabinet (3) Agreed that steps should be taken to limit remittances inrespect of foreign films to not more than 25 per cent, ofthe earnings of such films.At their meeting on 24th July (CM. (47) 64th Conclusions,Minute 3), the Cabinet had decided that a saving of 500,000 tons of petrol should be achieved by cuts in the basic ration and in theamount of petrol consumed by commercial vehicles and by theServices; and at their meeting on 1st August (CM. (47) 67th Con-clusions, Minute 2) they had suggested that the possibility of makinga greater saving than 500,000 tons should be considered.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that an additional savingcould not be secured except by a further cut in the basic ration, or afurther reduction in supplementary allowances, or by a cut in the issues of petrol to charabancs. The decision already taken wouldinvolve a substantial reduction in the basic ration and supple-mentary allowances, and he was afraid that, if further reductionswere made, private owners would increasingly resort to the black market for additional supplies.The Minister of Transport said that the Governments pro-posals for stimulating production would throw a heavy burden on road transport. He therefore suggested that the cut in issues of petrol to commercial vehicles should be 5 per cent, instead of 10 percent., as proposed by the Minister of Fuel and Power.The Cabinet (4) Agreed that the aim should be to secure savings of petrolamounting to 500,000 tons in 1947-48 by the methodsproposed in paragraph 10 of Annex II to CP. (47) 223.Travel. The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that he had proposedthat from 1st October foreign travel allowances should be reduced from  75 for 12 months to  35 for 14 months. He also proposedto limit the allowance of a child to  20 and to make reductions in business allowances. If the Cabinet thought it right, he would beready to reduce the foreign travel allowance further to  25. Hewould greatly prefer not to have to revert to the war-time system under which foreign travel was only rjermitted for special reasons,since this would impose an excessive strain on the administration.The Cabinet (5) Agreed that foreign travel allowances should be reduced from  75 for twelve months to  35 for fourteen months,and that the proportionate allowance for a child shouldbe  20.jyment        The Lord President explained that, though the representativesour.      of the Trades Union Congress with whom the Minister of Labourand he had discussed the Governments tentative proposals for there-deployment of labour had been unable to commit themselves
finally, they had been generally favourable to the proposals and had agreed that, in addition to the negative direction of labour througjthe general application of the Control of Engagement Order, therwas a case for some measure of positive direction. There would hifurther consultations with the National Joint Advisory Council orthe following day.The Minister of Labour explained that he contemplated the ualof positive powers of direction only in exceptional cases whenworkers refused to accept employment offered to them by the employ,ment exchange.The President of the Board of Trade recalled that at the ICabinets meeting on 1st August (CM. (47) 68th Conclusions)doubts had been expressed about the wisdom of attempting to uss:powers of positive direction under peace-time conditions.   Inview it would be unwise to try to use powers of positive direction4to deal with individual recalcitrant workers and, unless the Govern-ment were prepared to embark on the wholesale positive direction oflabour, it would be better for them to confine themselves to the use o:negative powers.The Minister of Health urged that penalties for the contraven-1tion of the Control of Engagement Order should be primarilydirected against the employer.    He supported the view of the IPresident of the Board of Trade that it would be unwise to attempt jto use powers of positive direction in individual cases and pointedout that where a man was unwilling to accept a reasonable offer ofemployment he could be penalised by refusal of unemploymentbenefit.   The Government would find themselves in great difficultiesif they attempted to use powers of positive direction to force workersinto employment in which the conditions were unsatisfactory.The Secretary of State for War pointed out that many men released from the Armed Forces in Class &quot; A &quot; had reinstatementrights, and it had been the practice to allow all men released in class &quot; A &quot; to enter any employment they chose during their 58days of demobilisation leave. He hoped the new proposals wouldnot involve any change in the position of such men.The Prime Minister said that he had assumed that in his state-ment in the Parliamentary debate he would indicate that powers ofpositive direction would be used to a limited extent.The Cabinet-(6) Invited the Minister of Labour to review in the light of thediscussion the draft statement which had been preparedfor the use of the Prime Minister in the parliamentary debate.(7) Agreed that any powers of negative or positive directionwhich it might be decided to exercise should not be usedin such a way as to affect the reinstatement rights of men released from the Armed Forces, and invited the Minis-ter of Labour to consider with the Minister of defence the effect of the exercise of any such powers on the free-dom of choice of occupation which men released in class &quot; A &quot; enjoyed in the period of 56 days&apos; demobilisa-tion leave.Capital The Prime Minister said that he proposed to state in the debateinvestment. on 6th August that in the immediate future it would be necessaryto concentrate on investment projects which would give quietreturns in additional exports or in the strengthening of theindustrial structure which produced exports or essential goods which must otherwise be imported. He would indicate that neff&apos;building of all kinds would have to be strictly limited and that therewould be some curtailment of the housing programme and greaterconcentration on the building of houses for miners and agricultural workers.
The Minister of Health suggested that it would be better toavoid any specific reference to housing for miners and agricultural workers, since this might be held to imply that housing projects in areas such as Plymouth, Coventry and London, where there was avery urgent need for additional houses, would be stopped. He didnot dissent from the view that there should be some redirection ofthe housing effort, but he urged that there should be no suggestionthat the total programme was being cut. Any such suggestion would jeopardise the success of the scheme for payment by results in thebuilding industry.The President of the Board of Trade said that control of capital investment was meaningless without some reduction in the building-programme. There would be no difficulty in finding markets abroadfor any surplus of building materials which might arise as a resultof the slowing down in our building programme.The Cabinet (8) Reaffirmed their decision that there should be a curtail-ment of capital investment projects other than thosecontributing to export or to import saving.The Prime Minister said that it would be seen from CP. (47)226 that the Defence Committee had recommended that by31st December, 1947, there should be a reduction of 133,000 in thenumber of British troops stationed overseas. A further reductionof 77,000 would be made between 1st January, 1948, and 31st March,1948; and there would also be by 31st December, 1947, a reductionof 34,000 in the number of non-British troops employed in theMiddle East and South-East Asia, which was equivalent in termsof cost to a reduction of approximately 21,000 British troops. Theproposed reductions would put a heavy strain on shipping andwould affect the arrangements for granting special leave to men withlong service overseas as well as slowing down the rate of withdrawalof German prisoners of war from the Middle East. In announcing the reductions to Parliament no details would be given of theparticular theatres from which troops were being withdrawn. Withregard, to the size of the Armed Forces, the Minister of defence had been able to recommend a reduction of the estimated strength at 31st March, 1948, from 1,087,000 to 1,007,000. The DefenceCommittee had come to the conclusion that to attempt to bring thenumber below 1,007,000 at 31st March, 1948, by accelerating releaseswould accentuate the difficulties which the Services were experien-influencing through the shortage of trained men to such an extent as tomake it impossible for them to maintain fighting units or to providefor the training of new recruits. On the other band, the Committeehad felt that it might be possible to make a temporary reduction inthe number of men called up under the National Service Acts, andthe possibility of this was now being explored. It would be impos-sible to indicate in the debate what reduction in the size of theForces might be achieved in this way, and he proposed to confinehimself to stating in general terms that this point was being looked into together with the whole question of the size and shape of theultimate peace-time Armed Forces.The Minister of Labour said that, since the meeting of theDefence Committee, the officials of the Departments concerned hadbeen considering how a reduction in the size of the Armed Forcesat 31st March, 1948, could be achieved by a temporary slowing down of the call-up. Before further progress could be made in thismatter, however, it would be necessary to decide whether the aimwas to secure only a small reduction, say, of 10,000, or something ofthe order of 100,000. A small reduction could be achieved by theslowing down of the call-up by administrative action, but any largereduction would require to be carried out by restoring the schedule of Reserved Occupations.The Minister of Defence pointed out that any wholesale defer-ment of men due for call-up in 1947 and 1948 would be regarded as
a breach of the pledges given by the Government to men already Pin the Armed Forces.   He hoped that no decision would be reached Iuntil the results of the enquiries which he was making into the size and shape of the ultimate peace-time Armed Forces were available the Foreign Secretary said that he would be opposed to amscheme of complete exemption of particular classes from nationalservice. He also pointed out that His Majestys Government were*pledged to return all German prisoners of war by the end of 1948&apos;He assumed that the slowing down of the withdrawal of german prisoners of war from the Middle East would not result in failure to carry out this pledge.The Cabinet (10) Approved the recommendations of the Defence committee with regard to overseas military commitments and the size of the Armed Forces as set out in CP. (47) 226, and agreed that in the debate on 6th August it would beimpossible to give any estimate of the extent to whichthe size of the Armed Forces might be reduced by slowinodown the call-up of men under the National Service Act(11) Agreed that arrangements should be made to ensure thatthe temporary slowing down of the withdrawal ofGerman prisoners of war from the Middle East shouldnot involve any breach of the pledge that all german prisoners of war would be repatriated by the end of1948.Balance of The Foreign Secretary said that he had received a communication-Payments tion from the United States Secretary of State, in reply to hisSituation. telegram of 2nd August, accepting the suggestion that discussions should take place forthwith on a high official level concerning thepresent position of the United Kingdom and its immediate implications-tions. Mr. Marshall had said that he was in entire agreement withthe view that such discussions should not be regarded, as affectingthe matters under consideration at the Paris Conference; and, inorder to avoid any misunderstanding on this point, the UnitedStates Government felt that any reference to, or any announcementof, such discussions should, make it clear that they were to deal with problems arising out of the Anglo-American Financial Agreement.Mr. Marshall had added that the decision whether or not to invoke article 12 of the Agreement was one which at this juncture wouldappear to rest with the British Government; but that it should be understood that the United States Government could agree to no action under this article without prior authorisation by theCongress.The Foreign Secretary said that, in view of Mr. Marshall^reference to this point, it would be a tactical mistake to invoke article 12 of the Agreement at this stage.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed with the foreign secretary.  It would be advantageous if at any rate the preliminary discussions could take place in London rather than in Washington,as had been suggested by Mr. Marshall.   If necessary, further jdiscussions could take place in Washington at a later stage.The Cabinet then discussed what should be said in the Parlia-mentary debate on 6th August about the present drain on UnitedKingdom dollar resources and the measures which might be takento remedy the situation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was circulatingto the Cabinet a memorandum showing the effect of the various!factors which had led to the present situation. As the Cabinetknew, there had been no marked increase in the drain on our dollar resources since 15th July, when the convertibility obligation underthe United States Loan Agreement had come into force. In fact,for some time before 15th July we had been obliged to allow certain
countries, such as Canada and the Argentine, to convert into dollarstheir sterling receipts for supplies sold to us. Moreover, there hadbeen a tendency for holders of sterling balances to draw on themfor dollar transactions, though he had done his best to limit theextent of this. In his view, it would be a serious mistake to attemptto deal with the situation by some such dramatic move as the blocking of sterling, since such action would merely accentuate our difficulties. It had to be remembered that we were dependent on theArgentine for such essential commodities as meat, and that, if were fused to pay for it in convertible sterling, the only result wouldbe that supplies from that country would be invoiced in dollars.The Minister of Health said that, in his view, the right course was to block sterling forthwith. Whatever the Prime Minister said in the debate on the subject of convertibility was likely to lead toa run on our dollar resources which would drive us to make sterlinginconvertible. Our aim should be to disentangle ourselves from theUnited States economy since it was obvious that the United states were not prepared to comply with the conditions which would makea multilateral trade system work. Our present negative policy of cutting imports would merely lead to a further restriction of world trade and so aggravate our problem.The Minister of Food supported the Minister of Health. Eventhough the blocking of sterling were to lead the Argentine to demandpayment in dollars, should we be in any worse case than at present when we had to pay in sterling which was straightaway converted into dollars 1 And might we not be able to reduce the calls on our dollar resources from other countries by blocking sterling 1The President of the Board of Trade said that it would be advisable to await the outcome of the debate before taking any steps to block sterling.The Foreign Secretary suggested that, in the parliamentary debate on 6th August, the Prime Minister should make it clear thatthe drain on our dollar resources did not arise by any means exclu-sively from our obligations under the Loan Agreement, and that much of it was due to a world shortage of dollars which had notbeen contemplated or provided for when the Loan Agreement wasmade. The aim of the Loan Agreement, and of other agreementssuch as Bretton Woods, had been to provide the conditions underwdiich a system of multilateral trading wTould operate satisfactorily,but the operation of any such system pre-supposed a fertilising flow of dollars outwards from the United States, whereas in fact duringthe past year or so, owing partly to bad harvests and partly to the cessation of U.N.R.B.A., dollars had tended to flow towards theUnited States. Thus the conditions under which multilateraltrading could operate had not been created. If the system could notbe made to work, then we must look for salvation in some other way.The statement could go on to announce that the United StatesGovernment had agreed to enter into discussions with us regardingour position and its implications.The Secretary of State for Air said that the statement proposedby the Foreign Secretary might be strengthened by some referenceto the severe droughts in Europe and elsewhere, as a result of whichagricultural production had not begun to reach a satisfactory levelin these areas until the present year. This had obliged european countries to look to the Western Hemisphere for a very largeproportion of their food. The solution of our difficulties must befound, first, in higher agricultural production in Europe and othercountries outside the Western Hemisphere; secondly, in higher productivity in the United Kingdom so that we might exchangegoods for food instead of having to pay for our imports in sterling;and thirdly, in an outflow of dollars from the United States to carry the world over it present temporary difficulties.[34134-2] c
The Cabinet-(12) Invited the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of theExchequer to prepare for the use of the Prime minister in the Parliamentary debate a statement dealing withthe drain on United Kingdom dollar resources and themeasures which might be taken to remedy the situation.This statement should be on the general lines indicated by the Foreign Secretary in the discussion.(13) Took note of CP. (47) 224.ofCoal.ExtensionFive-day week toAncillaryWorkers in theCoalminingIndustry.(previous reference erence:C.M.(47)32ndConclusions,Minute 8.)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of fuel and Power (CP. (47) 225) about the claim of the NationalUnion of Mineworkers that the five-day week should be extendedto workers in ancillary undertakings of the National Coal Board.The Minister of Fuel and Power explained that on 5th june the National Coal Board and the National Union of Mineworkershad agreed that the five-day week should not apply to workers in ancillary undertakings. Subsequently the Union had pressed theBoard to agree to its application to such workers, and on 3rd july the Board, after being informed by the Ministry of Fuel and Powerthat any proposal for an extension of the agreement of 5th june was a matter on which the Board should seek guidance from theGovernment, had agreed with the Union on a formula which, by extending the five-day week only to colliery craftsmen and byspecifically excluding workers whose activities had clearly nothing to do with coal-mining, in effect confirmed the agreement of 5th June. Later in July, however, the Union had claimed that this formula had been only provisionally agreed and bad discussed withthe Board a new formula which did not exclude ancillary workers.At this point the Board had indicated that they could not settle ona revised formula without guidance from the Government, and hehad then thought it right to bring the matter before the Lord Presi-president&apos;s Committee, who had agreed (L.P. (47) 23rd Meeting,Minute 3) that the Minister of Labour and be should maintain theattitude that the five-day week was intended to apply to mine-workers as such and not to workers in ancillary undertakings. Inaccordance with this decision he had written to the Chairman ofthe National Coal Board on 28th July stating that it would not be proper for the Board to agree to the extension proposed by theUnion, while concurrently the Minister of Labour bad informedrepresentatives of the Union that the Union should deal with theBoard in the normal way, and that, if agreement could not bereached, the usual arbitration machinery should be invoked. Unfor-unfortunately the Chairman of the National Coal Board had sent a copyof the letter of 28th July to the Secretary of the Union who, atthe meeting which the Prime Minister had held with the Board andthe Union on 30th July, had suggested that, if the Government wereintervening in the matter, the Union should have the right to submit their case directly to the Government. The Secretary of the Unionsuggested that, unless the Union&apos;s claim was granted, there wouldbe stoppages of work. On the other hand, to grant the claim wouldmean agreeing immediately to a five-day week for some 7,000workers employed in ancillary undertakings, such as brick works,central workshops and oven works, and there was no guarantee thatit would be possible to avoid further extension to all workers of thiskind employed by the Board, which in turn might lead to a claim for a five-day week for all workers in the transport, engineering and building materials industries.The following points were made in discussion : (a) The repercussions of granting the claim of the Union were so serious that the Government could not give the National coal board a free hand to negotiate a new formula.
(b) It would be particularly undesirable to concede a five-day week to workers in colliery railways in view of the repercussions ofsuch a concession on other railway workers.(c) There seemed to be no ground for granting to the workerscovered by the claim anything beyond a 44-hour week.(d) If the National Coal Board were not prepared to reject theclaim, the normal arbitration machinery could not be brought intooperation. It would, however, be possible to institute a fact-findingenquiry which would take account of the repercussions on otherindustries.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of Labour, in consultation with theMinister of Fuel and Power, to arrange for a fact-finding enquiry into the claim made by the NationalUnion of Mineworkers;(2) Agreed that it should be made clear to the National coal board that, pending the holding of this enquiry, theyshould not grant the claim made by the Union.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,5th August, 1947.
