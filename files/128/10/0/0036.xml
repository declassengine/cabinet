The Cabinet were informed of recent developments in thesituation in Kashmir, Punjab and Hyderabad.3. The Cabinet discussed the line to be taken on behalf of theAviation. Government in the forthcoming debate on the Adjournment aboutthe flight which the Minister of Civil Aviation had made toAustralia and the Far East.In the course of this discussion it was suggested that furtherconsideration should be given to the question of maintaining aspecial flight of small aircraft for use by Ministers and officials on Government business. The present practice of chartering privateaircraft for this purpose was not wholly satisfactory; and it might prove more economical, as well as more efficient, to arrange for transport Command or one of the Airways Corporations to main-tain a number of such aircraft for such journeys.Doubt was also expressed about the extent to which the airways corporations were giving effect to Government policy, and aboutthe relations between the Corporations and the Ministry of CivilAviation.The Cabinet-(1) Took note that the Prime Minister would discuss with theMinister of Civil Aviation and his Parliamentary Secre-tary the line to be taken in the forthcoming debate on the adjournment;(2) Invited the Minister of Civil Aviation to consider, in con-sultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, whethera special flight of small aircraft should be maintained for the use of Ministers and officials on government business;(3) Invited the Lord President to arrange for the socialisation of Industries Committee to undertake a special reviewof the relations between the Ministry of Civil aviation and the Airways Corporations.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,6th November, 1947.
