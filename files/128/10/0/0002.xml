India.constitutional position.(previous reference:CM. (47) 50thConclusions.)1. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that the Viceroyhad reported that the plan for the transfer of power in India hadbeen favourably received by the leaders of the three political parties.The Cabinet-Invited the Prime Minister to convey to the Viceroy ontheir behalf a message of congratulation on the successful outcome of his negotiations.repatriation of Japanesefrom South-East Asia,2.&apos; The Minister of Defence informed the Cabinet that theService Ministers and the Chiefs of Staff had approved a report bythe Principal Administrative Officers1&apos; Committee setting out therate of repatriation of Japanese from South-East Asia during 1947,and recommending that, in order to raise their morale, the Japaneseshould be informed that their repatriation would- be completed bythe end of the year. The United States Government had originallywished that the work of repatriation should be completed at an earlier date; but, in response to representations from His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, they had agreed in principle that the date of comple-tion should be 31st December, 1947. The necessary shipping wasbeing made available from Japan, and, though the Commanders-in-Chief, South-East Asia, would not find it easy to obtain suitablelabour to replace the Japanese, their difficulties were not regardedas insuperable. The Cabinet should know of this plan of repatria-tion and of the proposal to announce that all Japanese would be repatriated by the end of the year, since the action proposed might lead to ix demand for earlier repatriation of German prisoners ofwar in British hands.The Foreign Secretary said that he was. most anxious that nothing should be done to stimulate a demand for the earlierrepatriation of German prisoners of war. It would be difficult toreceive these prisoners back into Germany at a higher rate than15,000 a month, and it had been agreed that a substantial numberof German prisoners of war should be retained in the UnitedKingdom for the 19418 harvest. The offer of shipping for there patriation of Japanese should be accepted and repatriation should proceed at a rate which would enable it to be completed by the endof 1947, but no public announcement should be made.The Cabinet-Agreed that Japanese in our custody in South-East Asiashould be repatriated at a rate which would enable theprocess to be completed by 31st December, 1947, but thatno announcement of this decision should be made.Admission of 3.   The Cabinet had before them a joint memorandum by the hon-Europeans Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Secretary of State forinto United India (CP. (47) 154) and a memorandum by the First Lord of the kingdom Admiralty (C.P. (47) 155) on the admission of non-Europeans to the armed Forces. United Kingdom Armed Forces.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that before thewar there had been an acknowledged ban on the entry of non-Europeans into all three Services. During the war, however,non-Europeans had been admitted not only as other ranks, but also as temporary commissioned officers, into all,three Services. In 1945it had been decided that non-European entrants should be admitted into the post-war Royal Air Force, provided that they attained the requisite standards, were resident in this country, and could satisfy the selection authorities that they were likely to mix with otherentrants and hold their own in the corporate life of the Service. TheFirst Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State for War,on the other hand, had been unable to agree to the adoption of similar arrangements for entry into the Royal Navy and the Army,and had suggested, as a compromise, that officers and men from[34108-2] b 2
India and the Colonies should continue to enter their own local forces but should be given more facilities for training in and withthe Royal Navy and the British Army. This alternative was not,however, acceptable, since few Colonies could maintain local forces which would provide an adequate outlet for non-Europeans and since it would not meet the needs of persons resident in thiscountry. The. Secretary of State said that he did not wish to minimise the practical difficulties which would be created by the admission of coloured persons to the Royal Navy and the Army.But a major issue of principle was involved, since the existence ofthis colour bar was contrary to the accepted principles of our commonwealth policy, was resented as a sign of racial superiority,and was incompatible with our policy of associating the peoples ofthe dependent Empire in its defence both in war and peace.The Secretary of State for India said that the exclusion of coloured&apos; men from the Royal Navy and the Army would be greatlyresented in India. It would deprive a substantial number of Britishsubjects and British-protected persons resident in this country ofthe opportunity for public service, and it was inconsistent with theimposition on coloured persons of liability for service under theNational Service Acts.The Secretary of State for Air said that the decision taken in1945 to admit non-Europeans to the post-war Royal Air Force hadbeen regarded as a just recognition of the distinguished services which many such men had performed during the war. In fact, thenumber of coloured persons admitted as regular members of theRoyal Air Force was not large and he did not think that if theother two Services adopted the same practice as the Royal Air Forcethey would find themselves compelled to admit an undue number ofnon-Europeans.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, during the war,the normal practice had been for non-European entrants to serve in the local Forces of their own territory and very few short-servicecommissions had been granted to non-Europeans in the Royal Navy.He was concerned to secure recruits of the right quality and numbers for the Royal Navy in peace-time, and he had no doubtthat a decision to admit coloured entrants would have an adverse effect on morale and discipline. Living conditions in His Majesty&apos;s ships were necessarily cramped, and the effect of admitting colouredpersons to the Royal Navy could be judged from the seriouscomplaints already received from ships in which coloured men from india and Egypt were receiving short-service training. He thoughtthat the compromise suggested, under which special training facili-ties would be made available for non-European officers and men fromthe local Forces, would provide a means by which existing colourprejudices could gradually be overcome without excessive friction.The Secretary of State for War said that, if non-Europeanswere admitted to the ranks of the British Army, they were bound tobe eligible in due course for consideration for advancement tocommissioned rank. British soldiers would not take kindly to service under coloured officers and discipline would be undermined.He urged that the compromise proposed by the First Lord of theAdmiralty should be accepted.The Minister of Defence pointed out that no decision had yetbeen reached about the extent to which it would be necessary tomake use of coloured troops in the scheme of Commonwealth defence.When plans bad been fully worked out they might involve asubstantial expansion of the existing local Forces. In the mean-time it would, he thought, be premature to reach a decision aboutlifting the ban on the entry of non-Europeans into the Royal navy and the Army.The general feeling of the Cabinet was that it would bedifficult to justify the retention of an admitted ban on the entry ofnon-Europeans into the Royal Navy and the British Army. the raising of the ban would not result in a flood of applications for
Ceylon.ConstitutionalDevlopment.(previous reference:CM. (47) 44thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies (CP. (47) 171) on the constitu-tional position in Ceylon.The Secretary of State for the Colonies recalled that on 8th May the Cabinet had invited him to prepare, in the light oftheir discussion, the draft of a communication to be made toMr. D. S. Senanayake, vice-chairman of Ceyion&apos;s Board of Ministers,in reply to his request that Ceylon should be promised independence within the British Commonwealth as soon as possible after the inauguration of the new Constitution in October, 1947. The text of this communication, which formed Annex I to CP. (47) 171,would need further consideration, and he proposed to submit a revised draft to the Prime Minister. He had also attached as annex II to CP. (47) 171 a draft announcement to be made inParliament by 10th June, the date for which the Ceylon state council had been summoned. A revised text of this had beenprepared since the circulation of CP. (47) 171, copies of which hadbeen handed to his colleagues.The Cabinet first considered the draft announcement. Thefollowing points were made : (a) In dealing with the question of constitutional advance in ceylon the Cabinet had always been much concerned to secureadequate protection for the minorities in the Island. The draftcontained only a perfunctory reference to this problem and to theUl/lltij.   LlJUilCLliL.   lOOUCO   111VU1VCU   ill   LliC  gJLClHU Ul   lulluci    pUVVCIS   LU   111CCeylon Government. The announcement should not suggest that further constitutional progress in Ceylon was free from practicaldifficulties.(b) It would be inadvisable to suggest that the development ofv3VciAub jl-ii j-iiuioj clxj.\x j-* U.X i.ii&apos;a, ijhoi\x uooii i cbpuuoiuic lui   W1C vv lliillglieoi^of His Majesty&apos;s Government to consider the possibility of speedierconstitutional progress in Ceylon.(c) No reference should be made to the willingness of theGovernment to lend their, support to an application by Ceylon for membership of the United Nations.(cl) It would not be advisable to make any reference to thepossibility that the present arrangements by which Ceylon affairs were the responsibility of the Colonial Office might be reconsideredThe Secretary of State for the Colonies recalled that at the cabinet&apos;s discussion on 6th May reference had been made toMr. Senanayake&apos;s suggestion that it was unrealistic to suppose thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government would be willing to face a major clash with India in order to protect Ceylon&apos;s interests. The view hadbeen taken that it should be made clear to him that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment could not accept this assumption. Should this pointbe made in the formal communication which was to be sent toMr. Senanavake?admission to these Services and the possibilities of trouble could befurther reduced by careful selection in accordance with the prin-ciples already adopted for the Royal Air Force. There would beno need to give wide publicity to the Government^ decision.The Cabinet &apos;Agreed that British subjects and British-protected persons of non-European race should be admitted to the royal navy and the British Army, provided that they attained the requisite standards, were resident in this country, and could satisfy the selection authorities that they were likelyto mix with other entrants and hold their own in thecorporate life of the Services.
It was agreed that it would be inexpedient to make such astatement in a written document which would no doubt receive wide publicity. The Governor of Ceylon might, however, make the pointin discussion with Mr. Senanayake.The Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to prepare,in the light of the discussion, revised drafts of the proposedcommunication to Mr. Senanayake and of the announce-ment to be made in Parliament on the question of further constitutional progress in Ceylon, and to submit them tothe Prime Minister for his approval.Equal Pay.(previous reference:CM. (47)49thConclusions,Minute 6.)5. The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that on 22nd may the Cabinet had agreed that at the present time it would be inexpedient for the Government to introduce equal pay in the public services, and had invited the Minister without Portfolio, inconsultation with him, to revise the draft statement annexed to cp. (47) 165. A revised statement had now been prepared, but before the Cabinet considered it they ought to decide whether their conclusion of 22nd May required modification in the light of theresolution passed at the Labour Party Conference calling on theGovernment forthwith to implement the policy of equal pay for equal work. His own opinion was that the Government should adhere to the view that it would be inexpedient to introduce equal pay in the public services at the present time. If this was accepted,the only remaining question was whether in the proposed statement the Government should or should not say explicitly that they accepted the principle of equal pay.The Minister of Fuel and Power suggested that the Govern-ment should not merely accept the principle of equal pay, but should state that they hoped to apply it progressively in particular sectors of the public services and were considering how this might be done.He realised that the progressive application of the principle wouldnot be free from difficulty, but the alternative of merely accepting the principle without any indication of when it was to be applied in practice would not be satisfactory. It did not seem to him logicalto oppose the application of equal pay on the ground of itsinflationary effect unless the Government were prepared to take action to curb wage increases.The Minister of Health said that in his view the right course was to state that the Government accepted the principle of equal pay, but that it would be inexpedient to introduce it at the presenttime. It was also important that the Government should as soonas possible make it clear that they could not accept the resolution passed by the Labour Party Conference in favour of legislation forthe immediate abolition of the tied cottage system.The Lord President said that, while the Government were bound to give serious consideration to any resolution passed by theLabour Party Conference, they must take account of the situation as a whole, and;, in the light of the considerations which had beenput forward by the Ministerial Committee on Equal Pay, it seemed clear that the Cabinet should adhere to their decision of 22nd May.It would be difficult to avoid stating that the Government acceptedthe principle of equal pay, but it was very desirable that the wording of this declaration should be such as to indicate that itwould be some considerable time before the principle could beapplied.In further discussion there was general support for the viewthat the Cabinet should adhere to their previous conclusion that atthe present time it would be inexpedient to introduce equal pay inthe public services.
69 CM. 51 (47)The Chancellor of the Exchequer then read to the Cabinet the revised draft statement. The third paragraph of this draft statedthat, as a broad affirmation of a general principle, the Governmentwere prepared to accept, as regards their own employees, the justice of the claim that there should be no difference in payment for thesame work in respect of sex. It then explained that there remained to be settled many difficult questions of interpretation, and theimportant practical question of when and over what range of caseseffect should be given to the principle. The Chancellor of theExchequer also read to the Cabinet an alternative draft of thisparagraph which was so worded as to avoid acceptance of the claim in principle.The general view of the Cabinet was that it would be undesir-able to attempt to avoid stating that the Government accepted theclaim in principle.The Cabinet-(1) Reaffirmed their decision that at the present time it wouldbe inexpedient for the Government to introduce equal pay in the public services;(2) Approved the revised draft statement prepared by theMinister without Portfolio and the Chancellor of theExchequer and, in particular, agreed that it should contain a sentence accepting, as a broad affirmation of ageneral principle, the justice of the claim that thereshould be no difference in payment for the same work inrespect of sex;(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange to makethe statement in the House of Commons in the following week.double summer Time.(previous reference:CM. (47) 17thConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (CP. (47) 173) on the question whether, in response torepresentations from the National Farmers1&apos; Unions of England and scotland, the Government should introduce legislation to shorten the period of double summer time in 1947 or should give an assur-ance that double summer time would not be reintroduced in 1948.The Prime Minister said that he had received a deputation from the National Farmers&apos; Unions, who had argued that double summer time should be brought to an end by 29th June at latest,on the ground that to continue it after that date would have mostharmful effects on agriculture. The Unions had made out a strong case and it had been difficult to resist their arguments, as there wasno evidence that the adoption of double summer time had resultedin any large amount of evening shift working.The Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister ofA griculture pointed out that the farmers&apos; leaders who hadco-operated loyally with the Government when the decision to adoptdouble summer time was originally taken, were now placed in an extremely embarrassing position and had undoubtedly lost influence with their constituents. Unless farmers could be given some conces-sion, they could not be expected to support the food productioncampaign wholeheartedly.The Home Secretary said that it was disappointing that so little had been done to introduce evening shift working, since theintroduction of double summer time had been largely justified onthe ground that it would facilitate this. He would be opposed tothe introduction of legislation to shorten the period of double summer time in 1947, but he thought that the National Farmers&apos;Unions should be given an assurance that double summer time wouldnot be introduced in 1948 or in any future year.
The Lord President pointed out that it would be impossible tofind time for legislation to shorten the period of double summer timefixed for 1947.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that it would be impracticable to pass legislationshortening the period of double summer time fixed for1947.(2) Agreed to consider further at their next meeting whether an assurance might be given to the National Farmers&apos;Unions that the Government would not introduce double summer time in 1948.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,3rd June, 1947.
