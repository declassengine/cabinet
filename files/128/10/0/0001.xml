India.constitutional position.(previous reference:CM. (47) 47thConclusions,Minute 6.)The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (CP. (47) 158) covering the draft of an announcement tobe made by His Majesty&apos;s Government on the arrangements proposed for the transfer of power in India.The Prime Minister gave the Cabinet a general account of therecent political developments in India and the results of the discus-sions which the India and Burma Committee had had with theViceroy.The refusal of the Muslim League to participate in the workof the Constituent Assembly had destroyed any possibility that theCabinet Mission plan could be successfully put into effect. TheLeague had, indeed, entered the Interim Government, but thefailure of both Parties to co-operate within that Government made it improbable that it could continue to hold together for much longer. The extensive discussions which Lord Mountbatten had had with the various political leaders since his arrival in India hadconvinced him that there was no prospect of a Union of India either on the basis of the Cabinet Mission^ plan or on any other basis,and further that, unless a very early announcement was made of themethod by which His Majes&apos;ty&apos;s Government intended to transferpower, widespread communal disturbances would be inevitable. Allthe Indian Parties were now convinced that, in view of the recal-citrant attitude of the Muslim League, some form of partition wasunavoidable. But the Congress view was that, if partition was tobe conceded, it was a necessary corollary that there should also bea division of Bengal and the Punjab.The Viceroy had convened a conference of Indian leaders for2nd June, at which he would make a final effort to secure agreement on the basis of the Cabinet Mission&apos;s plan. If, as he expected, hefailed to do so, he intended to lay before the Conference the text of an announcement by His Majesty&apos;s Government, which was contained in the Annex to CP. (47) 158. The plan outlined in that document had already been discussed with the Indian leaders, and represented the maximum degree of common agreement that wasever likely to be achieved. The announcement stated that HisMajesty&apos;s Government had reached the conclusion that the attemptto secure a Union of the whole of Tndia on the basis of the cabinet mission&apos;s proposals must now be abandoned, and that arrangements must therefore be made whereby power could be transferred to morethan one authority. It then proceeded to set out a detailed planunder which the different parts of India could choose, throughelected representatives, whether their future Constitutions shouldbe framed by the existing Constituent Assembly or by a newConstituent Assembly composed of representatives from those ares which held aloof from the main body; and it provided for the estab-lishment of a new Constituent Assembly for the areas which optedfor separation. The probable result of the plan would be that, inthe North-West of India, Sind, the Western Punjab and possibly also the North-West Frontier would stand out from the existingConstituent Assembly. In the North-East there were good hopes that Bengal might decide to remain united on the basis of a coalition government elected on a joint electorate. If, however, that did nothappen, Eastern Bengal and the one predominantly Muslim district of Assam were likely also to stand out.The Prime Minister drew attention to the difficulties anddangers necessarily inherent in any scheme of partition. Thesituation in many parts of India was already highly inflammable.In the Punjab, in particular, the proposed announcement was likely in the Governor&apos;s view to provoke serious disorder and blood-shed. The application of the plan to that Province would involvethe division of the Sikh community in fairly even proportionsbetween the two successor States, though their position might tosome extent be eased by the Boundary Commission, which would establish the final boundary. Partition would also involve highlycomplex administrative problems, such as the division between the successor States of the Indian Army and such subjects as finance,trade and industry, which were at present the responsibility of the
59CM. SO (47)Central Government. But, whatever the practical difficulties involved, there appeared to be no alternative to partition. Unfor-unfortunately, there was now reason to fear that the Muslim League mightafter all decide to oppose the plan. In that event, the best coursewould be to impose it as an award by His Majesty^ Government.It seemed unlikely that the attitude of the Congress leaders to theplan would similarly change. If it did, a more difficult positionwould arise and the whole plan would then have to be reconsidered.During the past fortnight, however, there had been a further development of major importance which put the whole matter in adifferent light. While Mr. Jinnah had always claimed thatPakistan would wish to remain within the British Commonwealth,it had been the policy of the Congress Party that India should be a sovereign independent republic and they had seamed a resolution to that effect in the Constituent Assembly. The prospect that one part of India would wish to remain within the Coaamonwealth whenthe other had become an independent republic had always involvedissues of great complexity. It now appeared, however, that someof the Congress leaders had become increasingly apprehensive aboutthe difficulties which the grant of immediate independence wouldinvolve, and a most significant approach to the &quot;Viceroy had beenmade by Pandit Nehru and Sardar Patel, who had suggested thatin the event of partition Hindu India should be granted dominion status, at any rate as a temporary measure. They had explainedthat they would hope to secure the agreement of their supportersto this course by arguing that acceptance of Dominion status wouldenable power to be transferred to Indian hands at a date substan-tially earlier than June 1948, and that onee she had attainedDominion status Hindu India would be free to secede at any time from the Commonwealth.This was a most important development, and the India and burma Committee had felt that, full advantage sfeouid be taken ofit. If Dominion status were conferred on the two successor states as part of the plan for the transfer of power, this would greatlyease the difficulties inherent in partition. For example, both theIndian Parties wished to retain the services of European officersof the Indian Army to assist in carrying out thes division of thearmy between the new States and building up effective militaryorganisations on a fresh basis : this would not he possible if the successor States had become independent republics. More impor-tant, it was reasonable to suppose that the Indian Parties, in thelight of practical experience of the advantages of Dominion status,would be slow to exercise their right to secede at a later stage.India&apos;s decision would also, no doubt, be closely watched by Burma,who would shortly have to choose between independence and dominion status; and Ceylon would also be greatly influenced bythe line taken by India on this question. But it must be rememberedthat the proposal made by the Congress leaders was that dominion status should be granted and power transferred as early as possiblein 1947. Moreover, after the proposed announcement had beenmade, the interim Government would become increasinglyineffective; and it was essential for practical reasons that the interim period between the announcement and the actual transferof power on the basis of Dominion status should be reduced to aminimum. It would, therefore, be essential to enact, before the endof the present Session, legislation amending the Government ofIndia Act, 1935. The purpose of this legislation would be to conferDominion status on the States emerging from the plan for the partition of India and to provide the necessary madfoinery enabling the new Constitutions to be established and the division of powersto be gradually completed.The grant of Dominion status to the successor States would,of course, mean that the India Office should cease to be responsiblefor the handling of United Kingdom relations with India : thiswas a point on which the Indian leaders were emphatic. Thealternative arrangements needed further consideration but it[34108-1] B&apos;2
seemed possible that the best solution might be to expand theDominions Office into a Department for Commonwealth Relationsresponsible for handling our relations, not only with the existingDominions, but also with India and Burma and subsequently withCeylon and any other territories which might attain a position of^independence within the Commonwealth.&quot;In discussion the following points were raised : (a) When these Constitutional changes in the status of India-took effect, it would be necessary that The King should divest him-self of the title &quot; Emperor of India.&quot; He would become King ofthose parts of India which attained Dominion status. HisMajesty had already mentioned this point to the Prime Minister.(V) This possible change in the status of India also emphasised the need for some further review of the existing relations betweenthe various parts of the British Commonwealth. Though it might prove possible and appropriate that parts of India should attainthe status prescribed for Dominions by the Statute of Westmin-ster, there were other parts of His Majesty&apos;s Dominions for which some different form, of &quot; independence within the Common-wealth&quot; might be more appropriate. The Prime Minister saidthat he was taking steps to set in hand a comprehensive reviewof the constitutional relations between the various parts of theBritish Commonwealth.(c) How would India&apos;s attainment of Dominion status affectthe position of Indians in South Africa? The Cabinet were informed that these people, though Indians by race, were mostlySouth African citizens by nationality; and their national statuswould not be affected by India&apos;s achieving self-Government as a dominion. The political difficulties which had arisen over theposition of these Indians would at least be no greater if Indiabecame a Dominion than if she became a foreign country.(d) The Lord President said that, in view of the congestion of the Parliamentary timetable, there would be no hope of passinga Government of India Bill before Parliament adjourned in the summer unless this legislation had the full support of the Opposi-tion. The Prime Minister said that he had received a firmassurance in writing from the leader of the Opposition that thissupport would be forthcoming if the proposals of His Majesty*sGovernment proved generally acceptable to the leaders of theIndian Parties.(e) The Prime Minister said that communal feeling in india was now intense and it was possible that serious disorders mightbreak out in the Punjab and certain other Provinces at any time after the announcement of the plan for partitioning India. It wasthe Viceroys considered view that the only hope of checking wide-spread communal warfare was to suppress the first signs of itpromptly and ruthlessly, using for this purpose all the forcerequired, including tanks and aircraft, and giving full publicitythroughout India to the action taken and the reasons for it. In thisview the Viceroy had the unanimous support of his Interim Govern-ment. It was important that he should also be assured that thispolicy had the support of His Majesty&apos;s Government.The Cabinet agreed that the policy which the Viceroy proposedto follow in this matter should have their full support.(/) The Prime Minister explained the arrangements whichwere being made for the publication of the proposed statement ofpolicy. It was expected that the Viceroy would be ready to publish the announcement in India on the evening of Tuesday, 3rd June;and any last-minute changes in the text would be telegraphed toLondon so as to enable a simultaneous announcement to be made in both Houses of Parliament. The Viceroy also proposed to broad-cast, later that evening, a message to the people of India. It was hoped that he would record this in London before returning toIndia, so that it might be broadcast simultaneously in this
61CM. 50 (47)&apos;country. The Prime Ministers broadcast would then take theform of an introductory statement by way of preface to theViceroy&apos;s broadcast.The Cabinet endorsed the plan outlined in CP. (47) 158 for determing the successor authorities to which power should betransferred in India. They welcomed the further proposals whichhad been explained by the Prime Minister for the early attainment of Dominion status by the various parts of a partitioned India.They expressed their warm appreciation of the outstanding ser-vice rendered by the Viceroy, and by the Prime Minister and hiscolleagues on the India and Burma Committee, in evolving these new proposals for further constitutional development in India. Ifthis scheme could be carried through successfully, it would be a notable landmark in the development of the British Commonwealth.The Prime Minister, in summing up the discussion, paidtribute to the remarkable skill and initiative which the Viceroy had shown in his conduct of these difficult negotiations with the indian leaders. It was essential that, in the concluding stages of thenegotiations, the Viceroy should be given a large measure of discretion to amend the details of the plan, without prior consulta-tion with His Majesty&apos;s Government, so long as he kept withinthe limits of the broad policy which had now been approved by theCabinet.The Cabinet-(1) Approved in principle the draft announcement annexed to cp. (47) 158 regarding the procedure for determining the successor authorities to whom power would be trans-ferred in India; and agreed that this should be adoptedby the Viceroy as a basis for his final discussions with indian leaders on 2nd and 3rd June.(2) Took note w-ith approval of the proposals outlined by thePrime Minister for the early attainment of dominion status by the various parts of a partitioned India;(3) Agreed that, in the concluding stages of his negotiationswith the Indian leaders, the Viceroy should have a large measure of discretion to amend the details of this planprovided he kept within the broad limits of the policy approved by the Cabinet;(4) Agreed that His Majesty&apos;s Government should give full support to the policy which the Viceroy proposed tolUiiuw, vviLji unc agicmiieiiL. ui ma -LiiLerim vjroverimieiib,in using whatever force might be necessary to check thefirst signs of any widespread outbreak of communalwarfare in India after the announcement of theproposals for Partition.Cabinet Office, S.
