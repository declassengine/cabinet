RadioactiveSubstancesBill.(previous reference:C.M.(47)46thConclusions,Minute 4.)1. The Cabinet were informed that it had not been found possible to reach agreement with the opponents of the RadioactiveSubstances Bill in the House of Lords. In view of the congestion of business both in the House of Lords and the House of commons during the remainder of the current Session, it would be impossibleto find time for the Bill except as a non-contentious measure, andit was accordingly proposed that the Bill should be dropped, on theunderstanding that it would be reintroduced at the beginning ofthe 1947-48 Session.The Cabinet-Agreed that no attempt should be made to make further progress with the Radioactive Substances Bill in thecurrent Session and that it should be reintroduced at thebeginning of the 1947-48 Session.ForeignAffairs.Hungary,(previous reference:CM. (47) 53rdConclusions,Minute 3.)Indonesia.(previous reference:CM. (47) 54thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Foreign Secretary said that the reaction of world opinion to the recent constitutional changes in Hungary seemedto have checked further Soviet pressure on the Hungarian Govern-ment and to have lessened the likelihood of Soviet interference in finland and Czechoslovakia, where the Socialist Parties had been much encouraged by the action taken by the United Kingdom and united States Governments. He proposed to continue1 to press the Soviet Government for a clarification of their attitude and intentions in Hungary.The Foreign Secretary said that he was maintaining his efforts to persuade the Netherlands Government to reach a peaceful solution of their differences with the Indonesians, and that he had instructed His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at The Hague to make a formal offer of our good offices in a final attempt to secure a settle-ment by agreement.The Minister of Food said that the Anglo-American sugar commission had reported that stocks of sugar in Indonesia amountedto 200,000 tons, and that, contrary to the information given by theDutch authorities, the factories and plantations in the areas con-trolled by the Indonesian authorities were not in a derelict condition.The Cabinet,-Took note, with approval, of the statement made by theForeign Secretary.Economic 3.

He had for this reason strongly advised the Italian Government to ratify the Peace Treaty without delay,since, so long as they had failed to do so, their participation wouldbe opposed by the Soviet and French Governments.   It was alsoessential that we should consider at once the nature of our owncontribution to European recovery and the bearing of this on ourdomestic plans.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement made by the Foreign Secretary.[34109-21b 2
India.constitutional changes.(Previous .Reference:CM. (47) 50thConclusions.)4. The Prime Minister reminded the Cabinet that, when theproposed constitutional changes took place in India, it would benecessary for The King to divest himself of the title &apos;&apos; Emperor ofIndia.&quot; The assent of the United Kingdom Parliament would begiven by a Clause in the Indian Independence Bill, and the fourDominion Governments who had been consulted had agreed to intro-duce similar legislation as soon as practicable.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that theGovernment of Eire had not yet been consulted but that this wouldbe done as soon as possible.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Ministers statement.Import Pro-gramme for1957-48.(previous reference:CM. (47) 52ndConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the following memoranda on the subject of the Import Programme for 1947-48 : CP. (47) 167 : by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, covering a memorandum by the Treasury setting out proposals for reductions in the Import Programme and for other measures designed to deal with the problem of the balance of payments;CP. (47) 170 : by the Minister of Food on the question whatcuts might be made in food imports; and cp. (47) 109 : by the Minister of Fuel and Power on theneed for a positive balance of payments policy.The Cabinet also had before them a memorandum by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (CP. (47) 172) on textile exports and the clothing ration.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he hoped that theCabinet would now take decisions on the proposals made in cp. (47) 167. Though the developments which had taken place since that memorandum had been circulated gave some reason forhope that in the long run a solution of the world dollar shortageproblem would be found, it would be rash to act on the assumptionthat the problem would be solved before our dollar resources wereexhausted if the drain on them continued at the present rate. Owingto the increases in world prices and the fact that we were, in effect,obliged to pay United States dollars for our imports from canada and the Argentine, the United States credit was being drawn uponmuch more rapidly than we had contemplated, and, unless there were considerable cuts in imports from dollar sources, it would be exhausted before the end of 1947. It was of the utmost importance that we should make the credit last until the end of March 1948, andhe believed that this could be done by a cut of about  60 million in the proposed food import programme, taken together with the cuts in other imports suggested in CP. (47) 167 and the increasein textile exports proposed in CP. (47) 172.The Cabinet first discussed whether the situation justified cutsin the Import Programme of the order suggested in CP. (47) 167.It was urged by some Ministers that, while some of the cuts,e.g., those in paper, tobacco and films, could be made without serious disadvantage, there was a danger that others, and particularly theproposed cuts in food imports, would have an adverse effect on morale and so on production. Would it not, in these circumstances, bebetter to limit the cuts to something much less than what was proposed in CP. (47) 167 and to draw on our reserves of gold and dollars, which amounted to  625 million ?The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, as far as he couldforesee, it would in any event be necessary to draw on our gold and dollar reserves some time in 1948 but that he regarded it as of theutmost importance that we should postpone calling on these reservesas long as possible.   The additional time which we should be able
to buy by imposing cuts of the order proposed in CP. (47) 167 would,in his view, be of decisive importance.The Foreign Secretary stressed the importance of postponing the exhaustion of the United States credit for as long as possible.The Cabinet then discussed the proposals for cuts in the importsof commodities other than food.  The following points were made : (a) It was stated in paragraph 13 of the memorandum annexed to CP. (47) 167 that the proposed cut in imports of raw materials would still allow us to import all the timber available to us. since this memorandum had been written, however, it had been reportedthat larger supplies of timber were likely to be available and, asthe housing programme was being held up for lack of timber, itwas suggested that more dollars should be made available for thepurchase of timber.It was pointed out in reply that the. proposed programme forthe purchase of timber in 1947-48 was calculated to meet all theneeds of the housing programme and that the present difficultiesin obtaining timber for housing were due largely to seasonal short-ages. Moreover, there was a hope of a substantial fall in the present high price of timber and it would be undesirable to prevent thisby making an immediate offer to purchase the additional supplies which were now being offered. The Chancellor of the Exchequerand the President of the Board of Trade would, however, considerwhether some modification of the programme of purchases of rawmaterials should be made in order to allow for increased purchases of timber.(b) There was general agreement that it would be undesirable to make such cuts in imports of petroleum as would necessitatechanges in the existing rationing scheme calling for a more elaborateadministrative machine. The figure of 500,000 tons proposed inparagraph 14 of the memorandum annexed to CP. (47) 167 should,however, be accepted as a target and an attempt should be made to achieve it by a redaction in the rate of replenishment of the stocksof petroleum held by the Services and by encouraging the road haulage industry to make voluntary savings in petrol consumption.(e) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs asked why itwas not possible to reduce the drain on our dollar resources byrelying to a greater extent on the import of petroleum from non-dollar sources under our control.In reply The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that todraw more petroleum from non-dollar sources would merely reduce our dollar receipts from the sale of petroleum and involve additionaldollar expenditure on the chartering of tankers. He would, however,in consultation with the Minister of Fuel and Power, prepare amemorandum for the information of the Cabinet on this point.(d) There was general agreement that, in view of the additionaladministrative difficulties which would arise if the allowance forforeign travel were reduced from  75 to  50 and of the likelihood that such a reduction would lead foreign countries to restrictexpenditure by their nationals in the United Kingdom, the presentallowance of  75 should remain unchanged.The Cabinet then turned to discuss the question of reductions inthe food import programme.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that he had proposedin CP. (47) 167 that the programme of food imports from hard currency sources should be reduced by  80 million. He had sincehad discussions with the Minister oi Food and was now preparedto make available the  24^ million necessary to enable a secondcut in the meat ration to be avoided and the  4 to  5 millionnecessary to give an increase in the sugar ration to the ordinaryconsumer, on the understanding that the Minister of Food would
agree to a reduction of  10 million in other parts of the foodimport programme. Thus, the total cut would amount to  60 millioninstead of  80 million. He emphasised that this represented areduction, not from the level of imports during the past year, butin the programme proposed by the Minister of Food, which was substantially higher. Thus, if the proposed cut were accepted, theindex figure for food imports in 1947-48 would be 80 as comparedwith a figure of 63 for 1946.The Minister of Food said that he remained of the view that,if we were to avoid a fall in nutritional standards, the cut in food imports must be limited to  25 million. Though it was true thatthe cut proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer would mean that the value and volume of the food imports in the 1947-48programme would be higher than the actual figures for 1946, ithad to be borne in mind that there had been a very great rise in world prices and that a much larger part of the new programmeconsisted of animal feeding-stuffs and wheat supplies to rebuildour depleted stocks. It should also be remembered that the non-availability of supplies of particular commodities invariably resultedin reductions in the approved programme of food imports, so thatif a cut of  60 million were imposed, the actual imports of food in 1947-48 would fall short of his original programme by a gooddeal more than this.In further discussion it was suggested that it would be reason-able to allow any saving in the authorised expenditure on particularfood imports due to the non-availability of supplies to be expendedon other food imports.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would be willingto accept an arrangement of this kind, provided that it was under-stood that the Minister of Food must agree with him on the sourcesfrom which any alternative supplies were to be obtained and thatthe savings accruing from any substantial fall in food prices wouldnot be wholly used for increased purchases of foodJ-The Minister of Food said that he would accept this eom-promise. He suggested, however, that the total cut in food imports should be limited to  50 million, on the understanding that he would arrange for additional exports of luxury foods amounting to 10 million in 1947-48. This would mean some increase in theallocation of sugar to manufacturers, and the export of food fromthis country might lead to some criticism. He was satisfied, however,that the proposal could be justified.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs stressed theimportance of securing the agreement of the United States Govern-ment to a relaxation of the non-discrimination provisions in theAnglo-American Financial Agreement with a view to avoiding theneed to restrict imports of commodities such as fruit from theDominions because of the restriction of imports of these commodities from the United States.The Cabinet then had a preliminary discussion on the memo-randum by the President of the Board&apos; of Trade (CP. (47) 172)proposing that steps should be taken to raise exports of textilesto the level of  250 million a year.The President of the Board of Trade said that, unless therewas a substantial increase, in production, his proposal would mean that the clothing ration for the next ration period would not exceedfour coupons a month. It might also involve, through the diversion of cloth from the home market to export, the standing off of 25,000to 30,000 workers in the clothing industry. It was important thatan early decision should be taken on this proposal in order to enable him to give effect to it in planning production for the next period.In discussion it was urged that the gain from increased exportsof textiles would be more than offset by the depressing effect of
maintaining the clothing ration at the present level and theunemployment which would be caused in the clothing industry. Itwas also suggested that more might be done to secure a higher outputof textiles by stimulating. recruitment&apos;to the textile industry.The Prime Minister suggested that a decision on the proposal in CP. (47) 172 should be deferred until the meeting of the Cabineton 26th June. It would also be desirable to consider at that meetinghow far it would be necessary to make public the decisions reached by the Cabinet on the proposals in this memorandum and in cp. (47) 167 and CP. (47) 170 and what form any announcement should take. The Lord President might consider these points inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Presidentof the Board of Trade:The Cabinet^-(1) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe President of the Board of Trade would considerwhether some modification of the programme of pur-chases of raw materials in 1947^48 should be made inorder to allow for increased purchases of timber;(2) Subject to (1), agreed that the programmes for importsof raw materials, goods for industry, consumer goods,tobacco and films in 1947-48 should be reduced by theamounts proposed in paragraph 11 of the memorandum annexed to CP. (47) 167;(3) Agreed that the aim should be to effect a reduction of500,000 tons in the import of motor spirit in 1947-48,provided that this could be achieved without elaboration of the existing petrol rationing scheme; and took note(i) that the Minister of Defence would consider whatreduction might be made in the rate of replenishmentof the stocks of petroleum held by the Services and(ii) that the Minister of Fuel and Power and the Ministerof Transport would meet representatives of the road haulage industry with a view to agreeing with them on ascheme for the voluntary saving of petrol;(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerof Fuel and Power to circulate a note giving the reasons why at the present time imports of petroleum, from what-ever sources they came, represented a drain on the UnitedKingdom dollar resources;(5) Agreed that the present allowance of  75 for private travelabroad should remain unchanged;(6) Agreed that the food import programme of  870 million which had been proposed by the Minister of Food shouldbe reduced by cuts amounting to  50 million in theimports proposed from hard currency sources, and invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerof Food to settle, on this basis, a revised programme offood imports which would enable a 2-ounce increase inthe sugar ration to be made and a second cut in the meat ration to be avoided;(7) Agreed that if it proved unnecessary to expend the full amount allocated for the purchase of any particular com-commodity in the revised programme, e.g., because supplies were not available, the Minister of Food should beentitled to expend the resulting saving on other food imports, subject to consultation with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer with regard to the sources from whichthese alternative imports were to be obtained;(8) Agreed that, if there were any substantial fall in the pricesof food imports, a reduction in the amount of foreign currency allocated for food imports would have to beconsidered;(9) Agreed that the Minister of Food should arrange for the resumption of exports of certain luxury foods at therate of  10 million a year;
(10) Took note that the President of the Board of Trade wouldmake every effort to secure the agreement of the UnitedStates Government to a relaxation of the non-dis-crimination provisions of the Anglo-American financial agreement;(11) Agreed that the Lord President and the President of theBoard of Trade should consider what steps might betaken to improve recruitment to the textile industry;(12) Agreed to consider further at their meeting on 26th june the proposal made in CP. (47) 172 for increasing theexport of textiles;(13) Invited the Lord President, the Chancellor of theExchequer and the President of the Board of Trade toconsider what should be the method of announcing any decisions on the proposals in CP. (47) 167, CP. (47) 170and CP. (47) 172 which had to be made public.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,24th June, 1947.
