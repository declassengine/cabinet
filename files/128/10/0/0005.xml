Indonesia.(previous reference:CM. (47)53rdConclusions,Minute 3.)1. The Foreign Secretary said that the Indonesian reply to thelatest proposals for a settlement put forward by the netherlands government had not, in his view, been unreasonable, but that therewas still a divergence of view on certain points, notably the Dutchscheme for joint action in restoring and maintaining order through-out Java and Sumatra. The Netherlands Government took apessimistic view of the situation and seemed disposed to resort to force. The outbreak of war in Indonesia would provoke politicaltrouble in other parts of the Far East and involve very serious losses of food and raw materials; and he had felt that the netherlands government should be left in no doubt about the attitude of HisMajesty&apos;s Government. He had therefore told them that, in ourview, the extent of the divergence between the Dutch proposals andthe Indonesian reply was not so great as to preclude all possibilitiesof an agreed solution; that a further attempt should be made to finda solution by negotiation; and that resort to force would alienateworld opinion. He had also made it clear that, should hostilitiesbreak out in the Dutch East Indies, it might be impossible for theBritish Government to continue the provision of equipment andtraining facilities for the Dutch Forces. He had at the same timeinstructed His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington to ascertain from the United States Secretary of State whether the UnitedStates Government would be prepared to take the initiative withHis Majesty&apos;s Government in making a joint offer of good-officesprivately to the Netherlands Government and the IndonesianRepublic in an endeavour to persuade them to seek a peaceful solution by negotiation.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that the Governor-General of Malaya bad expressed great anxiety about the effect which hostilities in Indonesia would have on the internal situationin Malaya.The Minister of Food said that, in the event of war, the republican forces would undoubtedly resort to scorched earthtactics. This would gravely affect Indonesia^ capacity to exportfood for many years.The Cabinet-.$jEt hEndorsed the action taken by the Foreign Secretary to persuade the Netherlands Government to seek a peaceful solution of the Indonesian situation.Economic 2.   The Foreign Secretary  informed  the  Cabinet that heRecovery of intended to go to Paris later in the day for exploratory talks with europe. the French Government about the proposed European reconstruc-tion plan. Meanwhile he had sent a message to the Soviet Govern-ment explaining that we were concerned only with economicrehabilitation and not with any political objects, and asking fortheir views. Since this message had been sent an article had appeared in Pravda criticising the United States offer. He felt,however, that we must press on urgently with the preparation ofa plan, whether or not the Soviet Government were willing toco-operate. Joint proposals were already being drawn up by theGovernments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, andthese Governments should be brought into the discussions at an earlydate. He had also indicated to the Italian Government that hewould be prepared to consider bringing them in as soon as theyratified the Peace Treaty. It would no doubt be necessary in due course to associate the Economic Commission for Europe with thework, but we could not afford to entrust full responsibility for theplan to the Commission, since they were as yet without adequatestaff and their activities were liable to be delayed by obstructionon the part of the Soviet Government. The proposals which he hadin mind would cover Germany, and he hoped that one result of them would be to reduce the financial burden falling on the UnitedKingdom Government.[34108-5] b 2
mi        /-n   i  &apos;       .ine oaDinet Took note with approval of the action which the foreign secretary was taking to initiate the preparation of a european reconstruction plan.CommonwealthConferenceat Canberra.(previous reference:CM. (47) 49thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Foreign Secretary said that the publicity which theAustralian Government had given to the forthcoming Common-wealth Conference^ at Canberra had created an unfavourableimpression in the United States and aroused the suspicion that its object was to ensure that the members of the British commonwealth should constitute a united bloc at the proposed discussions about thePeace Treaty with Japan. It would not be easy to dispel thissuspicion but, on his return from Paris, he proposed to discuss thematter with the United States Ambassador in London. In his view,a meeting of Dominion Prime Ministers in London would not havearoused the same disquiet as the decision to hold a Conference inCanberra, and he thought that, as part of the study of futureCommonwealth relations which was being undertaken, there shouldbe an examination of the effect on foreign Governments of thevarious procedures adopted for consultation between members ofthe Commonwealth.The Cabinet-Took note that the Foreign Secretary would discuss withthe United States Ambassador in London the purpose ofthe proposed Commonwealth Conference at Canberra.ElectricityBill.compensation of LocalAuthorities.(previous reference:CM. (47)27thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Ministerof Fuel and Power (CP. (47) 181) proposing that an additional sumof  5 million should be allocated to local authorities whoseelectricitv undertakings were acauired under the Electricitv Bill,as compensation for the additional burden imposed on the ratesthrough the loss ofbenefit arising out of income tax set-off.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that, in accordance withthe Cabinet&apos;s decision of 11th March, he had announced during theCommittee Stage of the Electricity Bill that a sum of  5 million would be made available as compensation for the reduction of thefield over which overhead expenses could be spread by reason of the severance of the electricity undertaking from the remainder of thelocal authority organisation. This concession had been challengedas inadequate by the associations representing local authorities,who had maintained that the sum offered was not sufficient com-pensation for the losses due to severance and that it made no provision for other items, such as income tax set-off and debtmanagement charges, in respect of which local authorities would suffer loss. Though it was difficult to obtain precise estimates ofthe increase in rates which would have to be made if local authori-ties were no longer able to apply profits from their electricity undertakings in reduction of interest charges on loans for other purposes and so obtain the benefit of income tax set-off, the estimatesgiven in paragraph 4 of CP. (47) 181 showed that, in certain areasat least, the burden on the ratepayers would be substantially increased. The Association of Municipal Corporations had originally suggested that the sum of  5 million agreed to by theCabinet should be increased to  15 million, but he had good reasonto believe that a total payment of  10 million would be acceptable.This payment would not fall on the Exchequer and it would repre-sent no more than a relatively trifling increase of  125,000 a year in the interest charges payable by the British Electricity Authority.The Minister of Transport said that, in view of the Cabinet&apos;decision of 11th March to provide compensation to local authoritiesin respect of severance, he had drawn up a scheme under which asum of about  2J million would be given for losses due to severance
on the transfer of transport undertakings, together with anadditional sum of  200,000 in respect of docks and harbours. Ifthe concession now proposed by the Minister of Fuel and Powerwere made it would be necessary to make a further  1-2 millionavailable under the Transport Bill to compensate local authorities for the loss of relief due to income-tax set-off on the transfer oftransport undertakings.The Lord President recalled that it had been agreed in prin-ciple that when undertakings were transferred from one public authority to another the basis of compensation should be repayment of the net debt. The new concession proposed by the Minister of fuel and Power could not be justified on merits and would tend to favour those local authorities who, in order to relieve the rates,had kept the charges for electricity at a high level. The increases in rates due to the loss of the benefit of income tax set-off wouldbe lost sight of in the general reduction in rates as a result of thenew Block Grant proposals. A further objection was that thecorresponding concession to local authorities which would have tobe made in the Transport Bill would be most embarrassing in viewof the pressure from the Opposition for improved compensationterms for railway shareholders.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, though the grantof a further  5 million would not impose a direct burden on theExchequer, it would militate against his general policy of keeping-down the interest charges on new socialised undertakings. He was willing to agree to the transfer of liability for debt managementcharges, but he felt that any further concession should be resisted.In further discussion it was argued in favour of the pi*oposedconcession that the benefit of income tax set-off had accrued even tothose local authorities who had pursued a policy of providingelectricity at the lowest economic rate. On the other hand, it waspointed out that it would be impossible to devise a scheme of distribution which would confine the additional compensationsuggested to those local authorities who had pursued an enlightenedpolicy.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that no compensation should be paid for the lossof the relief to rates arising from income tax set-offwhich local authorities would sustain on the transferof their electricity undertakings to the British Elec-tricity Authority.(2) Agreed that the British Electricity Authority should takeover the liability for debt management charges along with the net debt on electricity undertakings.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Presi-dent of the Board of Trade (CP. (47) 174) outlining a proposal for reducing dollar expenditure on films.The President of the Board of Trade said that in the year to march, 1947, dollar remittances for films had amounted to over 17 million. This was an excessive drain on our dollar resources,and public opinion clearly expected that the Government shouldtake action to reduce it. He had discussed with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer possible ways of enforcing a substantial economy indollar expenditure on films and they bad reached the conclusion thatthere was no alternative to the imposition of an ad valorem duty. It-was suggested that the duty should be sufficiently high to halve theremittances, and it would have to apply to films from all sources,though new films and certain other special classes would be exempted. In order to ensure that the duty was not passed on tothe public, the Board of Trade would, if necessary, use their priceregulation powers to control film rentals. The proposal, whichwould be extremely unwelcome to the American film interests, was
put forward on the assumption that it would form part of thegeneral scheme for meeting our balance of payment difficulties andhe would not wish it to be adopted unless the other parts of that scheme were to be implemented.The Chancellor- of the Exchequer pointed out that, if provisionfor the imposition of a duty on the lines proposed was to be includedin the Finance Bill, it would be necessary to give notice of thenecessary resolution at a very early date.The Foreign Secretary said that it would be embarrassing forthe Government to commit themselves to the imposition of a dutyon imported films in advance of any statement about the other measures designed to remedy our balance of payment difficulties.He suggested that this difficulty might be met by taking power inthe Finance Bill to impose the proposed customs1 duty on importedfilms by order.The Cabinet-Approved the addition to the Finance Bill of a Clauseenabling a customs duty to be imposed on imported filmsby order.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,11th June, 1947.
