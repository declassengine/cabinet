Parliament;,,Amendmentof parliament act.(previous reference:CM. (46) 90thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Prime Minister reminded the Cabinet that, if legisla-tion amending the Parliament Act, 1911, was to be passed in the lifetime of the present Parliament, it ought to be introduced inthe coming Session so that, if it were rejected by the House of Lords,its passage into law could be enforced under the existing provisionsof the Parliament Act before the next General Election. In thesecircumstances he invited the Cabinet to consider whether the pro-gramme of Government legislation for the 1947-48 Session shouldnot include a Bill limiting the power of the House of Lords toprevent the passage of legislation desired by the House ofCommons, possibly on the lines proposed in the memorandum(CP. (46) 376) submitted to the Cabinet by the Lord chancellor in October 1946.The Cabinet first discussed whether it was expedient that such legislation should be introduced at the present time. In the Deciara-tion of Labour Policy issued-before the last General Election thestatement of the Party&apos;s domestic policy had been prefaced by thedeclaration : &apos;&apos; We give clear notice that we will not tolerateobstruction of the peopled will by the House of Lords.&quot; Havingbeen returned to power on the basis of that declaration, the Govern-ment had a clear right to limit the powers of the House of Lordsif those powers were used to prevent the passage of government legislation. Hitherto, however, the House of Lords had not rejectedany Government Bill and had in fact passed a number of importantsocialisation measures. It would, therefore, be argued that, as theHouse of Lords had not obstructed the passage of government legislation, the situation envisaged in the Party&apos;s Declaration ofPolicy had not in fact arisen and the Government had no mandate fromthe electorate to introduce legislation amending the Parliament Act.There might be a demand that this issue should be specifically referredto the electorate, and moderate opinion throughout the country mightbe alienated. Moreover, it should not be assumed that the House ofLords would necessarily become more inclined to obstruct Govern-ment legislation in the remaining Sessions of this Parliament thanthey had been in the first two Sessions. There were some grounds for believing that the House of Lords were apprehensive of thepolitical consequences of exercising their powers under the Par-liament Act; and it was arguable that on this account they wouldrefrain from rejecting even a Bill for the socialisation of the ironand steel industry, especially if the Bill reached them towards theend of the life of the present Parliament. A few Ministers feltthat in these circumstances it might be bad political tactics for theGovernment to introduce at this stage, without any provocation fromthe House of Lords, legislation limiting the powers of the House ofLords to delay the passage of Government legislation.On the other side it was argued that because the House of Lordshad refrained from obstructing Government legislation in the first two Sessions of this Parliament it could not be assumed that theywould be equally reasonable throughout the remaining Sessions.Hitherto, they had acted in the knowledge that the Government had power to enforce the passage of legislation amending the Parlia-xnent Act. If such legislation were not introduced in the coming session, the House of Lords could prevent its becoming law beforethe next General Election; and, once the threat of such legislationhad been removed, there might be a change in the attitude of theHouse of Lords towards Government legislation. Account must also be taken of the strength of the political feeling which wouldbe aroused by the Iron and Steel Bill. This wduldx cause far morecontroversy than the earlier socialisation measures which had beenaccepted by the House of Lords; and a number of Peers who didnot normally attend the sittings of the House of Lords might be pro-provoked to attend and vote for the rejection of the Bill. If that situation arose it was unlikely that the more moderate counsels ofthe Leaders of the Opposition Parties in the House of Lords wouldprevail.
The following arguments were also put forward in -favour of early legislation amending the Parliament Act:         .;.(a) Failure to introduce this legislation would reduce theGovernments prospects of enacting an Iron and Steel Bill in thepresent Parliament. If The King&apos;s Speech contained no referenceto the amendment of the Parliament Act, some of the government&apos;s supporters would infer that the Government had abandoned the ideaof enacting further measures of socialisation in this Parliament&apos;;and this was likely to cause continuing difficulties with government supporters in the House of Commons. On the other hand, a decisionto proceed with legislation amending the Parliament Act wouldoffset the disappointment which would be felt by many government supporters at the decision to postpone the Iron and Steel Bill until a later Session of this Parliament.(b) If the Government intended to introduce this legislation,it was preferable that they should do so now when none of the by-elections held since the last General Election had gone against them.(c) It was also arguable that it would be preferable to take this step before any controversy had arisen between the two Houses ofParliament. The issues could then be discussed on their merits, andwould not be clouded by political bitterness over some other issuesuch as the nationalisation of iron and steel.The Cabinets conclusion was that the balance of the argumentslay on the side of introducing legislation in the coming Session to limit the power of the House of Lords to delay the passage ofGovernment legislation.The Cabinet next considered the form which this legislation should take.  The Parliament Act, 1911, provided that a Bill passedby the House of Commons in three successive Sessions within a periodof two years should become law, notwithstanding its rejection bythe House of Lords.   The proposal made by the Lord chancellor in October 1946 (CP. (46) 376) had been that this period duringwhich the House of Lords could delay the passage of government legislation should be reduced to two successive Sessions within aperiod of one year. This change could be made by a simple amending bill.   It was, however, argued that such a Bill might be open to two objections.    First, the Government might find difficulty in defending such a measure : for, on the one hand, it could not berepresented as an emergency Bill to overcome House of Lordsobstruction of the Governments legislative programme, as no suchobstruction had yet been offered; and, on the other hand, the Govern-ment would not wish to represent it as their final contribution towards the problem of reforming the House of Lords.   Secondly,it was suggested that a measure which merely limited the lengthof time for which the House of Lords could delay the passage ofGovernment legislation would tend to confirm the right of the Houseof Lords to interfere with such legislation and might even strengthen their position.  Some Ministers felt that, as the effective governmentof the country had for many years been maintained in a singleChamber, it would be a mistake to promote legislation affirmingthe principle of a bi-cameral legislature.   Other Ministers con-sidered that the House of Lords performed a useful function inrevising legislation passed by the House of Commons and that, ifit was to continue to exercise that function, it must be allowedreasonable time for the scrutiny of legislation.   That being so, theright course would be to reduce the period within which it was required to dispose of legislation passed by the House of Commons.That period might, however, be less than that suggested by the LordChancellor in CP. (46) 376.   Thus, the Bill might provide that legislation brought up from the House of Commons should be passedby the House of Lords within six months or by the end of the current session whichever was the shorter period.   Alternatively, it might provide merely that legislation passed by the Commons should be passed by the Lords in the same Session, provided that it reachedthe Lords within a reasonable period before the end of the Session.
53 CM. so (myLegislation on these lines could be justified, not on the basis of cutting down the rights and privileges of the House of Lords, buton the ground that for the efficient conduct of its business a Govern-ment must be assured that its legislative programme for a givenSession could be passed into law within that Session.The Cabinet reached no final conclusion on the precise formof the legislation to be introduced to amend the Parliament Act,1911, and agreed that this question should be further considered bythe Machinery of Government Committee.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that legislation amending the Parliament Act, 1911,should be introduced in the coming Session;(2) Invited the Machinery of Government Committee to con-sider and report to the Cabinet what form this legisla-tion should take.Parliament.legislative programme for the1947-48Session.(previous reference:C.M.(47)47thConclusions,Minute. 4.)2. The Cabinet considered a. memorandum by the Lord Presi-dent (CP. (47) 281) submitting for their approval a final Programmeof Government Legislation for the 1947-48 Session.The Lord President said that, when allowance was made for anautumn Budget and other essential business, the Programme set outin the Annex to CP. (47) 281 would occupy almost the whole ofthe time available for legislation in the coming Session. In addi-tion, time must be found for the Bill amending the Parliament Act,which the Cabinet had now decided to include in the Programme(see Minute 1 above), and for the Bills now unforeseen which would inevitably be found to be required in the course of the Session. The1946-47 Programme had imposed a very heavy strain both on ministers and on Parliament, and at their meeting on 20th March(CM. (47) 30th Conclusions, Minute 4) the Cabinet had agreed thatthe 1947-48 Programme should be lightened. No further additions to the Programme in CP. (47) 281 could therefore be made without some compensating omissions from it.The following points were made in discussion : (a) The Prime Minister invited the Cabinet to endorse therecommendation of the Future Legislation Committee that a GasBill should be included in the Programme and that the Iron andSteel Bill should be postponed to a later Session.The Minister of Health said that, in view of the decision tointroduce in the coming Session legislation to amend the Parlia-ment Act, he would not press for the inclusion of the Iron and steel bill in this Programme.The Minister of Supply asked that an authoritative statement should be made at an early stage, preferably by the Prime minister in the Debate on the Address, explaining why the Bill was beingpostponed and promising that it would be introduced in the 1948-49Session. It would also be convenient if he could communicate theCabinet&apos;s decision in advance to representatives of the two sides ofthe industry.The Prime Minister said that some such statement would bemade in the course of the Debate on the Address. No communica-tion could, however, be made to the industry in advance of TheKing&apos;s Speech.(b) The Lord President suggested that the Restrictive PracticesBill should for the present be placed among those to be passed inthe 1947-48 Session if time permitted.The President of the Board of Trade said that, while he had hoped that the Bill would secure a definite place in the 1947-48Programme, he would not oppose this proposal.
(c) The Lord President pointed out that in present cireum-stances little or no effective work could be carried out under thepowers to be conferred by the Motorways Bill and the Milk(Special Designations) Bill. He therefore proposed that these bills should be omitted altogether from the Programme.The Minister of-Food said that, while he would not press forthe inclusion of a Milk (Special Designations) Bill in the Pro-gramme, he hoped that he might have the draft Bill printed and published.(d) The Minister of Labour suggested that the Training andEmployment Bill, which was at present included among those bills to be introduced if time permitted, should be given a. definite placein the Programme, on the understanding that the Factories bill would be postponed to a later Session.(e) The Lord Chancellor said that he hoped that a definiteplace would be found for the Legal Aid Bill in the Programme.He had been strongly pressed in the House of Lords to implement the recommendations of the Rusheliffe Report, the existence of which meant that the present inadequate system of legal aid was becoming-even less effective, since the voluntary effort on which it dependedwas no longer forthcoming to the same extent. The principles ofthe Bill had been approved by his colleagues and were supportedby the legal profession and by the Opposition.The Lord President pointed out that if this Bill was given adefinite place in the Programme it could only be at the cost of excluding some other measure.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Gas Bill and a Bill to amend the Parlia-ment Act should be included among the major Bills tobe passed in the 1947-48 Session;(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would consider, in con-sultation with the Lord President and the Minister ofSupply the form and timing of a statement about the postponement of legislation to bring the iron and steelindustry under public ownership;(3) Agreed that the Restrictive Practices Bill and the legal aid Bill should remain among those which might beintroduced if time permitted;(4) Invited the Minister of Labour to discuss with the lord president whether the Training and Employment bill might be included among the medium-sized Bills to be passed in the 1947-48 Session if the Factories Bill werepostponed to a later Session;(5) Invited the Minister of Food to raise with the legislation committee the question whether the Milk (SpecialDesignations) Bill could be printed and published, not-withstanding that it was not intended to proceed with it during the 1947-48 Session.(6) Subject to (1) and (4) above, approved Groups I to vi of the Annex to OP. (47) 281 as the Legislative Pro-gramme for the 1947-48 Session, and invited the Legis-iation Committee to keep the Programme under review.3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord President(CP. (47) 282) covering drafts of The King&apos;s Speeches on the prorogation and Opening of Parliament prepared by a Committeeof Ministers under his Chairmanship.The following points were made in discussion : (a) References to Austria should be included in paragraph of the Prorogation Speech and paragraph 9 of the Opening Speech.(b) An expression of regret for the disorders in India and pakistan should be included in paragraph 12 of the ProrogationSpeech.(c) The reference to events in Burma in paragraph 13 of the prorogation Speech should be omitted.Parliament.King&apos;speeches onthe Proroga-tion and opening ofParliament.(previous reference:CM. (46) 90thConclusions,Minute 2.)
CM. 80 (If);id) Paragraphs 26 and 27 of the Prorogation Speech should berecast into a single paragraph covering both Scotland and Wales.(e) A paragraph dealing with housing should be added to the prorogation Speech.(/) The Opening Speech should state that legislation would beintroduced to amend the Parliament Act.(g) There should be a reference in the Opening Speech to theintention to introduce a Law Reform (Personal Injuries) Bill, but no mention should be made of the Legal Aid Bills.In addition, various amendments of drafting were approved.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord President, the Minister for economic affairs, the Minister of Health and the Secretary ofState for Scotland to settle the terms of the referenceto be made to housing in the Prorogation Speech;(2) Subject to (1) and to the amendments agreed upon in thediscussion, approved the draft Speeches annexed to cp. (47) 282.Cabinet Office, S.W. t,Uth October, 1947.
