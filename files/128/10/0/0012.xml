Foreign 1.   The Minister of State said that, though precise informationAffairs. about recent events in Greece had not so far been received, it wasGreece. clear that extensive arrests had been made by the Greek Govern-ment. There had been no consultation with His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, or so far as he knew, with the United States government before these arrests had been made. The Greek Government claimed to have anticipated a major Communist plot, and the large-scalerebel attack on Konitza gave some colour to the suggestion thata Communist offensive might have been planned. It was impossibleto form definite views until more information was available, and,meanwhile, we were pressing the Greek Government to makeemergency arrangements for screening the arrested persons. There-were still 5,000 British troops in Greece, but they were not involvedin operations against the rebels.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Minister of State.2. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the attitude whichthe Government should adopt with regard to capital punishmentwhen the Criminal Justice Bill was before Parliament, and had before them a memorandum by the Home Secretary (CP. (47) 200)drawing attention to the considerations which should be borne inmind in reaching a decision on this matter.The Home Secretary recalled that at the discussion on 19th Juneit had been suggested that the question whether capital punish-ment should be abolished should be left to a free vote on the report stage of the Bill. This might well, however, be taken as an indica-tion of indecision on the part of the Government and as an invita-tion to the House of Lords to delete from the Bill any provisionabolishing the death penalty which might be inserted in it by theHouse of Commons. The Government would then be faced withthe difficult question whether the reinstatement of the provision should be left to a free vote of the House of Commons. In thesecircumstances, if the Cabinet felt unable to take the initiative byinserting in the Bill a Clause for the abolition of the death penalty,the best course might be to table a Resolution which would enablethe House to consider whether there should be more frequent recom-mendations for the exercise of the Royal Prerogative.The Secretary of State for War said that the Army and AirForce Acts provided for the death penalty for certain militaryoffences, such as shamefully delivering up a post or casting awayarms in the presence of the enemy, as well as for those offenceswhich were punishable by death under the ordinary law.Experience had shown that, if the death penalty for an offence wasabolished in peace-time it was difficult, if not impossible, to reimposeit in war, and even in time of peace conditions in the Armed Forces,whose members were necessarily in possession of lethal weapons,were not comparable with conditions in the civil community. he hoped, therefore, than any decision to abolish capital punishment for offences punishable under the ordinary law would not be extendedto cover offences punishable under military law without a carefulenquiry into the consequences of such a step.The First Lord of the Admiralty supported the Secretary ofState for War; and The Secretary of State for Air said that, thoughthe Air Council had reached the conclusion that the death penaltycould safely be abolished for all offences other than those for whichit could be imposed under the ordinary law, he agreed that an enquiry on the lines proposed would be desirable.The Lord Chancellor said that His Majesty&apos;s Judges were unanimously opposed to the abolition of the death penalty on ther 34132-2] b 2CriminalJustice Bill.ProposedAbolition ofCapitalPunishment.(previous reference:CM. (47) 55thConclusions,Minute 4.)
ground that it constituted the only effective deterrent in certain cases. Moreover, at the present time, when there was an abnormalamount of crime with violence, abolition might have very grave eon-sequences. He thought that it would be worth considering whether in preference to the suggestion that there might be more frequentrecommendations for the exercise of the Royal Prerogative, it mightbe possible to introduce a system similar to that adopted in some parts of the United States under which a distinction was made between murder in the first and second degree, the death penaltybeing reserved for cases of the former kind.In further discussion it was urged that, since Ministers werenot agreed on the merits of the question and since this divergence of view was reflected among Members of Parliament of all Parties,the right course was to leave the matter to a free vote, unless itwere found possible to avoid its being raised altogether. It waspointed out that the Government might reasonably be expected togive a lead to Parliament on a matter such as the abolition of capital punishment and that if on a free vote in the House of Commons theBill were amended to provide for abolition and the House of Lordswere subsequently to delete the provision from the Bill, the Govern-ment would be placed in an extremely awkward situation. In thesecircumstances, there, was much to be said for attempting to dis-sociate the question of the death penalty from the Criminal justice bill. One method of doing this would be to promise that a Billabolishing the death penalty would be introduced in a later Session,but before such a promise could be given it would be necessary that ministers should agree that the death penalty ought to be abolished and the discussion at the Cabinets meeting on 19th June had shownthat Ministers were divided on this question. Accordingly, thebest course seemed to be to explore further the possibility of drafting the title of the Bill in such a way as to exclude any amendment to abolish capital punishment. At the same time, an attempt shouldbe made to assess the strength of feeling among Government sup-porters in favour of abolition and to determine whether it wouldbe possible to convince them that they should refrain from pressing for the abolition of capital punishment at the present time. Itcould be represented to them that such evidence as there was ofopinion in the country did not suggest that there was any strong demand for abolition; that the Government had no mandate forthis change in the law; and that any attempt to deal with capital punishment in the Criminal Justice Bill might, in view of theattitude of the House of Lords, jeopardise the very desirable reformscontained in that Bill.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Home Secretary to ascertain whether it wouldbe possible to draft the title of the Criminal justice bill in such a way as to exclude any amendment for theabolition of capital punishment;(2) Invited the Lord President to take soundings among government supporters with a view to determining whether it would be possible to persuade those who werein favour of the abolition of capital punishment thatin the interests of securing the passage of the criminla justice Bill in the 1947-48 Session they should refrain from pressing for this change in the law;(3) Invited the Home Secretary to circulate a memorandum to the Cabinet on the suggestion made by the Lord Chan-cellor that it might be possible to distinguish between certain types of murder for which capital punishmentwould be retained and other types for which it wouldbe abolished.
3. The Cabinet Considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (47) 193) reporting certain conclusions reached bythe Ministerial Committee appointed to consider the scope and formof any legislation On electoral feforht to be introduced in the 1947-48Session.The Home Secretary said that he had set out in CP. (47) 193the conclusions so far reached by the Conrmittee as a result of their consideration of the Report of the Committee oh Electoral Registra-tion (Cmd. 7004), the Interim Report of the Committee on electoral law Reform (Cmd. 6606) and the outstanding recommendations ofthe Speakers Conference (Chid. 8534 and 6543). , The Committeehad still to consider the Final Report of the Committee on electoral law Reform, and they had not yet completed their considerationof the recommendations of the Speaker&apos;s Conference with regardto speakers&apos; expenses and increased polling facilities in rural areas.With the exception of the recommendation that postal and proxyvoting facilities should not be extended to absentee owners in Scot-land, all the conclusions set out in CP. (47) 193 were unanimous.The proposed Bill would deal not only with electoral reform butalso with the redistribution of seats, and he was fully aware of theneed to do everything possible to have the Bill ready for introductionearly in the new Session.In discussion the following points were made : (a) There was general agreement that, in accordance with theprinciple that each person should have only one Parliamentary vote,the business premises qualification and University representations should be abolished. This would not be inconsistent with the retention-tion of the arrangements under which local government electorswho Occupied, or in Scotland owned, premises in different areas should have more than one local government vote.(&amp;) The Committee had recommended that the City of Londonconstituency, the electorate of which would, with the abolition ofthe business premises qualification, be reduced to 4,585 voters, shouldbe abolished. The Cabinet were agreed that the retention of theCity as a separate constituency was indefensible but it was suggestedthat, in view of its historic associations, the title of the City ofLondon constituency should be preserved, the electorate beingenlarged by amalgamating the City with suitable portions ofadjoining Metropolitan boroughs-.(c) It was suggested that those Peers who were not entitledto a seat in the House of Lords should be given a Parliamentaryvote; and The Home Secretary undertook to consider what amend-ment of the law would be required to effect this.(cl) The Minister of State asked whether it would not be possibleto give Crown servants stationed overseas the same right to vote in Parliamentary elections as it was proposed to give to membersof the Armed Forces. It.seemed to him difficult to distinguish between a member of the Control Commission for Germany and amember of the Armed Forces who happened to be stationed inGermany.In reply it was pointed out that, if any concession were madein favour of Crown servants stationed abroad, it would be difficultto withhold it from members of commercial firms who were sent abroad; and the general view of the Cabinet was that the rightto vote in United Kingdom elections while stationed overseas shouldbe restricted to members of the Armed Forces.(e) It was questioned whether, in view of the shortage of man-power, it would be justifiable to revert to the pre-war system ofbasing the electoral register on a canvass. On the other hand, itwas pointed out that the associations of local authorities and theParty agents were strongly in favour of a reversion to the canvasssystem and that the additional work entailed would in fact becarried out by existing members of local authority staffs and byretired persons, with the result that the man-power available forproductive industry would not be affected.
(/) The Lord President and The Chancellor of the Exchequerurged that the Government should not accept the recommendation that two registers should be published each year. The abolition ofthe qualifying period of residence would enable a more up-to-dateregister to be produced, and the compilation of a second registerwould involve an additional annual expenditure of about  -  million from the Exchequer and  ^ million from the rates, as well asincreasing the pressure of work on the printing trade.As against this it was pointed out that the compilation of asecond register each year was strongly advocated by the political parties and desirable as a means of ensuring the smooth and efficient working of representative government. There were likelyto be considerable movements of population in the coming yearsand if there were only a single register each year many people would be disfranchised, which would give rise to complaint andundermine the support for Parliamentary government. more over it was unlikely that in future years there would be the same difficulties as there had been in 1945, when the need for a completereprinting of the register had coincided with a dispute in the printing trade. In these circumstances, the general view of theCabinet was in favour of providing for two registers a year.(g) It was pointed out that if the Government accepted therecommendation in paragraph 9 of CP. (47) 193 that all local elections should be beld in the spring, the question would arisewhether arrangements should be made to hold county council and district council elections on the same day. Discussions on thispoint were being held with the associations of local authorities anda final recommendation on the point would be made to the cabinet at a later date. There was much to be said for holding both countycouncil and district council elections on the same day, but there might well be objections to a similar arrangement for the LondonCounty Council and the Metropolitan borough elections.(h) The Home Secretary said that he had been in touch withthe Service Ministers in order to ensure that the Service regulations and the instructions issued to Commanding Officers were such asto ensure that all members of the Armed Forces had a full oppor-tunity of exercising their rights as citizens and that suitabledisciplinary action would be taken against any officers who failedto discharge their responsibilities in this matter.(i) The Committee had recommended that, in order to removedoubts, the law should be amended to provide that candidates at parliamentary elections (but not their wives) should be eligible to vote as absent voters. The Cabinet felt, however, that the spousesof Parliamentary candidates should also be eligible to vote as absentvoters.(j) The Home Secretary said that the Committee had intended that facilities for postal voting in Metropolitan borough electionsshould be granted, though this had not been specifically stated inparagraph 11 of CP. (47) 193.(k) The Home Secretary undertook to consult the Minister ofEducation about the use of schools for election meetings.The Cabinet (1) Subject to the points noted in paragraphs (&amp;), (c), (i) and (j)above, approved the recommendations of the ministerial committee as set out in CP. (47) 193;(2) Took note that the Home Secretary would circulate a further memorandum dealing with the recommendations of the ministerial Committee on the Final Report of the Com-mittee on Electoral Law Reform and on any other outstanding points. ...Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,Vtth July, 1947.
