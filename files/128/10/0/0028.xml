Negotiations.United StatesBequests onPreferences.(previous reference:CM. (47) 72ndConclusions,Minute 4.)34393-2b 21 The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Presi-dent of the Board of Trade (CP. (47) 266) on a request by Mr.Clavton the leader of the United States delegation at the geneva conference for further concessions in respect of the preferencesenjoyed by&apos;the United Kingdom in Commonwealth markets.The President of the Board of Trade said that the recent negotiations with United States representatives on the eliminationor reduction of preferences, which had culminated in a meeting which the Foreign Secretary and he had had with Mr. Claytonand the United States Ambassador on 21st September, had shownthat Mr. Clayton regarded the concessions offered as inadequate.It was clear that he felt it a matter of personal prestige to obtain a much wider elimination of preferences, and his latest suggestion had been that the United Kingdom Government should agree tothis, on the understanding that the process would be spread overa period of ten years and would not begin until 1950.   Though itwas difficult to assess precisely the value of the concessions madeon either side in the course of the negotiations, it was estimated thatthe offers made on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government covered avolume of trade of $160 million a year, as compared with UnitedStates offers covering $81 million a year, and he could not advise the Cabinet to authorise any further concessions.   As regardsMr. Clayton&apos;s latest suggestion, both the Foreign Secretary and he felt that it would be wrong for His Majesty&apos;s Government to pledgethemselves to begin a progressive elimination of preferences overa wider field in 1950, since it was impossible to foresee what condi-tions would be at that date.  Moreover, the tariff reductions offered by the United States Government would last for a period of threeyears only, and it seemed only fair that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould retain the right to consider in 1950 what further eliminationsof preferences they were willing to offer in the light of the proposalsof the United States Government with regard to tariff levels after1950.  If the Cabinet approved, he proposed to hand to Mr. Claytonlater in the dav a letter in the terms of the draft annexed to cp. (47) 266.The Foreign Secretary said that at the meeting on 21st Septem-ber Mr. -Clayton and the United States Ambassador had hintedthat if His Majesty&apos;s Government were not willing to offer further concessions their prospects of obtaining help under the Marshalloffer might be jeopardised. In reply he had. pointed out that, inview of the experience of His Majesty&apos;s Government in connectionwith the obligations regarding convertibility and non-discrimina-tion assumed in the Loan Agreement, they could not commit them-selves to any further obligations for the future which they mightnot be able to honour when the time came.The following points were made in discussion : (a) The Prime Minister had received a telegram from the PrimeMinister of Canada expressing the hope that the United KingdomGovernment might find it possible to reach agreement with theUnited States Government, since any failure to agree would not onlvimperil the future of the International Trade Organisation, but might well have grave consequences for the programme of UnitedStates assistance to Europe. The other Dominion Governments,however, were satisfied that the United Kingdom Government had gone as far as could reasonably be expected in the way of makingconcessions to the United States; and the Canadian Government, bythe nature of their trade, had not in fact been called unon to makeany very substantial concessions in the course of the negotiations.(&amp;) The first paragraph of the draft letter to Mr. Clayton shouldbe amended to make it clear that the offers mentioned related onlyt0 Pyrenees enjoyed by the United Kingdom in Dominion markets and did not include preferences enjoyed by the United Kingdom intne Colonies.
(c) There Was no ground for the suggestion that the offers madeby Dominion Governments had been more generous than those madeby the United Kingdom Government.(d) If the United States Government accepted the offers madeby the United Kingdom Government there was no reason to sup-pose that the other parties to the negotiations would regard them as inadequate.(e) Paragraph 12 (c) of CP. (47) 266 drew attention to thepossibility that the United States Government would refuse to release the remaining $400 million of the United States Credit ifthe trade negotiations broke down. The Chancellor of the Exchequerhoped it would be possible to obtain this sum but agreed that therisk of losing it must be accepted.(/) If the negotiations should finally break down, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should be ready to issue a clear statement both in thiscountry and in the United States showing the lengths to which theyhad gone in the attempt to secure agreement.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the President of the Board of Trade to refuseany further concessions with regard to the elimination of preferences and agreed that, subject to the amendmentnoted at (b) above, a letter in the terms of Annex Cto CP. (47) 266 should be handed by the President of theBoard of Trade to Mr. Clayton;(2) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to send the necessary instructions to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washing-ton with a view to ensuring that Mr. Marshall was fully aware of the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government andof the implications of a break-down in the negotiations;(3) Invited the Minister of State for Commonwealth relations to communicate to Dominion Governments a statementof the reasons which had led the Cabinet to their decision and a copy of the letter to Mr. Clayton;(4) Took note that the Foreign Secretary and the Presidentof the Board of Trade would prepare suitable state-ments to be issued in the United Kingdom and theUnited States in the event of a break-down in thenegotiations.Proposals for 2.   The Foreign Secretary recalled that, in his speech to theCustoms Trades Union Congress on 3rd September, he had referred to theUnions. possibility of a customs union of the Commonwealth and Empire.It seemed desirable that the difficulties and advantages of such a project should be fully explored and he proposed that a study group should be appointed for this purpose. His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould also be involved in the examination of the possibility of a european customs union, which had been proposed by the Committeeof European Co-operation, and it would be necessary for the sug-gested study group to consider how an Empire or Commonwealthcustoms union might be related to a European customs union. the study group would have to take up this question as a matter of urgency, since the United States Government were pressing for anearly report on the possibility of European customs union.The President of the Board of Trade supported the proposalfor the establishment of a study group on the lines suggested by theForeign Secretary It would be necessary to appoint a committeeto give guidance to the United Kingdom representatives on theEuropean customs union study group and it might be convenient if the same body undertook the enquiries into the possibility of an empire or a Commonwealth customs union. The first task should,in his view, be to examine a scheme for a union based on the Colonies.The Minister of State for Commonwealth Relations said that he supported the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposals. It should be realised,however, that the allusion made by the Foreign Secretary in his
speech to the Trades Union Congress had had an unfavourablereception in Canada, South Africa and India, and that the australian -lian and New Zealand Governments had so far adopted a non-committal attitude.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Colonieswelcomed the proposal for an examination of the possibility of an empire customs union. He pointed out, however, that the benefits to be derived from any such customs union would be relatively smalland there might be some opposition from Colonial Governmentswho were naturally jealous of their rights to control tariffs.In further discussion it was urged that the establishment of a customs union would not in itself contribute much towards a solutionof the economic problems of the Empire and Commonwealth andthat it was of more importance to press on with schemes for theeconomic development of the Empire and Commonwealth throughthe work of such agencies as the Colonial Development corporation and through the extension of bulk purchase arrangements with dominion and Colonial producers.The Prime Minister agreed that it was important that anystudy of the possibilities of an Empire or Commonwealth customs union should keep in view what was being done to promote thedevelopment of the resources of the Commonwealth and Empire.This would be kept in mind in settling the terms of reference ofthe proposed study group.The Cabinet-Agreed that a study group should be appointed to considerthe possibilities of an Empire or Commonwealth customs union and took note that the Prime Minister would settle the terms of reference of the study group with the Presi-dent of the Board of Trade in the light of the cabinets discussion.3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary, the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations andthe Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP. (47) 263) on the pro-problems raised by the action of the Argentine and Chilean Govern-ments in establishing posts in the sector of the Antarctic over whichthe United Kingdom Government claimed sovereignty.The Prime Minister said that, although he doubted whether the strategic considerations involved were of much importance, he agreed that His Majesty&apos;s Government should continue to maintain their title to the Falkland Islands Dependencies, making proteststo the Governments of Argentina and Chile in regard to their recent encroachments, but making it clear that they wrould acceptthe judgment of an International Court of Justice on the questionof their title to these islands.The following points were made in discussion : -(a) The Minister of Defence said that, in his view, the strategicarguments for maintaining the title of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto the territories in question were of considerable weight.(b) The Minister of Food hoped that, in the interests of UnitedKingdom fed supplies, the action proposed would be taken in sucha way as to avoid any unnecessary friction with the argentine government.(c) The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State fdr theColonies asked the Cabinet to approve the continuation of thepresent policy of maintaining posts in the Falkland IslandsDependencies.
The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that His Majesty&apos;s Government should continue tomaintain their title to the Falkland Islands Depen-tendencies on the lines proposed in paragraph (hi) of cp. (47) 263;(2) Agreed that the Dominion Governments should be givenadvance information of the course of action which it was proposed to adopt;(3) Approved the continuation of the present policy of main-taining posts in the Falkland Islands Dependencies.Wages Policy.(previous reference erence:CM. (47) 68thConclusions.)4.   The Cabinet had before them: (i) a memorandum by the Minister of Labour (CP. (47) 264)covering an interim report of a working party of officialsappointed to report on the problem of stabilising wages,and a draft statement which it was suggested that theGovernment should make after consultation with theNational Joint Advisory Council;(ii) a memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade(CP. (47) 267) covering an alternative draft of theproposed statement.The Minister of Labour said that, following the reference towages made by the Prime Minister in his speech in the House ofCommons on 6th August, he had addressed letters to both sides ofthose industries who were known to be engaged in wage negotiationsasking them to keep the Prime Minister&apos;s statement fully in mind.This had led the General Council of the Trades Union congress to raise with him the question whether the Government wereattemntins- to interfere with the normal machinery for the settle-ment of wages disputes, and the General Council had now askedfor an interview with the Prime Minister on the subject. In thesecircumstances he had thought it desirable to submit the interimreport of the working party to the Cabinet before communicatingit to the National Joint Advisory Council. It would, of course, stillbe open to Ministers to decide that the interim report should go before the National Joint Advisory Council without cabinet approval, so that its recommendations might be considered further in the light of the views expressed by the Council.In discussion reference was made to the following points : (a) The effect of any decision by the Chancellor of theExchequer to reduce the amount of the subsidies paid in respectof food-stuffs and other essential commodities would be largely offsetif workers were able to recoup themselves by obtaining wage increases. It was true that any substantial increase in the priceof essential commodities would hit the lower-paid workers hardest;but in practice it was the higher-paid wTage earners who took the lead in pressing for wage increases when the cost of living rose and obtained the biggest advances.(b) Over a considerable field employers had no inducement to oppose applications for wage increases because the cost of grantingthem could be recovered by increases in grants or subsidies or byhigher prices.(c) Action by the Government to control increases in wages would not be generally acceptable to wage earners unless it were accompanied by effective steps to restrict profits.(d) The number of vacancies notified to the Ministry of labour in those industries which were of importance from the point of viewof the balance of payments was relatively small, and it should bepossible to secure the necessary transfer of labour to these industries by controlling the supply of raw materials and the placing of orders.Any attempt by the Government to impose ceilings on wages would lead to a dangerous situation and, as experience in the British and united States Zones of Germany had shown, would undermine theposition of the trade unions.
(e) The Minister, of Agriculture felt that the last paragraph ofthe; draft public statement annexed to CP. (47) 264 could not beregarded as applying to agriculture, since in November 1946, theGovernment had undertaken that, where a substantial rise in costs,such as an appreciable, increase in the statutory minimum wage,occurred between the annual February reviews, there should be an automatic increase in agricultural prices of an amount sufficient tocover the increase in costs; and he hoped he would be authorised togive an assurance that the statement did not in any way derogatefrom that undertaking.(/) It would be impossible to interfere with the impendingincreases in the wages of Scottish farm workers who were due toreceive in November an increase corresponding to the 10s. a weekincrease already granted to agricultural workers in England andWales., (g) The Treasury would not wish to be prevented from givingwage increases to the middle grades of sub-professional workers clerks of works, technical foremen, engineering assistants and the like who had not yet been given increases in pay corresponding tothose already granted to the professional and technical classes ofthe Civil Service. The numbers involved were about 30,000, and ageneral promise had been given to them that they would receiveincreases which Avould operate from 1st January, 1946.The Prime Minister said that the right course appeared to beto put the interim report of the working party before the national joint Advisory Council as a document to which the Governmentwere not committed, but on which they desired to obtain the viewsof the National Joint Advisory Council. Before this was done,however, he would meet the General Council of the Trades UnionCongress in accordance with the request which they had made tohim. His own view was that the recommendations in the interimreport would not contribute much towards a solution of the problems raised by the present inflationary pressure. He recalled that at their meeting on 17th July (CM. (47) 62nd Conclusions, Minute 3), theCabinet had asked the Lord President and the Minister of labour to discuss the general question of wages policy with representativesof the trades unions, and said that he hoped that these discussions could take place at an early date.The Cabinet-Agreed that, subject to the omission of the draft public statement, the interim report attached to CP. (47) 264should be submitted to the National Joint Advisory council for their observations after the Prime Minister had hada preliminary meeting with die General Council of theTrades Union Congress.Man-Power.UnproductiveEmployments.(previous reference erence:CM. (47) 75thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. At their meeting on 9th September the Cabinet had invited the Man-Power Committee to consider the detailed proposals in thereport annexed to CP. (47) 248, on possible means of directing toproductive work the unoccupied and those engaged in unproductiveoccupations.The Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Labour (CP. (47) 265), reporting the conclusions reached by the Man-Power Committee.The Minister of Labour said that it was proposed that an order should be made under Defence Regulation 58A giving him powerto require the managements of undertakings of any type to registerparticulars of themselves and their employees. He proposed thathe should use this power to call for particulars from the manage-ments of football pools and other gambling enterprises. He also had it in mind that he might call on the managements of certain clubsto submit particulars, though it would be undesirable to require this of all clubs, and he proposed that his Department should study, inconsultation with the other Departments concerned, the method ofselecting the clubs which were to be called on to register particulars.
With regard to street trading, the Man-Power Committee pro-posed that a Bill should be introduced to provide that any person who engaged in street trading must have a certificate that he hadregistered for employment and was not required for essential work.The Committee had realised that this Bill might be controversial,but had felt that it was most important that the Government should appear to be doing everything possible to divert to productive work  the type of street trader who performed no useful function.The third proposal of the Man-Power Committee was that allunoccupied persons within the ages of control should be called uponto register compulsorily. It was true that there might be consider-able evasion of this requirement, but the Government could not afford to lay themselves open to the charge of neglecting anypotential source of labour.In discussion the following points were made : (a) The scope of the proposed order under Defence Regulation58A should be wide enough to enable the Ministry of Labour to callon the managers of fun fairs and similar enterprises to registerparticulars. It might, however, arouse opposition if it were drafted in such wide terms as to cover all types of business.(&amp;) There was general agreement that it would be undesirable to introduce separate legislation to control street trading on the lines proposed in paragraph 3 of CP. (47) 265; and it was suggested thatthe Minister of Labour should consider whether it would not bepossible to achieve the desired result by requiring persons whoengaged in street trading to register under the same powers as wouldbe used to secure the registration of unoccupied persons.The Cabinet-(1) Subject to the point noted at (a) above, approved the pro-posal that an order should be made under defence regulation 58A giving the Minister of Labour powerto require the managements of undertakings includingfootball pools, gambling enterprises, fun fairs and clubs *to register particulars of themselves and their employees;(2) Agreed that the Minister of Labour should require allunoccupied persons within the ages of control to register;(3) Invited the Minister of Labour to consider what steps he might take, without fresh legislation, to require persons engaged in street trading to register.Coal. 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theHours of Minister of Fuel and Power (CP. (47) 268) reporting that theWorking in the National Coal Board saw no prospect of settling the question of anCoalmining extension of working hours on the lines agreed by the Cabinet atIndustry.        their meeting on 20th September.(Previous j1 he Minister of Fuel and Power drew attention to the corres-reference: pondence with the Chairman of the National Coal Board annexedCM. (47)76th to CP. (47) 268. The attitude of.the Board was that in their provi-Conclusions, sional agreement with the Union they had made the best practicableMinute 7.) settlement by stipulating that there would be no question of Satur-day working at overtime rates unless all possible measures to imple-ment the five-day week agreement had been taken, and that any arrangements at a pit for Saturday working could be terminatedby them at one month&apos;s notice if there was excessive absenteeism.He had also discussed the matter with the President and Secretaryof the National Union of Mineworkers, who had reminded him ofMr. Horner&apos;s letter of 11th September, which made it clear thatthe Union would not accept Saturday working on the conditionsagreed to by the Cabinet on 20th September. He was, therefore,driven to the conclusion that, if an increased output of coal was tobe secured, the Cabinet must accept the proposals on which theNational Coal Board and the National Union of Mineworkers hadprovisionally agreed.
Game Prices.(previous reference:CM. (47) 74thConclusions;Minute 2.)The Foreign Secretary said that that he found it difficult tounderstand the policy of the National Coal Board. At the meetings which he and other Ministers had with the Board and the union on 21st August, the function of Ministers had been to act as achannel of negotiation between the Board and the Union. Accordingto his recollection the Board had specifically stated that they couldnot agree to Saturday working at overtime rates unless the workers were required to work six shifts before qualifying for the atten-dance bonus, and it was on this point that negotiations had broken down. For his own part he would 9a.tb.er rely on the continuanceof the five-day week arrangements with any voluntary arrangements that might be made for extra working on the five week-days thanaccept Saturday working under the conditions now proposed.Unless there was an adequate sanction against men who failed towork for six days each week there could be no assurance that therewould not be widespread absenteeism; and an arrangement which enabled a miner to obtain higher wages without any guarantee of a return in the shape of longer hours of work could not fail to causedissatisfaction and unrest among workers in other industries.In further discussion reference was made to the difficultieswhich would arise from the proposal that the Divisional Coal boards and the Area Executives of the Union should have to agree that thelevel of attendance at individual pits was satisfactory before over-time could be worked. Unless there could be a general agreement that attendance must reach a level of, say, 95 per cent, to be regardedas satisfactory, this requirement would be a prolific source of disputes. Moreover, it suffered from the defect that, whereas theGovernment proposal made each miner answerable for his ownabsenteeism, the Board&apos;s proposal meant that individual miners with good records would be penalised because of the performance of thegit as a whole.The Prime Minister said that the matter was not one on whicha formal direction could properly be issued to the National coal board. In these circumstances the right course appeared to be forthe Minister of Fuel and Power to write to the Board recapitulatingbriefly the course of the earlier discussions and indicating that,while the Government were satisfied with the arrangements pro-posed in regard to overtime on the existing world) 5 days, they were of opinion that the proposed arrangements for Saturday workingwere unsatisfactory. It should, at the same time., be made clear tothe Board that the final decision must rest with them and that theymust take full responsibility for it.The Cabinet-7. At their meeting on 25th August the Cabin i, had asked the Minister of Food to consider the reimposition maximum prices for game birds.The Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Food (CP. (47) 253) setting out the reasons why, in his view, the imposition of maximum prices would serve no useful purpose.The Cabinet-Agreed that the price control of game bird.s should not bereimposed.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,25th September, 1947.Agreed that the Minister of Fuel and Power ?letter to the National Coal Board on the linesthe Prime Minister.)iild send adicated by
