Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.Business inthe House ofLords.1. The Cabinet discussed the arrangements for handling thefurther stages of the Debate on the Address. For the remainder of the current week discussion would turn mainly on the economicsituation : on Monday. 27th October, there would be a discussion on foreign affairs, including German questions : and the two con-cluding days, 28th and 29th October, would be devoted to a debate on the Opposition Amendment. In this week&apos;s discussion of theeconomic situation, the Government spokesmen would be theMinister for Economic Affairs and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Prime Minister would settle, in consultation with the lord president and the Chief Whip, who should speak on behalf of theGovernment in the concluding stages of the debate in the following week.The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the business whichit was proposed to take in the House of Commons in the following week, after the conclusion of the Debate on the Address.The House of Lords had concluded their Debate on the Address.On 28th October they would discuss the reductions in the strengthof the Armed Forces, and the First Lord of the Admiralty would speak on behalf of the Government. On 28th and 29th Octoberthere would be a debate on the economic situation, in which theGovernment spokesmen would be the Secretary of State for burma and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.Parliament.Reports of theCommittee of privileges onthe Cases ofMr. GarryAllighan, M.P.,and Mr. EvelyaWalkden, M.P.(previous reference:C.M.(47)66thConclusions,Minute 1.)2.   The Cabinet had before them :  (i) a memorandum by the Lord President (CP. (47) 290) onthe line to be taken by the Government in the forth-corning debate on the reports of the Committee of privileges on the cases of Mr. Garry Allighan, M.P.,and Mr. Evelyn Walkden, M.P.; and(ii) a note by the Secretary Of the Cabinet (CP. (47) 297)covering a telegram from the Attorney-General com-menting on the proposals put forward in CP. (47) 290.The Lord President said that these reports raised the important question (on which the Committee of Privileges had itself been divided) how far meetings of groups of Members, such as meetingsof the Parliamentary Labour Party, attracted to themselves or tothe Members attending them any of the law and custom of Parlia-ment affecting the conduct of Members. After discussion with the clerk of the House of Commons, whose final views on this difficult question were set out in the confidential memorandum annexed to cp. (47) 290, he had reached the conclusion that it was not possibleto sustain the view of the majority of the Committee thatMr. Allighan and Mr. Walkden had been guilty of breaches of privilege. This did not imply that there might not be occasions when the disclosure of information about Parliamentary businessacquired at a Party meeting would be a breach of privilege; but hewas satisfied that in these particular cases the relation between theinformation disclosed and actual proceedings of the House was not sufficiently specific to involve a breach of privilege. He had care-fully considered the arguments set out in the telegram from the attorney-General annexed to CP. (47) 297, but he remained of theopinion that it was possible to maintain that there had been nobreaches of privilege without being driven to the conclusion thatthe Members should go unpunished. Both Members had been guilty of dishonourable conduct in betraying confidence for money; andMr. Allighan&apos;s article clearly constituted an affront to the dignityof Parliament, which could be regarded as an act tending to obstruct the Houses in the performance of their functions by diminishingthe respect due to them. Moreover, Mr. Allighan&apos;s offence hadbeen aggravated by his giving of wilfully misleading evidence tothe Committee. He accordingly recommended that the case ofMr. Allighan should be dealt with by putting down a motion in the34526-3 B 2
terms of the draft set out in paragraph 13 of CP. (47) 290, andthat a corresponding motion, with appropriate modifications, shouldbe put down to cover the case of Mr. Walkden. As regards penalties,his view was that it should be recommended to the House thatMr. Allighan should be severely reprimanded and suspended fromthe service of the House until after the Easter Eecess of 1948, andthat the House should be asked to decide whether his salary as aMember should be suspended for this period. Mr. Walkden&apos;s offencehad been lighter and a reprimand seemed to be a suitable penalty.As regards Mr. Heighway, he endorsed the recommendation of theCommittee that he should be reprimanded, though not on thegrounds for which they had proposed the penalty. No further action should be taken against the journalists concerned, but the Housemight be asked to agree to a motion in the terms set out in para-graph 14 of CP. (47) 290, warning journalists that, if anyrepresentative of a newspaper or press agency were hereafter foundto have been responsible for offering bribes for the disclosure of confidential information about Parliamentary matters, that repre-sentative and any other representative of the same newspaper oragency might be excluded from the precincts of the House. Finally,he suggested that the terms of reference of the Committee of privileges should in future make it clear that the Committee&apos;sjurisdiction enabled it to consider all relevant matters.The Lord Chancellor said that he was in general agreementwith the views expressed by the Lord President on the questionwhether there had been breaches of privilege. On the other hand,he was satisfied that both Mr. Allighan and Mr. Walkden had been guilty of dishonourable conduct as Members of Parliament andshoukl, on this ground, be punished.In further discussion the following points were made : (a) The second part of the draft motion in paragraph 13 of cp. (47) 290 should be recast so as to condemn the giving of mis-leading evidence to the Committee as an aggravation of the offencementioned in the first part of the motion rather than as an indepen-dent offence.(b) The third part of the draft motion should be amended soas to bring it out that the essence of the offence was, not the dis-closure of information about Parliamentary matters obtained underthe obligation of confidence, but the disclosure of information which mr. Allighan had obtained in his capacity as a Member of Parlia-ment from other Members of Parliament, for it was this that tended to destroy mutual confidence among Members.(c) The Minister of Health dissented from the proposal thatMr. Allighan should be suspended for the period up to the easter recess, 1948, on the ground that suspension for so long a periodamounted to disfranchising the constituency.It was the general view of the Cabinet that nothing less thana severe reprimand, together with a long period of suspension with-out payment of salary, would suffice to mark the gravity ofMr. Allighan&apos;s offence.The Cabinet (1) Agreed generally that, while the decisions of the House onthese reports of the Committee of Privileges should beleft to a free vote, the Lord President should advise theHouse on behalf of the Government in the senseindicated in paragraphs 8 to 11 of CP. (47) 290;(2) Invited the Lord President to reconsider, in the light ofthe points noted in paragraphs (a) and (&amp;) above, theterms of the draft motion proposed in oarasTaph 13 of cp. (47) 290;(3) Agreed that the Government should put down in respectof Mr. Walkden a motion in similar terms to the thirdpart of the motion relating to Mr. Allighan, as revised in accordance with Conclusion (2) above;
(4) Agreed that the House should be advised to reprimandMr. Allighan severely and to suspend him from theservice of the House for the period up to the easter recess of 1948, his salary as a Member of Parliamentbeing suspended for this period; and that the house should be advised to reprimand Mr. Walkden andMr. Heighway;(5) Agreed that, as a warning to journalists against offering-bribes for the disclosure of confidential information byMembers of Parliament, a motion should be put down inthe terms suggested in paragraph 14 of CP. (47) 290,subject to any amendments consequential on the revisionof the motion relating to Mr. Allighan&apos;s case;(6) Agreed that the terms of reference of the Committee of privileges should in future make it clear that the Com-mittee&apos;s jurisdiction was sufficiently wide to enable itto consider all relevant matters.3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Ministerof Food (CP. (47) 295) containing proposals for regulating thedistribution of potatoes.The Minister of Food said that the 1947 potato crop was likelyto be 20 per cent, less than that of 1946; and it was estimated thatthe quantity available for the civilian market in the next eight months would be only 2,252,000 tons as against 3,848,000 tons in thesame period of 1946-47. The gap of 1,396,000 tons could only be closed by reducing consumption. It was, unfortunately, impracticable-able to do this by an official system of differential rationing;and he recommended the adoption of a distribution schemeproviding for a fiat rate allowance a bead, which would be recordedby the marking of rationing books by retailers. On the figures given, it would be necessary to secure a reduction in average con-sumption from b\ lbs. to 3^ lbs. a head a week; this would mean that, after allowing for consumption in schools, canteens and catering establishments, the weekly allowance for issue to domestic consumers against the ration book would be only 2\ lbs. a head aweek. The scheme proposed was clearly far from satisfactory; it provided no guarantee of supplies to the individual, it took no account of varying nutritional needs, and enforcement would be virtually impossible. The proposed reduction in potato consump-tion, taken together with the restrictions in food imports from dollar sources already approved by the Cabinet, would reduce the averagedaily calorie level of the people&apos;s food to 2,675. If it was necessaryfor the Minister for Economic Affairs to make some reference, inhis speech that day in the Debate on the Address, to the need for restricting potato consumption, it would be inadvisable for him to deny that these reductions, taken as a whole, would have gravenutritional consequences.In discussion attention was drawn to the serious disadvantages of this scheme for controlling the distribution of potatoes. It tookno account of very wide variations in consumption between differentgroups of consumers and between individuals within those groups.The fixing of an official allowance might encourage some people toeat more potatoes than they did at present. Many people wouldhave access to additional supplies over and above the official allow-ance, and this would increase the sense of inequality. The schemeseemed bound to give rise to widespread complaints which would tend to undermine the stability of food rationing as a whole. would it not be preferable, therefore, to rely on a voluntary restriction of consumption ? Alternatively, should not the introduction of such ascheme be postponed until the possibility of abolishing bread rationing had been fully explored. There would be much less objection to this scheme if it could be introduced simultaneously with the abolition of bread rationing.
Balance ofPayments.DollarExpenditurein 1948.(previous reference:CM. (47) 81stConclusions,Minute 3.)4. In the course of the discussion recorded in the preceding-Minute, the Cabinet had occasion to review their decisions of20th October regarding the reductions to be made in the levels offood consumption with a view to reducing the prospective deficit in our balance of payments with dollar countries in 1948.The Minister of Health said that on reflection he doubted the wisdom of cutting food rations to the extent then approved by theCabinet. The estimates of dollar income and expenditure on which those decisions had been based admittedly contained a substantialmargin of error. Thus, the import programme for 1948 provided 69-5 million for the purchase of steel; but he now understood thatthe Ministry of Supply were satisfied that the supplies available for export from North America would fall substan-tially short of that requirement. Similarly, the Presidentof the Board of Trade had informed the Cabinet that it might bepossible to expand our exports to North America beyond the figuresassumed in the memorandum (CP. (47) 283) on which the CabinetsIn further discussion, the following particular points weremade : a(a) A measure of flexibility would be introduced into thescheme proposed in CP. (47) 295 if it could be provided that personsentitled to additional rations under the bread rationing scheme should be entitled to additional potatoes.(b) Were the Government open to criticism for failing to take Imeasures to regulate consumption earlier in the season with a viewto conservingsupplies ? It was pointed out that an accurate estimate of the crop could not have been made at an earlier date,and that emergency arrangements had already been introduced withthe object of restricting the run-down of stocks.(c) The shortfall in the current year&apos;s potato crop was generally known, and there was already widespread expectation that theGovernment woidd introduce a scheme for reducing consumption.Was there risk of a serious run on stocks while the matter was still under consideration?The Cabinet were informed that the remaining stocks weresteadily being bought by the Government or brought under Govern-ment control. It was unlikety, therefore, that there would be asubstantial run on stocks.(d) The Cabinet were informed that the estimate in paragraph 2of the Annex to CP. (47) 295 for shrinkage, w^aste and consumptionon farms (790,000 tons) assumed that, as a result of the weather conditions, wastage would be abnormally low. On the other hand,there was some evidence of diver sion for stock-feeding.(e) The Minister of Health endorsed the views expressed bythe Minister of Food on the effects on the morale and health of thecountry of a reduction in the level of calorie intake to 2,675. Inhis view, production would be gravely prejudiced in consequence.(/) There was general agreement that, whether or not a schemefor controlling the consumption of potatoes was adopted, it wouldbe advisable to maintain publicity to reduce waste of potatoes.(g) While it was preferable that the Governments decisions on reductions in food rations should so far as possible be announced at one time, it would not be possible for the Minister for economic affairs to make any detailed statement on potatoes in his speech inthe House of Commons that day. It was agreed that the Ministetsstatement should deal mainly with the cuts in food-stuffs involvingdollar expenditure.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Food to submit an early report onthe possibility of linking the introduction of a scheme for controlling the consumption of potatoes with the abolitionof bread rationing.
decisions had been based. The Minister therefore doubted whether these estimates were sufficiently reliable to warrant the drasticreductions which the Cabinet had decided to make m the level otfood consumption. In any event, he feared that the nutritional andpsvchological consequences of these cuts would have the effect otreducing industrial output and would thus diminish our power tosecure that expansion of exports on which we must rely to redressour balance of payments. He thought it would be particularly difficult to defend a decision to reduce the sugar ration, at thebeginning of a difficult winter, when ample supplies of sugar wereavailable and were being added to existing stocks.The President of the Board of Trade said that he still believed&apos; that the assumptions about the expansion of our exports to north america which had been accepted by the Cabinet on 20th Octoberwere unduly conservative; and he would himself have been preparedto take the risk that our dollar income from exports would exceed the figures assumed in CP. (47) 283. He also believed that dollar expenditure on imports of timber would prove to be less than hadbeen assumed. The memorandum on which the Cabinet&apos;s decisions had been based had been prepared at short notice and he had had little opportunity, before the Cabinet&apos;s meeting, to scrutinise itsstatistical assumptions.The Minister of Food agreed that our prospective balance ofpayments with dollar countries must be reduced by a figure of theorder of  175 million. He believed, however, that in determining the cuts required for this purpose the Cabinet had misjudged theproper order of priorities. He thought that heavier cuts could bemade in supplies of tobacco, films and raw materials and that the cuts in food consumption should be proportionately lighter. Theopinion was held in some quarters that industrial workers in thiscountry would not appreciate the gravity of the economic situationunless there was some noticeable reduction in their present standardof living; and he feared that the recommendations on which theCabinet&apos;s decisions had been based had been put forward with this in view.In reply to these points other Ministers argued that it wouldbe unwise to assume that the margin of error in the estimates would,on balance, operate to our advantage. Exports to North Americamight exceed the amount assumed in the estimates, but equally theymight fall short of it. The estimates also assumed that we shouldnot incur any dollar expenditure on Germany in 1948; and it was by no means certain that this assumption would be realised. Itwas not the case that the assumptions had been based on apessimistic, or even a conservative, estimate of our prospects. Asregards steel, it was common ground that supplies from north america were not likely to meet in full the requirements includedin the original import programme; and the estimated expenditure under this head had already been reduced by  13 million in the calculations which had been put before the Cabinet on 20th October.The decision to accumulate stocks of sugar could readilv be defendedon the ground that these stocks would form part of our reserves andwould serve to reduce our dollar expenditure in future years.The Minister for Economic Affairs and the Chancellor of theExchequer said that, in submitting their recommendations to theCabinet on 20th October, they had been concerned to find means of reducing the prospective deficit in our balance of payments withdollar countries. The hard facts of the economic situationdemanded cuts in imports as well as expansion of exports. It was important that both the Government and the public should facethose facts, and that the necessary adjustments in our economyshould be made as quickly as possible. If, however, their recom-mendations involved some lowering of living standards in thiscountry, this was due to the necessities of our economic situationand not to any idea that increased output should be sought bydepressing living standards.
The Minister of Health indicated that he still doubted the expediency of making the proposed cuts in food consumption levels.In further discussion reference was again made to the needfor exploring every possibility of obtaining additional supplies offood from non-dollar sources. The Minister of Food said that hewas at present bound by a decision that purchases from non-dollar sources should not exceed  508 million in the year 1947-48. TheChancellor of the Exchequer said that he was fully prepared todiscuss proposals for specific food purchases from non-dollar sourceswhich might bring the total of such purchases above that ceiling.The Cabinet-(1) Reaffirmed their decisions of 20th October, regarding the. reductions to be. made in the food import programmefrom dollar countries in 1948 and the consequentialadjustments in the levels of food consumption in thiscountry;(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerfor Economic Affairs, in consultation with the Ministerof Eood, to consider how the import programme shouldbe adjusted to give greater flexibility in respect of foodpurchases from non-dollar sources, and what further steps could be taken to obtain increased supplies from such sourcesCabinet Office. S.W. 1.2Brd October, 1947.
