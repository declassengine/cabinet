Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.allocation of Granth amFactories.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.21st July would be the thirteenth allotted Supply Day. Areport from the Public Accounts Committee on currency losses inEurope would be considered, and there would be a debate on theArmy. A Motion to approve the Greenwich Hospital accountswould also be taken.On 22nd July, the fourteenth allotted Supply Day, there wouldbe a debate on Scottish affairs. The Eeport Stage and third reading of the Education (Exemptions) (Scotland) Bill and theLocal Government (Scotland) Bill would also be taken.On 23rd July the Lords&apos; amendments to the Transport bill would be considered.On 24th July, the fifteenth allotted Supply Day, there wouldbe a debate on the work of the Ministry of Supply. A Motion to approve the National Health Service (Superannuation) regulations would also be taken.On 25th July it was proposed to take the Committee and remaining Stages of the Wellington Museum Bill; to conclude theCommittee Stage of the Crown Proceedings Bill and, if possible,to take its remaining Stages; to consider the Lords&apos; amendments to the Statistics of Trade Bill and the Industrial Organisation Bill,and, if there was time, to take the Report Stage and Third reading of the Companies Bill. In the absence of the President of theBoard of Trade, the Parliamentary Secretary, with the assistanceof the Paymaster-General and the Solicitor-General, would dealwith the Statistics of Trade Bill, the Industrial Organisation Bill,and the Companies Bill.The Cabinet were informed that Opposition Members had putdown a Motion calling for the appointment of a Select Committeeto enquire into the allocation of the Grantham factories.There was general agreement that the right course was for theLord President to resist this proposal. It would ease the task ofthe Lord President if the President of the Board of Trade, in replying to the Parliamentary Questions addressed to him on thissubject, would do what he could to clear up the misunderstandingswhich had arisen.Madame 2. The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the terms of aPeron. resolution protesting against the proposed visit of Madame Peron(Previous to Great Britain, which had been passed at a recent delegate meetingReference: of the London Trades Council. Ministers felt that the significanceCM. (47) 55th of this might be misunderstood in the Argentine, and that Anglo-Conclusions, Argentine relations might in consequence be affected adversely. ItMinute 7.) would, therefore, be desirable to acquaint the Argentine Govern -ment with the status of the Council.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to instruct His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Buenos Aires to take such action as he might think advisable to remove any local misconceptionsabout the significance of the London Trades CounciFsresolution relating to Madame Peron&apos;s proposed visit toGreat Britain.Wages Policy.(previous reference ei-ence:CM. (47) 59thConclusions,Minute 4.)3.   The Cabinet had before them-(i) a memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Power (CP.(47) 189) advocating the establishment of a central advisory councilto investigate and report on claims for higher wages in the lightof the relevant economic and social considerations, and to comment on the advisability of fixing minimum wage rates for all workers[34132-3] B 2
Annexed to this was a memorandum which the Minister had circulated to the Lord Presidents Committee setting out proposalsfor a national wages policy;(ii) a memorandum by the Minister of Labour (CP. (47) 190)describing the existing arbitration machinery for dealing with questions of wages and conditions of work and opposing the sugges-tion that a central arbitral body should be established;(hi) a memorandum by the Minister of Labour (CP. (47) 195)commenting on the proposals made in CP. (47) 189 and covering amemorandum which the Minister had circulated to the Lord Presi-dents Committee on the proposals made by the Minister of Fuel and power for a national wages policy; and(iv) a memorandum by the Lord President (CP. (47) 202)urging that more active steps should be taken to bring borne thefacts of the economic situation to all those concerned with claims for higher wages or shorter hours, and suggesting certain administrative action which would help the Government to exercisemore control over changes in wages and hours of work.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the Lord presidents committee had been increasingly concerned about the effect on thenational economy of the unco-ordinated increases in wages and reductions in hours of work which had taken place since the end ofthe war.   But, though almost a year had elapsed since he had submitted to the Committee proposals for a national wages policy,no recommendations on these proposals had been made by theCommittee to the Cabinet.   The Minister of Labour claimed thatthe results of the working of the existing system had been most satisfactory, and in support of this had compared the reductions in hours of work, the increases in wage rates, and the number of dayslost through trade disputes since the war with the corresponding figures for 1919-20.  It had to be borne in mind, however, that hoursof work in 1945 were already much lower than hours of work at theend of the 1914-18 war, and that the much greater rise in wage ratesbetween 1914 and 1920 could be explained by the fact that afterthe 1914-18 war all controls had been abandoned and no attempthad been made to stabilise wages by means of food subsidies.  Again,the number of working days lost through trade disputes in the past three years could not be fairly compared with the number lost afterthe 1914-18 war, since conditions then were entirely different. Thefailure of the existing system to work satisfactorily could be illustrated from the experience of the coal-mining industry, in whichit had been necessary to agree to shorter hours, and it would benecessary to face a demand for higher wages, which in turn would lead to an increase in the cost of coal.   Moreover, labour recruited from Ireland for work in the mines was drifting away into betterpaid employment in the motor industry.   He recognised that anyproposal to set up a central advisory council would encounter someopposition from trade unions, but he believed that, if it could bemade clear that it was not intended that the Government shouldintervene in the settlement of individual wage claims, the proposal would be generally accepted.  It was an essential part of his scheme that the council should advise on all wage claims made by tradeunions, including claims which the employers&apos; side were willing to concede, and that its functions should not be restricted to dealingwith those claims which were to go to arbitration.  He also regarded it as important that the council should comment on the advisability of determining minimum wage rates for all workers.The Minister of Labour said that, in his view, it would be disastrous to attempt to consolidate the existing machinery for arbitration in a central body. Nor would it be possible to requireall claims to be referred to a central advisory council withoutweakening the position of the trade unions and destroying all sense of responsibility in the parties to wage negotiations, sincepronouncements by the council could not be confined to purelyobjective statements of economic facts, and the procedure wouldin practice amount to a compulsory court of enquiry in advance
of negotiations. It was incorrect to suggest that the Governmenthad been unable to exercise any influence on wages claims. Forexample, it had been possible to secure the rejection of the claim of building workers for higher wages. Nor was it true, as hadbeen suggested, that each arbitral body dealt-with the claims coiningbefore it without reference to the general economic situation or tothe position in other industries. In his opinion, the right course was to continue the policy of drawing arbitrators from a selectedgroup of persons who could be depended upon to take a broad andstatesmanlike view, and of employing the same person as chairmanof a number of wages councils or wages boards. He was preparedto accept the suggestions made by the Lord President in para-graph 10 of CP. (47) 202, but he suggested that it would be useful if in the first instance there were discussions with representativesof the trade unions.The Lord President said that in conditions of full employment the Government could not keep control of the economic situationunless they found a solution for the problems presented by unco-ordinated increases in wages and reductions in hours of work. Thetrade union leaders had, on the whole, shown a considerable sense of responsibility, but a great deal remained to be done in educatingthe rank and file in such matters as the effect of uncontrolled wage increases on our ability to find markets for our exports. Over thepast two years the Government had repeatedly been embarrased by concessions made in individual industries without regard to theeffect on other industries or on the national economy as a whole,and he sympathised with the view of the Minister of Fuel and power that positive action to remedy this was necessary. On theother hand, he did not think it would be safe to make such an abruptdeparture from the established methods of negotiation as would be involved in setting up a central advisory council. Hitherto, theGovernment had not kept in close enough touch with the parties concerned in claims for higher wages or shorter hours, and it seemedto him essential that the Minister of Labour should set up an organisation to keep track of all claims and to report promptly theeffect which the granting of each claim was likely to have on theman-power required, on the charges made to the consumer, on national subsidies, and on similar claims put forward by other workers. The Minister should also find means of ensuring thattribunals, courts of enquiry, wages councils and other similar bodieswere suitably informed about the national interests. It would alsobe desirable for the Central Economic Planning Staff and theEconomic Section of the Cabinet Office to furnish the Minister with information about the relationship between wages policy considera-tions and the working out of economic policy and economic planningtargets. These proposals represented only a first step towardsdealing with the wages problem, but he was convinced that if theywere put into effect vigorously many of the present difficulties couldbe avoided.The Minister of Health said that if the Government intervenedin wage negotiations in the sphere of private enterprise they would inevitably be regarded as siding with the employers. Thus, therewas great resentment among the building workers, who knew thatthe Government had encouraged the employers to reject their wagesclaims. On the other hand, he did not see how. the Governmentcould escape responsibility for intervening in claims affectingworkers in socialised industries, in the local Government service or in industries, such as agriculture, which were largely dependenton Government subsidies; and he felt that it would be necessaryto devise a procedure for settling such claims which would openlyrecognise the interests of the Government. If a satisfactory pro-cedure could be worked out, it would not only protect the Govern-ment against unreasonable claims, but would also have an indirectbeneficial effect on negotiations in private industry.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was essential thatthe Government should take some positive action. He was in favourof the proposals put forward in paragraph 10 of CP. (47) 202 in
reference to the establishment of a central advisory council, bute thought there was a case for an enquiry by a committee ofMinisters into the proper procedure for handling wages claims by workers in socialised industries or in the local Government service.He was also in favour of encouraging public discussion of theproblems of wages policy, particularly by trade union leaders. Itwas interesting to note that, whereas at the Labour Party Con-f erence it had been generally agreed that direction of labour was outof the question, the General Secretary of the Transport and general works&apos; Union had now suggested that a limited amount of direction of labour might be necessary.The Minister of Transport said that he viewed with somemisgiving the suggestion that a special tribunal might be set up todeal with claims made by workers in socialised industries. these industries now covered a very large part of the national economy,and experience had shown that Government intervention, which infact meant political intervention, was not likely to provide effectiveresistance to wage increases or to encourage the downward move-ment of wages when this was necessary in the general interest.The President of the Board of Trade said that it should berecognised that in many industries the employers had at present no interest in keeping wage rates down. Thus, advice from a central advisory council on particular wages claims would be ineffectiveunless it were a preliminary to arbitration. He believed that inthe end it might be necessary to make provision for a central arbitral tribunal of a judicial kind and, though it might as yet be too early to establish such a body to deal with claims by workers in private industry, it seemed desirable that a special tribunal should be setup to deal with claims from workers in socialised industries and inthe local Government service. He supported the proposals madein paragraph 10 of CP. (47) 202 as a first step towards dealingwith the problem, and he suggested that it would be useful to havea frank and informal talk with representatives of trade unions.Other points in discussion were :(a) The Minister of Agriculture said that he favoured theappointment of a central advisory council, provided that its functions were confined to the collection and dissemination ofinformation and advice on wages questions. He pointed out thatthe recent increase in the minimum agricultural wage badimmediately been followed by a claim for increased wages from road-workers. The General Secretary of the National Union of municipal and General Workers had taken a reasonable view aboutthe relation between agricultural workers&apos; and roadworkers&apos; wages,but he was unable to control the activities of the individual branchesof the union.(&amp;) An unsatisfactory feature of the existing methods of handling claims by local Government servants for increased wageswas the presence on the employers&apos; side of trade unionists wdio werelocal authority members.(c) The Minister of Food said that the risks involved in not taking positive action to control wages should not be under-estimated. Unless the Government found a way of influencingwages so as to induce labour to flow in the desired direction, their economic policy would fail.(d) The Home Secretary pointed out that the habit of judgingwage rates in particular industries by reference to the wages paidin corresponding industries was deep-seated and that it would bedifficult to eradicate the belief that roadmen and other rural workersmust always receive higher rates of wages than agricultural workers. He believed that a central advisory council, on the lines suggested by the Minister of Fuel and Power, would prove necessaryin the long run, and he suggested that, as a preliminary step,arrangements might be made to submit to arbitral bodies who were considering wages claims, objective statements of the economic factors affecting these claims.
(e) The Minister of Education said that, though it was truethat the two sides of the cotton industry bad agreed on shorter working hours without reference to the Government, he believedthat the shorter hours were justified in view of the large numberof married women employed in the industry. It was impossible to expect workers who had been employed in munition factories duringthe war to resume wnrk in cotton mills at lower wage rates without some compensation, and the only way to obtain higher output wouldbe to ask the workers to work additional hours at over-time rates.The central advisory council proposed by the Minister of Fuel and power would be resented by the workers as involving Governmentinterference and, in his view, the right course was to adopt the suggestions put forward by the Lord President and to arrange for discussions on the question of wages policy with representatives ofthe trade unions.(/) The Minister of Transport pointed out that the chairmen of the Railway Companies bad refused to take responsibility for deciding whether to accept the award of the recent court of enquiry into the claims of railway workers for higher wages and reducedhours. The award had been accepted by the unions concerned andhe had now to decide whether he or the Railway ExecutiveCommittee should accept it.(g) The Minister of Health said that the rejection of thebuilding workers&apos; claims for higher wages had affected the outputof houses. The building industry was considering a scheme for payment by results, but the shortages of materials experienced inthe past year and the forecast that, owing to transport difficulties,there would be difficulty in delivering materials next spring werenot likely to encourage the workers to agree to such a scheme.Summing up the discussion, The Prime Minister said that,though it was clearly the duty of the Government to adopt a positivewages policy, it should be borne in mind that in those countries wherethe Government had intervened directly in questions of wages and hours of work the results had not always been satisfactory. Theproposal of the Minister of Fuel and Power seemed to lead to fixing of wages by the Government, and for this reason it would be unwise to adopt it, at any rate for the present. He thought that the suggestions made by the Lord President in paragraph 10 of CP.(47) 202 should be followed up and that there should be an enquiry into what special new machinery ought to be set up in order todeal with claims by workers in socialised industries and the locaigovernment service. It would also be helpful if a few of theMinisters mainly concerned were to have a preliminary informaltalk with representatives of the trade unions.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord President and the Minister of Labour toarrange for a preliminary informal discussion on questions of wages policy between Ministers and repre-sentatives of the trade unions.(2) Approved the suggestions made in paragraph 10 of CP.(47) 202, and invited the Lord President and theMinister of Labour to take steps to give effect to them.(3) Agreed that the Committee on the Socialisation of Indus-tries, with the addition of the Minister of Health, should consider what machinery should be set up to deal with claims for higher wages and shorter hours made by workers in socialised industries or industries largely dependent on Government subsidies and by workers employed by local authorities.
Trade 4.   The  Secretary of  State  for   Commonwealth  RelationsDelegation      informed the Cabinet that the Canadian Government had been muchto Moscow.     disturbed to learn of the authority given to the United Kingdom(Previous       Trade Delegation in Moscow to negotiate a four-year contract for reference:      the purchase of Russian wheat on terms which appeared to themCM. (47) 55th   to be in some respects more favourable than those provided by theConclusions.     Anglo-Canadian Wheat Agreement.    In particular, they were minute 6.)      critical of our willingness to offer $2-02 a bushel in 1947-48 for russian wheat as compared with f 1 - 55 payable for Canadian wheatunder the Agreement;   and of the proposal to buy increasingquantities of Russian wheat during the four-year period in contrast with the diminishing quantities which had been inserted in theAnglo-Canadian Agreement at the request of the British Govern-ment.   The Canadian Government were considering proposals fora compensating adjustment of the Agreement to take account bothof recent changes in world prices and of the effect of any agreementbetween the British and Soviet Governments; and they had asked that there should be no announcement of the terms of any contract with the Soviet Government until they had been able to submit their proposals.The President of the Board of Trade said that agreement hadnot yet been reached in the Anglo-Soviet negotiations. TheCanadian Government had been kept fully informed and the Over-seas Economic Policy Committee would have an opportunity of considering the final terms of any proposed agreement with theSoviet Government before it was concluded.The Cabinet Took note that the Overseas Economic Policy Committeewould consider the representations made by the canadian government with regard to the negotiations for thepurchase of Russian wheat.Visits by 5.   The Minister of Agriculture informed the Cabinet that ministers to Colonel T. L. Kennedy, the Ontario Minister of Agriculture, hadCanada. suggested to him that more frequent visits to Canada by UnitedKingdom Ministers would be warmly welcomed and would serve tostrengthen the ties between the two countries.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations welcomedthis suggestion.The Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations to consider what arrangements might be made for visits to Canada by United Kingdom Ministers.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,17th July, 1947.
