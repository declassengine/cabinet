Parliament.Business in house ofCommons.1. The Cabinet had a preliminary discussion on the arrange-ments for handling the Debate on the Address. It was pointed outthat final arrangements could not be made until it was known on what topics the Opposition would concentrate their criticism. Itwas, however, desirable that the House should proceed as soon aspossible to discussion of the economic situation, and that the debate should be concluded by 29th October. It seemed likely that theprincipal spokesmen for the Government would be the PrimeMinister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister for economic Affairs.The Cabinet agreed that it should be left to the Prime Minister,the Lord President and the Chief Whip to make the final arrange-ments for handling the Debate.Parliament.Amendment ofParliamentAct.(previous reference:CM. (47) 80thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Cabinet had decided on 14th October that legislation should be introduced in the coming Session to amend the Parlia-ment Act, 1911, and had invited the Machinery of Government Com-rnittee to consider what form this legislation should take. TheCabinet now had before them a memorandum by the Lord President(CP. (47) 292) submitting the Committee&apos;s recommendations onthis question.The Lord President said that the Committee had carefully con-sidered the suggestion, made in the Cabinet&apos;s preliminary discussion on 14th October, that the Parliament Act should be so amended asto enable the Government to ensure that Bills passed by the Commonscould.be passed into law within the same Session, notwithstanding the opposition of the Lords. They had, however, been impressed bythe consideration that, if the House of Lords was to retain any effective function in revising legislation, there must be some sanction to ensure that the Commons gave due consideration to Lords amend-ments and some interval of time to enable the two Houses to reach an accommodation when disagreements arose between them. Thiswould not in practice be secured if the Commons was enabled toenforce its will within a single Session. The Committee, therefore,favoured the proposal which had been put forward by the LordChancellor in October 1946 in his memorandum CP. (46) 376, thatamending legislation should take the form of providing that a bill passed by the Commons in two successive Sessions within a minimum period of one year should become law, notwithstanding the opposi-tion of the Lords.The Lord President added that amending legislation on theselines would meet the Governmenfs immediate needs in the present parliament. Even if this Bill were rejected by the Lords and hadto be enacted under the existing provisions of the Parliament Act,1911, it could be passed into law by the latter part of 1949, if within that period a short additional Session was interposed between thenormal Sessions. And the amending Bill could be so framed as toensure that the Parliament Act, as thus amended, would applyto Bills which were already before Parliament before it passed into law. Thus, important Government legislation introduced inthe 1948-49 Session could, under the amended provisions of the Par-liament Act, be carried into law in the final Session of the present parliament, notwithstanding the opposition of the Lords.The Cabinet endorsed the recommendations put forward by theLord President on behalf of the Machinery of government committee.The Cabinet further agreed that this Bill should be justified as a practical measure for reducing the length of time for which government legislation could be delayed by the House of Lords.Nothing should be said to imply that&apos; it reflected the views of theLabour Party on the broader question of House of Lords reform,or that the Partjr favoured the retention of a reformed House ofLords-.34526-2b 2
The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the legislation amending the Parliament Act,1911, which was to be introduced early in the coming-Session, should take the form of reducing the periodspecified in Section 2 of that Act from three successiveSessions within two years to two successive Sessionswithin one year;(2) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for a draft Bill forthis purpose to be prepared and submitted to the Legis-lation Committee;(3) Took note that in the Debate on the Address the PrimeMinister would give a general indication of the form which this amending legislation would take.Balance ofPayments.DollarExpenditurein 1948.(previous reference:CM. (47) 74thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and the Minister for Economic Affairs (CP. (47) 283)covering a memorandum on the programme of dollar expenditure in1948. They also had before them memoranda by the Minister ofFood (CP. (47) 291 and 293) commenting on the proposals in cp. (47) 283 for further cuts of  75 million in purchases of food from dollar sources in 1948.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that on 30th Septemberour gold and dollar reserves were  586 million plus the balance ofthe Canadian Credit amounting to  101 million.   In the last six weeks the drain on these reserves had averaged  17 million a week.Since 15th September we had been compelled to sell  50 million ofgold and further sales would shortly be necessary.   By the end ofthe year, even after drawing a further  48 million from the Inter-national Monetary Fund and with substantial gold receipts from south Africa, our reserves would have fallen to  500 million plus 65 million of unused Canadian Credit.   The 1948 import require-ments submitted by Departments would involve a total gold and dollar drain amounting to  476 million; and on this basis our reserves, including the Canadian Credit, would have fallen to 325 million by June 1948, and to  90 million by the end of 1948.If, however, the drain on our reserves continued at that rate, over-seas suppliers would demand payment in gold or dollars long beforethe end of 1948; and the Government would then find themselvescompelled to impose the most drastic cuts on imports, and to seekaccommodation from the United States Government on whateverterms could be secured.   In these circumstances the Cabinet should consider what immediate action should be taken to protect our reserves.   The memorandum attached to CP. (47) 283 showed thatthe prospective deficit on our balance of payments with the american continent in 1948 was estimated at  458 million.   Proposals weremade in paragraphs 21-35 of that memorandum for reducing thisdeficit by  175 million; and in his view this was the indispensableminimum reduction to be made.   Certain proposals were made for developing exports to the American Continent, for reducing over-seas Government expenditure and for cuts in imports of tobacco,petrol, manufactured goods and machinery; and it was hoped thatthese would save  75 million.   The remaining  100 million wouldhave to be saved on raw materials and food.   It would be unwise to cut raw material imports by more than  25 million; and thebalance of the saving must, therefore, be met on food imports. Para-graph 32 of the memorandum contained a list of possible economies in food consumption totalling  100 million.   After consultationwith the Minister for Economic Affairs, he recommended the Cabinetto select from this list the following measures, which would yielda dollar saving of  73 million in 1948 : (i) Sugar ration to be reduced from 10 ozs. to 8 ozs., and theuse of sugar in manufacturing to be reduced by 25 percent, (saving  12 million);(ii) Meat ration to be maintained at Is. (saving  16 million);
(iii) Further reduction to be made in distribution of canned meat (saving  7 million);(iv) Bacon ration to be maintained at 1 oz. (saving  28 million);(v) Consumption of shell eggs to be reduced to 66 a year, and stocks of dried eggs to be run down more rapidly (saving 10 million).The Minister of Economic A fairs supported the statement madeby the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It was essential that means should be found of reducing the dollar import programme for 1948by about  175 million. He felt some doubt, indeed, whether savings of this amount were adequate to meet the situation. While he regretted the need for reducing the food import programme, he was satisfied that the total saving required could not be achieved other-wise. The estimate of exports to dollar countries in 1948 was themaximum that could be safely relied upon, and it would be imprudentto substitute hypothetical increases under this head for actualimmediate savings in purchases from dollar sources. Apart fromthe cuts recommended in the memorandum, however, an immediatesaving of  7 million could be made if the Cabinet were willing toagree that purchases of tobacco from the United States should be suspended. Stocks of tobacco would be sufficient to enable consump-tion to continue at something approaching the present level for afurther year, and no decision regarding the resumption of purchasesneed, therefore, be reached until next autumn. It would be pre-mature to anticipate the final decision whether purchases should bemade for 1949. and it could not therefore be assumed that we shouldsave the whole of the dollar expenditure on tobacco in 1948 whichwas included in the current programme ( 28 million). Dollar expen-diture on American films which were now being exhibited in thiscountry could not be avoided unless the showing of all foreign filmswere banned and this would involve closing about 80 per cent, of thecountry&apos;s cinemas.The Minister of Food invited the attention of the Cabinet tothe list contained in CP. (47) 291 of recent or impending cuts in food rations and of the further cuts now proposed. These cuts,taken together, would reduce the average daily calorie level of thepeople&apos;s diet to between 2,650 and 2,725 calories a day. He was advised that this level of food consumption would result in under-nourishment and even hunger, which would seriously prejudiceindustrial output. Moreover, he feared that it might undermine thewhole rationing system, which was already over-strained, withdangerous consequences in national demoralisation and social bitter-ness. For these reasons he had felt bound to put forward in cp. (47) 291 alternative proposals for effecting the reduction inthe import programme which he recognised to be unavoidable.The President of the Board of Trade said that he would have preferred to defer a decision on these recommendations until therehad been an opportunity for closer scrutiny of the figures. Theseadmittedly contained a substantial margin of error, which mightinvalidate decisions reached at this stage. In any event he thoughtit would be difficult to defend further reductions in food consump-tion so long as exports to non-dollar markets remained at theirpresent level, and he would have liked more time in which to explorewith industry means of increasing exports, particularly to Canada.There were two points of detail which affected the figures givenin the memorandum; first, the  11 million for tobacco imports in thefirst half of 1948, shown in paragraph 18 of the memorandum, might prove to have been brought into account already; and, secondly, hewas advised that steel purchases from North America in 1948 mighttotal substantially less that  13 million on account of shortage ofsupplies.A full discussion ensued. The following were the principalpoints raised in the course of this discussion : (a) The nutritional effect of a reduction of  75 million in food imports from dollar sources had been calculated before it was known34526-2 n q
what selections the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerfor Economic Affairs would make from the list of possible cuts,totalling  100 million, set out in paragraph 32 of the memorandum.Even so  those calculations (which were summarised in paragraph 33of the memorandum) indicated that in the second half of 1948, undera food import programme reduced by  75 million, the calorie intakewould be somewhere between 2,850 and 2,925 calories a day, as corn-pared with the current figure of 2,877. Thus, in the second halfof 1948 the nutritional position would not be substantially worse than it was at present. The warnings given by the Governmentsmedical and scientific advisers seemed, therefore, to apply only tothe first six months of 1948.The Minister of Food said that these calculations were based onthe assumption that his Department would be successful in obtainingall the food supplies from non-dollar sources which had been includedin their programme. This programme was, however, essentiallyan authority to buy; and it could not be assumed that supplies wouldin fact be obtainable up to the full limits of the programme.(b) Some Ministers considered that there must still be scope forfinding alternative sources of food supplies outside the dollar area,if all the Departments concerned collaborated to this end and lessreliance was placed on the ordinary channels Ox uxclclG. If addi-tional supplies could thus be obtained, this would not only ensurethat the food import programme for the second half of 1948 wouldbe realised, but might also offset the reduction in food consumptionlevels which would otherwise occur in the first half of 1948. Thus,in present circumstances more might be done to increase our food imports from Eire; and it might be desirable to review our earlierrefusal to pay the high prices demanded by Denmark for her foodproducts. It might also be justifiable to reopen negotiations with aview to securing imports of food from the Soviet Union.(c) In balancing cuts in food consumption against possibleincreases in exports to dollar countries, it should be kept clearly inmind that the former were certain while the latter were problema-tical. It was expedient, therefore, to proceed on assumptions aboutthe expansion of exports which were reasonably conservative : other-wise we should risk finding ourselves in the position of having eatenthe food and, towards the end of the period, finding that our exportincome was not going to be sufficient to pay for what we had alreadyconsumed. Reference had already been made, in the discussion, tothe margin of error in the calculations; and it was arguable thatthis vvas more likely to operate to our disadvantage than to our advantage. Thus, one of the assumptions on which the memorandum was based was that we should not incur any dollar expenditure inGermany in 1948. How confidently could we rely on that assump-tion? In these circumstances, would it not be preferable to beginat once to secure the economies which would flow from reducing thelevel of food consumption, rather than take the risk of being forcedto make much more drastic reductions towards the end of 1948 ?(d) There was a real risk that further cuts in food rations mighthave the effect of reducing output in industry. It was already beingsuggested that, on the existing rations, men would be unable towork longer hours for lack of sufficient food. The cut in the baconration would create special difficulties for men, e.g., miners, who took food to their work. At the same time, there was much to besaid for the view that, if the level of food consumption had to bereduced, this should not be done in instalments. It would be prefer-able to make at once the maximum cut which was likely to prove necessary, so that the workers could feel that any subsequent changes would be in the direction of improvement.(e) Full account should also be taken of the fact that the general public had been expecting, for two months past, decisions whichwould affect their standard of living far more drastically than anywhich the Government had so far announced. The cuts announced in August had undoubtedly been less severe than the public had thenexpected.  If some reductions were announced now, and the Govern-
63CM. 81 (ffl)ment found it necessary to enforce even more drastic reductions later on, public confidence would be seriously shaken. This considerationreinforced the argument for taking decisions on the general lines recommended in the memorandum annexed to CP. (47) 283.In the light of this discussion the Cabinet again consideredthe list of possible reductions in food consumption set out in para-graph 32 of the memorandum.The Minister for Economic Affairs recalled that he and theChancellor of the Exchequer had already proposed that the meat ration should be maintained at Is., and that there should be nochange in the cheese ration. If the Cabinet were willing to agreethat purchases of tobacco in the United States should be suspendeduntil further notice, he could also refrain from pressing the sugges-tion that there should be a further reduction in the distribution of canned meat. The revised list of food consumption economies,together with the savings in dollar expenditure which they would secure up to the end of 1948, would then stand as follows :   millionSugar : From 10 ozs. to 8 ozs. and 25 per cent, cut in manufacturing...       ...       ...       ...       ... 12Meat : Maintain at Is.        ...      ...       ...       ... 16Bacon: Maintain at 1 oz.    ...       ...       ...       ... 28Eggs : Limitation of shell egg consumption to 66 ayear; and earlier exhaustion of dried egg stocks 10Total..................      66The Cabinet agreed that these cuts should be made. They recognisedthat this decision would involve negotiations for the adjustment ofthe long-term contracts for the purchase of bacon and eggs from canada; and The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that our case for reopening these contracts should be based on financial grounds.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the prospective deficit in our balance of pay-ments with dollar countries for 1948 must be reduced by 175 million;(2) Endorsed the proposal that exports to the American Con-continent should be developed to the maximum extentpracticable;(3) Approved in principle the proposals made in the memo-randum annexed to CP. (47) 283 for cutting overseasGovernment expenditure by  10 million (paragraph 22),the petroleum programme by  9 million (paragraph 24),the programme for the import of manufactured goods,particularly machinery, by  8 million (paragraph 25)and the import of raw materials by  25 million.(4) Agreed that the food import programme should be reducedby  66 million, and that the following adjustmentsshould be made in the proposed levels of food consump-tion : (i) the sugar ration to be reduced from 10 ozs.to 8 ozs., and the use of sugar in manufacturing to bereduced by 25 per cent.; (ii) the meat ration to be main-tained at Is.; (iii) the bacon ration to be maintained at oz,; (iv) the consumption of shell eggs to be limited to66 a year and the stocks of dried eggs to be run downmore quickly;(5) Agreed that purchases of tobacco from the United states should be suspended and should not be resumed withoutfresh authority from the Cabinet; and that in the mean-while the programme of tobacco imports for the second half of 1948 should be left open;(6) Authorised the Minister for Economic Affairs to make ageneral announcement of these adjustments in our import programmes  for dollar  countries,  in  the  statement
investment programme.(previous reference:CM. (47) 68thConclusions,(2) and (3).)which he was proposing to make on the balance of pay-ments position in the course of the Debate on the address;(7) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister for Economic Affairs would submit a further memorandum on the balance of payments  is Sj whole.4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Minister for economic Affairs (CP. (47) 284) covering the report of the Invest-ment Programmes Committee which had been appointed to workout detailed proposals giving effect to the Cabinets decision of1st August that there should be a curtailment of capital investment projects.The Minister for Economic Affairs said that this report hadalready been considered by the Production Committee, the economic planning Board and the Official Committee on Economic Develop-ment, who had endorsed the recommendation that there should bea reduction of  200 million in investment programmes in 1948. Hewas discussing with the Ministers concerned certain questions arisingfrom the proposals for the detailed application of this general reduc-tion to Departmental programmes. The only question outstandingfor decision by the Cabinet related to the housing programme. Therewas general agreement that this must be brought into balance; andin determining the programme for 1948 the limiting factor mustbe the available supply of timber, which would be sufficient onlyto sustain a programme of 140,000 houses a year.   In his view theof Health should be invited to take suitable measures to reduce by mid-1949 the existing stock of unfinished houses to a level commen-commensurate with this rate of building, due provision being made within these figures for the priority needs of mining and agricultural workers. As regards industrial building, the Production Committeehad thought it right to continue the existing preferential treatmentof development areas within the reduced programme for completingindustrial building projects already started, and he invited theCabinet to endorse their recommendation on that point.The Minister of Health said that he accepted the necessity fora reduction in the housing programme. The balance of the pro-gramme was, however, being restored at a rate substantially faster than had been suggested by the Investment Programmes Committee,He would deprecate any decision at this stage which would involvedrastic modification of the 1948 programme, since this could not now be achieved without breaking contracts already entered into.He understood, however, that the proposal to restrict the allocation of labour and material for the 1948 programme to the number and quantity required for the construction of 140,000 houses would not,in fact, mean that the number of houses actually completed during that year would be restricted to that figure. For instance, in over100,000 of the houses under construction, all the timber required was already in place or on the site. He thought it would be pre-mature at this stage to reach any decision about the size of thehousing programme for 1949 and 1950; in his view the figure shouldbe 180,000 houses rather than the figure proposed by the Ministerfor Economic Affairs. He therefore suggested that the whole posi-tion should be reviewed in June 1948, but that in the meantime thegrant of approval for the construction of new houses should be governed by the assumption that the approved programme for 1949and 1950 would be 140,000 houses only.The Minister of Defence said that he was prepared to acceptthe recommendation of the Investment Programmes Committee fora labour ceiling of 12,700 for the three Services at June 1948, andhis Department would examine the Services&apos; programmes to see whether they were in balance. He could not accept the Committee&apos;sassumption that a further cut of 15 per cent, in the Services&apos;housing programme
65CM. 81 (47)building projects could be made, but he would examine the service programmes afresh with a view to securing such a cut if it were practicable. He attached great importance to proceeding with theService programmes for the construction of married quarters. the investment Programmes Committee had suggested in Appendix ii of their report that the research and development work programmeof the Ministry of Supply should be reviewed to see whether work could be slowed down or postponed for a period of two years. Hesuggested that this investigation might be entrusted to a specialsub-committee of the Defence Research Committee.The Cabinet-(1) Endorsed generally the recommendations of the investment programmes Committee, subject to further considera-tion by the Ministers concerned of the points mentionedin the Annex to CP. (4.7) 284;(2) Approved the recommendation made by the Minister for economic Affairs in paragraph 2 (b) of CP. (47) 284on-the understanding that this would not prejudice thecompletion of more than 140,000 houses in 1948 if this could be done within the material allocation proposed,and that the position would be reviewed in June 1948;(3) Approved the recommendation made by the Production Com-mittee in favour of continuing the existing preferential treatment of the development areas within the reducedprogramme for completing building projects already started;(4) Approved the recommendation of the Investment Pro-grammes Committee that there should be continuedsupervision of the investment programme;(5) Approved the proposal in CP. (47) 284 that a further studyshould be made at once of the requirements of theengineering industry for home and export in order toascertain whether further cuts should be made in invest-ment or to rebalance the export programme.(6) Invited the Minister of Defence to appoint a Sub-Committeeof the Defence Research Committee to review the research and development work programme of theMinistry of Supply in accordance with the recommenda-tion in Appendix II of the report of the investment programmes Committee.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,20^ October, 1947.
