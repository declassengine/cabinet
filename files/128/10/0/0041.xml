1. The Minister of Food said that he was proposing, as in pastyears, to make some special increases in food rations at Christmas.The increases could not be as large this year as last; but he proposedto allow an additional Qd. worth of meat, one and a half pounds of sugar and four ounces of sweets.In discussion it was suggested that, in announcing these con-cessions, the Minister might relate the Christinas increase in the meat ration to the increase in meat supplies from Eire.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals of the Minister of Food forincreased food rations at Christinas, and took note thatthese increases would be announced, in the course of thefollowing week.2. The Foreign Secretary said that he was not optimisticabout the outcome of the discussions at the fifth meeting of theCouncil of Foreign Ministers, which was opening in London later that day. There were no indications that the Soviet Governmentwould be more accommodating than they had been at the last meeting in Moscow. Indeed, their action in establishing the Cominform, in strengthening their political control in the satellite countries of eastern Europe and in fomenting industrial ti-oubles in many partsof Western Europe seemed to suggest that they had. no presentdesire to reach agreement with the Western Powers for the peace-ful settlement of Europe. There was, therefore, little ground forhoping that the Council of Foreign Ministers would be able to makemuch progress towards agreement on the main issues still out-standing in connection with the Peace Treaties for Germany and austria.The Foreign Secretary said that, if the proceedings at thismeeting confirmed his fears, he would have to ask the Cabinet toconsider a fresh approach to the main problems of our foreignpolicy.The Foreign Secretary said that the United- Nations discussions on Palestine would shortly reach the stage at which a vote wouldbe taken on the alternative proposals for partition or for the estab-lishment of a unitary State. The United Kingdom representative had been instructed that, when this stage v/as reached, he shouldabstain from voting. This was the only course consistent with thepolicy adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Government in submitting this problem to the United Nations without recommendations.In discussion it was suggested, that the time was approachingwhen His Majesty&apos;s Government would be compelled to adopt amore positive attitude towards this problem. We should, inparticular, have to decide whether we intended to facilitate theestablishment of alternative authorities to whom we could hand overour responsibilities wdien we withdrew from Palestine.The Prim-e Minister said, that the Cabinet must consider thesematters as soon as it was known whether a two-thirds majoritycould be obtained in the United Nations for any particular solutionof the Palestine problem.The Foreign Secretary recalled that, under the proposalsoriginally submitted by the United States Government and acceptedby His Majesty&apos;s Government, the Japanese Peace Treaty was tohave been drawn up by a Conference of the main belligerent powers at which substantive issues would be decided by a two-thirds majority. The Chinese Government had since put forward alterna-tive proposals which would have the effect that decisions could notbe taken by the Conference unless they were supported unanimouslyby all the participating Powers. He had just learned that theUnited States Government were prepared to accept this proposal.-1 b 2
This would create a difficult situation, for the Dominion Govern-ments would be opposed to the unanimity rule and would press very strongly for the adoption of the procedure which had been discussed and approved at the preliminary Commonwealth meeting held at canberra in August.Parliament.Reports of theCommittee of privileges onthe Cases ofMr. GarryAllighau, M.P.,and Mr. EvelynWalkden, M.P.(previous reference:CM. (47) 82ndConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Lord President said that in accordance with the cabinets decision of 23rd October the following motion had beenput down for the debate on 30th October :  &quot; That, if in any case hereafter a Member shall have beenfound guilty by this House of corruptly accepting payment forthe disclosure and publication of confidential information about matters to be proceeded with in Parliament, any personresponsible for offering such payment shall incur the grave dis-pleasure of this House; and if such person shall be the repre-sentative of a newspaper or of a press agency, that person andany other representative of the same newspaper or agency shall,if the House think fit, be excluded from the precincts of this house until this House shall otherwise determine/&apos;There had been some criticism of the latter part of the motion on theground that it was directed specifically against journalists, and thatto exclude all the representatives of a, particular newspaper fromthe precincts of the House would be too heavy a penalty; and, inview of the late hour at which discussion of this motion had starter!,he had thought it wiser not to press the House to reach a decisionon it on that occasion. He thought it important, however, that theHouse should make a general declaration on this point, and he nowproposed to put down an alternative motion, the latter part of which,from the words &quot;displeasure of this House,&quot; would read asfollows : &quot; and may, if the House think fit, be deprived of any facilities which he may enjoy within the precincts of the House for such,period as the House may determine.&quot;In discussion it was suggested that this indication of the penalties which might be imposed would tend to fetter the discretion of the House in dealing with any future cases that might arise and,so far from acting as a deterrent, might even encourage potentialoffenders by revealing the limited nature of the penalties whichcould be inflicted.Care should also be taken, in settling the terms of the motion,to consider whether it would have the effect of extending the privileges of the House. A former declaration of the House that itwould take no action to extend its privileges, though admittedly notbinding-for all time, should not be overlooked.The Cabinet Invited the Lord President to revise the terms of the proposed motion in the light of the discussion and to submit a revised   draft   for   consideration  by   the   Cabinet   on27th November.Balance ofPayments.Non-dollarExpenditurein 1948.(previous reference:CM! (47) 81stConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (47) 311) covering a report by officials on a non-dollar balance of payments plan for 1948. Therecommendations made in this report had been endorsed by theEconomic Policy Committee.In discussion, the following points were made : (a) Information about the United Kingdom balance of pay-ments plan would be conveyed to Dominion Governments throughthe liaison arrangements mentioned in paragraph 16 of the report.(b) The plan would have to be reconsidered, when the amount and nature of the Marshall aid likely to be made available to theUnited Kingdom were known.
117CM. 90 (47)(c) While it was recognised that some inessential goods wouldhave to be imported, the quantity should be kept down to a minimum and steps should be taken in advance to explain the reasons for taking these imports. Moreover, since any export of coal from theUnited Kingdom would depend on greater output from the miners and continuing restrictions on domestic consumers, it should be seen to result in the import of such essential commodities as food and timber.(d) The figures in paragraph 5 of the report indicated that;if our export targets were achieved, the trading position of theUnited Kingdom alone would be brought very nearly intoequilibrium by the end of 1948. The danger seemed to lie in the adverse trade balance of the rest of the sterling area. Our position,as bankers for the sterling area as a whole, would be seriouslyprejudiced by any continuing failure by the rest of the sterling area to redress their adverse balance of payments.(e) The Minister of Food said that the large number of bilateral negotiations which must be undertaken as a result of the decisionto suspend the convertibility of sterling was putting a very heavy strain on the officials of the Departments concerned. There was a risk that opportunities of buying food would be lost through delay in opening general trade negotiations with the countries from which supplies might be obtained. Thus, we had already missed a chanceof buying 3,000 tons of Danish butter, and might well lose up to48,000 tons more if we were not able to begin trade negotiationswith Denmark before January. Would it not be possible to give him more latitude to make purchases of food in advance of thegeneral negotiations 1 Though the price asked for the Danish butterwas high, there was no doubt that it would be paid by buyers fromother countries, and any expenditure that we incurred would, it was hoped, be offset against the debt of  35 million owed to the UnitedKingdom by Denmark.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while satisfactory arrangements had been made to co-ordinate this work and to concentrate first on the more urgent and important negotiations,there were undoubtedly instances in which it would be advantageous to open negotiations sooner than we could with our existing resources. He was taking steps to strengthen these resources, andhe would discuss with the Minister of Food his suggestion that heshould be authorised to buy Danish butter in advance of the openingof general trade negotiations with Denmark. In general, however,our bargaining power in trade negotiations would be prejudiced ifwe entered into substantial commitments in advance.(/) Would it not be possible to do more in the way of directingoil exports to those countries where they would contribute most torelieving our balance of payments difficulties ? While the difficultiesdue to the shortage of tankers and of steel for constructional workwere recognised, it was agreed that all practicable steps should betaken to ensure that oil produced or handled by British companieswas used in such a way as to make the greatest possible contributionto the solution of our balance of payments difficulties.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the non-dollar balance of payments plan out-lined in the report annexed to CP. (47) 311;(2) Agreed that a survey should be made of the UnitedKingdom possible long-term scale of import, the desirablecomposition of the import programmes that would be practicable and the sources from which such importsmight be drawn;(3) Subject to the point noted in paragraph (c) above, agreedthat imports of inessential goods should be accepted inaccordance with the principles laid down in para-graph 13 of the report;(4) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer wrouldsubmit a progress report on the further steps requiredto secure co-ordination between sterling area countries;
(5) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerof Fuel and Power to submit a memorandum showing what was already being done, and whether anything more could be done, to secure that oil produced or handled by British companies was used in. such a way as to makethe greatest possible contribution to the solution of our balance of payments difficulties.Emergency 5.   The Minister of Health said that the Opposition wereLaws pressing for an assurance that the powers of compulsory billeting:(Miscellaneous under Defence Regulation 22, which were being continued by theProvisions) Emergency Laws (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, would not be usedBill. to billet persons other than those in certain specified classes, suchas war orphans, nurses and civil servants. In his view, it wouldbe wrong to give an assurance in terms which would limit the powerof the Government to use compulsory billeting powers in an emer-gency due, for example, to flooding. He would, however, like to repeat in the debate on the Report Stage of the Bill an assurancegiven by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the home department in Committee that compulsory powers would not be usedto billet workers directed to take up employment away from home.The Cabinet-Authorised the Minister of Health to make it clear thatcompulsory billeting powers would not be used to billetEuropean volunteer workers or British workers who were directed to take up employment away from home.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,25th November, 1947.
