ForeignAffairs.BrestExplosion.Indonesia.^previous reference:CM. (47) 60thConclusions,Minute 5.)1. The Foreign Secretary suggested that a message of sympathy should be sent to the French Government on behalf ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government in respect of the explosion which had occurred at Brest on the previous day.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for a suitablemessage of sympathy to be conveyed to the FrenchGovernment.The Foreign Secretary said that the provision of military supplies and facilities to the Dutch from British sources in theFar East had now been stopped. He had put forward a proposalto the United States Government for an Anglo-American offer ofmediation to the Netherlands and Indonesian Governments on thebasis of the Linggadjati Agreement. This suggestion had not,however, proved acceptable to the State Department, and an offer of mediation by His Majesty&apos;s Government alone was not likelyto produce useful results. In the circumstances, we should no longerattempt to restrain the Indian and Australian Governments fromreferring the matter to the Security Council, although he was afraid that little practical advantage would come of this. The Nether-lands Government would claim that, since the Linggadjati Agree-ment provided for the continuation of Dutch sovereignty in theDutch East Indies until 1949, the present operations were merelya matter of internal administration.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that the Governor-General of Malaya had enquired whether arrangements could bemade with the Netherlands Government for medical supplies tobe delivered to the Indonesian authorities.The Cabinet-(2) Agreed that no attempt should be made to restrain theAustralian and Indian Governments from referring the indonesian dispute to the Security Council, and invited the Foreign Secretary to settle, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Commonwealth Relations andthe Secretary of State for India, the terms of the com-munications to be made to these Governments on thesubject;(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to discuss with the Secretaryof State for the Colonies the question of providing from malaya medical supplies for the Indonesian authorities.Balance of 2.   The Prime Minister said that a difficult situation hadPayments.       arisen owing to the rapid exhaustion of the United States credit.(Previous        It was essential that the Government should meet this situationReference:      by positive action designed to preserve the standard of life of the cm. (47) 57th   people and to maintain the position of the United Kingdom in theConclusions,     world.  He proposed that the Cabinet should have a general discus-Minute 3.)      sion in the first instance and that at a later meeting, on 1st August,they should consider specific proposals.   A full statement of theGovernments plans would have to be made in the debates on theeconomic situation which were to be held in both Houses of Parlia-ment in the following week, and it might also be necessary for himto broadcast on the situation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that on 5th June(CM. (47) 52nd Conclusions, Minute 2) he had told the Cabinetthat if the then rate of drawing continued the United States creditwould be exhausted by the end of 1947. The position had sinceworsened and at the present rate of drawing the credit would not last beyond November at best and would probably be exhaustedin October or even late September. The main reason for the pre-mature exhaustion of the credit was the very large increase inUnited States prices. This had amounted to from 40 to 50 percent, between December 1945 and May 1947, and to 20 per cent.
between July 1948 and May 1947.   Another important factor wasthe world shortage of dollars, which drove countries such as theArgentine to convert their sterling earnings into dollars and hadforced the Canadian Government to ask us to pay for half our purchases from Canada in United States dollars.   Once the UnitedStates credit had been exhausted, we should have only the remains of the Canadian credit, which was not likely to amount to morethan  100 million in November, and our final reserves of gold and dollars, which totalled less than  600 million, and had to serve notonly the United Kingdom but also the other countries in the sterling area.   While we should no doubt have to dip into these reserve^we must at all costs avoid running them down so far as to leave us defenceless against pressure from abroad.   It was clear that whatever came out of the Conference on European economic co-opera-tion, we could not be sure of obtaining the means to meet our difficulties from this source, and we must rely on our own efforts to ward off the crisis with which we were threatened in the autumn.It had been suggested that we should make a determined effort toincrease the production of key commodities in the United Kingdomand to expand our exports. He agreed that these suggestions shouldbe actively pursued; but in themselves they would not be sufficient,and there must be substantial reductions in the year 1947-48 bothin Government expenditure overseas and in expenditure on imports.There were certain cuts, for example, in film imports and in foreigntravel allowances, which it would be desirable to make for symbolicreasons, though the actual saving in dollars would not be great.He did not think there was any room for reducing imports ofmachinery or of raw materials, except possibly timber, and the bulkof any saving in dollar expenditure must be on food imports.  his proposal here was that for a limited period we should stop thepurchase of a wide range of food imports.  This would not only savedollars at a critical time but should also produce a fall in the extor-tionate prices which we were at present having to pay.   He would circulate a memorandum to the Cabinet setting out his specific proposals.   This would call for bold and unpleasant decisions, buthe was convinced that Parliament and the country as a wholeexpected such decisions of the Government.The President of the Board of Trade said that by the end of1946 United Kingdom exports had risen to 112 per cent, of the1938 figure. There had, however, been a setback due to the fuelcrisis, the full effects of which had not yet worked themselves out.We were also finding increasing difficulties in placing our exports and the proposed target of 140 per cent, of the 1938 figure by the spring of 1948 would not be achieved without very great efforts.A further handicap was that our exports, which consisted almost exclusively of manufactured goods, were under-priced as comparedwith the primary products which formed the bulk of our imports.The Lord President said that the Government must be ableto jDresent to Parliament a coherent and realistic plan for dealingwith the situation. The debate on the import programme on 8th Julyhad been held at a time when the expectations of help from theUnited States had been high. Now, however, there was less optimismabout the prospects of help from this source and there was a danger that if the Government did not demonstrate to Parliament beforethe Summer Recess that they were dealing effectively with thebalance of payments problem, a feeling of panic would arise whichwould have a serious effect on the economic situation. The outputof coal must be raised to a much higher level and this should bemade plain to the National Union of Mineworkers at the meeting with them on the following day. Steel production must also beraised, and there should be a determined effort to obtain an increaseof about  100 million in the net agricultural output of the UnitedKingdom. The drive to increase the output of textiles had met withsome success, but it would have to -be intensified. The government must do everything possible to avoid fresh demands from workers-2] b 2
for higher wages or shorter hours, and there might also have tobe some positive or negative direction of labour, for which purposenew emergency legislation might conceivably have to be introduced.When all these things had been done, however, there would stillbe a big gap to be bridged and this could not be done except by reducing Government expenditure overseas and expenditure on imports. At their meeting on 1st August the Cabinet would nodoubt consider proposals for reductions in military expenditureabroad. As regards expenditure on civil supplies for Germany, theForeign Secretary had already warned the United States Govern-ment that we could not continue to support the drain on our dollar resources and that we should have to ask for a revision cf theexisting agreement. He himself would be disposed to go even further than this and to inform the United States Government that from a given date we should be compelled to stop all further dollar expenditure on Germany. When the last review of the import programme had taken place, he had, on the whole, been averse to large cuts, but he now supported the proposal of the Chancellorof the Exchequer that we should for a limited period stop buyinga wide range of foods. It would be better to take positive actionof this kind and possibly be able to resume purchases at a later stage than to drift into a situation in which our resources wouldbe completely exhausted.The Foreign Secretary said that he attached the utmost impor-tance to enlisting the public in a combined effort to raise productionand expand our exports, and that he hoped that any cuts which itwould be necessary to impose would be of limited duration. Hehad never led the Cabinet to believe that the proposals for european economic co-operation would in themselves provide a solution ofthe United Kingdom balance of payments problem, but the paris conference had so far made good progress and it was too soon todespair of getting some help from it. He was satisfied that a european customs union would not be practicable, but if we could secure an agreement covering a group of Western european countries, under which their currencies would be mutually con-vertible but not convertible into dollars, our difficulties would be eased considerably. Until the November meeting of foreign ministers had been held, he was unwilling to abandon hope of achieving German unity and he thought it would be most unwise to inform the United States Government that after a given datewe could no longer incur any dollar expenditure on Germany, since this might lead them either to withdraw from Europe altogetheror to insist on our handing the British Zone over to them, with theresult that our plans for the socialisation of the Ruhr industries would come to nothing. It should not be overlooked that againstthe dollar expenditure which we were incurring on supplies for germany there had to be set the benefit from the work performed by German prisoners of war retained in this country. He hopedthat any statement about the reduction of military commitmentsoverseas would be carefully worded. He had struggled hard tosecure the ratification of the Italian Treaty, with a view to enablingour troops to be withdrawn from Venezia Giulia and it was alsohis hope that British Forces would leave Greece very shortly. Hehad constantly pressed for a reduction in the numbers of troopsin Egjrpt and, in bis view, it should be possible to bring them downto not more than 30,000 by mid-1948. It might also be worthexploring whether the forces of occupation in Germany should notbe allowed to run down to a relatively low level in the immediatefuture, it being understood that at a later stage they might haveto be increased again. As soon as the Italian Treaty had been ratified, he hoped to secure agreement to a declaration that thetechnical state of war with Austria had come to an end, but he didnot regard it as possible to withdraw British Forces from Austriaat the present time.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that it was difficult todiscuss the balance of payments problem without more information
than had been made available to the Cabinet. It would be unwise to aim at a large expansion of exports without considering whateffect the export of particular commodities would have on the homeeconomy and whether we should in fact find markets for theadditional exports in hard currency countries. It was only by aseries of bilateral agreements with particular countries that weshould be able to solve our problems. It was unfortunate that earliersteps had not been taken to reduce Government expenditure over-seas by cutting our commitments, since in present circumstances itwas much more difficult to abandon such commitments. There wouldhave to be substantial reductions in food imports and it would benecessary to offset them by increased production of home-grown food.Clearly, however, we should also have to use some of our gold and dollar reserves, and he hoped that the memorandum by the Chan-cellor of the Exchequer would deal with this aspect of the matter.The Minister of Health said that, while the Government mustshow that they were taking positive steps to meet the situation, theyshould make it clear that the difficulties which had arisen were dueprimarily to world causes. The Government must keep the initiative and he would be prepared to contemplate the most drastic action,such as the withdrawal of British Forces from Palestine or thecomplete exclusion of American films. He was in full agreementwith the foreign policy which the Foreign Secretary had sought tocarry out, but we appeared to have neither the time nor the resources to carry this policy to its conclusion and we must avoid imposingan unreasonable strain on our national economy. He realised thatit would be necessary to call for sacrifices from the civilian popula-tion. These, however, must be accompanied by severe measures to restrict our expenditure overseas and must be shared equally by thewhole population.The Minister of Food suggested that it might be desirable to divert to exports practically the whole production of certain con-sumer goods, such as motor cars and radio sets. A measure of thiskind would serve to impress on the public the Governments deter-mination to take all possible steps to deal with the situation. Withregard to food imports, he was willing to consider the suggestion made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer that purchases over a wide range of commodities should cease for a period, though there mightbe certain commodities, for example, bacon, the purchase of whichcould not be stopped without an interruption of supplies to theconsumer. Any announcement of the Governments proposals inthis field would have to be very carefully framed and he would discuss the matter further with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Cabinet (1) Agreed to resume their discussion of the problem of balanceof payments at a meeting on 1st August;(2) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would circulate a paper for consideration at the meeting setting out specific proposals for dealing with the situation.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,29*A July, 1947.
