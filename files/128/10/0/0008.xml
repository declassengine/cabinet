1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be, takenin the House of Commons in the following week.The Third Reading of the Electricity Bill and a Motion to approve the Western Highlands and Islands of Scotland transport and Mail A greement would be taken on 30th June.1st, 2nd and 3rd July would be the eighth, ninth and tenthallotted Supply Days, and the Opposition had proposed that on thesedays there should be debates on the Ministry of Food Vote, the PostOffice Vote and the Army.On 4th July the Second Reading of the Crown Proceedings bill would be taken and further progress would be made with certain minor Bills now before the House.During the week the Ways and Means Resolution relating toCinematograph Films and the Motion to approve the Purchase Tax(Charges) (No. 1) Order would be taken.It was pointed out in discussion that during the current Sessionthere had already been many opportunities of debating matters connected with the Armed Forces, and that a debate on the army at the present time would be embarrassing. The Chief Whipaccordingly undertook to suggest to the Opposition leaders that theproposed debate should be postponed until a later date.2. The Foreign Secretary said that the latest reports fromthe Dutch East Indies suggested that the Dutch were determined to resort to force, in the belief that the internal weakness of the indonesian Republic would enable them to crush any resistancequickly. He did not see what further steps he could take to promote a, peaceful settlement, but he proposed to see the Dutch Ambassadorlater in the day in order to remind him that, if hostilities shouldbreak out, it would be impossible for His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto continue the provision of equipment and training facilities forthe Dutch Forces. In fact no equipment had been supplied for thepast fortnight. Beyond the denial of equipment and training facilities there seemed to be no other action which we could take to apply pressure to the Netherlands Government. He would enquire whether training facilities for Dutch troops were still being provided in Malaya.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.3. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the memorandumby the President of the Board of Trade (CP. (47) 172) on textileexports and the clothing ration, and also considered what shouldbe the method of sions with regard to the import programme for 1947-48 which had to be made public.The President of the Board of Trade explained that, althoughthe labour force in the textile industries was increasing, the increaseup to the present was hardly enough to offset the loss of output per head due to the reduction of working hours at the beginningof the year. The proposed increase of textile exports to a levelof  250 million could not be secured without a diversion of thenecessary supplies of cloth from the home market and, while itmight be possible and would certainly be his aim, to obtain anincrease in output which would enable the clothing ration to beraised to the equivalent of five coupons a month, he did not believethat this could be guaranteed. His proposals would mean that supplies of household textiles for the home market would remain at a low level, but he intended to secure the maximum productionpossible of cotton sheets and to retain the whole output for thehome consumer.   He would, in addition, do everything possible to-3] B 2
ease the inconveniences arising from the clothes rationing scheme.Thus, when stocks of particular types of clothing rose to satisfactorylevels, the points value of these types would be reduced; and hewas also considering whether it would be possible to allow the currency of the next supply of clothing coupons to run from 1st October instead of 1st November.In discussion it was pointed out that, unless we could main-tain a satisfactory balance of payments during the critical monthswhich lay ahead, we should be unable to play an effective partin international affairs. The decisions on food imports which theCabinet had reached at their meeting on 24th June would mean a higher expenditure of hard currency than had been originally proposed in the memorandum annexed to CP. (47) 167, and this made it all the more necessary to secure the additional foreign exchange which would be obtained by increasing textile exports tothe level of  250 million a year. Almost all the additional exports would go to hard currency areas, and so would be a direct contri-bution to the solution of our balance of payments difficulties.At the same time Ministers felt that it would be deplorableif the proposed increase in textile exports were to be obtained only at the cost of creating unemployment in the tailoring industry,which would have an adverse effect on the morale of workers in the textile industries, and that it was urgently necessary to make moreclothing and household textiles available for the home consumer. Itwas therefore suggested that a strong appeal should be made to workers and employers in the textile industries to increase produc-tion with a view to helping the home consumer. It should be made clear to the workers that there was no intention of rescinding theagreement reached on shorter working hours, but they should beasked, as an emergency measure, to agree to overtime working inorder to tide the country over the present critical period. ThePresident of the Board of Trade should have the co-operation ofhis colleagues in making the appeal for greater output and it mightbe useful if the Prime Minister himself were to launch it at aconference of representatives of both sides of the industries.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that immediate steps should be taken to raise textileexports to the level of  250 million a year;(2) Agreed that an urgent appeal should be made to employersand workers in the textile industries to increase output in order to enable additional supplies of clothing and household textiles to be made available to the homeconsumer.The Cabinet then discussed what should be the method; of announcing the decisions with regard to the import programme for1947-48 which had to be made public.The Lord President said that, in accordance with the Cabinetsdecision of 24th June, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Presi-dent of the Board of Trade and he had discussed this matter andhad come to the conclusion that the right course was for the Chan-cellor of the Exchequer to make a general statement in the Houseof Commons on 30th June. Unless a comprehensive statement wasmade there was a serious risk that the decisions taken would reach the public in a misleading form.. In discussion the following points were made : (a) Some Ministers doubted whether any general statement ofthe Governments decisions was necessary or expedient, and it wassuggested that it might be embarrassing for the Foreign secretary in his discussions on the European reconstruction plan if any state-ment made led to a debate in Parliament.(b) Whatever announcement was made should avoid, so far aspossible, suggesting that cuts were being made in imports into theUnited Kingdom. In fact most of the proposals approved by theCabinet merely meant reductions in Departmental programmes
which, represented substantial increases in the volume of importsas compared with the past year. ,(c) The best way of handling the announcement might be toarrange for a Parliamentary Question to be addressed to the Chan-cellor of the Exchequer asking what steps the Government were taking to deal with the balance of payments situation. In reply the Chancellor of the Exchequer might say that the policy of theGovernment was to spend the country&apos;s dollar resources prudently,while at the same time doing everything possible to secure theexpansion of production in this country. Reference might also bemade to the need to restrict imports of newsprint and to any other decisions on which some public announcement was necessary.The Cabinet (3) Agreed that a general statement should be made on thedecisions with regard to the import programme whichhad been reached and invited the Lord President, theChancellor of the Exchequer and the President of theBoard of Trade to consider, in the light of the points made in discussion, what should be the form and content of this statement.India. 4.   The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that good pro-Constitutional gress had been made in drafting the legislation to give effect to the changes. decision to transfer power in India on the basis of establishing two(Previous independent Dominions. The Viceroy&apos;s final views were stillEeferenee: awaited on certain Clauses, but the main lines of the Bill wereC.M.(47)56th now settled. It would provide that from 15th August twoConclusions, independent Dominions would be set up in India, to be knownMinute 4.) respectively as India and Pakistan. It would define their terri-tories and provide for the appointment of a Governor-General foreach. The original intention had been to do no more than givethe Constituent Assembly in each Dominion full power to legislateuntil other provision was made by them in exercise of their con-stituent powers, but it was understood that the Congress leaderswished the constitution established by the Government of india act, 1935, to be made applicable separately in each of the twoDominions until such time as other provision was made by theConstituent Assemblies and it was proposed to agree to this. TheGovernor-General would have power to make by order such pro-vision as was necessary to bring the legislation into effective opera-tion; and the Bill would also provide for dividing the Indianarmed forces and safeguarding the position of the British forcesin India. It had been hoped to obtain Indian agreement to aprovision separating the Andaman and Nicobar Islands from India,but it was now clear that we should have to seek to secure our defence requirements in these Islands by negotiation. The IndianInterim Government had asked that provision should be made inthe Bill to give effect to their guarantee that any officer of theSecretary of State&apos;s Services who continued in service after thetransfer of power would receive the same conditions of service from the successor authorities; and this proposal was still underdiscussion with Indian Ministers. The title &quot; Indian IndependenceBill,&quot; which had been adopted at his suggestion, would be acceptable to the Indian leaders and to Dominion Governments.The aim Was to introduce the Bill not later than 9th July,and he hoped that the Cabinet would agree that he should discuss it with the Opposition leaders on 27th June, though its final detailsmight then be still undecided, and that thereafter the Viceroy shouldbe authorised to show it to the Indian political leaders, who had pressed to see it before its introduction.The Cabinet Agreed that the Prime Minister should discuss the termsof the draft Indian Independence Bill with the Opposi-tion, and that the Viceroy should be authorised to show the draft to the Indian political leaders.
Iron and SteelIndustry Bill.(previous reference:C.M.(47)44thConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord Presi-dent (CP. (47) 185) reporting the views of the Committee on the socialisation of Industries on certain issues raised by representativesof the Iron and Steel Federation at a meeting with the PrimeMinister.The Lord President said that, in accordance with the Cabinetsdecision Of 1st May (CM. (47) 42nd Conclusion, Minute 6), theMinister of Supply had given the President and Chairman of theIron and Steel Federation a general indication of the scope and nature of the Government&apos;s proposals for bringing certain sectionsof the iron and steel industry under public ownership. The Presi-dent and the Chairman had subsequently made to the Prime Ministercertain representations, which were summarised in paragraph 2 ofthe memorandum annexed to CP. (47) 185, and the Prime minister had asked the Committee on the Socialisation of Industries to advise the Cabinet on the issues raised by these representations. TheFederation&apos;s proposal was that, in order to retain the willingco-operation of the industry, the Government should limit them-selves to assuming permanent statutory control over the industry,together with a measure of financial participation in, or even of full ownership of, individual concerns; and the Minister of supply had recommended. that, while the preparation of legislation to giveeffect to the scheme already approved by the Cabinet should proceed,confidential discussions should be pursued with the Federation asto the possibility of an alternative scheme, which would have togo further than the proposal made by the Federation but would avoid bitter controversy with the industry. The Committee on the socialisation of Industries were still convinced that the scheme approved by the Cabinet was soundly conceived but they felt that nothing would be lost by arranging for discussions with the Federa-tion in order to ascertain how far the industry could be broughtto meet the Governments views. In reaching this view they had had in mind that, for tactical reasons, it would be unwise to reject the Federation^ overtures and they had also had regard to therisk that the controversy which would be aroused by a scheme forthe immediate transfer of large sections of the industry to public ownership would impair the output of steel at a critical time and delay vital schemes of modernisation. The Committee accordinglyrecommende d that, while the preparation of legislation to giveeffect to the scheme approved by the Cabinet should continue tobe pressed forward, a Minister or Ministers should undertake con-fidential discussions with representatives of the Federation in orderto give the latter an opportunity of developing their ideas as to thepossible alternative scheme. The Ministers concerned should, how-ever, be guided in these discussions by the knowledge that no scheme would be acceptable unless it satisfied the essential conditions setout in paragraphs of CP. (47) 185, namely, that effective powerover the industry must pass from the Federation to the Govern-ment, that the responsible Minister must be able without further legislation to transfer to public ownership any undertakings withinthe industry, that the Government should at an early date assumetotal or partial ownership of some substantial assets in the industry,and that it should be clearly understood that the government&apos;s policy remained one of bringing the appropriate sections of theindustry under full public ownership. He himself was muchexercised over the problems of severance which would arise in thecase of highly-integrated plants and he felt that it might be worth considering a scheme under which specific provision would be madein the Bill for the transfer to public ownership of concerns about which there was no doubt, and the Minister would be given powerto make orders bringing under public ownership such additionalconcerns as it might prove expedient to take over at a later stage.Such a scheme, coupled with full powers of control over all sectionsof the industry and the effective transfer to a statutory Iron andSteel Board of all the executive functions at present carried outby Steel House, might enable the aims of the Government to beachieved with less risk of damage to the national economy through
the loss of steel output or delays in carrying out modernisationschemes. For this reason, he thought it would be useful to ascer-tain in the course of discussion how far the Federation would beprepared to acquiesce in proposals on the lines which he had indicated. He recognised, however, that other members of theCommittee did not think it would be right to go as far as this in the discussions.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he supported theproposals made in CP. (47) 185 but he did not interpret them asinvolving any reversal of the decision taken by the Cabinet on28th April to proceed with a comprehensive scheme of public owner-ship or as involving any delay in the preparation of a Bill for introduction during the 1947-48 Session and of an explanatoryWhite Paper. It would be a mistake not to agree to further dis-cussions with the Federation, but these discussions should be onthe basis of the essential conditions laid down in paragraph 6 of cp. (47) 185.The Minister of Supply said that the preparation of the bill and the White Paper were proceeding, but that on tactical groundsit seemed desirable to agree to further discussions. It was mostimportant to maintain steel output during the next year and, inthe interests of obtaining the maximum co-operation from theindustry, it seemed very desirable to explore further how theGovernments aims could be achieved with the least possiblecontroversy.In further discussion it was urged that the Government were already committed to a comprehensive scheme of public ownership,and that to lead the Federation to believe that the Government,were now hesitating between that scheme and an alternative scheme on the lines set out in paragraph 8 of the memorandum annexed to CP. (47) 185 would only encourage the Federation to mobiliseopposition to the original proposals. Moreover, merely to take powers of control without transfer of ownership would not be satis-factory and was, indeed, more likely to affect output adversely thana comprehensive transfer of ownership. For these reasons it was most important that any discussions undertaken should not suggestthat the Government were willing to abandon any of the essential features of their original scheme.In reply it was pointed out that sub-paragraph (iv) of para-graph 6 of CP. (47) 185 made it clear that there could be nocompromise on the policy of bringing appropriate sections of theiron and steel industry under public ownership and that the issueonly concerned the stages by which this objective was to be achieved.In these circumstances further discussions on the basis indicatedin paragraph 6 would not, in fact, suggest any weakening of theGovernments attitude or mislead the Federation as to their intentions.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the drafting of legislation to give effect to thescheme already approved by the Cabinet for bringingcertain sections of the iron and steel industry under public ownership should be pressed forward;(2) Invited the Prime Minister to arrange for a Minister or ministers to undertake further discussions with repre-sentatives of the Iron and Steel Federation on the basisof the conditions set out in paragraph 6 of CP. (47) 185.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,2$th June, 1947.
