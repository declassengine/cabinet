Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.cabinet procedure.Times of meetings.Parliament.Amendmentof the parliament act.(previous reference:CM. (4V) 87thConclusions,Minute 3.)1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.2. The Cabinet agreed that, in order to meet the convenience of Ministers in charge of Bills before Standing Committees in theHouse of Commons, the regular meetings of the Cabinet should beheld for the time being on Mondays at 11 a.m. and Thursdays at10 a.m. This new arrangement would be brought into force in theweek beginning 8th December.3. The Cabinet were informed that further doubts had been raised about the power of the Speaker to give his certificate undersection 2 (2) of the Parliament Act, 1911, if the House of Lords,instead of rejecting a Bill, merely refrained from passing it. Inthat event it could be argued that the Speaker could not certify thatthe Bill had been rejected by the Lords within the meaning ofsection 2 (3) of the Parliament Act until the Session had actuallyended and that it would then be too late to present the Bin forthe Royal Assent. This point was raised in the memoirs of JLordUllswater, who had been Speaker when the Parliament Act, 191Lwas passed and when the two Bills enacted under that Act hadbeen passed into law in 1914. (See &quot; A Speaker&apos;s Commentaries &quot; :Volume II, pages 112 and 171).In discussion it was suggested that this point could be met byinserting in the Parliament Bill a provision to the effect that theHouse of Lords should be deemed to have rejected a Bill if theyhad not passed it by, say, three days before the end of the Session.It was pointed out, however, that such an amendment, though itwould put the point beyond doubt for the future, would serve toemphasise the doubt in relation to the passage of the present Parlia-ment Bill if that Bill had to be enacted under the existing provisionsof the Parliament Act.The Lord President undertook to consider this question further,in consultation with the Lord Chancellor and the Home Secretary.Meetings of 4.   Attention was drawn to reports published in that morning&apos;sParliamentary issue of the Daily Worker of speeches made by Ministers at a labour Party,   meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party on the previous day.These disclosures were serious in themselves; and it was also dis-quieting that they should occur so soon after the investigation madeby the Committee of Privileges into the publication of information obtained at Party meetings.The Lord, President said that he intended to ask the Parlia-mentary Labour Party to be ready to take appropriate disciplinary action against any members of the Party who were found to havedisclosed such confidential information.Parliament.Reports of theCommittee of privileges onthe Cases ofMr. GarryAllighan, M.P.,and Mr. EvelynWalkden, M.P.(previous reference:C.M.(47)90thConclusions,Minute 8.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (47) 314) regarding the revision of the government motion relating to the conduct of journalists.In discussion there was general support for the second of thealternative formulae set out in paragraph 6 of this memorandum.The Cabinet Authorised the Lord President to table on behalf of theGovernment a motion in the following terms : &quot; That, if in any case hereafter a Member shall have been found guiltyby this House of corruptly accepting payment for the disclosure and publication of confidential information aboutmatters to&apos; be proceeded with in Parliament, any personresponsible for offering such payment shall incur the gravedispleasure of this House; and this House will take suchaction as it may, in the circumstances, think fit.&quot;34724-2 B 2
Requisitioned 6.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ChancellorLand and War 0f the Exchequer (CP. (47) 315) proposing that provision shouldWorks Bill.     be made in the Requisitioned Land and War Works Act (Amend-w ment) Bill for the amendment of the existing law governing thepayment of compensation for requisitioned property.This Bill would extend the period during which land requisi-tioned for military purposes might be retained, and would amend the Requisitioned Land and War Works Act, 1945, in other respects.Compensation for requisitioned property was payable under the1945 Act on the basis of 1939 values. This standard had, however,been abandoned both for war damage payments and for compensationon compulsory acquisition; and it was suggested that this oppor-tunity should be taken to provide a different standard of compensa-tion for requisitioned property.   It was therefore proposed (i) that rental compensation should be raised to current values,within a ceiling of the 1939 values plus 60 per cent, or,&apos;for rent-restricted property, the standard rent; and(ii) that terminal compensation should be subject to a ceilingrepresenting the difference between the current &quot; com-pulsory acquisition &quot; values of the property in its state(a) at the beginning and (b) at the end of the requisition.The Minister of Defence said that the proposals contained in cp. (47) 315 were acceptable to the Service Departments, thoughthe amended principles for the payment of terminal compensation would throw a heavy burden on the limited valuation staff.In discussion, the following points were made : (a) The prolongation of requisitioning might operate harshlyin the case of leasehold property, if the lease was nearly ended. Itwas pointed out, however, that this Avould not affect the totalcompensation payable, though it might increase the difficulty of dividing the compensation equitably between the tenant and theground landlord.(b) An owner whose house had been converted into flats wouldnot receive the cost of reinstatement and might receive no compensa-tion at all, since the conversion of the property might have increased its value. It was, however, an accepted principle that, save in very exceptional circumstances, compensation should not be paid on thebasis of reinstatement.(c) Claims might be made for compensation where access forthe upkeep of grounds had been refused. Great care should be takenin dealing with such claims, as payment of compensation for refusal of access might establish a precedent for claims on the same basis in regard to the foreshore.The Cabinet-Agreed that provision relating to the payment of compensa-tion for requisitioned property should be made in theRequisitioned Land and War Works Act (Amendment) bill as proposed in CP. (47) 315.7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofFood (CP. (47) 312) on the increases in food prices required to keeptotal expenditure on food subsidies within the limit of  392 millionset by the former Chancellor of the Exchequer in introducing his budget on 12th November. This memorandum showed that, inorder to keep within this limit in a period during which world food prices might continue to rise, a reduction of about  20 million should be made in the total subsidies for the rest of the current financial year and about  70 million in the financial year 1948-49.It was recommended that this saving should be secured by increases in the prices of meat, bacon, tea and eggs which, on present ration scales, would represent an increased cost to consumers of just under7d. per head per week. Alternative methods of securing the samereduction in the subsidies were set out in Appendix B to thememorandum.Food Prices.(previous reference:CM. (47) 74thConclusions,Minute 2.)
123G.ML 01 (47)In discussion serious doubts were expressed about the expediency of increasing food prices on the lines suggested at thepresent time. The Cabinet were informed that the price increases proposed in paragraph 2 of CP. (47) 312 would involve a rise ofover three points in the cost-of-living index; and this, together withthe rise caused by recent increases in the prices of sugar and beerand the increased incidence of purchase tax, would mean that theindex figure would rise from 101 to over 106. In the followingmonth a further rise in the index figure must be expected as a resultof increases in the prices of coal and gas. There were still a fewindustries in which wage rates were automatically adjusted inaccordance with movements of the new cost-of-living index; and,although these industries were not in themselves important, adjust-ments in their wage rates to reflect this rise in the index figure were likely to provoke demands for similar adjustments in more important industries. A fresh cycle of wage increases might well be started;and, if so, the cost to the community would far exceed the amountsaved by the reduction in food subsidies. Some Ministers feared that such a series of wages demands would disturb industrial relations, provide further opportunities for unofficial strikes, andtend generally to reduce industrial output.It was also argued that it would be a mistake to increase food prices at a time when food rations had recently been reduced. price increases would be more acceptable to the public if they could be linked with some increase in the quantity of food available to theconsumer. Thus, before announcing any increase in the prices ofbacon and eggs, there would be advantages in waiting to see whether,as a result of the current trade negotiations with Canada, it wouldbe possible to increase the supply of bacon and eggs.It was also suggested that it would be inopportune to increasefood prices shortly before Christmas. It would be much easier ifthese changes could be deferred until the winter was over.In further discussion the following particular points weremade :  (a) If the food subsidies had to be reduced, there was much tobe said for spreading the price increases more widely. Thus, thecurrent price of butter was slightly below the pre-war price, andit would be preferable to raise the prices of butter and cheese and make a smaller increase in the price of bacon. Instead of seeking the whole saving on meat, bacon, tea and eggs, the Cabinet were disposed to favour spreading the price increases more widely, onthe lines of the alternative scheme set out in paragraph 2 (B) of appendix B to CP. (47) 312.(b) Need the saving be obtained solely from the subsidiesdirectly related to the prices of particular foods ? Would it not bepossible to spread the saving over all the food subsidies, includingthe subsidies to farmers ?It was pointed out that the new agricultural prices announced in August as part of the Government programme for expandinghome food production took account of the subsidies paid to farmers;and any reduction in those subsidies would involve an upwardadjustment in the prices of agricultural products.(c) If the price of tea were increased by lOd. a pound, asproposed in CP. (47) 312, there would be no remaining element ofGovernment subsidy in the retail price. This would help to defeat the tactics of the Governments of India and Ceylon, who had been encouraged to impose export taxes on tea by the knowledge that the consequential increase in cost would be carried in this country bythe Government subsidy instead of being passed on to the consumer.On the other hand, there were great political difficulties in raising the price of tea : this would be strongly criticised as causing hard-ship to old-age pensioners.The Chancellor of the Exchequer reminded his colleagues thathis predecessor, in opening his Budget on 12th November, had declared with the authority of the Cabinet the Governments
intention not to allow the food subsidies to exceed a level represent-ing an annual rate of  392 million. If this policy was to bemaintained, some increase in food prices was inevitable. There wasno other sanctity in the precise figure of  392 million; and he hadalready instructed his officials to aim at stabilising these subsidiesaround the figure of  400 million. But, unless the policy announcedso recently by his predecessor was to be abandoned, it was inevitable that some increases in food prices should be made before the spring of next year. He had not intended that all the increases proposedin CP. (47) 312 should be announced simultaneously. He recognisedthat, if they were all announced together, shortly before Christmas,they might well produce the serious consequences both on publicmorale and on wage rates which some of his colleagues feared.He would also prefer to spread the increases rather more widely onthe lines of the alternative set out in paragraph 2 (B) of Appendix Bto CP. (47) 312. And he agreed that, Avhatever the range of price increases eventually approved, it would be expedient that they shouldbe introduced by degrees, at suitable intervals, and that every oppor-tunity should be taken of associating such price changes with any increases which could be made in the quantity of food-stuffsavailable.The Chancellor suggested that he should reconsider, in the lightof the Cabinefs discussion, the scope and the timing of the changes to be made in food prices with a view to limiting the food subsidies to an annual rate of  400 million.The Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Minister of Food, to reconsider the proposals in cp. (47) 312 in the light of the Cabinefs discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,21th November, 1947.
