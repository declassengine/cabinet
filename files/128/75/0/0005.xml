Copy No. /  of 3 copiesSECRETMOST CONFIDENTIAL RECORDTOCC(82) 19th CONCLUSIONSThursday 22 April 1982FALKLANDISLANDSPreviousReference:CC(82) 18thConclusionsThe Cabinet reviewed the state of the dispute over the Falkland Islands.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE informed the Cabinet ofthe British forces deployed in connection with the crisis and gave anaccount of the present location of Argentine naval forces.    No Argentinewarships had so far entered the Maritime Exclusion Zone (MEZ)declared by the United Kingdom around the Falkland Islands.    A numberof military options would be open to the Government if efforts to reach apeaceful solution failed.    It would be possible, when the carrier borneHarrier aircraft reached the area, to declare an Air Exclusion Zone,in addition to the MEZ.    To make a blockade of the Islands effective,it would be necessary to render the airfield at Port Stanley unusable.The Argentine garrison was thought to have sufficient stocks for about60 days, but the morale of the young conscripts who comprised about80 per cent of it would be affected sooner.    Given air superiority,British forces could successfully recover the Islands, though the operatiowould be difficult and require more consideration before any decision wastaken.    The option to recover the Islands militarily would not always beavailable since the difficulty of the operation would increase if it weredelayed.    Ships and troops had limited endurance in the hard conditionsof the South Atlantic winter.In discussion the following points were raade:-a.       Care should be taken to avoid action of which theAmericans might disapprove.    But the United States Secretaryof State, Mr Haig, regarded the application of military pressureas helpful in bringing the Argentine Junta to make concessions.As a result of Press speculation, it was widely believed thatBritish forces would soon retake South Georgia.    Unless thiswere done, it would not be believed that the Government was inearnest.    The Island   might be valuable as a sheltered anchoragefor British ships1-SECRET
SECRETb. There remained a danger that military action such asthe operation to retake South Georgia, as opposed to militarypressure, might both reduce Mr Haig&apos;s influence in BuenosAires and take some of the international pressure off theArgentine Government.    The effect of the South Georgiaoperation on Mr Haig&apos;s position would depend on whether manylives were lost.    Further action of a military nature, whichmight prevent a negotiated settlement, should not be taken overthe next few days, while the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretarywas in Washington.c. It was important to counter the Argentine claim, whichwas manifestly untrue, that in taking their military action againstthe Falkland Islands they had sought to avoid casualties.    It wasunfortunate that British television reports were giving theimpression that the morale of the Argentine garrison was high.d. Reports of Mr Haig&apos;s discussions in Buenos Aires hadshown the difficulty of dealing with the Argentine Government;major decisions involved some 50 people and could be vetoed byCorps Commanders.    President Galtieri was an alcoholic andapparently incapable of rational thought;    his future as head ofthe government seemed doubtful.    The Foreign Minister,Mr Costa Mendez, was without influence.    But it was essentialthat any failure to secure a negotiated settlement occurred in away that left the United States firmly in support of the UnitedKingdom&apos;s position.f.       Once the amphibious force had sailed from AscensionIsland, it would be difficult politically to turn it back.    A decisionto instruct the force to sail should only be taken after carefulconsideration of the full implications, including the possibilityof its use to make an assault landing on the Islands.    If militaryaction became necessary, it would be important to move quicklyif the present level of all-Party support was to be maintained.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that a numberof difficult decisions would be required, often at short notice, during theforthcoming weeks.    The Defence and Oversea Policy Sub-Committee onthe South Atlantic and the Falkland Islands, under her Chairmanship,would remain in day-to-day charge;  but if possible the Cabinet would beconsulted before a decision was taken to mount an assault on the FalklandIslands themselves.    Meanwhile it was of the highest importance tomaintain complete secrecy about possible operational plans.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office7 June 1982 -2-
