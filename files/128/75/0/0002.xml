SECRETCOPY NO. /   of 4 CopiesCABINETMOST CONFIDENTIAL RECORDTOCC(82) 3rd Conclusions, Minute 5Thursday 28 January 1982ECONOMICSTRATEGYPreviousReference:CC(81) 33rdConclusions,Minute 5The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C(82) 1) on the Government&apos;s economic strategy and itsimplications for the preparation of his forthcoming Budget on 9 March.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the latest forecastspredicted continuing, though slow, recovery in output and a further fallin inflation.    Unemployment was likely to edge up a little further in1982, though at a diminishing rate, while industrial productivity shouldcontinue to improve.    The general picture was one of continuingrecovery, with encouraging signs of real improvement in the economy,though this could be invalidated by events beyond the Government&apos;scontrol such as high interest rates in the United States of America or aserious set-back on pay.    For the recovery to continue, and to securea genuine improvement in the employment situation, it was essential topersevere with the present economic strategy.    For domestic andoverseas confidence in the strategy to be sustained, the financial frame-work had to be credible.    Within this framework the size of the PublicSector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) for 1982-83 was crucial. Thepresent forecast, which could change substantially before March, gavea provisional figure of rather less than the  9 billion for which theGovernment had planned at the time of the 1981 Budget.    This forecastwas based on the assumptions that public spending next year would be atthe level agreed by Cabinet in November - a planning total of about 11 5 billion;  and that income tax thresholds and excise duties would beincreased in line with inflation, but that the tax structure and rates werein other respects unchanged.    He would now welcome the views of theCabinet on what might be the appropriate size of the PSBR in 1982-83and, if some reductions in taxation should turn out to be possible, howthese might be distributed.In considering the size of the PSBR, a balance had to be struck betweenthe objectives of bringing about lower interest rates and, where possible,making tax reductions,     To plan for a PSBR of, say,   7 -  8 billionwould give a better prospect for lower interest rates which would behelpful to industry and to people with mortgages;  it would not, however,leave any room for tax reductions, apart from those changes alreadyassumed in the forecasts.    On the other hand, to go for a PSBR aboveabout  9 billion was likely to lead to higher interest rates than now, toSECRET
SECRETaffect the confidence of the financial markets, and to risk so large a fallin sterling as to jeopardise the prospects of reducing inflation and toimpair, or even reverse, recovery.In so far as tax reductions were possible, the choice was broadlybetween measures which would directly affect prices, those whichwould reduce income tax, and those which would directly assistcompanies;   though elements of all three could be included in the finalBudget package and he would also be considering a number of othersmaller items, as well as the structure of the North Sea tax regime.Measures to affect prices could include less than full revalorisation ofexcise duties or a reduction in the rate of Value Added Tax;   such changeswould avoid additions to the Retail Price Index.    For the personalsector, an increase in tax allowance of 10 to 11 percentage points aboveinflation would be necessary to restore tax thresholds, as a proportionof average earnings, to their 1978-79 levels;  an increase would bringbenefits in wage bargaining, and would diminish the poverty trap and &apos;whywork&apos; problems.    Assistance to companies would have the most directimpact on companies&apos; income, though at the risk of some leakage intowages;  the main proposal which had been canvassed was for a reductionin the National Insurance Surcharge (NIS).In discussion the following were the main points made:-a. It was generally agreed that the aim should be to maintainthe Government&apos;s broad economic strategy;  any radical departurenow, in search of benefits which could be only short-lived, wouldbe damaging to the Government&apos;s credibility and deeply disappointingto its supporters.    The 1982 Budget should be seen as a developmentof present policy.    Its aim should be to give confidence and hope toindustry, to the public generally, and to the Government&apos;ssupporters.b. It would be a mistake to go too far in offering tax and otherreliefs in the coming Budget.     Something should be kept in handto deal with difficulties which could emerge later in the year. Theright course was to leave room for progress in later Budgets inwhich there could be further tax reductions.    It was particularlyimportant to avoid the mistake of going so far in the 1982 Budgetthat retrenchment might be necessary in 1983.     The Governmentshould not put at risk the public&apos;s sense of its competence in thehandling of the economy through a period of great difficulty andrecession.    It would be important to be sure that measures includedin the Finance Bill would be supported in the House of Commons and,in particular, to avoid any which might have to be withdrawn throughlack of support from Conservative Members of Parliament. Careshould be taken in the remaining weeks before the Budget not toarouse over optimistic expectations of its contents.2SECRET
SECRETc. It was generally agreed that it would be better to make taxreductions rather than to plan for a PSBR as low as  7 -  8 billionin the hope of bringing about lower interest rates.    Tax reductionsoffered a more certain, and visible, benefit than the possiblereduction of interest rates.    The Government could influence thelevel of interest rates only to a limited extent;  the effect on interestrates of a lower PSBR could be more than offset by other factorssuch as high interest rates in other countries, notably in the UnitedStates of America.d. A number of Ministers thought that it would be right to planfor a PSBR of up to  9 billion.    This should allow for tax reductions;it should also avoid putting at risk the recovery of the economy, andthe prospects for continuing export led growth, by going so high as tolose the confidence of the financial markets in the Government&apos;seconomic policy.e. Some Ministers thought that the PSBR should be somewhathigher - perhaps  10 -  11 billion - and that this would not underminemarket confidence, provided that the PSBR was no higher as apercentage of Gross Domestic Product than in previous years. Thefinancial markets might be encouraged to accept borrowing at thislevel if the PSBR were reclassified to distinguish public sectorborrowing to finance capital and productive investment, or possiblyto exclude some of such borrowing from the PSBR;  on the otherhand, the markets might discount such reclassification, and anyreview of the definition of the PSBR could lead to the inclusion ofsome types of borrowing at present outside its scope.    It was furthersuggested that, if a high PSBR led to instability in the exchange rate,this might be met by the United Kingdom deciding to participate inthe exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System.f. In considering how any financial relief might be distributed,it was generally agreed that the emphasis should be on giving helpto companies rather than to individuals.    While there were nowsigns of economic recovery, there was still a long way to go, andit was important to take steps to strengthen the country&apos;s industrialand commercial base.    This, rather than reductions in the realrate of personal taxation, was the best way to respond to the problemof unemployment and to open up the prospect of creating jobs.g. It was generally agreed that income tax thresholds should beincreased in 1982-83 in line with inflation (&quot;Rooker-Wise&quot;).    It wassuggested that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should not seek tomake good in the 1982 Budget the effects of not indexing thresholdsin 1981-82, but that some relatively modest changes in personalallowances, over and above &quot;Rooker-Wise&quot; might be considered forthe 1982 Budget.    Further changes in personal taxation should be leftfor consideration in the 1983 Budget.3SECRET
SECRETh. It was agreed that, with the exception of petrol and derv,indirect taxes should be fully revalorised.    It would be helpfulto industry and to rural communities if any increases in thetax on petrol and derv   were less than full revalorisation;it was unlikely that a majority in the House of Commons wouldsupport a measure to increase the price of a gallon of petrolby 9p, which would be the effect of full revalorisation.i. Opinion was divided on whether the main measure to helpindustry should be a reduction in the NIS.    Some Ministerswished priority to be given to this reduction:   the public wereresentful of what they saw as a tax on employment, at a timewhen 3 million people were unemployed;  and it would be warmlwelcomed by industry as a response by the Government to theirrepresentations.    These Ministers doubted whether in presentcircumstances any significant part of the benefit would bepassed on in the form of wages rather than used to restoreprofitability and to increase investment and output. OtherMinisters thought that a reduction in the NIS would be mis-directed:  less than one-third of NIS payments were made bymanufacturing industry and much of the benefit would go to thebanking and North Sea oil sectors whose needs were relativelyless pressing.    Unless steps were taken to prevent it, someof the benefit would also go to local authorities and nationalisedindustries.    The trade unions would be likely to seize theopportunity of the reduction to reinforce their claims for higherincreases than otherwise in the coming round of wagenegotiations;  the result could be that much of the benefit wouldbe taken up by wage increases.j.        It would be better not to devote any further substantialresources to large programmes of public sector capital invest-ment which would be slow in fruition and in helping to reduceunemployment.    A better course would be to considermeasures to stimulate, and to accelerate, investment inselected sectors by offering time-limited financial incentiveswhich would be available for, say, investment undertaken inthe next two years.    In particular, there was support formeasures to stimulate a programme of house improvement:this work was labour intensive, and so would be useful inreducing unemployment;  a programme could take effectquickly;  and it would be seen as a positive and necessarymeasure to restore the quality of the country&apos;s housing stockwhich was rapidly deteriorating in a number of areas.Proposals for investment by the nationalised industries showJQga satisfactory return should not be held back by capital ration-ing;  cash planning systems in the public sector should beoperated so that capital programmes did not suffer and wereable to benefit from underspending elsewhere.4SECRET
SECRETk.       It would however in general be better for any newassistance to particular sectors of industry to be given by wayof tax reductions rather than increased public expenditure.Although some public expenditure had the effect of helping theprivate sector, this point was not generally and readilyperceived;  and it was important that the Government should notbe criticised for appearing to preside over an inexorably,expanding public sector.1.       Further consideration should be given to proposals forprivate sector participation in public sector projects, such asthe roads programme.     There were possibilities for usingpublic sector money in partnership with private sector finance,for example in house building, with a very beneficial gearingeffect in the sense that a relatively small injection of publicsector money could lead to a considerable investment pro-gramme.     The Secretary of State for the Environment, inconsultation with the Chief Secretary, Treasury, would shortlybe making proposals to the Ministerial Committee on EconomicStrategy on the possibilities for the direct involvement of marketfinance in construction projects in the public sector.m.     Although it had so far proved impossible to work out apracticable scheme, it would be helpful if there could be somereduction in industrial energy costs.    The Secretary of Statefor Energy would shortly be making proposals to the Chancellorof the Exchequer on electricity prices for large industrial users.The Secretary of State for Industry had put proposals to theChancellor of the Exchequer for measures to help small firms,to stimulate enterprise, and to encourage the development ofnew technology.n.       In considering the measures in the 1982 Budget, accountshould be taken of their impact on the coming round of wagenegotiations.    Most wage earners were seeing their personaldisposal incomes reduced by increases in tax, national insurance,rates and fuel bills;  about two-thirds of trade unionists livedin council houses and they were faced with rent increases too.This would increase the pressure for higher wage increases inthe coming pay round.    In the public sector, where cash limitsoperated, it could indirectly lead to cuts in capital expenditureto compensate for increased wage costs.    Consideration shouldbe given to the possibility of influencing wage bargaining inselected sectors of private industry;  for example, it might beindicated that if the construction industry were to settle at arelatively modest level of wage increases, the Government wouldthen be willing to introduce tax allowances which would stimulateactivity, and employment, in the industry.5SECRET
SECRETTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion,  said that theCabinet recognised that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would have todetermine both the main budgetary judgment and the details of budgetarymeasures in the light of the situation and prospect as they appearednearer the time.    The discussion had shown that the Cabinet agreedthat it would be right to continue on the broad strategy which theGovernment had followed hitherto.    It was essential not to put at riskthe objective of reducing inflation;  within that the aim should be toenable the country to take advantage of the prospects of recovery.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion.2. Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to takeaccount of the views expressed and the points made indiscussion in the preparation of his forthcoming Budget.Cabinet Office28 January 19826SECRET
