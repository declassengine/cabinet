Copy No.    /   of 3 copiesSECRETMOST CONFIDENTIAL RECORDTOCC(82) 42nd Conclusions, Minute 2Thursday 30 September 1982 at 10. 00 amCHINA THE PRIME MINISTER, reporting on her recent visit to China, saidthat the second of her two days of talks with the Chinese PremierZhao Ziyang had been on the future of Hong Kong.    She had also hada talk on the same subject with the Vice-Chairman of the CentralCommittee of the Chinese Communist Party, Deng Xiaoping. Whenallowance was made for translation, the time spent on substantivediscussion came down to less than two hours.     It was impossible inso short a time to move far towards agreement:  and essentially bothsides had outlined their opening position.      The Chinese Government&apos;sposition was that they wanted to assume control over the whole Colonywhen the lease of the New Territories expired in 1997.    She hadexplained that the British position was that the three treaties governingthe status of Hong Kong remained valid and could not be unilaterallyabrogated.    But if the Chinese would accept the continuation of Britishadministration over the whole of Hong Kong it might be possible for theBritish Government to consider recommending to Parliament thatsovereignty should be ceded to China.    Having no understanding of how afree society worked, the Chinese leadership failed to grasp that publicassurances that life in Hong Kong under the control of a CommunistGovernment could go on as before would be insufficient to maintaincommercial confidence;  and that this was dependent on the continuationof a British administration.    Given this difference of view, the centralfeature of the communique had been the statement that both sides wantedto assure the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong and were preparedto enter into talks on how to achieve this common aim.    The talks, whichwould now begin through diplomatic channels, would be difficult: theproblem would be to persuade the Chinese that the commercial prosperityof Hong Kong, which it was an important Chinese interest to maintain,could not continue without British administration.    On balance, shethought that an accommodation should be achievable.    Her own talkswith the Chinese leadership, although tough, had not been acrimonious;and the statement in the communique that they had been conducted in afriendly atmosphere had been inserted on Chinese initiative.    It wasinevitable that her visit to China had aroused hopes in Hong Kong for anearly resolution of the problem which could not be satisfied, but she washopeful that the terms of the communique would be sufficient to sustainconfidence for the moment.    A critical point would be reached in 198 5,since all Hong Kong mortgages were for a term of 12 years. Agreementwith China consequently needed to be reached within the next two to threeyears.     The universal concern for the future felt in Hong Kong was-1-SECRET
SECRETunderstandable:   5-| million people there had escaped from communism inChina, and Britain had absolute responsibility for them.    In thisconnection account should be taken of the anxieties felt in the Colony onthe nationality question.    This was one of the subjects which would haveto be covered in the discussions with the Chinese Government. Meanwhilethe fact that under the 1981 Nationality Act citizens of Hong Kong wouldno longer be described as British subjects was a cause of particularconcern in the Colony and should be re-examined.    In carrying out thisre-examination the risk of appearing to confer on Hong Kong citizens someresidual, moral right of access to the United Kingdom would have to becarefully weighed against Britain&apos;s obligation to the people of Hong Kongand the need to maintain their confidence.The Cabinet -Took Note.Cabinet Office1 October 1982-2-SECRET
