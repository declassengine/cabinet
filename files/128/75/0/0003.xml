Copy No. / of 3 copiesTOP SECRETCABINETMOST CONFIDENTIAL RECORDTOCC(82) 8th ConclusionsThursday 4 March 1982THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that the strategicnuclear deterrent was central to the defence of the United Kingdom.No one could foresee what might over the next 30-40 years happen tothe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation or to the United States attitudeto the defence of Europe.    A strategic deterrent under British nationalcontrol was therefore essential.    The Polaris force would be 30 yearsold by the 1990s and its credibility would be declining.    Only a four-boat Trident force could provide a successor which would be credible inSoviet eyes and remain operational well into the 21st Century. TheD5 Trident 2 missile would be more cost-effective than the C4 Trident 1version, because it would preserve commonality between Britain andAmerica.    It would also be cheaper during the years immediately ahead.Its total cost over fifteen years would average  500 million a year orjust over three per cent of an annual Defence Budget of over 14, 000 million.    By contrast France&apos;s nuclear deterrent was costingtwenty per cent of her defence expenditure.    For both military andpolitical reasons the British decision could not be further delayed.Following the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on 21 January, therefore, secrethigh-level negotiations had been undertaken with the United Statesauthorities to establish the terms on which the Trident 2 missile couldbe made available.    The upshot of these negotiations had been exception-ally favourable;  after a difficult start the Americans had in the endmade every effort to be helpful.    As in the case of the Polaris andTrident 1 agreements, the missiles would be made available at thecontract price applicable to the United States Navy.    By way of offsetthe United States authorities had undertaken to modify administrativelythe effect of their Buy America legislation, so that British industrycould compete for sub-contracts across the whole range of the UnitedStates Trident programme.    American liaison staff in London would beavailable to advise British firms wishing to tender for such business.Their success would of course depend on their competitiveness. TheAmericans had also indicated privately that they hoped to continue theircurrent policy of placing other large defence orders in Britain. Thesurcharges applicable to a British purchase of Trident 2 would be 35 million lower than those envisaged under the Trident 1 agreement;THE UNITEDKINGDOMSTRATEGICNUCLEARDETERRENTPreviousReference:CC(82) 2ndConclusions1TOP SECRET
TOP SECRETthe facilities charge had been waived altogether and the Research andDevelopment levy would be limited to a fixed sum in constant dollarsrather than a percentage, so that no cost escalation risk would beinvolved in either case.    In return for these concessions the Americanshad sought assurances about British conventional deployments; andwhile no specific undertakings of this kind would feature in the proposedagreement, the British negotiators had been able to make good use ofhis decision (which he had already taken on.other grounds) to retain theRoyal Navy&apos;s two assault ships Fearless and Intrepid.    As the resultof an unexplained leak some account of these terms had appeared in theBritish Press.    Public reactions had been favourable.    Subject to theCabinet&apos;s agreement he now hoped that the negotiations could beconcluded and the new agreement announced on 11 March. Thereafterevery effort would need to be made to maximise public support for thedecision.    Although a majority of the electorate clearly believed thatBritain should retain an independent deterrent, there was as yet lessagreement that Trident 2 would be the right choice.    It would beimportant to show that its real cost over time would be no higher thanTrident l&apos;s would have been;  that it would leave room within the defenceprogramme for significant increased expenditure on conventional forces;and that there would be no need for Britain to deploy the maximumnumber of missiles or warheads possible with the Trident 2 system, ifa more limited number proved militarily adequate.In discussion there was general support for the Secretary of State forDefence&apos;s proposals and appreciation was expressed for the fullbriefing which he had arranged for members of the Cabinet followingtheir earlier discussion of the subject on 21 January.    The decisionwould be warmly welcomed by almost all the Government&apos;s supportersin Parliament, as a meeting the previous evening had made clear.Cost escalation remained a danger;  but the proposed offset arrange-ments should prove particularly valuable, provided that they did notencounter too much opposition in the United States Congress.    A majoreffort would now be necessary to rally public support for the Trident 2programme.    It would not be possible to devise penalty arrangementswhich would preclude a future Government from abandoning it. Butpolitically it might not prove disadvantageous that comparatively littlewould have been spent on the programme by the time of the nextGeneral Election;  the Government could not be accused of pre-emptingthe issue, and in practice many of their opponents in Parliament wouldif they came to office be forced to recognise that the decision now beingtaken was the only possible one.    Public emphasis would need to beplaced on the annual rather than the fifteen-year cost of the programme;on the inaccuracy of fears that it would seriously undermine Britain&apos;sconventional military strength, which could in fact be effectivelydeployed only in conjunction with an adequate strategic deterrent; andon the continuing search for nuclear disarmament, which would beharder rather than easier if Britain abandoned her position of strength.2TOP SECRET
TOP SECRETThe Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) gained from being atleast nominally a non-party organisation, and from the support itenjoyed among the young and in some church circles.    It was perhapsa pity that the CND&apos;s many opponents were not also organised on anon-party basis.    The CND rightly stressed the terrible nature ofnuclear weapons but failed to recognise that Britain&apos;s possession of astrategic deterrent lessened rather than increased the danger ofnuclear war.    Although there were arguments against suggesting thatBritain might deploy fewer missiles and warheads than the Trident 2system made possible, there would on balance be major advantage inmaking clear to those with a serious concern for arms control that nomilitary escalation would in practice be involved in the switch byBritain from Trident 1.    Local opinion in Scotland should also bereassured by the fact that Trident 2 would not involve an extensionof the area of the base facilities in the Firth of Clyde. Internationallyit would have been unthinkable to leave France as the only effectivenuclear power in Western Europe.    Britain&apos;s allies were not expectedto oppose her Trident 2 decision.    Nuclear weapons were at presenta very emotional issue in the Federal Republic of Germany,particularly within Chancellor Schmidt&apos;s party;  but the private viewsof even such left-wing figures as Herr Bahr were that the British andFrench deterrents were vital for the security of Europe.    The FrenchGovernment, in order to meet domestic criticism of the much highercost of their own deterrent, felt obliged to argue that British nuclearforces were not fully independent of the Americans.    In operationalterms, of course, this was quite untrue.    Logistically, the BritishTrident 2 force as at present conceived did involve a degree ofdependence on American support, though less than would have been thecase with Trident 1 missiles which had a much shorter in-tube life.If such support were ever cut off, the success of the Che valineprogramme suggested that Britain would not be technologically unableto replace it on a national basis.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that Trident 2 missiles for a four-boat British forceshould be acquired from the United States on the terms suggested.Unless an earlier announcement became necessary because of leaksfrom Washington, the Cabinet would have an opportunity of formallyreconfirming this decision on 11 March, prior to the agreement beingannounced later that day.     The Secretary of State for Defence wouldbe publishing an Open Government Document explaining the reasons forthe new policy.     This might be circulated to the Cabinet for theirinformation on 11 March.    Meanwhile it was of the utmost importancethat the strictest secrecy should be maintained about the Cabinet&apos;scurrent discussion, the minutes of which should be retained by theSecretary of the Cabinet.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion.Cabinet Office15 March 1982 3TOP SECRET
