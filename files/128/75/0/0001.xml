The decisionwas to adopt the American Trident 1(C4) missile to be carried in anew British submarine based closely on the American submarinescurrently carrying Poseidon and C4 missiles.    Since then theMinistry of Defence had carried forward the technical and financialstudies on the project which were only possible after the decisionhad been made public.    In October 1981 President Reagan hadannounced his decision to deploy the Trident 2 (D5) missile in 1989,and to phase out the Trident 1 missile by 1998.    The President hadindicated that if Britain wished to buy Trident 2 he would agree. Agroup of Ministers under her chairmanship had been considering thisquestion.     They were in no doubt that Britain should continue tohave her own independent strategic nuclear deterrent;  and that thepossibility of acquiring Trident 2 rather than Trident 1 should beseriously considered, provided that satisfactory terms could benegotiated with the Americans.     The choice was one of greattechnical complexity and had considerable financial implications.Over the whole 15 year period of the project the extra capital cost ofacquiring Trident 2 would on a July 1980 price  and exchange ratebasis be about  600 million, bringing the total capital cost over theperiod to  6 billion if the decision were to go for a 4 boat force; atSeptember 1981 prices and exchange rates the total rose to 7-| billion.     The through-life running costs would be likely to belower in the case of Trident 2, because it would be operating inparallel with an American programme.    Both capital and runningcosts could be accommodated within the defence budget withoutunacceptable consequences for the conventional defence effort; andin the next four years Trident 2 would in fact cost less than Trident 1,She therefore intended to send a message to President Reagan tosuggest that a small team of senior officials should visit Washingtonto discuss the terms on which the Americans would be willing to makeavailable, if required, the technology, equipment and materialsnecessary for Trident 2.    When these negotiations were completedthe matter would be brought back to the Cabinet for decision.Meanwhile the Secretary of State for Defence would be ready toarrange a full briefing, for any member of the Cabinet who wished,1TOP SECRET

Itwas of the utmost importance that there should be no leak or publicindication of the Government&apos;s position, in order not to prejudice thesuccess of the negotiations in Washington.

The complexities of the potentialchoice could not be adequately explained in any shorter period.Interested Ministers would contact the Secretary of State for Defenceon an individual basis, observing maximum discretion. TheSecretary of State for Defence would be discussing separately with theSecretary of State for Scotland the implications for the shorefacilities required.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office2 5 January 1982ZTOP SECRET
