SECRETCopy No | of 3 CopiesMOST CONFIDENTIAL RECORDTOCC(82) 20th CONCLUSIONSWednesday 28 April 1982FALKLANDISLANDSPreviousReference .CC(82) 17thConclusions,Minute 2The Cabinet had before them a Note by the Secretary of the Cabinet(C(82) 15) to which were attached draft proposals for a settlementtransmitted by the United States Secretary of State, Mr Haig, afterhis most recent visit to Argentina; and for comparison the earlierdraft agreed between him and British Ministers the previous week.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that thelatest proposals were in a number of important respects lesssatisfactory than the earlier draft.     The military withdrawal pro-visions were unbalanced; the interim regime envisaged wouldinvolve excessive Argentine representation on the local Councilsand might allow massive Argentine immigration; above all, thearrangements for the longer term were unacceptable since therewas insufficient prospect of self-determination.     Nevertheless itwas important to try to maintain the momentum of Mr Haig&apos;sattempt to secure a negotiated settlement, even though this wouldhave the unwelcome side-effect of preventing the United Statesopenly endorsing Britain&apos;s cause.     Any alternative negotiatingprocess would be worse from Britain&apos;s point of view.     He there-fore   intended to put forward counter-proposals.    He was alsopreparing a commentary on the existing draft which would exposeits weakness if it were ever published, which at present Mr Haigdid not wish it to be.     Meanwhile, the steady movement of theBritish Task Force towards the Falklands should serve tostrengthen Britain&apos;s position.In discussion, there was widespread agreement that the latestproposals would be seen as a sell-out of the Islanders. Whatevertheir wishes, they would not be allowed to retain their presentstatus.    Moreover the Argentines clearly wanted to flood theIslands with immigrants, so that even if there was a test of localopinion they would still be able to take over.    It was a matter ofparticular concern that they wished to control the police forceduring the interim period.    Nor was there any safeguard againsta second Argentine invasion some time in the future when theBritish Task Force had gone away.     For that reason the UnitedStates Government would need to be involved in guaranteeing theindependence of the Islands and the security of Stanley airfield.This underlined the importance of retaining American goodwill atthe present stage.1.SECRET
SECRETIn discussion of what would happen if Mr Haig&apos;s mission failed, itwas pointed out that the most obvious next move would be at theUnited Nations.     But action there would carry with it certaindangers.    It would not be possible to repeat the massive supportfor Britain which had produced the Security Council&apos;s ResolutionNo. 502.    If hostilities started, world opinion would very likelychange and there would be a series of hostile United Nationsresolutions; it might be possible to parry these for a short period,but in the end use of the British veto would be inevitable. Pressurwould grow for Britain to refrain from further hostilities and shewould be thrown on the defensive.    Referring the dispute to theInternational Court of Justice would be too risky because the politi-cal composition of the Court made success uncertain, howeverwatertight the objective legal case.    If a call for immediatereferral to the International Court were to be made, it couldprobably not be ignored; but agreement to it would have to be madedependent on the prior withdrawal of Argentine forces from theIslands.     The really decisive factor, if the Haig mission collapsedand no alternative could be found, would be the attitude of theUnited States.    If war was to be avoided, British policy would needto command continued American support.     British policy prior tothe invasion had been willing to contemplate a lease-back arrange-ment of some kind.     This might be held to weaken Britain&apos;spresent stand on sovereignty.     But it had always been made clearthat the acceptability of any such plan would remain subject to thewishes of the Islanders.     In practical terms, administrationmattered more than sovereignty; but the invasion had made theprospects of a lease-back arrangement much more difficult.In further discussion, the following points were made -a. Although the Argentines sought sovereigntyover the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the SouthSandwich Islands, the roots of British title differed ineach case.    It would be important to maintain thedistinction in any future negotiation; and to preservethe position of Britain&apos;s Antarctic Territory.b. It was vital to mobilise world opinion aswidely as possible against the illegal seizure of theFalkland Islands.     Support from Germany, Japanand Australia would be particularly valuable sincethey had close links with Argentina.c. The other members of the EuropeanCommunity (EC) had so far shown admirable solidaritywith Britain.     But they did not want war.     They wereworried by the spectre of Soviet involvement and bydivision and disunity in the non-Communist world.2SECRET
SECRETThere was also concern at the possible damage toUnited States prestige if the Haig mission failed.The continuance of sanctions could not be taken forgranted; and some EC members were consideringhow to extract tactical advantage from the presentsituation.d. There were many stages still to be gonethrough before the British Task Force would be onthe scene.     Public opinion would expect more fromnegotiations as it approached.     The Opposition inParliament were no less pledged to the principle ofself-determination than the Government. Maximummoral advantage should be sought from Argentina&apos;sstatus as an aggressor.e. The present Argentine regime was very elusiveto deal with.    Power resided at many levels. Itmight therefore take a very long time to achieve anegotiated settlement which would stick.     But the timeactually available for negotiation was limited. Oncethe British Task Force reached the Falklands areait could not be kept waiting.    Military action wouldbecome unavoidable.THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion,  said thatmaximum diplomatic, economic and military pressure would needto be exerted if the Argentine Government were to be brought toagree to a reasonable settlement.     The Foreign and CommonwealthSecretary would be visiting Washington on 22 April to discuss thoseaspects of the present draft which were unacceptable to Britain.Meanwhile it was important to preserve the confidentiality of thedraft proposals, and comment should be kept to a minimum. Shewould arrange for the Press to be told that the Cabinet had takenstock of the present position, particularly in the light of the latestproposals communicated by Mr Haig.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office7 June 1982SECRET
