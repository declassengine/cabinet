1. The Cabinefs attention was drawn to the terms of a motionwhich was to be put forward by the Opposition in the debate that day on the Eleventh Report of the Select Committee on Estimates.This, while inviting the House to accept the recommendations in theReport, expressed regret at the Governments delay in reorganisingthe Ministry of Agriculture and the County Agricultural ExecutiveCommittees so as to promote efficiency and achieve economy in public expenditure and man-power. The second part of this motion was ineffect a vote of censure, and. its combination with an acceptance:ofthe recommendations in the Report was somewhat embarrassing forthe Government supporters who had sighed the Report of theCommittee. The future work of the Estimates Committee wouldbe prejudiced if their Reports were to be made the subject of suchParty motions as these.The Chief Whip said that there would have been nothingunusual in the Opposition &apos;s tabling such a motion in Committee ofSupply; and it was because there were no further Supply Days thatthe Opposition had taken the opportunity of bringing this motionforward in the debate on the Report of the Estimates Committee.Objection could not, therefore, be taken to the motion on proceduralgrounds: he understood that the Minister of Agriculture wouldave no difficulty in making an effective reply on the merits.In further discussion the view was expressed that the SelectCommittee oh Estimates had recently tended to go beyond its properfunctions; and that Departmental officials were being required to spend a disproportionate amount of time in giving evidence before this Committee and the Public Accounts Committee. These weretendencies which should be carefully watched in the new Parliament.The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week. It was expected that parliament would be prorogued at the end of the week, on16th December; and that the new Session would be opened on24th January, 1950.On 15th December there would be an opportunity for twohalf-day debates on general subjects, and the Lord Presidentsuggested that one of these might be initiated by a Governmentsupporter. Possible subjects for debate were the development of joint consultation in industry, or the publication of annual accountsby political organisations. After discussion the Cabinet agreed thatthe second of these subjects should be chosen, and that arrangements should be made for a Government supporter to bring forward a motion urging that political Parties, and all other organisationshaving political action as one of their aims, should publish annuallyadequate statements of their accounts. It was further agreed thatthe Home Secretary should speak for the Government in this debate.Business in The Cabinet were informed that the House of Lords would bethe House of willing to modify their rules of procedure for the purpose of enablingLords. the Festival of Britain Bill and the Parliament Square Bill to pass into law before the end of the current Session. They would, however,be willing to do this only, if all opposition to these Bills were with-drawn. The Lord President said that he was still hopeful that theMiddlesex County Council might be persuaded to withdraw their opposition to the Parliament Square Bill. He recognised that, ifthey did not do so, it would not be possible to get the Bill passed before the Session ended.Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.38012-1 B 2
Industrial 2.   The President of the Board of Trade said that a draftOrganisation Order establishing a Development Council for the woollen industryand Develop- ha(i recently been laid before Parliament under the Industrialment Act, Organisation and Development Act, 1947. Before this draft had1947. been debated in either House, solicitors acting on behalf of certainDevelopment members of the Wool Textile Delegation had informed him that council Orders they were taking proceedings in the courts to challenge his right to for Woollen make the Order on the ground that, because it was opposed by theIndustry and employers in the industry, it was not desired &quot;by a substantialClothing number of persons engaged in the industry,&quot; as required by industry. section 1 (4) of the Act. There could be no doubt about the intentions of Parliament on this point; for during the proceedings on the Billit had been made clear that the Government must be free in thelast resort to impose a Development Council against the wishes ofone side of an industry. The Attorney-General had, however,advised that as a matter of statutory interpretation a case could bemade for the contrary view and might indeed succeed in the courtof first instance. Moreover, there was a risk that the House of Lordsmight refuse to approve the draft Order on the grounds that itsvalidity was sub judice, and the Government would be placed in an embarrassing situation if the court of first instance should subse-quently decide that the Order was ultra vires. It had therefore beendecided at a meeting of Ministers earlier that week that it wouldnot be advisable to ask Parliament to approve the draft Order forthe time being. In the meantime, however, the Financial Times&apos;ha,dpublished a statement to the effect that the legal proceedings wouldnot be started until it was known that the motion to approve thedraft Order was to be brought forward. The Government could not allow the establishment of a Development Council for the industryto be delayed indefinitely by such tactics, and it was for consideration whether the solicitors should be informed that Parliament wouldbe invited to approve the draft if a writ had not been issued by theend of that week. Alternatively, it would be possible to defer askingParliament to approve this draft Order until the courts had given a ruling in the similar proceedings which had now been initiatedagainst the Clothing Industry Development Council Order.It was the view of the Cabinet that it would be undesirable toenter into an arrangement with the solicitors on the lines suggested :political action should not appear to be governed in this way by a threat of legal proceedings. The proceedings on the ClothingIndustry Development Council Order would provide a suitable opportunity for testing the Ministers powers, and furtherParliamentary action on the Wool Textile Industry development council Order should be delayed until the courfs decision on thoseproceedings was known.The Cabinet Agreed that Parliament should not be asked to approve thedraft of the Wool Textile Industry Development CouncilOrder until the legal proceedings on the Clothing industry development Council Order had been concluded.Counoil ofEurope.(previous reference:C.M.(49)69thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. At their meeting on 1st December the Cabinet had agreedthat the United Kingdom Government should express theirdisapproval of the proposal that a meeting of the EconomicCommittee of the Assembly of the Council of Europe should be heldin Paris in December, and should take steps to persuade other european Governments to take a similar line. It had then been contemplated that a statement defining the Government^ attitude would  be  made  in  Parliament  on  5th  December;   but  that
statement had not in the event been made,; since it had by then become clear that few of the other Governments concerned would support the line which the Cabinet had wished to take. Itwas now known that, except for Greece, Turkey and perhapsNorway, all the other Governments concerned were unwilling to adhere to the view taken on this point by the Committee ofMinisters at their meeting on 3rd-5th November, and that their countries would in fact be represented at the meeting of theEconomic Committee in Paris, In these circumstances the foreign secretary now recommended that no further attempt should be madeto prevent the United Kingdom representatives on the Committeefrom attending this meeting, and that the Government should paythe expenses which they incurred in doing so; but that he should raise the matter at the next meeting of the Committee of ministers and protest against their failure to maintain their authority overthe business of the Assembly.In discussion it was pointed out that the Governments earlier decision on this matter had become known to a number of Membersof Parliament, and that it Would be regarded as a sign of weaknesson the Governments part if that decision were now reversed. TheGovernment could not expect to maintain their prestige and authority in the Council of Europe if they were seen to be pursuing a vacillating policy in a matter of this kind. Moreover, on the merits, it was still admitted to be highly inexpedient that thismeeting should be held in Paris at this particular time, when it couldnot fail to be a source of embarrassment to the Organisation for european Economic Co-operation. The Chancellor of the Exchequerattached special importance to this point.On the other side it was argued that the only ground on whichthe Government could have publicly justified their opposition to thismeeting was that it had been convened in contravention of the expressed views of the Committee of Ministers; and the force ofthat argument had been destroyed when it was found that almost allthe Governments represented on the Committee had abandoned that view and were proposing to send representatives to the meeting. Itwould doubtless have been preferable if the Foreign Office had beenable to ascertain the intentions of the other Governments before thematter came to the Cabinet on 1st December, and it was unfortunate that the Foreign Office had been unable to prevail upon them to adhere to the decision reached by the Committee of Ministers. But,as it now appeared that the meeting would be held and would be attended by representatives of most European countries, the UnitedKingdom Government had nothing to gain by persisting in a policyof disapproval which would not prevent the meeting from being held and would not have the support of any of the more importantEuropean Powers. Such an attitude was bound to expose theGovernment to the criticism, in this country and throughout Europe,that they were not giving their whole-hearted support to the Councilof Europe.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Foreign Office should pay the expenses incurred by United Kingdom members of the EconomicCommittee of the Assembly of the Council of Europe inattending the meeting of the Committee which was to beheld in Paris in December.(2) Took note that, at the next meeting of the Committee ofMinisters, the Foreign Secretary would make, a protest against the action of other Governments in departing from the decision which they had taken on this matter atthe Committee&apos;s previous meeting ou 3rd-5th November.
Employmentof communists and Fascists.SecretGovernmentContracts.(previous reference erence:CM. (49) 50thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. On 19th May the Cabinet had approved, subject to the viewsof the National Joint Advisory Council, the scheme outlined in cp. (49) 107 for excluding untrustworthy persons from participa-tion in secret Government Work undertaken by contractors. this had included provision for a general statement of policy, to be made before action was taken against any particular individual, and fora right of appeal to a special tribunal. On 28th July the cabinet had agreed that the introduction of the scheme should be deferredbecause of doubts expressed by the National Joint Advisory Council.The Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by the Minister ofDefence and the Minister of Labour (CP. (49) 233) reporting thatthe Council had expressed the considered view that the proposed statement of policy would provoke controversy out of all proportion to the issues involved, ana that the creation of a special appeal tribunal would cut across the established machinery for conciliationin industry. The Council therefore recommended that the Depart-ments concerned should proceed, without any general announcementof policy and without establishing any special rights of appeal, toremove untrustworthy individuals from participation in secretGovernment work by administrative action under the terms of their contracts, which empowered them to require contractors to remove from secret Government work any persons whom they regarded asunreliable.In discussion it was pointed out that, where an untrustworthyperson denied membership of a political party and ascertained thathe was being excluded from secret work at the request of the responsible Minister, the procedure preferred by employers and workers would provide no forum where the facts could be tested. Itwas, however, clear that both sides in industry were opposed to theappointment of any appeal tribunal which might seem to cut acrossthe established conciliation machinery. Both sides agreed that thesecurity of the State must be paramount, but considered that theresponsibility for safeguarding it must rest with the Government.If a suspected person were a member of a trade union, he could make representations through his union; but a technician might not be amember of any union and in such cases it might be represented inParliament that there were no safeguards for the individual. Theview of the Cabinet was that, if a Minister were pressed to indicate in what respects an individual was untrustworthy, he would be well advised to refuse to go beyond the general statement that he was satisfied that the individual could not safely be employed on secretGovernment work.It was stated in CP. (49) 233 that the Admiralty and theMinistry of Supply were the only Departments concerned with this problem. In discussion, however, it was pointed out that theMinistry of Works were also concerned in respect of contracts underthe atomic energy programme.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that, in view of the advice given by the national joint Advisory Council, there should be no general policystatement about the Government&apos;s intention to excludeuntrustworthy persons from employment on secretGovernment work undertaken by contractors, and thatthe proposal for a special appeal tribunal should be abandoned.(2) Agreed that, where the responsible Minister was satisfiedthat the removal of an Untrustworthy individual fromsecret work was essential, the Minister should request the firm, under the terms of their contract, to remove the manfrom secret wOrk.
Parliament.Eing&apos;s speech on Prorogation.(previous reference:C.M.(48)64thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (49) 243) covering a draft of The King&apos;s Speech onthe Prorogation of Parliament, which had been prepared by TheKing&apos;s Speeches Committee.In discussion various drafting amendments were suggested and approved.The Cabinet endorsed the view of the Committee that the Speechshould not include any reference to the establishment of the irish republic.The Cabinet-, Approved the draft Prorogation Speech annexed to cp. (49) 243, subject to the amendments agreed in discussion.Indonesia.Arms Embargo.(previous reference:CM. (49) 34thConclusions,Minute 5.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (49) 242) recommending that the embargo on thesupply of military equipment and training facilities to the Nether-lands Government should be discontinued.The embargo had originally been imposed in June 1947, onaccount of the outbreak of hostilities in Indonesia. Under the termsof the recent agreement reached at The Hague, the netherlands government had agreed to withdraw their forces from Indonesia,and withdrawal had already begun.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to inform the netherlands government that the United Kingdom authorities would no longer seek assurances about the destination of armsordered by them.(2) Agreed that no publicity should be given to this decision.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,8th December, 1949.
