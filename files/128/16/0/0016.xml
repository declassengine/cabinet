EconomicSituation.Discussion inParliament.(previous reference:C.M.(49)57tb.Conclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Cabinet considered the arrangements for handlingParliamentary discussion of the Governments further proposalsfor meeting the needs of the current economic situation.The Cabinet agreed that these proposals should be announced in a statement in the House of Commons on Monday, 24th October;and that it would be appropriate that this statement should be madeby the Prime Minister. They further agreed that it would be inexperienced-expedient that this statement should be debated on the same day; andthat the Government should offer facilities for a general debate inthe course of the following week. In the interval between thestatement and the debate the Prime Minister might make a non-political broadcast.EconomicSituation.Devaluation.(previous reference:CM. (49) 55thConclusions.)2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was to answer that afternoon a Parliamentary Question by Sir Waldron Smithers,M.P., asking how many Empire and foreign Governments he had consulted and informed, respectively, before he announced the deci;sion to devalue the pound. There would be no difficulty in giving a list of the Governments which had been informed of this decision.He was, however, in some doubt about the terms in which he should refer to the obligation to consult the Governments of France,Belgium and the Netherlands which we had assumed in the Mone-tary Agreements . concluded with those Governments. Specialcommunications had been made to those Governments, but it couldnot be said that there had been any formal consultation with them.After discussion the Cabinet agreed that the answer to thispart of the Question should be in the following terms : &quot; Communi-cations were made by His Majesty&apos;s Government Ho the Govern-ments of Belgium, France and the Netherlands in accordance withthe provisions for consultation in our Monetary Agreements withthose countries.&quot;Contracts ofService inEssentialIndustries.(previous reference:C.M.(49)21stConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofLabour (CP. (49) 192) on the enforcement of contracts of service inessential industries.The Minister of Labour recalled that earlier in the year, when there had been a number of unauthorised strikes or threats of strikes in electricity undertakings, the Cabinet had asked him toconsider whether there was a case for revising contracts of service inessential industries in order to make it clear that workers were under an obligation to fulfil such contracts, which could be enforcedif necessary by civil proceedings. He had looked into this question and was advised that, save in very exceptional circumstances, a court would not be prepared to order the specific performance of a contract of service or to grant an injunction to prevent a worker from taking up alternative employment. The only effective civil remedy forenforcing a contract of service was therefore an action for damages.But a master0 s right to sue a servant for damages for breach of contract of employment existed apart from any express provision inthe contract giving the employer such a right, and the insertion of aspecial provision in contracts of service enabling an employer to suea worker for damages would therefore be merely declaratory. Inthese circumstances no practical advantage would be gained by ageneral revision of contracts of service in essential industries on thelines contemplated, and he did not recommend that this suggestionshould be further pursued. In his view, a solution for the problemof unauthorised strikes should be sought through the developmentof the appropriate consultative machinery.
The Minister of Transport said that, while he was in agreementwith the conclusions reached by the Minister of Labour, he couldnot endorse the suggestion in the footnote to CP. (49) 192 that the disciplinary procedure provided by the Dock Workers (Regulationof Employment) Scheme, 1947, was in fact effective. The workingof this scheme was now being- reviewed by an inter-departmentavworking party. ..... .The Cabinet-Endorsed the conclusion in CP. (49) 192 that a solution forthe problem of unauthorised Strikes, should not be soughtthrough a general revision of contracts of service in essential industries.National 4.   On 30th June the Cabinet had invited the ForeignHealth Secretary, in consultation with the Minister of Health, to^considerService. what proposals might be submitted to the other Brussels PowersUse by regarding the grant of reciprocal facilities fqr medical and dentalForeigners. treatment.   The Cabinet had now before them :-(Previous CP. (49) 190: by the Minister of Health, oh the  use of the reference: National Health Service by foreigners and the possibilitiesCM. (49)43rd . of reciprocal arrangements with other countries;Conclusions, O.P. (49) 196: by the Minister of National Insurance, on the minute 8.) need to secure agreement to a Convention between the brussels Treaty Powers on the treatment of indigentnationals of any of the contracting countries, without,waiting for agreement on the wider problem of the medical treatment of resident or visiting foreigners;CP. (49) 206: by the Minister of Health, giving the text of theinformation about the National Health Service which wasmade available to foreigners when they came to thiscountry.The Minister of Health said that he was advised that the statu-tory obligation to provide the various facilities under the national health Service extended, not merely to British subjects, but to any.one in the country (including temporary foreign visitors) who wasin need of the Service. Clearly the resident foreigner had to beprovided for, and in relation to the visiting foreigner regard shpuldbe paid to the small size of the problem. It was believed that thecost of such services as were provided to foreign visitors would notexceed  200,000 in 1949-50. Arrangements had already beenmade, in consultation with the Home Office, to identify anyforeigners who manifestly came for the sole purpose of taking advantage of the National Health Service and they were refusedmedical or surgical treatment. He was in favour of continuing thepresent policy for the time being, taking all practicable measures to check abuses and, meanwhile, endeavouring to secure reciprocal arrangements with other countries, notably the Brussels treaty powers.In discussion, reference was made to the following points : (a) In Scotland a number of foreigners had come to Edinburghfor treatment by specialists before the National Health Servicecame into operation; and when they had received this treatment involuntary hospitals no charge had been made. It would be difficultto offer less favourable conditions under the National Health Ser-yice. Moreover, such statistics as were available did not suggestthat there was widespread use of the Service in Scotland by foreignvisitors. In the first year of the Service 1,860 foreigners had con-suited medical practitioners.   In July last, when a check had been
33CM. 59 (49)made, the dental service had been used by 34 persons,from abroad,including 3 British subjects and 10 foreign seamen, and only oneset of dentures had been given. In the same month there had been17 sight tests for persons from overseas, but no spectacles had beenfiven. It was estimated that about 150 foreign visitors had receivedospital treatment in the first year of the Service.(6) The Ministry of Pensions were directly responsible for providing artificial limbs, artificial eyes and invalid chairs under theNational Health Service. In eight such cases, appliances had beenprovided for foreigners and in six of these the provision was found,on investigation, to be open to criticism. There were some signs thatcitizens of the Irish Republic might be willing to travel to scotland in order to avail themselves of the National Health Service. Therewas also a danger that the export trade in artificial limbs might be prejudiced by foreigners coming here to be fitted with limbs at theexpense of the Exchequer.(c) The reference to the use of the National Health Service byforeigners in the general leaflet on the Service which was given toall foreigners who remained in this country for more than twenty-eight days was open to the objection that it gave unnecessaryprominence to the fact that the Health Service was available to foreigners and might be regarded as inviting foreigners to takeadvantage of its facilities. While it was no doubt desirable thatseamen should be encouraged to make use of the facilities, it was arguable that the ordinary visitor might be left to discover that hecould avail himself of the Service when he was sick and requiredmedical treatment., id) It was clear that in law the Health Ministers were under an obligation to provide facilities for everyone, whether Britishsubjects or resident, or visiting foreigners; and it was doubtfulwhether the Government were on sound legal ground in refusingmedical facilities to a foreigner who came for the purpose ofavailing himself of the Service. Moreover, although an immigration officer had complete discretion to grant or withhold leave to an aliento land in this country, if he made it a condition of landing that thealien was not to avail himself of certain of the facilities afforded by the National Health Service, he might be acting unconstitu-tionally by suspending in part the operation of the National health service Act, 1946.(e) There appeared to be a broad distinction between providingany urgent medical treatment which a foreign visitor might requireduring his stay in this country, and meeting long-term requirementssuch as dentures, spectacles, surgical appliances and artificial limbs.The first was a service which might reasonably be provided free of charge : the second was one which the Government could reasonablydecline to make available, without charge, to temporary visitors.(/) While all practicable steps should be taken to securereciprocal arrangements with other countries, in regard to health services, the negotiation of these arrangements would take a longtime and meanwhile there should be no delay in making progress with the draft convention about indigent foreigners, the text ofwhich was appended to OP. (49) 196.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Minister of Health, in the National Health. Service (Amendment) Bill or in a separate Bill, should take powers to restrict by order the extent to which persons not&apos; resident in this country could avail themselves of thefacilities of the National Health Service and, in appro-priate cases, to make charges for the use of certain of thosefacilities by such persons.
Political 5,   xbe Cabinet resumed their discussion of the memorandumActivities of    by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (49) 198) on the report ofCivil Servants, the Masterman Committee on political activities by civil servants.(Previous -.   &apos;     . . -..       .        1        &apos; &apos;iReference: The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had been con-.CM. (49) 58th sidering how he could meet the views expressed by his colleagues in conclusions, the Cabinet&apos;s earlier discussion on 13th October. In view of the minute 4.) categorical acceptance of the Committee&apos;s recommendations whichhe had announced, with Cabinet authority,, on 28th June, it wouldbe difficult for the Government to put forward now proposalsdeviating from those recommendations. He thought it would be preferable to bring into operation at once those of the recommenda-tions which allowed full political activity to the 450,000 civilservants below the line of demarcation proposed in the report, butto postpone a final decision on the remainder of the report until after the General Election. He therefore proposed that the national staff Side of the Whitley Council should be informed that, in viewof the difficulty of making permanent arrangements at the present -time, the Government were willing (i) to give effect forthwith to allthe recommendations of the report which involved the removal of restrictions on staff below the line of demarcation suggested in thereport; and (ii) to leave in force for the rest of the Civil Service, until after the General Election, the rules which applied before theMasterman Committee reported. This would mean that those notfreed from restrictions by the change proposed under (i) above would continue to be governed by the existing departmental rules, whichin general debarred civil servants from taking any prominent partin - political activities. It would also mean the temporarycontinuance of the existing Post Office rules, which allowed certainpolitical activities.(notably canvassing) by grades of staff who werenot to be wholly freed from restrictions by the recommendations ofthe report.In discussion it was suggested that this reference to the GeneralElection might be misunderstood, especially since so large a propor-tion of the political activity of civil servants was in local, ratherthan national, politics. It was agreed that it would be preferable to announce that staff who were not to be freed from these restrictionsentirely should continue to be governed by the existing rules untilthe end of 1950. -It was also suggested that less restrictive rules might be appliedforthwith to staff employed in the Post Office. The Chancellor ofthe Exchequer felt, however, that if any departure were made nowfrom the detailed recommendations of the Masterman Committee,the Government would be obliged to go into the merits of all their recommendations when they took the matter up again in 1951.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that effect jnight be given forthwith to all therecommendations of the Masterman report which would allow staff below the line of demarcation suggested inthe report to engage freely in political activities; andthat for the remainder of the Civil Service the existingrules and practice should continue to apply until the endof 1950.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for thedecision recorded in Conclusion (1) above to be communi-cated to the National Staff Side of the Whitley Councilbefore any public announcement was made.
35CM. 59 (49)House ofCommons(Service inHis Majesty&apos;forces) Act,1939.6. In connection with the discussion recorded in the preceding minute, the Minister of Defence raised the question of the conditions under which members of the Armed Forces might engage inpoliticalactivities, and referred in particular to the House of Commons(Service in His Majesty&apos;s Forces) Act, 1939, which enabled membersof the Armed Forces to sit in Parliament as a temporary war-timearrangement. This Act could be brought to an end by Order inCouncil, and it seemed desirable that it should be terminated with effect from the end of the present Parliament. Two serving officers were sitting as Conservative Members of Parliament by virtue ofthe operation of the Act.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Minister of Defence should arrange forthe necessary Order in Council to be made with a view toterminating, as from the end of the present Parliament,the operation of the House of Commons (Service in his majesty&apos;s ,]esty&apos;s Forces) Act, 1939.InternationalNorth-WestAtlanticFisheriesConvention.(previous reference:C.M.(49)4thConclusions,Minute 4.)7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Scotland and the Minister of Agriculture(CP. (49) 171) proposing that His Majesty&apos;s Government should accept the recommendations contained in the Final Act of theInternational North-West Atlantic Fisheries Conference held in washington in January-February 1949, and should ratify theConvention drawn up by the Conference.The Cabinet-Approved the recommendations made in CP. (49) 171.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,18th October, 1949.
