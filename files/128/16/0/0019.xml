Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in,the House of Commons in the following week.The Cabinet were informed that the Justices of the Peace Billshould have passed through all its stages in the House of Lords bythe middle of November. It was recognised that, in the time thenremaining before the end of the Session, it might not be possible topass a Bill pi; this importance and difficulty through all its stages in the House of Commons. It was, however, agreed that every effort should be made to get the Bill passed into law before the end of the session.Greece. .2.   The Foreign Secretary said that, as good progress had&apos;been(Previous       made with the reorganisation of the Greek army and as further reference:      outbreaks of* disorder now seemed less likely, this was a suitableC.M.(49)36th   moment at which to withdraw the British troops from Greece.  he conclusions,     had already conveyed to the United States Government a pre-Minute 4.)      liminarywarning that this possibility was being considered; andthis had unfortunately led to a premature disclosure of his proposal in the United States Press, where it had been wrongly represented as part of the Governments economy plans.    Subject to theCabmefs concurrence, he now proposed formally to notify theUnited States Government and other Commonwealth Governments,and thereafter the Greek Government, that the British troops in greece would shortly be withdrawn.The future of the Anglo-American Military Mission in Greeceshould be considered separately. Its future size would turn largely on the contribution which the Greek Government were prepared tomake towards its cost. He proposed in the first instance toascertain the views of the United States Government about thefuture of the Mission.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the British troops in Greece should now be withdrawn; and invited the Minister of Defence to makethe necessary arrangements.(2) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to notify this decision tothe Governments of the United States, the other Membersof the Commonwealth and Greece.Mr. J. R. 3    The Prime Minister said that the members Of the CabinetClynes. would share his great regret at the death of Mr. J. R. Clynes, whomMemorial they had known for so many years as a loyal colleague and a tirelessService. worker for the Labour movement. There would be many who wouldbe glad of an opportunity to attend a Memorial Service in hismemory; and he had enquired whether the Home Office were pro-posing to arrange for such a service to be held. He had beeninformed that, although the Scottish Office had arranged a memorial service for Mr. Joseph Westwood, the Home Office had never beforeassumed responsibility for arranging a Memorial Service for a- former Home Secretary and considered that it would be contraryto precedent for them to do so on this occasion.In discussion there was general agreement that, while it wouldbe appropriate that a Memorial Service should be held for mr. Clynes, it would be undesirable to seek to establish a presumption-tion that it was the duty of a Government Department to arrangeMemorial Services for its former Ministers. On the present occasionit would be more appropriate that the Trades Union Congress or theLabour Party should undertake the responsibility for arranging a memorial Service.
-     The Cabinet- )t . , %.Xu ,   tj. . j Matasihm.Invited the Chief Whip to ascertain whether the Trades&quot;Union Congress or the Labour Party would be prepared -totake the initiative in: arranging a ^Memorial Service for:i        Mr. J. R. Clynes.   .&apos;(^m^/x jte     feur;4.1 The Cabinet considered a memoranduih by&apos;the Ministerof Supply (CP. (49) 211) on the question whether&quot; the House ofCommons should be advised to insist on retaining in the Iron andSteel Bill the provision, now at issue between them and the Houseof Lords, which contemplated that the industry would be brought under public ownership on 1st May, 1950.    y    \- .a?onnThe Minister of Supply recalled that, Under the Bill as it left the House of Commons, the vesting date was to be 1st may; 1950^or such later date not more than eighteen months after the&apos; entry &quot;intoforce of the Act as the Minister might by order determine.;! It &apos;,:wa;s&apos;now evident that it would be quite impracticable to carry but:,thetransfer by 1st May, 1950, and the Minister would shortly be com-pelled to admit publicly that this was so. It would therefore be unrealistic for the House of Commons to insist on retaining this date in the Bill and, by so insisting, to make it impossible to reach any agreement with the Lords which would enable the Bill to be passed into law during the current Session. While he appreciated thepolitical difficulties involved, the Minister thought that the balanceof advantage lay on the side of deleting the date from the Bill andreaching some acceptable compromise with the Lords which wouldenable the Bill to become law before the end of the year.In the ensuing discussion it was argued, in favour of retainingthis date in the Bill, that when in their earlier discussions they hadresolved to join issue with the House of Lords on this point theCabinet had been aware that it would not in practice be possible totransfer the industry to public ownership by 1st May, 1950. Forthe Government now to withdraw from this position, which theyhad deliberately taken up, might be regarded as a capitulation to theHouse of Lords. Moreover, it might be construed as an admission that the Opposition were justified in their claim that this Bill shouldnot be passed until the electorate had had a further opportunity toexpress their views upon it. It might well be that it was impracticable-cable to bring the steel industry under public ownership before theGeneral Election; but it was politically important that the Govern-ment should be able to argue that the delay was due to the resistancewhich the House of Lords had offered to the passage of the Bill-There might be positive political advantages for the Government ifthe House of Lords rejected the Bill in the present Session and thereby delayed its passage until shortly before the Election.On the other side it was argued that the Government would beopen to criticism for insisting upon a vesting date which theyadmitted to be unrealisable in practice, and choosing to lose the Billthis Session rather than make any concession to the Lords on thispoint. Further, if the Bill, had to be passed for the second timeunder the- new Parliament Act procedure in the 1950 Session, an awkward situation might arise if the Lords on that occasionrefrained from rejecting it and merely delayed proceedings upon it until the end of the Session. In that event it might be necessaryto bring the Session to an end before the vesting date of 1st May,1950; since; for the reasons outlined in the Appendix to cp. (49) 211, it could not be assumed with certainty that the speaker would certify an amendment inserting a; date later than May, 1950, as an amendment &quot; necessary owing to the time whichhas elapsed&apos; since the date of the former Bill.&quot; This uncertaintywould greatly complicate the arrangement of parliamentary business, including essential financial business, in the 1950 Session.
55CM. 62 (49)From that point of view there would be advantages in arriving atsome agreement with the House of Lords which would allow the Billto be passed into law before the end of the current Session.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Prime Minister to arrange for a small group ofMinisters to examine the Parliamentary, considerationsarising from the question raised in C.P. (49) 211.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of this question when theresults of this further examination were available.Council ofEurope.(previous reference:C.M.(49)41stConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the foreign secretary (CP. (49) 200 and 204) on the work of the Council ofEurope at its first session.The Foreign Secretary said he had circulated with CP. (49) 200a comprehensive report on the first session of the Council of Europe.In CP. (49) 204 he had made detailed recommendations on future policy towards the Council and on the line to be taken on the specific proposals and resolutions adopted by the Consultative Assembly.The Assembly&apos;s recommendations on economic matters were dis-cussed separately in CP. (49) 203 (see Minute 6 below). In general,he thought that the United Kingdom Government should continueto support the Council of Europe and to play an active part in its development.. But it had been agreed that we should not involveourselves in the economic affairs of Europe beyond the point at whichwe could, if we so wished, disengage ourselves, and we should therefore treat with strict reserve any schemes for the pooling of sovereignty or for the establishment of European supra-nationalmachinery. Provided that our position was safeguarded in thisrespect; he thought it right to adopt a positive attitude towardsproposals for co-operation and his detailed recommendations on theresolutions of the Consultative Assembly were based on this principle. He thought it important to secure the early participation of the German Federal Republic in the work of the Council, andhe hoped he might be able to persuade the Committee of ministers to issue a statement to the effect that, if the German federal republic desired to be invited to join as an associate member and accepted the principles of the Statute, an invitation would be issued to it. It might be necessary to make a similar declaration in respectof the Saar in order to induce the French Government to acquiesce in the admission of Germany. &apos; He thought, however, that the issueof an invitation to Austria at this stage would seriously jeopardise the prospects of reaching early agreement with the Soviet Govern-ment on the Peace Treaty for Austria.In discussion the following points were made : (a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that theAssembly&apos;s resolutions on economic matters should be referred to governments with a view to action being taken on them through themachinery of the Organisation for European Economic Co-opera-tion. He thought it would be preferable to adopt this procedurerather than to refer these proposals back to the Assembly or to referthem for examination by a Sub-Committee of the Committee ofMinisters.There was general support for this suggestion.(b) The recommendations in paragraph 4 (d) of CP. (49) 204would be welcomed by the Consultative Assembly. The proposal that the Assembly should have a veto on new accessions had beeninspired by the fear that the Council of Ministers might invite Spainto become a member of the Council of Europe. If some assurance onthis point could be given, the proposal would not be pressed.(c) The French Government would be less likely to press their objections to the accession of the German Federal Republic if theAssembly&apos;s proposal for a special session was rejected.
(d) Some doubt was expressed whether it would be advisable tosupport the proposal for. the accession of the Saar. This mightcreate an embarrassing precedent for similar claims for the admis-sion of parts of other sovereign States; and it was, in any event,unreal to suppose that the Saar could ever become a full sovereignmember of the Council. Against this, it was argued that it wouldbe unwise altogether to exclude the possibility that the Saar might eventually achieve political independence while remainingintegrated economically with Trance under some form of customs union; and it need not therefore be assumed that, if admitted as anassociate member, she would be left permanently with that status.(e) There would be great difficulty in drafting a Human RightsConvention in a form generally acceptable to the members of the.Council. In the Assembiy&apos;s discussions on this subject,.a number&apos;of specific proposals had been made which would be unacceptable tothe United Kingdom Government.(/) Support should not be given to those proposals of theAssembly on cultural and scientific affairs which would involve the,duplication of existing bodies. I(g) In several of the countries of Western Europe there existeda state of political and social tension-which their present Govern-ments were unable to resolve; and the enthusiasm for the Councilof Europe was largely inspired by the feeling that a solution forthese conflicts could be found only through an appeal to someexternal authority. It was therefore important that we should notonly give every encouragement to projects for the political andeconomic integration of Western Europe, but should ourselves seek to make a constructive and positive contribution to it. In particularwe should not discourage those on whom fell the main burden of resistance to Communist pressure by pursuing a needlessly cautiouspolicy.On the other hand, it was agreed that the United Kingdom, byreason of its geographical position and of its political and economic relations with the Commonwealth and the United States, could not enter into any exclusive political or economic association withContinental countries. While, therefore, our policy must not benegative or unhelpful, it must take full account of the reservationsmentioned in CP. (49) 204.The Cabinet -(1) Took note of CP. (49) 200.&apos;(2) Subject to the point recorded in paragraph (a) above,approved the recommendations made in CP. (49) 204.Economic 6.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ForeignUnification      Secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (49) 203) on theof Europe.      policy which the United Kingdom Government should pursuetowards proposals for the further economic unification of Europe,and on the relation of the Organisation for European economic co-operation to the Council of Europe.Both these questions were likely to come up for discussion atthe forthcoming meetings of the Consultative Group of ministers and of the Council of the Organisation for European economic co-operation, and of the Committee of Ministers of the Council ofEurope. The Economic Policy Committee had agreed on26th January (E.P.C. (49) 5th Meeting/Minute 2) that the UnitedKingdom Government should not involve themselves in the economic affairs of Europe beyond the point from which they could, if they wished, withdraw; and it was suggested that the developments ofrecent months had confirmed the importance of adhering to thispolicy. In paragraph 8 of CP. (49) 203 an attempt had been madeto give greater precision to it by defining the risks which the Govern-ment ought not to run in co-operating with Europe in economic affairs, and the Cabinet were invited to endorse the views expressed
57cm. 62 (19)in that paragraph and in the general statement of policy already communicate to the United States Secretary of State as set out inparagraphs 5-10 of Annex B to CP. (49) 203. Approval was alsosought for the recommendation in Annex C that, while there shouldbe full collaboration between the Organisation for european economic Co-operation and the Council of Europe, this should beon a basis of equality and there should be no question of subordi-nating the Organisation to the Council.The Cabinet were in general agreement with the recommenda-tions made in CP. (49) 203. In discussion, the following points were made :-(a) The Minister of Defence said that, in considering proposalsfor closer European co-operation, full attention should be given totheir defence aspects. In order, to ensure that this point was notoverlooked, he suggested that paragraph 8 of CP. (49) 203 shouldbe amended to indicate that the Government would not be preparedto accept measures or proposals which might affect materially thesecurity or the war potential of the United Kingdom.The general view of Ministers was, however, that it would notbe advisable to adopt so far-reaching a reservation; and that, inany event, there was no prospect of any immediate threat to UnitedKingdom defence interests from European schemes for closereconomic union,(6) Attention was drawn to the pressing need for devisingmeasures to relieve the existing political and social tension in Italy.The position would be greatly eased if arrangements could be madefor an extensive emigration of Italians to France, and it was under-stood that this matter was under consideration by a Committee setup by the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation. Weshould also look to Italy for technicians and labour for the develop-ment of Africa. Italians were successful settlers and pioneers; andby invoking Italian aid in the economic development of Africa weshould go far to mitigate the political bitterness in Italy caused bythe loss of her Colonies. It was pointed out, however, that african opinion was still very hostile to the Italians, and in many areas sometime must elapse before the Italians could safely be employed. Thepreliminary surveys and investigations required in connection withthe major development projects had not yet been completed and nolarge demand for European labour had yet arisen.(c) It was proposed that other Commonwealth governments should be informed of the terms of the message communicated to theUnited States Secretary of State. Hitherto, no public announce-ment had been made of the principles governing our policy towardsErejects for closer economic union iri Western Europe, and it woulde advisable, after the forthcoming meetings in Paris, to considerwhether a statement on the subject should be made in the Mouse ofCoriimons. It was possible, however, that the Economic Co-opera-tion Administrator might press the Council of the organisation for European Economic Co-operation at their forthcoming meeting to commit themselves to an expression of views on this questionwhich would be incompatible with the special position of the UnitedKingdom, and in that Case it might be necessary for the Chancellorof the Exchequer to make a public statement at that meetingregarding the broad lines of our policy.The Cabinet-Approved the recommendations made in CP. (49) 203.
China:Recognitionof ChineseCommunistGovernment.(previous reference:CM. (49) 54thConclusions,Minute L)7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (49) 214) on the question of the recognition of theChinese Communist Government.The Foreign Secretary said that the Communist Governmentof the People&apos;s Republic of China had expressed a desire to enterinto diplomatic relations with foreign Powers; and the soviet union and their satellites had already accorded de jure recognition to that Government. The case for recognising the hew Governmentwas strong, but the first step must be to consult other commonwealth governments and the Governments of the United States and other friendly Powers. Until these consultations had taken place it wouldbe premature to take any decision regarding the date of recognition.Account must also be taken of the impact of recognition on UnitedKingdom interests in the Far East, and this could be discussed atthe forthcoming Conference at Singapore of His Majes&apos;ty&apos;s Repre-sentatives and Colonial Governors in South-East Asia and the far east. He hoped it would be possible to reach agreement on thismatter with the United States Government; and, if it should bedecided to recognise the new Government, he thought it would be important to ensure that the Indian Government took action at thesame time. In the meantime, he would feel bound to make it known that the recent statement on the subject made by the AustralianDeputy Prime Minister did not correctly represent the views of theUnited Kingdom Government. It would be unwise to seek to makerecognition conditional upon the fulfilment of specific obligations.In discussion, it was pointed out that de jure recognition ofthe Chinese Communist Government would create a special problem in Malaya, since there might be some disposition among the Chinesecommunity to assume that this would justify the cessation ofpunitive measures against the Communist bandits.The Cabinet Approved the recommendations made in CP. (49) 214.South-east asia and theFar East.(previous reference:C.M.(49)54thConclusions,Minute 1.)8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (49) 207) outlining the general policy which theUnited Kingdom Government should pursue in South-East Asia andthe Far East. If the proposed lines of policy were approved, theywould serve as a basis for the guidance of the forthcoming conference at Singapore of His Majesty&apos;s Representatives and colonial Governors in South-East Asia and the Far East.The Chancellor of the Exchequer hoped that nothing would besaid at this Conference to imply that this country would be ableto continue to give financial or material aid to South-East Asia onthe scale reached during the last few years. Commitments in respectof India, Pakistan, and to a lesser extent Burma and Ceylon, hadbeen running at the rate of  200 million a year, and the present economic position of this country made it necessary to make sub-stantial reductions in this expenditure in the future. This waspart of a general reduction of unrequited exports to. various partsof the world; and it involved as a corollary the agreement of theUnited States Government to an integrated overseas investmentpolicy. The extent to which the United States might be preparedto buttress the anti-Communist front in South-East Asia by under-taking capital investment had been discussed in a preliminary wayduring the recent Washington talks and had been referred to acommittee for detailed examination. It would shortly be necessary^to have further discussions on this subject with the United StatesGovernment.In discussion it was suggested that it should not be impracticable-cable to maintain the political influence of the United Kingdom^ inSouth-East Asia while arranging for the United States to providemuch of the capital investment that was required.   Conditions in
59 CM. 62 (49) 8$South-East Asia, and in certain other parts of the world, were now so uncertain that loans could probably not be secured through theordinary financial channels and large-scale capital investment by theUnited States Government might be &quot;required. The unfortunateexperience which the United States Government had had in Chinahad made them more receptive of suggestions for collaboration withthis country in Asiatic affairs on the basis that the United Kingdomprovided experience and the United States provided finance.The Cabinet ,(1) Approved the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposals in CP. (49) 207as a basis for the guidance of the Conference to be heldat Singapore, subject to any necessary modifications tomake clear the limited extent to which this country could undertake future financial commitments in South-East Asia.(2) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer wasreviewing the whole field of overseas investment policyand would endeavour to secure early agreement on thesubject with the United States Government.Pre-War 9.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ChancellorClaims of the Exchequer (CP. (49) 213) proposing that legislation shouldagainst be introduced during the current Session for the use of pre-warGermany.       German assets in the United Kingdom to pay a dividend on pre-warclaims on Germany by persons resident in the United Kingdom.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there was generalagreement that it4 would be advisable to postpone until the 1950Session the introduction of legislation for the distribution of certainRussian and Baltic assets among British claimants against Russiaand the Baltic States and of compensation by Czechoslovakia and yugoslavia for nationalised property. He had, however, promisedan early statement about the use to be made of pre-war german assets, totalling about  15 million, whieh were in the hands of theCustodian of Enemy Property. These assets could be paid into theExchequer, but there were strong arguments for making themavailable to the pre-war creditors of Germany, whose claims totalledabout  100- 120 million. The proposed Bill would set up anadministrator, with whom the final responsibility would lie, and arepresentative advisory committee. Creditors would have the optioneither of making claims against specific assets or of making a claimto a share of the general assets.There was general agreement that, in view of the precedentsand of the presumption which had arisen that these claimants would receive seme satisfaction, it was preferable to distribute these assetsamong the creditors rather than transfer them to the Exchequer.A staff rising from 100 to 200 in number would be required for handling the claims, but these administrative costs would be met from the assets.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals in paragraphs 4-6 of CP. (49) 213for the disposal of pre-war German assets in fhiacountry.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to bring the draftof a Bill on this subject before the Legislation committee with a view to consideration of its introduction duringthe current Session.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,27*A October, 1949.
