Private l.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the SecretaryInvestment of State for the Colonies (E.P.C. (49) 74) on the investment ofof Foreign foreign capital in the Colonies. They also had before them a capital. memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade (E.P.C(49) 92) covering a memorandum prepared in the Treasury onthe encouragement of United States private investment in theUnited Kingdom and the Colonies.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that president truman&apos;s &quot; Fourth Point &quot;had stimulated widespread interest inthe United States and elsewhere in the possibilities for investment in the Colonies, and there had been strong pressure both from private interests and from the Organisation for European economic co operation for an authoritative statement of the government&apos;s policy in this matter. In response to these requests, the draft statement annexed to E.p.G(49) 74 had been prepared in consulta-tion with Colonial Governments. He had hoped to make this inParliament before the Recess, but he accepted the suggestion inE.P.C. (49) 92 that any further public statement on this subject should be deferred until after the forthcoming discussions in washington on the general economic situation. He hoped that thiswould not prevent officials from giving a general indication ofUnited Kingdom policy, on the lines indicated in the draft, at theforthcoming meeting of the Overseas Territories Committee of theOrganisation for European Economic Co-operation.There was general agreement that it would not be advisable tomake any further public statement of policy on foreign investment in the United Kingdom or in the Colonies before the opening ofthe economic discussions in Washington in September; and that meanwhile, as suggested in E.P.C. (49) 92, there should be further consultations between the Departments concerned. This need not preclude the United Kingdom representatives on the overseas territories Committee from indicating our general policy on thisquestion.In further discussion, it was suggested that the draft annexed to E.P.G (49) 74 was needlessly long and technical, and also thatsome reference might with advantage be included to the question of. double income tax.The Cabinet-Agreed that no public statement on foreign investment inthe United Kingdom and the Colonies should be made before the forthcoming discussions in Washington.The Economic 2. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the economicSituation. situ^^on. They had before them memoranda by the President of(Previous the Board of Trade (CP. (49) 165 and 169) on interim measuresReference: which might be taken by the United States and Canada to ease the cm.

(49) 165 were generally within the competence of the Unitedn enm States Administration and did not require Congressional approval.e?s&quot;.r^f y The United States Government had already reduced somewhat them e a es. proportion of synthetic rubber required to be used by industry inthe United States and nothing further could profitably be said tothem on this point at the present time. His Majesty&apos;s ambassador in Washington should, however, make representations about the acceleration of stockpiling purchases, and should similarly follow up the talks which the Chancellor of the Exchequer had had withthe Secretary of the United States Treasury about features of UnitedStates tariff administration which hampered the United Kingdom37382-5 b 2
export drive and about drawings from the International monetary fund by India and countries similarly placed.   The question of&apos; a more flexible administration of the European Recovery programme and of loans from the International Monetary Fund to countries inreceipt of E.R.P. assistance should be raised with the economic co-operation Administrator (Mr. Hoffman) when he came to london in August. The New Zealand Government might be asked to enquireabout the possibility of loans from the Export-Import Bank in orderto prepare the way for discussion of this subject in Washington inSeptember.Substantial relief to current balance of payments difficulties would be secured if United Kingdom purchases of Canadian wheatcould be financed from E.R.P, funds. So far as concerned theEconomic Co-operation Administration, the matter would bediscussed with Mr. Hoffman next month; but the attitude of theUnited States Department of Agriculture was also important since,if they declared wheat to be a surplus commodity in the UnitedStates, it would not be possible for the Economic Co-operation administration to finance wheat bought elsewhere. It was under-stood that the United States Secretary for Agriculture would be visiting this country in August and.it would be useful if ministers could see him and endeavour to secure a sympathetic approach to theproblem.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the interim measures affecting the UnitedStates, set out in CP. (49) 165, should be handled on thelines indicated above.Future Trade The President of the Board of Trade said that there wouldRelations with clearly have to be frank discussions with the Canadian GovernmentCanada. about the long-term basis of trade between Canada and the sterling area. He was concerned, however, about the timing andthe method of broaching this question with the Canadian Govern-ment. It had not been mentioned to the Canadian Minister ofFinance during the recent Conference of Commonwealth finance ministers, and if an immediate approach were now made to the canadians about it they would suspect that there had been somesudden change of policy, or that there was some undisclosed reasonfor raising a matter which they had thought to be quiescent, at least until the September discussions. The Canadian Government were very well informed of the general facts of the situation; but theywere apt to ignore the extent to which sterling area countries were making it possible, by rationing their consumption of goods from theUnited States, for Canada to enjoy uncontrolled imports from theStates despite the deficit in their trading with the States.In discussion, there was general agreement that the aim shouldbe to induce the Canadian Government to begin considering, as early as practicable, their long-term trade relations with the sterling area. From this point of view it was undesirable that the matter should be left until the Chancellor of the Exchequer reachedWashington, or until official discussions took place immediately before the Washington talks. It would be necessary to explain tothe Canadian Government that, as existing contracts came to an end,progressively from the end of the year, it would be impossible forthe United Kingdom Government to renew them unless payment on future contracts could be accepted in sterling. Canada should alsobe persuaded to take imports from the Colonies in the West Indiesrather than from dollar sources. It might prove to be necessary toexpress our intentions for the future in emphatic terms, in order to impress upon the Canadian Government the seriousness of thiscountry&apos;s situation, The best course would be to recall the UnitedKingdom High Commissioner in Ottawa to London for consultation on the methods and timing for bringing these issues before theCanadian Government at a reasonably early date. This consultation
government expenditure.FutureProcedurecould also cover the steps to be taken in connection with the variousinterim measures which Canada might take (0,P. (49) 165).Attention was drawn to the statement in the treasury memorandum annexed to CP. (49) 169 that United Kingdom invest-ments in Canada totalled about $900 million and that in certaincontingencies it might be necessary to use these investments to enablethis country to continue to meet its contracts. There was generalagreement that it would be undesirable to mobilise these securitiesunless a long-term solution was iji sight, but it would be prudent to verify that the necessary action could be taken without legislation and to make plans ensuring that it could be taken quickly if need arose.The Cabinet (2) Agreed that an approach should he made to the canadian government before the Washington talks in Septemberabout the basis of Canada&apos;s long-term trade relations&apos; with the sterling area, and that the United kingdom high Commissioner in Ottawa should be recalled toLondon to advise on the manner in which the approach should be made, and on the handling of suggestions for interim measures which Canada might take.(3) Invited the Financial Secretary, Treasury, to examine whether the necessary powers existed, in case of need,to realise Canadian securities held in this country, andwhether the holders of these securities could be quicklyidentified.The Prime Minister said that the Economic Policy Committee,in the light of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on 28th July, would consider what reductions might be made in Government expenditure with-out prejudice to major Government policy, and he hoped that ministers would carefully consider the various suggestions made inthe Lord Presidents memorandum (CP. (49) 159). The Chancellorof the Exchequer, when presenting his Budget, had drawn iattentionto the importance of avoiding Supplementary Estimates and it was now more than ever necessary that Ministers should avoid incurringadditional expenditure and should also seek means of securingeconomy in the administration of existing policies. There was atendency for expenditure to continue on items which had lost theimportance and priority which they had once possessed. In adeveloping economy, faced with temporary difficulties, much couldbe done by delaying the expansion of necessary services. He pro-posed to issue instructions accordingly to all Ministers in charge of departments.In subsequent discussion, attention was drawn to the prospective-tive increase of Government expenditure, year by year, which wasentailed by the continuance of existing Government policies. this increased the need for a rigorous pruning of all less essentialexpenditure. Staff establishments tended to become unduly rigid andwere not reduced when the work on which they were engaged hadslackened or lost its importance.The Cabinet-(4) Took note that the Prime Minister would issue a memo-randum to his colleagues on the need for economy inGovernment expenditure, so that specific proposals tothis end could be considered by the Economic PolicyCommittee in September.In conclusion, the Prime Minister said that during the comingweeks there might be further developments in the economic situationwhich would call for urgent decisions. He was anxious to avoid,if possible, summoning emergency meetings of the Cabinet during august; for such meetings were apt to attract excessive publicity,which tended to enhance the atmosphere of crisis.   In the three
meetings which they had held during the week the Cabinet had madea comprehensive review of the economic situation, as a result ofwhich he was now fully informed of the general attitude of his cabinet colleagues towards the problems which might arise. He feltthat, in the light of these discussions, he would be able himself totake such further decisions as might be required during August,calling into consultation, as necessary, such Ministers as might be immediately available in or near London.The Cabinet agreed with the procedure proposed by the PrimeMinister.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,29th July, 1949.
