EconomicSituation.Publicity to industry. ;(previous reference:CM. (49) 57thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP. (49) 197) recommending that arrangements should be made for an immediate publicity campaign on the economicsituation directed towards both sides of industry.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that a new situation hadbeen created by the Washington discussions and the devaluation of sterling, and it was important that industry should not fail to takeadvantage of it. He nad therefore submitted to the production committee proposals for a comprehensive publicity campaigndesigned to secure a general recognition of the nature of the present emergency and the part which both sides of industry must play in meeting it. He had proposed that two national meetings ofemployers and trade unionists respectively should first be held inLondon, and that these should be followed by a series of privateconferences between the Production Ministers and representativesof a substantial list of industries. When this matter was discussed by the Production Committee, doubts had been expressed about theextent to which employers would be willing at the present time toco-operate with the Government in making such a campaignsuccessful. And in some preliminary talks which he had held since then with representatives of the employers&apos; organisations and theTrades Union Congress the idea of such a campaign had notcommended itself to either side. Subject, however, to furtherconsideration of the details on which he would wish to consult withthe Foreign Secretary and some of the Production Ministers he still thought that some publicity campaign of this kind should beundertaken.In discussion there was general agreement that industry shouldbe aroused to a fuller understanding of the facts and needs of thepresent economic situation, and that this publicity campaign shouldbe directed to the two sides of industry. It need not be assumed that individual employers would necessarily adopt the unco-opera--tive attitude of the representative associations.In further discussion, the following points were made : (a) Ministers should be prepared to indicate as precisely aspossible the part that each individual industry was expected to play in the present emergency. Neither employers nor workers wouldrespond to vague generalisations.(b) In some industries the progress so far achieved in estab-lishing Joint Production Committees had been disappointing, and every effort should be made to overcome the obstacles to the further development of those bodies. This lack of progress had been partly due to indifference on the part of the workers, and it was suggestedthat the title of the Committees gave a misleading impression oftheir scope and function. The Minister of Labour undertook to circulate a paper on this question.(c) Ministers taking part in the proposed discussions with industry would no doubt be pressed to explain the measures whichthe Government were taking to meet the current emergency.The Cabinet-Agreed in principle that the Government should launch anintensives publicity campaign on the economic situation,directed to both sides of. industry, and invited theChancellor of the Exchequer to discuss the details with theForeign Secretary and the Production Ministers mainly concerned.
Iron andami Bin.Messrs.Dorman Long.(previous reference:C.M.(49)49thConclusions,Minute 4.)Gold CoastConstitution.2. the Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister ef Supply (CPi (49) 195) about a proposal by Messrs:Ddrniah Long and Cbhipariy that the structural engineering aridchemical activities of the cbriipahy should be hived-off and remainin private ownership. The Socialisation of Industries Committee!after a preliminafy discussion, had decided that the issues involvedin this proposal slibuld be settled by the Cabinet.The Cabinet were infbrined that the company, under its ownname and through subsidiaries, was responsible for about 25 percent, of the structural engineering industry in Great Britain andthat it had subsidiary structural engineering companies in Africaahd in South America. It was not practicable tb separate off the african arid South American companies since they were largely dependent oil the parent company in Carrying oh their business.In f avbur of the proposal it was argued that, although it wasGovernment policy that iri selected industries State undertakingsmight operate in competition with private undertakings, it did not follow that the structural engineering business of Messrs. DormanLong should be taken Over fortuitously merely because it was linked with the iroii and steel undertaking. There might be some prejudiceabroad against the employment of Messrs. Dorriian Long onthe work of reorganising the basic irOn arid steel processes under public ownership, and it rriight be undesirable to burden them withdifficult overseas work. It Was not necessary to the successful operation of the Corporation that the Structural engineering assets of Messrs. Dorman Long should be transferred with the rest of theundertaking.It was, however, the general view of the Cabinet that the balanceof advantage lay in maintaining the integration Of Messrs. DormanLong arid iri bringing the entire Undertaking under public owner-ship. Detailed wdrk iri the overseas field would fall to the boardof the company rather than to the British Iron and steel corporation. It would be useful for the furtherance of the manylarge structural projects which were to be undertaken abroad under public auspices if the Government had under public control a largestructural engineering undertaking. While a public corporationriiight find some legal difficulties in operating branches in foreigncountries, it should not experience any such difficulties in tenderingfor contracts for work overseas. Public ownership in the field of structural engineering might lead to a reduction in the high level ofprices for structural engineering work and might also facilitate theintroduction of up-to-date constructional methods.The Cabinet--Agreed that the Minister of Supply should not consent tothe hiving-off Of the structural engineering and chemicalactivities of Messrs. Dorman Long and Company.3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies (CP. (49) 199) reporting the conclusions reached by a local Committee which had been appointed in January1949 to consider constitutional reform in the Gold Coast.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he was infavour of accepting the recoinmendations of this Committee subjectto three points : (i) He thought it impracticable to adopt the proposal&apos;for a bi-cameral legislature : he preferred the alternative suggestion of a single Chamber in which a third of the seats would be reservedfor Chiefs and elder statesmen, (ii) He considered that theExecutive Council must continue to be advisory to the Governor,rather than responsible to the House of Assembly, for so long as theultimate responsibility for the administration of the Colony rested with the Governor, (iii) In the absence of a Party system, he did.not regard it as practicable for the Leader of the House of Assembly
27CM. 58 (49)to be elected by that House and he proposed that the Leader shouldbe selected by the Executive Council.In discussion it was suggested that, as this constitution wouldnot provide full self-government, some undertaking might be given that it would be reviewed after a specified period of years. Thiswould be helpful in answering the sort of criticism which wasfrequently directed against our Colonial administration in inter-national discussions at the United Nations and elsewhere. It was,however, the general view of the Cabinet that such undertakingswere undesirable in principle : they were apt to have an unsettlingeffect on the local population, who were encouraged thereby to press for further constitutional reform instead of applying themselves tothe task of getting the best out of the constitution currently in force.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the recommendations in CP. (49) 199 regardingthe reform of the constitution of the Gold Coast.(2) Authorised the Secretary of State for the Colonies to publish the report of the Committee, together with astatement of the extent to which the government accepted its recommendations.66PoliticalActivities ofCivil Servants.(previous reference:C.M.(49)50thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (49) 198) recommending that, inspite of its unfavourable reception by certain Civil Service organisa-tions, effect should now be given to the report of the MastermanCommittee, which the Cabinet had accepted on 20th June.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that public comment onthe Governmenfs decision to accept the report had been almostentirely favourable, but some Civil Service organisations had beencritical. The Staff side of the Civil Service National whitley council had considered that the decision should not have been taken without consultation with the Council and had asked that the whole subject should be re-examined under the aegis of the Council andsettled by negotiation. If the Government now rejected some of therecommendations of the report, they could not refuse to discuss theother recommendations with the Civil Service organisations, andthis would be tantamount to re-examining the whole subject. Theadvantages of obtaining a report by an independent Committeewould then have been lost.In discussion it was pointed out that one of the main features of the report was that it would give political freedom to about450,000 civil servants who were at present subject to the rules governing the Civil Service as a whole. It now appeared, however,that, over part of the remainder of the field, the rules against active participation in political activities had not been fully observed, andthe Governmenfs proposal to apply the recommendations of thereport had caused considerable disquiet and dissatisfaction among those engaged in political activities, both national and local. Therewas a feeling that the Masterman Committee had taken too rigorousa line, more especially regarding the Post Office, where the rules inthe past had been less exacting than in the rest of the Civil Service.Moreover, the Post Office was a trading organisation which might conceivably have been organised as a public corporation to whichCivil Service rules did not apply. , One possible solution of thedifficulty would be to apply the Masterman recommendations to theCivil Service generally, but to leave the Post Office subject to its existing rules.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume at a further meeting their discussion ofthe proposals in CP. (49) 198.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,ISth October, 1949.
