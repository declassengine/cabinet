17CM. 37 (49)Parliament.Debate onEconomicSituation.(previous reference erence:C.M.(49)56thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Cabinet discussed, on the basis of a paper (CP. (49) 194)yby the Lord President and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, theterms of the Government motion to be tabled in the two Houses of1Parliament for the purpose of the forthcoming debates oh theeconomic situation.The Prime Minister said that he would prefer that this motion should be in somewhat broader terms than those proposed in cp. (49) 194, land he submitted an alternative draft for the con-sideration of his colleagues. In discussion various amendments were suggested and approved.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the motion to be tabled on behalf of the Govern-ment should be in the following terms: &quot;This Houseapproves the action taken by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin relation to the exchange value of the pound sterling;supports the measures agreed upon at Washington bythe Ministers of the United States, Canada and theUnited Kingdom, which are designed to assist in restor-ing equilibrium in the sterling-dollar balance of trade for the purpose of enabling the economy of the sterling area to maintain stability independent of external aid;and calls upon the people for their full co-operation withthe Government in achieving this aim, whilst maintain-ing full employment and safeguarding the social services.&quot;(2) Invited the Chief Whip to arrange for the terms of this motion to be communicated that afternoon to the leadersof the Opposition Parties, and thereafter to the Press.Civil Service 2.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that it had beenSalaries. intended to bring into operation progressively, from 1st October,(Previous       1949, the new scales of salary for senior civil servants which had reference:      been recommended by the Chorley Committee.  In present circum-C.M.(48)77th   stances, however, he had reached &quot;the conclusion that, in view of theConclusions,    need to avoid any increase in personal incomes following the de^Minute 6.)      valuation of sterling, the introduction of these salary increases should be postponed.  Subject to the Cabinefs concurrence, there-fore, he proposed to see that afternoon the representatives of theCivil Service Associations concerned and to inform them that theintroduction of the new scales must be postponed for the time being.He could not give any indication of the date on which it might bepossible to begin to bring them into operation; but he would under-take that the delay in introducing them would not be allowed to havethe effect of postponing the date (1st October, 1951) by which thenew scales were to be in full operation. Further, he intended thatthe pensions of senior civil servants retiring during the next fewyears should be calculated on the salaries which they would havebeen receiving if the new salary scales had been introduced from 1st October, 1949: for this purpose some legislation might benecessary.The Cabinet-Endorsed the proposals of the Chancellor of the Exchequer,as set out above, for postponing the introduction of the new scales of salary for senior civil servants.37645-3 B 2
Wages Policy.(previous reference:CM. (49) 56thConclusions,Minute 1.)&apos;3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by th&amp;;Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Labour (CP. (49).193) on&quot; the steps which should be taken to prevent general rises,in wages in consequence of the change in the value of sterling.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the main purpose of devaluation, viz., to increase the competitive power of United Kirig-dom exports, would be frustrated if there were any serious risein costs of production, including wages. The Government should therefore appeal to workers and employers in the strongest and most urgent terms to conform to the principles of the White Paper on personal Incomes, Costs and Prices. Industries in which wage rates were linked with movements in the cost-of-living index should be pressed to suspend the operation of those agreements. It seemednecessary, however, to allow wage increases for some categories of low-paid workers : the problem was how to distinguish such cases and where to draw the line. The whole question would have to bediscussed with representatives of the Trades Union Congress, andit was hoped to find an acceptable solution in agreement with them.One possible course would be to set up a new national tribunal whichwould consider all claims for increased wages in respect of poorly-paid workers. If this were not acceptable, these claims would haveto go through the existing negotiating machinery, though this might lead to lack of uniformity in dealing with applications. The pro-posed stand-still on wages would have to be balanced by a strongpolicy in relation to profits. He would make it clear in the debate in the House of Commons that, if firms failed to honour the voluntaryundertaking not to increase dividends, this arrangement would haveto be made compulsory at the time of next year&apos;s Budget. He also proposed to make a moderate increase, as from 1st October, in therate of profits tax on distributed profits.The Minister of Labour said that an endeavour should be madeto secure the agreement of the trade unions to the setting up of asingle national tribunal which would consider all applications for wage increases made on the ground that the existing wages did not provide for minimum subsistence. If such an agreement could bereached, legislation should not be necessary. He had not yet con-sidered in detail how such a body might be constituted, but it wouldhave to include representatives from both sides of industry, and therewas a large body of experienced men on whom the Government coulddraw in constituting the tribunal.In subsequent discussion, there was general agreement aboutthe urgent need for persuading the trade unions to accept a voluntarystand-still on wage increases. Applications for substantial wage increases were already being formulated on behalf of workers in theengineering and shipbuilding industries, and in coalmining, print-ing, furniture trades, boot arid shoe trades, railways, fire brigadesand the prison service, and also on behalf of teachers and clerical and executive grades in the Civil Service. These applications represented the beginning of a fresh cycle of wage increases. Devaluation, bythreatening some increase in the cost of living, had rendered evenmore urgent the need to secure that increases in wages were relatedmore closely to productive capacity. At present, increases in wages were being pressed, through the existing conciliation machinery,without sufficient regard to the inflationary pressure which theycreated. The stand-still agreement should .be such as to preventincreases in wages being granted, e.g:, in agriculture, where theGovernment had no control over the negotiating machinery and theunions might press their claims without sufficient regard for thenational interest: The agreement should also secure that increases in cost-of-living index should not lead to wage increases in industries where the index and the wage-rates were linked. There were atpresent 46 agreements of this character, covering one and a half million workers, of whom one million were in the building trades.
19CM. 57 (49)As things now stood, workers in the building trades would almost certainly be entitled to some increase in wages in February 1950,when an annual review of wages in the light of the cost-of-living index would take place. It would also be necessary to abandon anyattempts to secure workers for under-manned industries by increas-ing rates of wages. The stand-still would, however, apply to ratesof wages and not to earnings, and individuals would still be ableto earn more by working.harder or longer. It should be made clearthat the stand-still applied to those engaged in services such asteaching or local government administration, as well as to workersin productive industry. The decision to postpone the introduction ofthe new salary scales for senior civil servants would make it easier to maintain existing rates in the rest of the Civil Service and in local government.Doubt was expressed whether any period should be set for the stand-still on wages. The mention of an initial period of nine months might be regarded as merely a device to tide matters over until after the general election, and might also encourage a spateof applications at the end of that time. It would be preferable toarrange with the trade unions that the general position of wages and production would be reviewed at intervals, say, of six months.Ministers next discussed the implications of the proposal thatpoorly-paid workers should be entitled in exceptional circumstances to obtain increases in wages. It was recognised that it would bedifficult to administer this scheme without moving towards the ideaof a national minimum wage. Any tribunal or tribunals which hadto consider applications for increases made on this ground would be obliged to have some minimum figure in mind above which applica-tions would not be entertained : otherwise they might be swampedwith applications from the lower-paid workers in many industriesirrespective of the actual amounts which these workers received.At the same time there were obvious dangers in adopting a national minimum wage. It might set a standard for rates of pensions and national assistance allowances which would prove an intolerableburden on the Exchequer. Furthermore, distinctions could properly be drawn between different parts of the country and between townand country for examplej the minimum wage of an agriculturalworker might reasonably be set below the minimum subsistence wagein towns, since the agricultural worker could live more cheaply.Applications should relate to actual earnings, and not to formalminimum rates which might have little relation to average earnings.Any general rise in the wages of unskilled workers would lead togreat pressure from skilled workers fbr the maintenance of the differential, especially in engineering, where skilled workers already received wages which in some cases were no better than those paidto unskilled workers.There was general agreement that, as proposed in CP. (49) 193,Ministers should not finally decide how any concession in favour offorthcoming discussion with representatives of the Trades UnionCongress. If all applications could, by voluntary agreement, beconsidered by a single national tribunal, greater uniformity in administration would be secured; but, unless this plan commandedgeneral acceptance, there was a danger that industrial unrest mightbe caused by the apparent setting aside of conciliation machinery which in many industries had been developed over many years.There was also general agreement that the proposed increasein the rate of profits tax on distributed profits was essential in orderto secure general agreement to the wages stand-still. Otherwise itwould be argued that the Government were freezing wages while leaving employers free to secure the enhanced profits which in certain industries would follow from devaluation. Some concern was expressed lest the increase in the rate of profits tax should blunt thepoorly-paid workersadministered in advance of the
enthusiasm of those firms which it was hoped to induce to enter theAmerican market; but it was pointed out that only a moderateincrease in the rate of tax was proposed, that this increase would operate uniformly over all industries and that those firms whichwere able to enter the American markets effectively would securemuch larger benefits than they were likely to lose through theoperation of the tax.The Cabinet next considered whether some of the revenuesecured from the increase in profits tax should be used to increase therate of family allowances. An increase from 5s. to 6s. a week perchild would cost  10 million a year. The increased price of breadwould bear most hardly on those with large families, and wage-earners might find a stand-still on wages more palatable if it were accompanied by some increase in family allowances. Against this,it was argued that it was undesirable to offer increased social services at a time when the people were being called upon for special efforts in consequence of devaluation. If the Government desired to lessenits effect on the lower income groups, this would not be secured by increasing the rate of family allowances, since those allowances were paid to all classes of the community. The rate of family allowances would come up for review when the question of equal pay for menand women had next to be examined, and there was something to besaid for leaving the rate untouched until that time. If the TradesUnion Congress attached great importance to increases in family allowances (it was not thought that they would), the position couldbe re-examined.Attention was drawn to the importance of further education of the public on the significance of the country&apos;s economic situationand the need to exercise restraint in demands for increases in personal incomes. The strong pressure from wage-earners for thewages increases which were at present being put forward in various industries showed how little understanding there was of the truefacts of the country&apos;s economic situation.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Government should appeal to workers and employers in the strongest terms to agree to a generalstand-still on wages and that, while arrangements shouldbe made for periodical reviews of the position, no fixed period should be set for the stand-still.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerof Labour, together with the Ministers of Health and education, to discuss with representatives of the TradesUnion Congress the alternative procedures under which,in exceptional circumstances, increases in wages mightbe granted during the period of the stand-still to poorly-paid workers.(3) Agreed that there should be a moderate increase in the rateof profits tax on distributed profits, and that anannouncement to this effect should be made by theChancellor of the Exchequer in opening the Commons&apos;debate on Tuesday, 27th September.(4) Agreed that there should be no increase in the rate of family allowances, subject to further discussion of the matterif the Trades Union Congress should press for such a concession.(5) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to submit amemorandum on the steps which he proposed to take tomake the public more fully aware of the country&apos;economic situation and of the need for restraint indemands for increases in personal incomes.
21CM. 57 (49)Trade with canada.(previous reference:CM. (49) 52ndConclusions,Minute 2.)4. In the course of the discussion recorded in the preceding minute reference was made to the Cabinefs earlier decision onCanada&apos;s long-term trade relations with the sterling area. Was it proposed that the Cabinet should review this question in the lightof the recent discussions in Washington 1It was explained that the Foreign Secretary intended to suggest to the Canadian Government, during his visit to Ottawa, that thereshould be some reduction in the price of wheat imported into thiscountry from Canada. This would be an appropriate preliminary to any discussion of the wider issue of Canada&apos;s long-term tradewith the sterling area.Industrial 5.   The Lord President said that he would be glad to have the disputes. advice of his colleagues whether, in view of the unofficial strike of unofficial some workers at Olympia, he should carry out his engagement to strike at        open the radio exhibition there.Radiolympia. It wag ^ yiew of ^ cabinet that the Lord President shouldnot cancel his engagement to open Radiolympia and that, if the preparations for the opening of the exhibition had not beencompleted on account of the strike, he might properly express regret that an exhibition of such importance to the export trade should havebeen hampered by this irresponsible action on the part of some of theworkers.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,2Qth September, 1949.
