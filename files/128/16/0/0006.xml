1. The Minister of Agriculture recalled that the production committee had decided on 5th May (P.C. (49) 11th Meeting) to defer a decision on the proposal in P.C. (49) 46 that 480,000 tonsof animal feeding-stuffs should be allocated in 1949-50 to provide,rations for calves over six months old. Since then, however, thesupply prospects for 1949-50 had greatly improved as the result ofthe successful conclusion of the Argentine Trade and payments agreement and the provisional Russian grain contract. he therefore thought that a decision could safely be taken to make aspecial issue of rations for calves as proposed in P.C. (49) 46 andfor cows due to calve in the autumn. These issues would not involve any dollar expenditure and would be limited to the current rationyear. If his proposals were approved, he would announce thedecision in Parliament before the Recess.The Minister of Food said that he supported these proposals.The Cabinet agreed that special ration issues of animal feeding-stuffs should be made in 1949-50 as proposed by the Minister ofAgriculture, on the understanding that it would be made clear inthe announcement that no additional dollar expenditure would be incurred.In further discussion, the following points were made: (a) In view of our dependence on dollar wheat, would it notbe appropriate at this stage to review the arrangement by whichfarmers were allowed to retain 20 per cent, of their millable wheat for feeding to animals ? It was pointed out, in reply, that farmershad not in practice retained so nigh a proportion of their wheat,and that they were unlikely to do so while prices remained at theirpresent level.(&amp;) It was suggested that the deterioration in our dollar balance,of payments made it necessary to expand wheat production even atthe cost of coarse grains; and Ministers were informed that theagricultural expansion programme was being re-examined from thispoint of view.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals made by the Minister of Agri-culture for a special issue of rations for calves oversix months old and for cows due to calve in the autumn,,on the understanding that no additional dollar expendi-ture would be incurred.(2) Invited the Minister of Agriculture to consult with theEconomic Secretary, Treasury, regarding the terms inwhich this decision should be announced.Food.animal feeding-stuffs.(previous reference:CM.

(49) 16thConclusions,Minute 3.)The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of  fence (CP. (49) 161) on the provision of married quarters forthe Armed Forces.This proposed that legislative powers should be taken to enablethe Treasury to lend money from the Consolidated Fund for theconstruction of married quarters. The Chancellor of the exchequer had stipulated that money should be borrowed in this way only in areas where, on a reasonable estimate, the houses could be used bycivilians if the Service demand were reduced or extinguished.The Cabinet-Approved the recommendation made in CP.

Royal 3.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofOrdnanoe Supply (CP. (49) 156) on the increase in abstenteeism in the RoyalFactories: Ordnance Factories since the introduction of a scheme of paid sick-Absenteeism,   leave for Government industrial employees.(Previous Minister of Supply said that his Department employed no reference:      more tnan \q per cent. of the industrials in Government service,CM. (49)40th   but they had more complete statistics of absenteeism than some otherConclusions,     Departments.   He understood there had also been a serious rise in minute 3.)      absenteeism in Admiralty establishments since the introduction ofthe scheme of paid sick-leave.   Among Royal Ordnance Factoriesthe position was worse in the factories in development areas,particularly in South Wales, and the percentage of absenteeism was higher among employees on time rates than among those on piecerates.    In an old establishment,  such as Woolwich Arsenal,involuntary absenteeism was comparatively low, whereas in theRoyal Ordnance Factory at Glascoed in South Wales in May last ithad been as high as 16-5 per cent.  In some areas the extent of theabsenteeism from Royal Ordnance Factories on sickness grounds was having a bad effect on employees in neighbouring factories.The Minister of National Insurance said that the medicalcertificates in these cases were provided on a form supplied by hisMinistry. The Ministry of National Insurance did not employ a staff of doctors; and, if they were in doubt about a certificate, theyarranged for the claimant to be examined by the Regional medical officer of the Ministry of Health, to whom reference was also made if an illness appeared to be lasting for a prolonged period. In viewof the large number of claims which the Ministry of national insurance had to handle each week, it was only possible to scrutinisesample cases. Absenteeism tended to be higher where wages were paid during sickness than where a sick person was dependent on ordinary benefit.In subsequent discussion there was general agreement that thefundamental defect of the scheme of paid sick-leave introduced inSeptember 1948 was that in many cases a man would receive more money when he was sick than when he was at work, owing to repay-ment of income tax during sickness, a saving in travelling expenses and other reasons. All experience went to show that no adequate safeguards could be devised to prevent the abuse of schemes in whichit was more profitable to be sick than to be at work. The schemealso appeared to encourage the prolongation of absence for minorailments. The question of its continuance in its present form wouldhave to be carefully considered when it became due for review in 1950.As regards action which might be taken meanwhile, there was general agreement that the Minister of Supply should proceed withnfo pi&amp;Ei&apos;ftp&apos;arranging for one of his Parliamentary Secretaries anda trade union representative to address meetings of work-people onthe subject. Steps which had already been taken to enlist theco-operation of the trade unions through the Ministry of SupplyJoint Industrial Council and the Joint Co-ordinating Committeefor Government Industrial Establishments should also be energeti-cally pursued. While medical certification in connection with government industrial employees could not depart very far from thegeneral standard throughout the country, the Minister of Healthsuggested that a special scrutiny should be undertaken of the medicalcertificates granted in respect of employees in Royal OrdnanceFactories. The Medical Research Council had undertaken somework at Glascoed on the subject of absence through sickness, theresults of which might be of value to the Ministry of Supply.Meantime, a working party of officials should review the operationof the scheme of paid sick-leave among Government industrials tosee whether further action could be recommended.    This review
should cover the extent to which the repayment of income taxaffected the situation.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the action proposed by the Minister of Supply inparagraph 12 of CP. (49) 156, designed to educate work-people in Royal Ordnance Factories to a sense of their responsibilities in regard to the scheme of paid sick-leave.(2) Agreed that the Minister of Health, in conjunction with theMinister of National Insurance and the Minister ofSupply, should take such measures as were practicable to tighten up medical certification in respect of workers at Royal Ordnance Factories.(3) Invited the Prime Minister to arrange for the appointmentof a working party of officials to consider what further action might be taken to prevent abuse of the scheme ofpaid sick-leave for Government industrial employees.Iron andSteel Bill.(previous reference:CM. (49) 47thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Supply (CP. (49) 168) suggesting that, if the date forthe vesting of assets was left in the Iron and Steel Bill this Sessionas 1st May, 1950, the provisions of the Parliament Act might makeit necessary to retain this date in the Bill if it had to be reintroducednext Session. If, in fact, the Bill next Session did not receive theRoyal Assent until a date later than 1st May, 1950, the vestingprovisions might fail to operate. He therefore suggested that theinterchanges between the two Houses should be adjourned until theautumn, so that the legal position and the alternative courses opento the Government might be more fully examined.In discussion the view was expressed that the Speaker mightbe prepared to allow a rather later date than 1st May, 1950, to beinserted in the Bill next Session, without thereby depriving the bill of the protection of the Parliament Act. The position was,however, complicated and required further examination. TheGovernment were not publicly committed to completing before the summer Recess the interchanges between the two Houses on the lords&apos; Amendments.The Cabinet-Agreed that, as suggested by the Minister of Supply in cp. (49) 168, consideration by the House of Commons ofthe Lords&apos; insistence on certain amendments should be deferred until after the Summer Recesss.BritishNationalityLaw.deportation of BritishSubjects.(previous reference:CM.(49)46thConclusions,Minute 7.)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (49) 164) on the question whether power should betaken to permit the deportation from the United Kingdom of Britishsubjects who, not being United Kingdom citizens, engage insubversive activities in this country.The following were among the main considerations putforward, in the Cabinets discussion, against taking such a power : (a) It was a time-honoured principle of British law that the possession of British nationality should carry with it the right toenter and reside in British territory. It was true that significantdepartures from this principle had been made by the other independent members of the Commonwealth, and by some of theColonies, who had taken power to control the entry into their
territory of British subjects from other parts of the Commonwealth.But the United Kingdom was still widely regarded as the mother country, or at least the hub, of the Commonwealth; and, from thepoint of view of Commonwealth relations, it would be a serious matter to restrict the right of British subjects from other parts ofthe Commonwealth to enter and reside in this country.(6) Under the scheme of the British Nationality Act, 1948,there was a single citizenship for the United Kingdom and theColonies. It would be indefensible that powers of deportation fromthis country should be applicable to British subjects who werecitizens of the independent members of the Commonwealth, but notapplicable to British subjects from the Colonies. But power to deport the latter could not be taken without disrupting the schemeof citizenship under the Act of 1948.(c) Under the Aliens Order, 1920, the Home Secretary had power to deport an alien if he was satisfied that his continuedpresence in this country was not conducive to the public good.Parliament would be unwilling to concede such a wide discretionarypower to deport British subjects belonging to other parts of theCommonwealth. But experience in the administration of the aliens Order, and of the powers of internment conferred by regulation 18B of the Defence Regulations, had shown how greatwere the difficulties of stating specific reasons for an administrativedecision restricting the liberties of an individual engaged insubversive activities, or of providing a right of appeal against sucha decision.(d) The suggestion that these powers should be taken arose from the activities of Canadian seamen in fomenting the recentstrike in the London docks. Irritation at the activities of theseindividuals, however justified, should not be made the basis for toohasty a decision to modify what had for many years been one of thefundamental principles of British nationality law.On the other side, it was pointed out that there were strong reasons why the Government should not close their minds to thepossibility of making some change in the law : (e) The restrictive legislation, which had been introduced onthis subject by the Governments of other Commonwealth countries was justified on the grounds that they were countries of immigra-tion. Was it to be assumed that the United Kingdom would continue to be primarily a country of emigration? Might not ourhigher standards of living begin to attract immigrants from otherparts of the Commonwealth, especially the Colonies? There hadalready been signs of such a movement from the West Indies. Mightit not become necessary for us to regulate such movements ?(/) Was there not also some risk that the Communists mightlearn to take advantage of the fadS^^it Coismunist agitators whowere British subjects from other parts of the Commonwealth couldnot be deported from the United Kingdom ?(g) The recent dock strikes, which had been fomented byCanadian Communists, had inflicted serious economic loss upon thiscountry. Were not the Government entitled to protect themselves against the repetition of such incidents ?(h) Whatever view might be taken of legislation restricting the immigration into this country of British subjects from other partsof the Commonwealth, was it necessarily inconsistent with thegeneral principles outlined in CP. (49) 164 to take a power to deportan individual who. was engaged in subversive activities ?The Cabinet-(1). Agreed to defer for the time being their consideration ofthe issues raised by CP. (49) 164.
InternationalWhalingCommission.(2) Invited the Home Secretary, in dealing meanwhile with the&quot;Parliamentary Questions which were to be addressed tohim on this subject, to take the general line that these suggestions opened up far-reaching issues on which hewas not prepared to make any final pronouncement atthe present time.6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Scotland and the Minister of Agriculture (CP. (49) 162)reporting certain resolutions passed at the first meeting of theInternational Whaling Commission held in London from 30th may to 7th June. These resolutions were designed to amend theprovisions of the International Convention of 1946 for the regula-tion of whaling.The Cabinet-Approved the amendments of the International convention of 1946 set out in the Appendix to CP. (49) 162.Cabinet27thOffice, S.W. 1July, 1949.
