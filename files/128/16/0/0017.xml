Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Opposition leaders were urging that the debate on theeconomic situation should take place soon after the Prime ministers statement on 24th October, and in all the circumstances it seemedpreferable that this debate should be held on 26th and 27th October.The Opposition^ suggestion of a three-day debate should be resisted. Since some of the economic measures proposed wouldrequire legislation, the debate could not take place on the Adjourn-ment and would have to be held on a Motion by the Government orby the Opposition. The offer of an early debate would make it less likely that objection would be raised to the Prime Minister&apos;s makingthe original announcement as a statement after Questions.The Prime Minister, would broadcast after the 9 o&apos;clock news on26th October.The Second Reading of the Parliament Bill would have to be postponed from 27th October to a later date, and it would benecessary to ensure that the Bill, in this its final Session, reachedthe House of Lords one month before the end of the Session.Housing. 2.   The Minister of Health said that in a ParliamentaryLocal Question that day by Mr. Piratin, M.P., he was to be asked when heAuthorities&apos;     proposed to publish the information which he had collected fromWaiting Lists,   local authorities about their waiting lists for houses.    He had(Previous       promised to make available figures resulting from a circular which reference:      his Department had sent out in the previous year.  Although everyCM. (49) 39th   endeavour had been made to check the returns, by cutting out theConclusions,    duplication of individual applications and by test checks of realMinute 4.)      needs in selected areas, the figures appeared to show that one millionfamilies in this country were without separate homes, and that600,000 families with separate homes were in need of largeraccommodation.    The  publication  of  these figures would  be politically embarrassing, especially at the present time.In discussion it was pointed out that, under the existingdefinition of a separate home for housing purposes, many familieswould be regarded as being without a separate home whenthey were living in circumstances which had been accepted for agreat many years. Although a house might not have been dividedup for rating purposes, it might nevertheless have housed two ormore families for many years under conditions which they regardedas providing separate accommodation, though they would prefer tohave the improved standard of housing provided by separate council houses. Scottish experience in publishing figures of this kindshowed that it tended to saddle the Government with responsibilityfor failing to deal in four years with a state of affairs which had existed for several generations.The Minister of Health said that in view of the opinions expressed in the discussion he would certainly delay publication ofthe results of these returns. He would also consider whether&apos; hecould not withhold publication altogether, on the ground that thefigures as they stood gave a misleading picture of the situation andthat the true facts could not be ascertained without a comprehensivehouse-to-house survey, which would involve an expenditure of money and man-power which could not be justified at the present time. Hewould give a temporising reply to Mr. Piratin&apos;s Question, and would put before the Cabinet at a later meeting proposals for a consideredParliamentary statement on this subject.The Cabinet-Took note that the Minister of Health would delay publica-tion of the information collected from local authoritiesabout their waiting lists for houses, and would considerwhether publication of this information could not be with-held indefinitely.
united nations.Election toSecurityCouncil.3.   The Foreign Secretary said that serious international difficulties were arising from the question whether the vacancy onthe Security Council which was to be filled from the Eastern Blocshould go to Czechoslovakia or to Yugoslavia, but he saw no reasonso far to alter the policy which he had been pursuing.   When the charter of the United Nations was under examination before theSan Francisco Conference there had been much discussion about the composition of the Security Council.  While there were no specificprovisions in the Charter, other than a reference to equitablegeographical distribution, there was an understanding that russia would have two representatives in the Council and that two wouldbe drawn from the British Commonwealth. Russia had never madedifficulties about the second representative from the Commonwealth,and the United Kingdom Government had always supported the nomination of a State from the Eastern Bloc.  When it had been indicated that the United States would support the candidature of yugoslavia he had felt that this was hardly a suitable occasion for seeking a quarrel with Russia, more particularly since the other commonwealth countries had indicated that, for the sake of Common-wealth representation on the Security Council and other reasons,they wished to stand by past precedent in the matter. Furthermore,while this country had done much in the economic sphere to helpMarshal Tito to maintain his position, support of the Yugoslavcandidature for the Security Council might be interpreted, as implying that Marshal Tito might be backed in any politicalmanoeuvres he might make in the Balkans, and it was clear that neither the United States nor this country would find it possible tosupport him if he took steps which, however disguised, had theeffect of improving his position in the Balkans at the expense of hisneighbours and led to positive action on the part of Russia.  It now appeared, however, that the South American States and otherswould strongly support the candidature of Yugoslavia, and some uncertainty was developing in Australia^ attitude on the question.If it became clear that neither Czechoslovakia nor Yugoslavia would secure the necessary two-thirds majority, the position would haveto be reviewed; but he had instructed the United Kingdom Delega-tion to maintain until then their support of Czechoslovakia^candidature.There was general support for the policy which the foreign secretary was pursuing. Support for Yugoslavia on this issuemight provoke Russia to play off one member of the Commonwealthagainst another when the question of Commonwealth representationarose. The Minister of Health felt, however, that the importanceof encouraging Yugoslavia in her stand against Russian dominationwas so great that it provided an overriding reason for supportingher candidature for this seat on the Security Council.The Cabinet-Agreed that the United Kingdom Delegation at the united nations should continue to support the candidature of czechoslovakia for the vacancy on the Security Council,unless it became clear that she could not command thenecessary two-thirds majority of the votes, in which event the position would have to be reconsidered.Food.IncreasedEations for christmas.(previous reference erence:C.M.(48)74thConclusions,Minute 9.)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofFood (CP. (49) 201) proposing Christmas increases in the rationsof meat, bacon, cooking fats and sweets.The Minister of Food said that since his memorandum was prepared it had become possible to offer some further increase inthe bacon ration at Christmas because more supplies were coming forward and they could not be kept in store. If Argentine suppliesof meat were interrupted it might be necessary to abandon theproposal for an additional meat ration at Christmas, but if supplies
41CM. 60 (49)75came forward it would be necessary to give the increase in order to clear the cold stores. There was likely to be less Christmas poultrythis year than last, especially if it proved impossible to make anagreement with Hungary about the supply of turkeys.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he could not support the proposed increase in the sweets ration, nor the grantof extra supplies of manufacturing sugar, sinceJhis involved anbution as a whole would cost  500,000 in food subsidies, of which only about half had been included in the Ministry of Food Estimates.If the bacon ration had to be increased because we were importingmore than we could store, the scale of our imports should be reviewed, since superfluous bacon, even from non-dollar sources, wasa burden on our total balance of payments.The general view of Ministers was that the public would not see any inconsistency between the general economy measures whichwere to be announced on 24th October and some extra distributionof food at Christmas even if that involved some dollar expenditure.It would, however, be advisable that the Minister of Food should postpone any announcement for a week or so until the general economic situation had been debated. By then the prospects ofsupplies of Argentine meat might have become clearer.The Cabinet-(1) Approved in principle the proposal that Christmas foodbonuses should be given on the lines indicated in cp. (49) 201.(2) Agreed that no announcement of the bonuses should be made during the next two weeks.(3) Invited the Minister of Food to submit his final proposals tothe Cabinet during the week beginning 7th November.additionalThe bonus distri-Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,20th October, 1949.
