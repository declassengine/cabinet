1. At their meeting on 8th November the Economic PolicyCommittee had drawn attention to the heavy economic losses whichwere resulting from the action of the Governments of Egypt and iraq in preventing sterling oil from reaching the refinery at Haifa.The Foreign Secretary now informed the Cabinet that he was already considering what further steps could be taken to break thisdeadlock. Financial pressure had been applied to the Governmentof Iraq, but this had so far resulted only in their threatening to leavethe sterling area. The Egyptian Government, for their part, were reluctant to allow tankers to take this oil through the Suez Canal,for it was only routed that way because it could not be passed throughIraq, and public opinion in Egypt would be hostile to any actionwhich would help to nullify the stand taken by the Government ofIraq.In discussion it was suggested that the United States Govern-ment might be asked to join in applying further pressure to theGovernment of Iraq. Other possibilities were that the egyptian government might be induced to allow the tankers to pass throughthe Canal and lodge their protest afterwards or, alternatively, allow the passage of tankers which were carrying oil for other destinationsas well as Haifa.The Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary to continue to explore all practical possibilities of securing the passage of sterling oil to the refinery at Haifa.2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the foreign secretary, the Minister of Labour, the Minister of Health and hehad discussed in a preliminary way the policy which they should pursue in the forthcoming discussion about wages policy with theEconomic Committee of the Trades Union Congress general council. The General Council had it in mind to ask wage-earnersgenerally to accept a stand-still on wage rates, and, if this were generally accepted, they would be prepared to ask those on slidingscales related to the cost of living to forego claims arising from a moderate rise in the cost of living. This policy would not in itself be enough to prevent a general rise in wages.The Foreign Secretary said that one method of handling thesituation would be to attempt to stabilise wages in relation to thecurrent cost-of-living figure of 112. This might, however, involvethe grant of increases to trades, such as the building trades, whererates linked to the cost of living were revised at long intervals andhad not recently been revised. Moreover it would encourage tradeswhere wages were not linked to the cost of living to demand increasesif they could show that their present rates had been fixedwhen the cost-of-living index was at a lower figure (e.g., the railwaymen, who could claim that the present rates were fixed whenthe index was at 106). There were about 7\ million workers on fixedscales, and only about \\ million on scales linked to the cost-of-living index; and the main danger of attempting to stabilise wages inrelation to an index figure of 112 would come from the 7\ million workers on fixed rates. He therefore favoured an arrangement bywhich there would be a stand-still on wages until, say, February1951, with an understanding that this would be subject to review ifmeanwhile the cost-of-living index rose more than, say, five or six.points above its present level. As a quid fro quo, it would benecessary to agree that the cost of living would have to fall by five or six points before any decrease was made in wages linked to thecost-of-living index.   Any stand-still agreement should provide for-2 b 2
rates to be reconsidered where radical changes were made itiworking conditions e.g., where the introduction of mechanisationcalled for the revision of piece-rates. Moreover, incentive schemesmust also be encouraged, and industries should work out schemes which gave bonuses for increased production. The Governmentshould drop the idea that the pay of low-paid workers should be exempted from the stand-still, and should ask the Trades UnionCongress not to take this matter further. For over the last twoyears wages had been revised in a way that had substantially reduced the differential between skilled and unskilled workers. It would cause great unrest among skilled workers if this gap were stillfurther reduced, and there would be no adequate inducement for men .to undertake the training necessary for skilled trades. He believedthat an arrangement on the lines he had indicated would be loyallyaccepted by wage-earners and would create in the United States afavourable atmosphere for negotiating the changes necessary toenable this country to build up its trade with the dollar area.In discussion, the following points were made : :(a) There was general agreement with the view that theGovernment should not purport to be stabilising wages in relationto a cost-of-living index of 112. The use of this index figure wouldinvolve a reassessment of many wage rates and would cause greatunsettlement at a time when it was necessary to hold the positionin order to prevent inflation. Further, where workers had securedincreases in fixed rates in the last few years, this had been in substitution for increases based on the cost of living. The miners&apos;claim for a further fixed-rate increase would be strongly pressed ifit was suggested that wages were being stabilised on a cost-of-living index of 112. There would also be difficulty with the railway workers, and any increase in railway wages would create great difficulties for the British Transport Commission.(&amp;) Any stand-still arrangement should remain in force for aconsiderable period, preferably more than a year. At the same time a safety-valve should be provided, in the form of an understandingthat, if the cost-of-living index rose by more than, say, five Or sixpoints, wage rates would be reviewed.(c) Attention was drawn to the difficulties which would arise from the varying periods at which wage rates linked to the cost-of -living index were altered. The hosiery trades had secured anincrease of 22s. Qd. a week in the last two years because the rates were varied month by month, and the boot and shoe trades had secured an increase of 19s. On the other hand, the increase in thebuilding trades was only 3s. 8d., because the rates were reviewedannually in February. Should not industries subject to an annual review be entitled to some or all of the increases which they wouldhave secured if the stand-still agreement had not been introduced ?The iron and steel industry would probably oppose any stand-stillagreement which did not provide for this.The Cabinet agreed that this aspect of the matter would haveto be discussed with the General Council of the Trades UnionCongress; but it was felt that there would be great advantage in applying - the stand-still without exceptions. In particular,considerable objection was seen to the grant of any wage increases to the building trades. Builders&apos; labourers had already securedincreases unrelated to the cost-of-living index, which gave them very high wages as compared with skilled men. Moreover, in thebuilding industry generally, it was desirable that any further increase in earnings should be dependent upon greater productivity.(d) It was agreed that it was undesirable in present circum-stances to afford special treatment to low-paid workers. Thus, in theengineering industry some rates were rather low, but far moreunsettlement would be caused by raising them than by leaving themfor the present unaltered. D
(e) The Government could count on loyal support from the great mass of wage-earners in steps designed to prevent inflation and toimprove the economic situation of the country. The simpler andmore straightforward the policy, and the fewer the exceptions to it,the stronger would be the response from workers.The Minister of Labour said that any understanding reached with the Trades Union Congress General Council would not, ofcourse, bind individual unions : but he had in mind to secure theapproval of the Joint Consultative Committee of the National joint advisory Council to any agreed policy, which could then be broughtto the notice of negotiating bodies throughout industry.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Foreign Secretary, the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Minister of Labour should discuss the stabilisation of wages with the Economic Committee ofthe Trades Union Congress General Council on the lines indicated by the Foreign Secretary.Production of 3.   The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister of FoodGround-nuts in (CP. (49) 231) and the Secretary of State for the ColoniesEast Africa. (CP. (49) 232) on the future of the East Africa Ground-nuts(Previous Scheme. They also had before them a further memorandum by the reference: Minister of Food (CP. (49) 210) covering the report and accountsCM. (48) 5th of the Overseas Food Corporation for the year 1948-49.Conclusions, yAe Minister of Food said that he would be expected to makeMinute 4.) a fufl statement on future policy in the debate in the House ofCommons on 21st November on the first annual report of the overseas Food Corporation. That report had revealed the widediscrepancy between the original estimates as set out in the white paper of 1947 (Cmd. 7030) and the actual expenditure incurred andresults achieved to date. The original plan had provided for the clearance, by 1952-53, of 3,210,000 acres at a cost of nearly 24 million; in fact, by March last, only 46,000 acres had been cleared, but this had cost over  21 million. There would no doubt be strong criticism of past mistakes, but Parliament would be mainly concerned to discuss the future of the Scheme. The Overseas food corporation had now themselves submitted detailed proposals forits revision. Briefly, this plan provided for the clearance of600,000 acres by 1953-54 at an aggregate capital cost of  45 million;and a further  3 million would be required to cover possible losses on current operations during the development period. There were thus three possible courses of action: to abandon the Schemealtogether; to restrict its scope even more drastically than was proposed by the Overseas Food Corporation; or to adopt the planput forward by the Corporation. For the reasons set out in cp. (49) 231 he rejected the first two courses and recommended thatthe Overseas Food Corporation should be authorised to proceed withtheir revised programme. It should be recognised that this policy would involve a commitment for the expenditure of a further 16 million for capital development up to 1953-54; and that, inview of the impossibility of making any firm assumptions abouteither yields or prices so far ahead, no assurance could be given atthis stage that the Scheme would be able to make a profit, even on current account, after the development period. He thought it wouldbe essential at the same time to strengthen the Board of the overseas food Corporation, and he had already submitted to the PrimeMinister detailed proposals for doing so.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he was in full agreement with the recommendations made by the Minister of Food.The Scheme should not be judged from a purely commercial point
of view: a substantial part of its capital outlay had been devotedto the provision of development and welfare services, which werenormally the responsibility of the central Government or of the localauthorities. The abandonment of the Scheme at this stage would bea major disaster for East Africa, and would involve the loss ofvaluable experience in the technique of economic development undertropical conditions. It seemed certain that the Government wouldbe pressed in the debate to agree to arrangements involving closerParliamentary control over the operations of the Overseas food corporation; and it would no doubt be suggested that responsibilityfor the Scheme should be transferred to the Colonial development corporation. The latter suggestion should not be accepted: theexisting commitments of the Colonial Development Corporation were so heavy that it would not be able to undertake this additionalresponsibility.The Cabinet agreed generally that, for the reasons set out in cp. (49) 231 and 232, there could be no question of abandoning theGround-nuts Scheme.   Some Ministers were, however, doubtfulwhether it would be advisable at this stage to take a firm decisionto adopt in full the revised plan put forward by the Overseas food corporation.   This involved a further heavy expenditure of public funds in the clear knowledge that the Scheme would never earnenough for payment of interest or amortisation of capital, and thatit might have to be run at a substantial recurrent loss. Before a finaldecision was taken, ought not further information to be obtainedabout the suitability of the Southern Provinces, in which futured development would largely take place ?  Was it expedient to acceptthe Corporation^ proposals without fuller investigation into suchmatters as the rainfall prospects and the soil conditions in this area ?For this purpose, the Corporation should call upon the best scientificadvice available, not only in the Colonial Service, but in the UnitedKingdom; and an approach might perhaps.also be made to theUnited States Government for technical and even financial help inaccordance with the policy laid down in President Truman&apos;s FourthPoint.   In reply it was pointed out that, as the result of actualexperience, a programme of future development could now be framed with a much greater accuracy than had been possible in 1947.The technique of clearing the bush had been mastered; and thesection of the Corporation^ annual report dealing with scientific research had shown the extent to which investigation into the suitability of the Southern Provinces had already proceeded.Nevertheless, the Corporation recognised the need for proceedingcautiously in this area, and only 2,000 acres would be cleared therein 1950.   There would be no substantial advantage in seeking toobtain further scientific or technical advice at this stage; and inany event the Colonial Schemes already submitted to the UnitedStates Government for assistance under the Fourth Point policy would already fully employ the available funds.  Acceptance of theCorporation^ proposals did not, of course, mean that further changes might not in due course have to be made in the Scheme; but,on present information, there appeared to be no case for instructingthe Corporation to prepare an even more restricted scheme, since an area of about 600,000 acres seemed to be the minimum on whichthere was any prospect of operating a successful and economicscheme.Discussion turned next on the line which the government spokesmen should take in the forthcoming Parliamentary debate.Criticism was likely to take two main forms : it would be argued that the Scheme had been initiated with undue haste and on toograndiose a scale; and it would be said that the Government hadrelied on unsuitable persons for the planning and administration ofthe Scheme. The answer to the first criticism was that the world food shortage had made it necessary to accept abnormal risks; but,m reply to the second, the Government should admit that grave
89 CM. 68 (49)       If 5mistakes had in fact been made. The main responsibility for thislay partly with those who had prepared the original estimates, andpartly with the managing agents; but it would be neither accuratenor expedient to suggest that the Overseas Food Corporation or theGovernment itself were free from blame in this matter. In the debate, therefore, the Government spokesmen should admit that,whatever the wider value of the Scheme, its results had hithertofallen far short of expectations; and they should be ready clearly toapportion the responsibility for this situation. Both parliament and the public were, however, primarily interested in the future of the Scheme, and it was essential that a full and detailed statementof the Governments intentions should be given to the House ofCommons. No attempt should be made to disguise the speculativeaspects of the revised programme proposed by the Corporation : onthe other hand, it should be made clear that the Government werefirmly convinced of the need for continuing the Scheme on the restricted basis now proposed. In this connection, it would be relevant to point out that its merits should not be judged solely by reference to its ultimate capacity to earn a profit: even in thiscountry new agricultural production required Government subsidy-the production of sugar beet was still subsidised and it was virtually inevitable that the production of ground-nuts should in its initial stages involve direct financial assistance, such as the writing-off of part or the whole of the capital invested. The Minister ofFood should also be in a position to explain what action he was taking to improve the accounting arrangements of the Corporation.The Cabinet were also informed of the changes proposed in theBoard of the Overseas Food Corporation. These would involve the replacement of two of the existing full-time members of the Board,and the addition of two experienced business men on a part-time basis. After discussion, there was general agreement on the needfor strengthening the Board on the lines proposed; and it was agreedthat it would be preferable if an announcement on this point couldbe made in advance of the debate in the House of Commons.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the recommendation in CP. (49) 231 that the overseas Food Corporation should be authorised to pro-ceed with their revised plans to clear 600,000 acres ofbush in East Africa for agricultural production byNovember 1953.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would settle with theMinister of Food the detailed changes to be made in the membership of the Board of the Overseas Food Corpora-tion.(3) Agreed that the Minister of Food and the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies should speak for the Government in the debate in the House of Commons on 21st November.Newsprint. 4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the President ofSize of News-  the Board of Trade (CP. (49) 227) recommending (i) that controlpapers and     over the supply of paper for periodicals should be withdrawn fromPeriodicals.     4th March, 1950, and (ii) that the size of daily newspapers shouldbe increased to seven pages up to the end of 1949, and by an extrapage for four weeks during the General Election.There was general support for the proposal that periodicalsshould be freed from all control, even though this meant that theBritish Union of Fascists would in future find less difficulty inobtaining paper for their periodical Action.The Cabinet also agreed that the size of daily newspapersshould be increased by one page for four weeks during the periodof the General Election.  Doubts were, however, expressed about the
expediency of allowing newspapers an additional page up to the endof 1949 especially if, as stated in paragraph 3 of CP. (49) 227, therewould otherwise be good prospects of increasing our exports of newsprint to Australia. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said thatit was most important, on balance of payments grounds, that our exports to Australia should be increased to the greatest possible extent. If, as he understood, the Australian Government would notin any event allow the import of Canadian newsprint to meet theadditional demand, Canada could not have an^ reasonable objectionto our supplying it by the export of newsprint from the UnitedKingdom. There was general agreement with this view.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that control over the supply of paper for periodicalsshould be withdrawn from 4th March, 1950.(2) Authorised the President of the Board of Trade to informthe newspaper proprietors that an increase of one pagein the size of daily newspapers would be allowed for aperiod of four weeks during the General Election.(3) Rejected the proposal that the size of daily newspapersshould be immediately increased to seven pages up fco theend of 1949; and invited the President of the Board ofTrade to pursue instead the possibility of increasingexports of newsprint from the United Kingdom, particu-larly to Australia.Amendment ofBritish NorthAmerioa Acts,1867-1946.(previous reference erence:CM. (46) 69thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Commonwealth Relations (CP. (49) 235) covering an address to the King from the Senate and House of Commons ofCanada praying that the Canadian Parliament should be enabled toamend the Canadian Constitution in certain respects withoutrecourse to the Parliament at Westminster.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations explainedthat the proposal of the Canadian Government was that theCanadian Federal Parliament should have power to amend theCanadian Constitution in relation to most matters falling withinthe jurisdiction of that Parliament, and that the procedure for amending the Constitution in relation to matters of joint concern tothe Federal and Provincial Governments should be discussed at aconference of those Governments opening on 10th January. TheCanadian Government desired that the Parliament at Westminstershould pass legislation giving effect to the first part of this proposalbefore the opening of that conference.The Lord President said that the Legislation Committee would consider whether the Governments legislative business for theremainder of the Session could be so arranged as to enable this Billto pass before the end of the year.The Cabinet  -(1) Agreed that legislation should be introduced to enable theCanadian Parliament to amend the Canadian Constitu-tion in matters falling solely within the jurisdiction ofthe Canadian Parliament.(2) Invited the Lord President to consider what steps could betaken to ensure that this legislation passed into law before the end of the current Session.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,14th November, 1949,
