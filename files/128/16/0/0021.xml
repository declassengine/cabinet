1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of.Food (CP. (49) 223) recommending that the Governments decisions on the Christmas food bonuses should be announced at an early date.The Minister of Food recalled that on 20th October the cabinet had agreed in principle that Christmas increases in the rations of meat, bacon, cooking fats and sweets should be given on the lines indicated in OP. (49) 201, but that these should not be announceduntil after the Parliamentary debates on the economic situation.He now sought authority to make an announcement on Monday,14th November : this would include the increase in the tea ration,which the Economic Policy Committee had approved on 21st October(E.P.C. (49) 39th Meeting, Minute 4). Although little progress hadbeen made in the trade negotiations with the Argentine Government,there had so far been nO interruption of meat shipments, and hethought it would be reasonable to take the risk of granting a specialChristmas increase in the meat ration. The quantity involved would be only 11,000 tons.  and stocks were at present so high thatit had been necessary to charter ships for use as cold stores.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was still opposed* to the suggestion that the meat ration should be increased for christmas. Whatever the difficulties created by the shortage ofcold storage capacity, we ought not to weaken our bargaining position by dissipating our stocks while the negotiations with argentina were still proceeding. If a satisfactory agreement wasreached, a special ration increase might be authorised later.There was general agreement that it would not be advisablein present circumstances to reduce stocks by giving a special meat ration for Christmas. If it was necessary to defend this decisionpublicly, there was little doubt that the Governments determination to avoid weakening their position in the Argentine negotiations would be fully supported. In any event, the remaining Christmasfood bonuses were likely to be regarded as sufficiently generous inour present economic position.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that a special increase in the meat ration shouldnot be granted at Christmas.(2) Authorised the Minister of Food to announce on 14thNovember the other Christmas food bonuses proposedin OP. (49) 201 and the decision to increase the tearation to 2^ oz. a week from 4th December.Commonwealth 2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordRelations. Privy Seal (OP.

He had circulated with CP. (49)224 a copy of an aide-memoire which had been handed to the Govern-ment of India in pursuance of that authority. The various questionscovered in the aide-memoire were to be the subject of discussion inLondon later that week with Sir Girja Bajpai, the Secretary-Generalof the Indian Ministry of External Affairs; and he would welcomeany guidance which the Cabinet might wish to offer regarding thegeneral lines on which those discussions should be pursued.   Inparticular, he sought authority to communicate to Sir Girja Bajpaia copy of the draft India (Consequential Provisions) Bill, which was annexed to CP. (49) 224.IncreasedEations for christmas.(previous reference:CM. (49) 60thConclusions,Minute 4.)
In discussion it was pointed out that the introduction oflegislation on the lines of Clause 1 of the draft Bill would arousecontroversy in both Houses of Parliament. Under section 1 of theBritish Nationality Act, 1948, the -terms &quot; British subject&quot; and&quot;Commonwealth citizen&quot; were interchangeable; and the Govern-ment would find great difficulty in explaining to Parliament theproposal that the term &quot; Commonwealth citizen &quot; should in futureinclude Indian citizens who were not British subjects. The cabinet recognised that some legislation would have to be passed by the parliament at Westminster before 26th January, 1950, to authorisethe continuance thereafter of the. preferential treatment hithertoaccorded to India and her citizens. But was it essential that this legislation should include detailed provisions on the nationalityquestion ? Was it reasonable, or necessary, that the Parliament atWestminister should pronounce on that question before the detailsof the Indian Citizenship Law were known ? Would it not sufficeif, for the time being, United Kingdom legislation took the form of(i) a simple declaratory provision to the effect that, notwithstanding the establishment of the Republic of India, India remained amember of the Commonwealth, and that, until provision was madeto the contrary, the law of the United Kingdom would continue tohave effect in relation to citizens of India in like manner as hereto-fore ; and (ii) a provision on the general lines of Clause 2 of thedraft Bill annexed to CP. (49) 224 empowering His Majesty to makeby Order in Council such adjustments of the existing law as mightbe necessary by reason of India&apos;s remaining within the Common-wealth as a Republic.The Cabinet agreed that these possibilities should be fullyexplored in the forthcoming discussions with Sir Girja Bajpai. Itshould, in particular, be represented to him that any legislation tobe passed at Westminster before 26th January, 1950, must be confined to the major essential points, and that all questions of controversy or detail should be left over for later discussion. Fromthis point of view it was preferable that nationality questions shouldnot be dealt with specificially but should be covered by some generalformula.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord Privy Seal to arrange that thoseconducting the forthcoming discussions with Sir GirjaBajpai should explore, in the light of the Cabinet&apos;discussion, the possibility of avoiding the inclusion of provisions dealing specifically with nationality points inthe India (Consequential Provisions) Bill.Indian 3.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum (CP. (49) 218)Citizens which the Lord Privy Seal and the Minister of Labour had circu-Resident in lated in pursuance oi the Cabinet&apos;s decision of 29th August on thethe United liability to military service of Indian citizens resident in the UnitedKingdom:       Kingdom.Liability to This recommended that, in the forthcoming discussions with theMilitary Government of India on the content of the India (ConsequentialService. Provisions) Bill, an attempt should be made to reach an under-previous       standing about the application of the existing National Service ActsReference:       in peace-time to Indian citizens resident in this country.   The basisCM. (49)54th   of the understanding would be that, while the liability under thoseConclusions,     Acts extended to Indian citizens resident in this country, very fewMinute 4.) &apos;     Qf them would in practice be called upon to undertake militaryservice, and even those few would be free, if they preferred, to leavethe country rather than do so.   It would also be made clear that conscription for military service in war wOuld not be applied to indian citizens without further consultation with the Governmentof India.  It would be necessary to agree that corresponding treat-ment could be given to United Kingdom citizens resident in India
under any system of compulsory military service which might beintroduced there.In discussion the following points were made :-(a) The A attorney-General said, in support of paragraph 12 of cp. (49) 218, that he was doubtful whether an international court would uphold the right of the United Kingdom Government toconscript for military service a person who was a citizen of one ofthe other independent countries of the Commonwealth and was nota United Kingdom citizen.(6) The difficulty discussed in CP. (49) 218 could not be evadedby an administrative decision that no Indian citizen should inpractice be conscripted. It might well prove impossible to avoidconscripting Indian doctors : indeed, some Indian doctors had inthe past expressed a desire to be called up for service as doctors.(c) There was, however, no need to present the issue to theGovernment of India as one of any great practical difficulty, for it need not affect more than a small handful of people. The best tacticswould be to present it in a matter of fact way as a corollary to the many privileges which Indian citizens would obtain in this countryin consequence of their being treated as though they retained thestatus of British subjects.(d) No publicity should be given to any understanding whichmight be reached with the Government of India on this question.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals put forward in CP. (49) 218subject to the points noted in paragraphs (c) and (d) above.Title and 4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord PrivyStatus of Seal (C.P. (49) 226) on the title and status of Commonwealth HighCommonwealth Commissioners.High This recalled that the question of title had been discussed,Commissioners, inconclusively, at the meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers inOctober 1948, and had then been left over for discussion at a further meeting. It was now learned that, when India became a Republicon 26th January, 1950, the Government of India were likely tosuggest that their representatives in other Commonwealth countries should be given the title &quot;Ambassador,&quot; and the Government ofthe Irish Republic had already announced that India&apos;s representa-tive in Dublin would, as an Ambassador, be accorded precedenceover the representatives of other Commonwealth countries. It wastherefore proposed that the United Kingdom Government should at once decide in principle to exchange Ambassadors with India(after 26th January. 1950) and with the Irish Republic; and that all commonwealth Governments other than India snouid be invited toexpress their views on the question whether Commonwealth repre-sentatives generally should in future be styled &quot; Ambassador &quot;instead of &quot; High Commissioner.&quot;It was also proposed in the memorandum that, whatever decision might be taken on the question of title, all commonwealth governments should now be invited to agree that diplomatic and consular immunity should be conferred, on a basis or reciprocity, on commonwealth representatives in other Commonwealth countries;and that legislation should subsequently be introduced to grant suchimmunity in the United Kingdom and Colonies to the representa-tives of all Commonwealth countries which were prepared to grantcomparable immunity to the representatives of the United Kingdom.The Cabinefs discussion turned mainly on the question of title. It was recalled that at the Commonwealth meeting in October1948, the Prime Minister of India had himself deprecated theproposal that Commonwealth representatives should be styled&quot;Ambassador&quot;; and it would be unfortunate if this change ofnomenclature had now to be adopted by all Commonwealth countries
as a result of precipate action by the Government of India. At thesame time, it was desirable that all members of the commonwealth should follow a uniform practice in this matter. Might the Govern-ment of India be persuaded not to make this change immediatelyafter India became a Republic in January 1950? Alternatively,might all Commonwealth countries agree to style their representa-tives &quot;Commonwealth Ambassadors  ?The Prime Minister said that he shared the misgivings whichhad been expressed in the Cabinefs discussion. He would take theopportunity of discussing the matter personally with the PrimeMinister of India while the latter was in London during the currentweek. In the light of that discussion he would make a report on thematter to His Majesty The King.&apos; Thereafter, he would sendpersonal messages to the Prime Ministers of other commonwealth countries : he thought that a personal approach would be preferable to that suggested in Annex &quot; A &quot; of CP. (49) 226.The Cabinet .(1) Approved the proposals in CP. (49) 226 regarding thegrant of diplomatic and consular immunity to Common-wealth representatives.(2) Invited the Prime Minister to take personal soundings, ashe proposed, on the question of a change in the title of commonwealth High Commissioners.5. The Minister of Health said that the local authorities hadbeen negotiating national scales for town clerks and other seniorlocal government officials with a view to preventing poaching by one authority of the officials of another. These national scales would,however, have had the effect of giving substantial salary increases to some officials, with inevitable repercussions on the salaries oftheir subordinates. He was glad to say that, in response to repre-sentations which he had made, the local authority associations htadnow agreed to recommend the indefinite postponement of the date when these proposals would be brought into force.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was disturbed atthe possible outcome of the discussion of wages policy in the general council of the Trades Union Congress. The unions representingworkers in the steel industry were said to be unwilling to accept the suspension of their sliding-scale agreements linking wages to thecost of living. If these agreement could not be suspendedtemporarily, other wages could not be held and a very serious situa-tion would result. Ail the measures which the Government were taking to combat the inflationary pressure would be of little avail ifthere was a general upward movement of wages. He had reminded the General Secretary that the Trades Union Congress had agreedto discuss wages policy with Ministers; and Mr. Tewson had under-taken to do his best to ensure that an opportunity for such a discussion was afforded before final decisions were taken by theCouncil.The Minister of Labour said that, while he did not condone theaction of those trade unions which were opposing the temporary suspension of sliding-scale agreements, his colleagues should be aware of the arguments which were being used. Some unions whichhad such agreements felt that in the past they would have receivedlarger increases in wages through straight negotiations with theemployers than they had in fact received through the operation of asliding scale. When prices were tending to rise, they were reluctant to lose the advantage which the sliding scale gave them as comparedwith workers who had to negotiate each rise in wages with their employers.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.Wages Policy.(previous reference:CM.

National 6.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofHealth State for Scotland and the Minister of Health (CP. (49) 220) listingService some classes of case in which it would be difficult to apply the generalSalaries. decisions to stabilise all incomes, because that decision had been taken(Previous       while a complicated series of negotiations relating to salaries andEeference:      wages in the National Health Service was in progress.

Recent experiencesuggested that arbitrators had now very much in mind the general economic position of the country and were either rejectingunreasonable claims or were seeking means of postponing a decision.(c) The Service Departments were finding difficulty in securingdoctors and dentists because of the remuneration which could beobtained in the National Health Service, and they were proposing to approach the Treasury with a view to increases being granted inthe rates of pay of Service doctors and dentists. The service departments accordingly supported the view expressed in cp. (49) 220 that adjustments should be made where the breakdown of an essential service was threatened.(d) Re-adjustments of salary scales in medicine and dentistrywould in some cases have&quot; repercussions elsewhere. Thus, anyattempt to strengthen the school dental service by paying highersalaries to school dentists would lead to claims from other localgovernment officers.(e) It was desirable that the Health Ministers should ensurethat tne negotiating machinery in the National Health Service didnot proceed with the consideration of various claims for increases in pay which were now being formulated. It would be preferable, andmore in line with the general attitude of the Government in mattersof wage negotiations, that this point should be stressed by officials onthe management side rather than that direct representations shouldbe made by the Health Ministers.The Cabinet-- Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland and theMinister of Health to put before the Chancellor of theExchequer the adjustments they proposed in national health Service salaries and Wages, with a view to thesebeing considered in detail in the light of the views expressed in the course of the Cabinefs discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,7th November, 1949.
