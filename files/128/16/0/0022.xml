Iron andSteel Bill.(previous reference erence:C.M.(49)6SrdConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Lord Privy Seal, said that the Lord Chancellor and hehad completed their discussions with the Leader of the opposition in the House of Lords (Lord Salisbury) and Lord Swinton about theprovisions governing the coming into force of the Iron and Steel Bill.The Governments proposals, of which Lord Salisbury had now indi-cated acceptance, were that the Bill should come into operation fromthe date of its passing, but should include a provision that theMinister would not appoint any member of the Iron and. steel corporation before 1st October, 1950. The earliest date for the vesting of the companies in the Corporation would be 1st January,1951. Since the agreed provision about the establishment of theCorporation would enable the Minister of Supply to take pre-liminary steps, including the setting up of a shadow Corporation,before 1st October, 1950, it was proposed that the Minister of supply should state in the House of Commons that the Government did not intend to make any approach, formal or informal, to any individualwith regard to membership of the Iron and Steel Corporation until a new Parliament had been elected.In discussion the following points were made: (a) The compromise ultimately reached with the opposition in the House of Lords was more favourable to the Govern-ment than the concessions which the Ministers immediately respon-sible had been prepared to make in order to get the Bill on thestatute book before the end of 1949. .(6) The proposals were entirely acceptable to ,the Minister ofSupply. He had always recognised that, if the passing of the bill were delayed until a time when the General Election was in sight,it would not be practicable to set up a satisfactory Iron and steel corporation until after the Election. The necessary preliminary work would fully occupy the time before 1st October, 1950, whenthe Corporation could be formally constituted. On administrativegrounds if would have been impracticable to vest the undertakings in the Corporation before 1st January, 1951.(c) The House of Commons would discuss on 16th november the Lords&apos; insistence on their amendments relating to the cominginto operation of the Bill, and the Government^ counter-proposals.The Governments proposals would not be made available until the morning of 15th November, and it was important that completesecrecy regarding the Governments intentions should be observeduntil that time.(d) The Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords hadstipulated ,and the Lord Privy Seal and the Lord Chancellor had accepted, that the Governments proposals should not be represented as a compromise reached with the Opposition. The fact that conver-sations had taken place was not to be disclosed. From this angle themanner in which the Governments proposals were presented was important, and the Minister of Supply proposed to discuss with theLord President the terms in which he would advocate acceptance ofthe amendments and the terms in which he would announce theGovernments intention not to take any steps towards setting upthe Corporation before the Election.(e) The Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords had made it clear that he expected the Government to discuss theposition with the Opposition in the House of Commons, althoughMr. Churchill and Mr.; Eden had been consulted by Lord Salisburyon the Governments proposals. It was arguable that acceptanceof the Governments proposals by the Opposition in the House of37918-1 &apos; . b 2Parliament. 1.

The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP. (49) 225) covering a report on the economicsituation.The following points were made in discussion : Concern was expressed at the large increase in the number employed in the distributive trades during the past year; Alterna-tive employment was not, however, always available and the workers concerned were often unsuitable for more essential work. The totalnumber of persons employed in distribution was still well below thepre-war figure. Some reduction might result from the recent cutsin some retail prices.Since March the number of men on the colliery books had fallen by 17,000, and the total was now some 5,000 below the National coal board&apos;s requirements. Nevertheless, output had continued toincrease as the result of higher productivity. In this connection,attention was drawn to the fact that the total figure of personsemployed in the coalmining industry was some 70,000 in excess ofthe numbers on the colliery books. Was there reason to suppose thatthe administrative organisation of the National Coal Board mightbe excessively elaborate and wasteful in the use of man-power?The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he did not think that thenumbers of the administrative, clerical and technical staff employedby the Board were greater than were essential to the efficiency ofthe industry, but he would look further into this point.The figures for production were very satisfactory. The indexfigures for July and August were 7 points higher than for thecorresponding months of 1948, and this was largely due to increased productivity.It was inevitable that the ship-repairing industry shouldcontinue to contract. It IlctCL 1J.o&amp; so far proved difficult to findalternative employment for redundant workers, though theirmobility was seriously hampered by the housing shortage. The futureof this industry was at present being considered by the production committee.The value of United Kingdom exports rose in October to 156 million as compared with  142 million in September; imports,however, had increased by  17 million over the September figures.It was unlikely that either of these figures reflected any substantial changes in prices on account of the devaluation of sterling.The inflationary pull exerted by the sterling area on UnitedKingdom exports was a matter for concern; in particular, we were sending a very high proportion of our exports to Australia. during recent years Australia had accumulated large sterling balances; andthis situation would be further aggravated if the Australian WheatBoard took advantage of the the fact that the prices prescribed bythe International Wheat Agreement were stated in terms of dollarsand insisted on increasing the price of Australian wheat to the full extent made possible by the devaluation of sterling. The general view of Ministers was that this was a matter which should in due course be taken up with the Australian Government; there couldbe no justification for paying a price for Australian wheat three

But there were important political issues involved, and it would not be expedient to make this approach before the forthcoming Australian election. In the mean-time, no commitment on future wheat prices should be entered intowith the Australian Wheat Board. The Minister of Food undertook to consider how the negotiations might best be handled.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the United Kingdomgold and dollar holdings had increased by $170 million in October.It would, however, be inadvisable to attach undue weight to theinflow of dollar funds during this period since it seemed likely thatthis was largely due to temporary factors arising out of devaluation.In recent weeks there had been signs of a flight from the dollarto gold as a result of talk of a possible devaluation of the dollar.There were interests in the United States who might make a deter-mined effort to compel the Administration to devalue the dollar.In recent months the volume of imports had been expanded bypurchases for stock; since March the level of stocks had increasedby  100 million.The increase in prfces since devaluation had not so far exceeded the original estimates. For some months before September the termsof trade had moved slowly in our favour, but this movement wouldbe checked by devaluation.The Cabinet-Took note of CP. (49) 225 and of the points made in discussion.government expenditure.(previous reference :C.M.(49)61stConclusions,Minute 2.)administrative economies.4.   The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda : CP. (49) 216 : by the Prime Minister, asking Ministers inin charge of Civil Departments to press forward with the action required to give detailed effect to the Governments decisionsfor a reduction in the rate of supply expenditure;CP. (49) 221:. by the Lord President, suggesting measureswhich might be initiated with a view to effecting further economies in Government expenditure;CP. (49) 228 : by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, com-menting on the Lord Presidents proposals.The Lord President referred to the steps which were beingtaken to secure administrative economies in Government Depart-ments by reorganisation of work and staff reductions, but expressedthe view that a greater impetus was required to secure moreeconomies. Certain Departments which had grown during the warappeared to remain swollen in size beyond what was required tocarry out their present functions. The method by which reorganisa-tions and reductions in numbers might be effected would no doubtvary from Department to Department. In the aggregate, veryconsiderable savings could be effected. Where there was a general impression that a Department was unnecessarily large, an arbitrarycut might have to be imposed and the Department told to make thenecessary reorganisation of its work within the new limits of size.The Chancellqr of the Exchequer said that the Organisationand Methods Branches of various Departments were expected tosee that waste was avoided within the existing framework of organisation. At the same time these branches could not be expectedto cope with major problems of organisation, and he had for sometime been engaged in initiating special enquiries, conducted in somecases by persons with expert experience from outside the department concerned. These investigations took some time, and the numberof individuals competent to carry them out was limited, but satis-factory results had been secured from a special investigation intothe organisation of the Air Ministry and other enquiries were in
train.  It would be undesirable to make public the reports of these enquiries. He was not in favour of arbitrary cuts in establishments and preferred an expert investigation into the organisation of ani: &apos;.- -     -office.  -     - &apos;In discussion, the following points were made :&apos;- (a) Organisation and Methods Branches were concerned primarily with greater efficiency, and staff economies were incidental to their main work. Endeavours were being made to secure thatindividuals of the right calibre and temperament-were put in chargeof Organisation and Methods Branches.(b) It was difficult to initiate enquiries into the working of new and expanding services, such as the National Health Service, untilthe organisation had taken shape.(c) It was very desirable that special investigations, on the linesof that conducted in the Air Ministry, should be initiated as soonas possible in other large Departments, the staff of which had beenswollen during the war and did not appear to have contractedsufficiently since the end of it.(d) The matter was best left to the Chancellor of the Exchequer,who would consult the Prime Minister as might be necessary, ratherthan that the process of supervising administrative economies shouldbe entrusted to the Economic Policy Committee or other Ministerialbody.(e) Expenditure might in some cases be reduced by alterations in the methods of working adopted by Government Departments.It was, for example, suggested that the method of employing sub-contractors adopted by the Ministry of Works was very expensive.A matter of this kind would, however, have to be taken up with theMinister concerned, since it impinged on policy.(/) The possibility of effecting economies by the amalgamation of certain Government Departments would be brought before theMachinery of Government Committee.The Cabinet-(1) Endorsed the practice of holding special enquiries, into theorganisation of Departments and invited Ministers toco-operate with the Chancellor of the Exchequer ininitiating enquiries into appropriate cases.-Local Govern- In the Cabinet&apos;s discussion of administrative economies ininent Adminis- Government Departments, attention was drawn to the expansion oftration. local government staffs and the tendency to upgrade local govern-ment officers. The Ministry of Labour had recently handed overjuvenile employment bureaux to local authorities, and manyauthorities were now recruiting highly-paid staff to do the work.There was a tendency to insist to an unnecessary extent on the recruitment of university graduates in local government employment and to pay them high salaries.There was general agreement that there was scope for an investigation into the methods of recruitment, rates of remuneration and organisation of local government staffs, though it was undesirable that any overt steps should be taken in this matter untilthe Government had considered the report of the Committee on local Government Man-Power.The setting up of divisional organisations under county educa-tion committees had doubled the administrative staffs engaged in education work in counties; but changes in these arrangements,which involved the amendment of statutory provisions, would haveto be handled separately from any enquiry into administration.The Cabinet-(2) Invited the Minister of Health, after the report of the LocalGovernment Man-Power Committee had been received
81CM. 65 (49)       100and considered, to submit proposals for an enquiry into&apos; the methods of recruitment, remuneration and generalorganisation of local authority staffs:Future The Lord President said that he felt there was room forGovernment improvement in the control of Government expenditure. in expenditure, education and the other social services there was a tendency for expenditure to rise from year to year without funregard to the taxable capacity of the country. To a greater extent than had happened in recent years, what was desirable must.be judged in the light of what was practicablefrom the point of view of long-term national finance. his suggestion was that there should be a careful review of the likelycost of existing commitments over the next few years and that, inthe light of the estimated national income and of the revenue whichthe Chancellor of the Exchequer might properly take from thatincome, an endeavour should be made to allocate to each service what it might expect to receive during the next three or four years. Thiswould oblige Departments to consider Which of several desirableschemes they wished to adopt within the financial limits imposed on them and would go some way to relieve the Treasury of the burdenof considering a constant stream of proposals for further expenditure. It would in effect apply to the civil field something ofthe technique which the Ministry of Defence and the service departments had adopted in dealing with the size and shape ofthe Armed Forces in 1950-53.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Governmentwere faced with a new factor which had not hitherto arisen inpeace-time, namely, that they were reaching the limit of expenditure which could be raised by taxation, and there was a serious danger$that obligations might be entered into which the country could not meet in full in future years. The fact that so many persons were now in Government employment would make it difficult in a timeof severe stress to secure reductions in expenditure by reductions in wages, such as an industrial undertaking might haye to resort to;and this factor introduced further rigidity into the mechanism.&apos;It was with these considerations in mind that in July last he had circulated to the Economic Policy Committee a memorandum onthe prospective increases in expenditure in the next two years. Hewas arranging for the Treasury to keep a continuous watch on thesituation and he had it in mind that, in January and July of eachyear, he should circulate to the Economic Policy Committee amemorandum giving an estimate of Government expenditure for thenext twenty-four months or so. The January memorandum wouldbe useful in a final review of Departmental estimates, and the Julymemorandum could be the basis of a consideration, from the financial aspect, of the Government^ legislative proposals for the forthcoming session. He hoped that Ministers and Permanent Secretaries would examine carefully the figures submitted to the Treasury in connectionwith the preparation of these half-yearly forecasts. He did notthink it was practicable to prepare forecasts for more than about twenty-four months ahead.In subsequent discussion, attention was drawn to the difficultyof making accurate forecasts of expenditure some time ahead,having regard to the possibility of unforeseen developments. Itmight, however, be that firmer figures would be forthcoming from the angle of revenue and of the division of the available funds amongthe various services. The procedure would probably be for ministers to put forward their forecasts of expenditure in the next two years or so and for the estimated expenditure to be related to the estimatedrevenue. Thereafter, it might be necessary for Ministers to modify their policies in.the light of the sums likely to be made available infuture years for the services for which they were responsible.Attention was drawn to the fact that the whole of government expenditure should not be regarded as a burden upon the citizen.
To a considerable extent it operated to bring about a redistribution of income. The taxpayer derived substantial benefits through theoperation of subsidies and, indirectly, through the amounts devotedto productive expenditure.The Cabinet;  . . , )(3) Took note that the Chanceller of the Exchequer proposed tosubmit half-yearly forecasts of Government expenditure,covering the ensuing two years, to the Economic PolicyCommittee.(4) Invited the Prime Minister to draw the attention of the chairmen of Cabinet Committees (Ministerial and official) to the desirability of reporting on possiblesavings in public expenditure which came to notice inthe course of their investigations.(5) Agreed that Ministers should ensure that the necessary action was taken to give effect to the Governmenfsdecisions on expenditure, on the lines indicated by thePrime Minister in CP. (49) 216.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (49) 229) on the extent of the economies which he regarded as practicable in the estimated cost of the Festival of britain.The Lord President recalled that at the meeting of the Cabineton 21st October last he had expressed the view that he could secureeconomies amounting tp  600,000 and he had hoped it might bepossible to reach the full saving of  1 million proposed by theEconomic Policy Committee. He had since examined the questionwhether the saving of  1 million, to which the Priitie Ministersannouncement on 24th October last had referred, could be effected.The Festival Council had originally put forward proposals involving a cost to the Exchequer of about  14 million, and this had alreadybeen reduced to  12,300,000. He was satisfied that it was not practicable, without making cuts which would seriously detractfrom the value of the Festival, to secure further economies beyond 700,000; but he hoped to secure additional revenue, totalling 300,000, by making a charge to exhibitors for space. He thoughtit was reasonable to regard the saving of  700,000, and &quot;theadditional revenue he hoped to obtain, as amounting in the aggregateto an economy of  1 million. The Chancellor of the exchequer had suggested that one of the travelling exhibitions should be dispensed with, but he was sure that this would cause great dis-satisfaction throughout the country. There was already criticism of the extent to which the Festival was concentrated in London.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he saw great,difficulty about whittling away any of the economies which had been announced in the Prime Ministers statement. Apart from that,he felt doubtful whether the receipts from the Festival, includingthe proposed. charge for exhibitors&apos; space, would be as great ashad been estimated.In discussion, the question was raised whether exhibitors wouldbe prepared to pay for space in an exhibition which was not being organised for trade purposes. The Festival Council were confident that they could secure the necessary revenue from this source, andthe Scottish Committee favoured charges in respect of the exhibitionat Glasgow.The Cabinet-Agreed to refer the questions raised in CP. (49) 229 for detailed consideration by the Economic Policy Committee.Cabinet Ofpce, S.W. 1,lOth November, 1949.Festival of britain, 1951.(previous reference:CM. (49) 61stConclusions,Minute 2.)
