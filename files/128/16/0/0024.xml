Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.the Lord President informed the Cabinet of Parliamentarydifficulties which had arisen in connection with the Sea fish industry Bill. In view of the Cabinet&apos;s decision that price controlof fish should be discontinued in the spring, it was necessary that clause 3 of the Bill, if it was to proceed, should be substantiallyrecast in a form which involved the recommittal of the Bill and thepassing of a financial resolution. It was hardly possible, withinthe period remaining before the end of the Session, to find theParliamentary time which would be required for the discussion ofthese substantial changes. The Minister of Agriculture and theSecretary of State for Scotland said that the discontinuance of price control would change the existing conditions of the industry to suchan extent that it would, in their view, be unwise to proceed with theexisting Bill. If, however, the Bill were dropped the Minister ofTransport would probably find it necessary to press for early legislation dealing separately with the question of crew accommoda-tion in fishing vessels.The Cabinet-Agreed  that   in  present  circumstances  it  would  be inexpedient to proceed further with the Sea Fish industry the Cabinet&apos;s attention was drawn to a Question to be put tothe Attorney-General on 21st November by Mr. P. Piratin, M.P.,asking whether the Government would introduce legislation making it illegal to include in tenancy agreements clauses preventing-tenants from granting sub-leases to coloured persons. The cabinet were informed that under the common law the courts might hold thatsuch.a clause was invalid as being contrary to public policy.Ministers were, however, agreed that the Question should be answered on the basis that it would not in any event be practicable tointroduce legislation On this subject at this stage in the lifetime ofthe present Parliament.Town and country planning.DevelopmentCharges.(previous reference:C.M.(48)24thConclusions,Minute 7.)2. Reference was made to the debate in the House of Lords onthe previous day on the administration of the Town and country planning Acts. In the course of that debate it had been suggestedthat District Valuers had no objective standards by which to judge the amount of a development charge, and that in the course of nego-tiations on the fixing of charges there was often a wide variationU-i____5-1-. -  CUtStWCCil fiifci iigsuggested and the figure finally charged.The Cabinet were informed that the Central Housing AdvisoryCommittee had also expressed concern about the high level ofdevelopment charges. There appeared to be a general impression that the administration of the system of development charges was having the effect of frustrating desirable development.The Cabinet-Invited the Prime Minister to appoint a small Committeeof Ministers to examine the principles on which the CentralLand Board were operating in the fixing of developmentcharges.Wages Policy. 3.   The Minister of Labour referred to the decision of the(Previous Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions to pressReference: their application for an increase in wages of  1 a week.- The ship-CM. (49) 66th building workers had originally advanced this claim on the basisConclusions, that the proposed increase in wages could be found out of the profitsMinute 2.)&apos; of the industry, and the employers had rejected the application.The Confederation would now ask for a conference with the37918-3 b 2
employers : this request would doubtless be granted, but the outcome of the negotiations would almost certainly be that the einployerswould refuse to concede the claim. While the Trade Union Congresshad not yet set out its policy in detail, it had said enough to make clear its view that wage claims of this character should not be pressed in present circumstances.There was general agreement that the Government should notintervene at this stage but should await the outcome of the conference between the Confederation and employers.commonwealth relations.India(ConsequentialProvision)Bill.(previous reference:CM. (49)64thConclusions,Minute 2.)Council ofEurope.(previous reference:CM. (49) 62ndConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Commonwealth Relations (CP. (49) 234)reporting the course of the discussion which had been held with theSecretary-General of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, inpursuance of the Cabinet&apos;s decision of 7th November, about the formand content of the India (Consequential Provision) Bill.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said that sir Girja Bajpai had seen the advantages of confining this Bill, asthe Cabinet wished, to a simple declaratory provision designed to preserve unaltered, until provision was made to the contrary, theexisting position of India and Indian citizens under the law of theUnited Kingdom and Colonies. He had undertaken to representthe advantages of this course to the Government of India. Theresult of his representations to his Ministers was not yet known.Meanwhile, the draft Bill had been revised in the light of the cabinet&apos;s decision of 7th November and of the discussion with sir Girja Bajpai, and a copy of the revised draft was annexed to cp. (49) 234.The Cabinet were informed that the revised draft of the bill had been considered by the Lord Chancellor and the Attorney-General, who were satisfied that, subject to certain drafting amend-ments which they had suggested, it was now in a form in which itwas least likely to provoke Parliamentary difficulties.The Cabinet-(1) Subject to confirmation that legislation on these lines would meet the views of the Government of India, agreed inprinciple that a Bill should be introduced on the linesof the draft annexed to CP. (49) 234 with a view to its being passed before the end of the current Session.     ,.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations to submit the text of the Bill for detailed examination bythe Legislation Committee.&quot; &apos;5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (49) 230) reporting the conclusions reached at theSecond Session of the Committee of Ministers held in Paris from3rd to 5th November, 1949. The Committee of Ministers had accepted many of the Assembly&apos;s recommendations but, in deference to the views of certain Ministers who did not wish to ask theirParliaments to accept amendments of the Statute at this early stage,an endeavour had been made to meet these recommendations withoutamendment of the Statute.In discussion the following points were made : (a) Certain sections of the Assembly had tried to depart fromthe arrangement by which each country paid the expenses of itsdelegates and the Committee of Ministers had control over thenumber of standing committees which were set up. The UnitedKingdom Government could not, however, agree to relax their control over expenditure incurred by delegates from this country.
USBrusselsTreaty:consultative council.(previous reference:C.M.(48)54thConclusions.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (49) 236) reporting on the proceedings of the SeventhSession of the Consultative Council of the Brussels Treaty Powersheld in Paris on 7th November.In discussion the following points were made &apos;:- (a) The Lord Chancellor said that his attention had been called to the terms of a Convention negotiated through the Brussels Treatymachinery which was open to some legal objection from the UnitedKingdom point of view. He hoped that in future either he or theLaw Officers would be consulted at an early stage in negotiationsunder the Treaty for Conventions involving questions of law.The Foreign Secretary undertook to look into this point.(&amp;) The Consultative Council had agreed on the need for a clearpicture of the nature of the Western Union defence commitments and their cost, and it had been suggested that this should beprepared by the Ministers of Defence and Finance at their nextmeetings. The Ministers of Defence were due to meet in thefollowing week, and it would then be possible to judge when theMinisters of Finance could usefully meet for discussion of thisquestion. The position was seriously complicated by the refusal ofthe Belgian Government to make an equitable contribution towardsthe cost of Western Union defence.The Cabinet-Took note of CP. (49) 236.Suggestions that there should be a financial pool from which allexpenses would be met could not be entertained, since standing committees would then be created without regard to financial considerations, and there would be continual pressure for an increasein any general funds available for such activities.(b) The Strasbourg Assembly could not be allowed to exercise any form of control over the Organisation for European economic co-operation, nor to build up machinery which duplicated existing organisations for handling economic questions. ,(c) Members of the Assembly had come to see the undesirabilityof continuing the system of appointing substitutes. Although theproposal they had put to the Committee of Foreign Ministers had suggested that membership of the Assembly should be doubled inorder to compensate for the abolition of substitutes, they would infact be satisfied with a moderate increase in membership. TheCommittee of Ministers had in mind an increase of about 10 per cent.(d) The Foreign Secretary was arranging for the staffing ofthe Assembly to be further examined. The position was complicated by the fact that the Chairman of the Assembly had assumed variousexecutive responsibilities. This was in accord with continentalpractice, and was probably necessary for the successful conduct ofthe first Assembly, but might lead to difficulties if it continued fortoo long or developed too far.(e) It would be preferable, if practicable, to hold the next meeting of the Assembly in September, rather than August.The Cabinet-Took note of OP. (49) 230 and of the points raised in discussion.
Germany.Meeting ofUnited King-dom, UnitedStates andFrench foreign ministers.(previous reference erence:G.M.(49)26thConclusions,Minute 3.)7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (49) 237) reporting on the discussions held in Parison 9th and 10th November, 1949, between the Foreign Ministers ofthe United Kingdom, the United States and France on future policy towards Germany.The Foreign Secretary said that the establishment of the high commission and of the German Federal Government at Bonn inSeptember last had marked the end of a stage of Allied policy towards Germany. New problems had begun to emerge, and he had.therefore thought it advisable to take advantage of the meetings inParis of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe andof the Consultative Council of the Brussels Treaty Powers to invitethe United States Secretary of State and the French ForeignMinister to meet for discussion of certain urgent questions,particularly those relating to the dismantling programme. Thedecisions reached had been embodied in a Directive addressed to thethree High Commissioners, a copy of which was annexed to cp. (49) 237. This was intended as a general guide for the develop-ment of Allied policy in Germany and as a basis for negotiation withthe German Federal Chancellor. The most important and difficultpart of the discussions had been concerned with the related problemsof reparations and dismantling, but it had finally been agreed thata number of plants should be removed from the list of those scheduledto be dismantled, provided that the German Federal Governmentgave the necessary assurances of security and evidence of their goodintentions. These concessions would not involve any increase in the agreed ceiling of 11-1 million tons per annum for German steel production; and, in general, the oil plants would be retained forthe purpose of refining crude oil and not for the production of synthetic oil. Both he and the United States Secretary of State had strongly opposed a French proposal that the German Governmentshould be required to compensate the Governments represented onthe Inter-Allied Reparations Agency for the loss of reparations bythe supply of plant of an equivalent value, and this suggestion hadnot been pressed. He hoped that the policy laid down in the directive would not only ensure uniformity of policy on the partof the Western Occupying Powers, but would also provide a firmfoundation for future progress. An opportunity for a furtherevolution in policy towards Germany would be provided by the review of the Occupation Statute, which was due to take place in ayear&apos;s time.The Cabinet-Took note of CP. (49) 237, and endorsed the decisions reached at the meeting of Foreign Ministers in Paris as setout in the Directive to the High Commissioners.Divorce. 8.   Attention was drawn to a statement made by the Pope inPapal addressing the Union of Italian Catholic Jurists in Rome onPronounce- 6th November, 1949, to the effect that Roman Catholic Judgesment. should not, except for very important reasons, grant a civil divorcein the case of a marriage which was valid in the eyes of the roman catholic Church.The Lord Chancellor said that, while it had to be borne in mind that King&apos;s Bench Judges tried divorce suits on circuit, there wasonly one Roman Catholic Judge in the Probate, Divorce and admiralty Division, and that Judge had not communicated to himany difficulty he might have felt, following the statement by the pope. By his oath, a Judge was bound to do right according to thela/ws and usages of the realm.In discussion, it was suggested that, since justice should notonly be done but should also appear to be done, there was a risk that
litigants in divorce suits who came before a Roman Catholic Judgemight feel some doubt whether they would receive impartial justice;and that it would be desirable either to secure that Roman CatholicJudges did not sit in the Divorce Division or to obtain from any whocontinued to do so a clear statement that they did not regard themselves as bound by the Pope&apos;s pronouncement.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord Chancellor to consider, in the light of theCabinet&apos;s discussion, what action he should take regardingthe Pope&apos;s pronouncement on the granting of divorces byRoman Catholic Judges.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,17th November, 1949.
