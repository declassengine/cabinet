Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in     the House of Commons in the following week.the House of A two-day debate on the economic situation would be held onCommons. Thursday, 14th July, and Monday, 18th July. There would be pressure for a similar debate in the House of Lords, but that debate could probably be postponed until later in the month.Divorce Laws.(previous reference erence:C.M.(49)22ndConclusions,Minute .1.)2. The Cabinet were informed that, when the Law Reform(Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill came forward for report and third reading on Friday, 8th July, Lieut.-Colonel Lipton, M.P., wouldmove an amendment to enable a husband or wife to secure a divorceif they had been separated for seven years. This was likely to command substantial support in the House of Commons. TheGovernment had made it clear that they could only support the Billif it was confined to relatively minor improvements in the law. this amendment, however, raised major issues : it would make it possiblefor one of the parties to a marriage to desert the other and in due course sue for a divorce : it would undoubtedly provoke controversy.In discussion, there was general agreement that the time wasripe for a review of the divorce laws by a Royal Commission, and thatthe amendment might well be carried in the House of Commonsunless an enquiry were promised. At the same time, it was recognised that the report of any Royal Commission was likely toraise acutely controversial issues, and might present a difficult&apos; problem for the Government of the day.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Government spokesmen should invite theHouse of Commons to reject Lieut.-Colonel Lipton&apos;amendment to the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions)Bill; and should, if necessary to secure its rejection,undertake that the Government would arrange for theappointment of a Royal Commission to review the law relating to divorce in England and Wales.industrial disputes.london dock Strike.(previous reference:CM. (49) 43rdConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Home Secretary said that the Emergencies Committeehad agreed that troops should be sent into the London Docks tounload food ships and it might be assumed that in due course theywould begin unloading the two Canadian ships which were the causeof the dispute. The Emergencies Committee were concerned at thedelay in securing a general resumption of work in the London Docks,and they recommended that the Government should announce that,unless the dockers had returned to work by Monday, 11th July, andthe Port of London was in full operation, a state of emergencywould be declared under the Emergency Powers Act, 1920.Some discussion ensued on the question whether the docksdispute should properly be regarded as a strike or a lock-out, sinceif it was a lock-out the declaration of a state of emergency might appear to be directed to breaking the lock-out. The Attorney-General said &quot;that, on the facts supplied to him by the police, he andthe Director of Public Prosecutions inclined to the view that in themain it was a lock-out by the employers. The employers had tacitlyaccepted for some weeks the refusal of the dockers to unload twoCanadian ships, in which there was a dispute between the ship-owners and the crew, but on 27th June they had indicated that men would not be engaged for work on other ships until work began onthe unloading of the Canadian ships. On such facts as he had beengiven, he considered that a lock-out must be held to exist, even inrespect of dockers who would have been engaged for ships cominginto the port after the dispute had begun. The Minister of Laboursaid that, under the continuity rule, dockers who were engaged in
unloading a ship completed the task without further engagement,and to the extent to which the dockers, after 27th June, had declined to continue to unload ships on which they were engaged, there wasa strike in progress.With regard to the effect of the declaration of a state ofemergency, it was pointed out that, if formal directions were givento the dock employers to unload ships and the employers called for volunteers, the dockers could not be prevented from volunteering tounload ships other than the two Canadian ships. This might tendto confuse the issue. In any event, the Act of 1920 appeared to bea somewhat heavy weapon to employ to secure the unloading of twoCanadian ships.At the same time, a continuance of the present dispute wasintolerable, especially at a time of grave economic crisis when it was essential that exports should move without hindrance. There couldbe no compromise on the issue that the dockers must unload shipswithout discrimination? If the Government once admitted the claim that dockers could decline to unload particular ships, there wouldbe endless difficulties in the future. It might be that new legislation was required to enable the Government to handle the situationeffectively.There was general agreement that the Emergencies Committeeshould consider the position again in the light of the Cabinet&apos;discussion.The Cabinet were informed that the police had little evidenceabout the activities of Communists in fomenting the yarious dockstrikes, though strikers were being advised by persons with legalexperience who had Communist sympathies. The Secretary of Statefor Commonwealth Relations had already suggested to variousCommonwealth Governments that they should collect and poolinformation about the ramifications of the organisation which wascausing disputes in ships and docks, and it would be useful if further enquiries could be made into this point in this country.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for a further discussion by the Emergencies Committee of the steps which should be taken in connection with the london dock strike, and to report further to the Cabinet.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to consider what steps shouldbe taken to obtain information about the activities of any organisation engaged in fomenting industrial disputes in docks and ships.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,7th July, 1949.
