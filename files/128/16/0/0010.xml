The EconomicsSituation.washington talks.(previous reference:Minute 2.)Devaluation.1. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Minister of fuel and Power (CP. (49) 175) covering the draft of a brief for theforthcoming Ministerial talks in Washington, which had been pre-pared by a group of officials &quot;of the DepaTtments-primarily concernedunder the general direction of the Minister of Fuel and Power andthe Economic Secretary, Treasury.The Prime Minister said that since the Cabinet&apos;s discussions in the last week of July he had discussed with the ministers immediately concerned whether devaluation of the pound wouldmitigate the short-term difficulties of the dollar balance &apos;of pay-ments, but for reasons of security no reference to this&apos;questi6n-hadbeen included in the draft brief circulated with CP. (49) 175.Opinion had hardened in favour of devaluation, although it was realised that this would not in itself provide a solution of the long-term problem. He recommended that the Foreign Secretary andChancellor of the Exchequer should be authorised to discuss devalu-ation at Washington and to form a view, in the light of those discussions, on the amount and the timing of this measure.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was impossible toshow&apos;arithme^ woiil&amp; prove1 fo* be&apos; air advan-tageous1 istep td&apos;take,!ariditvwas^doubtful&apos;whether any considerablebenefits would accrue by way of increased dollar receipts. an atmosphere had, however, been created in this country, in the UnitedStates and in other countries in which the pound could not reachstability without devaluation. If there was a reasonable prospect that stability could be secured by this means, and if assurances couldbe obtained f rom the U&quot;nited States Government that they would not take measures that would&quot; defeat&quot; the&apos; purpose of&apos; devaluation, then he believed devaluation&apos;would On balance be of advantage to thiscountry. JtJ was,&quot; however, important that the United KingdomGovernment should^ consult the United States Government about thelevel to which the pound should be devalued^ If the level were fixed .iW high it inignt hie riecessaryJ to devalue again, which would have serious Repercussions bh the stability of :tne&apos;lpNound;&apos; ^andyif the levelwere fixed too low; the United Spates Government might feel com-f&quot; elled to take measures to mitigate the cohseguencesf satisfactory understandings were reached with the United&apos;StatesGovernment on devaluation, the operation should be carried out as quickly as possible after the conclusion Of the discussions- in washington. He believed that devaluation need not cause more thana 3^ per cent, increase in the cost of living in this country.In discussion there was general agreement that, if satisfactoryunderstandings could be reached with the United States Govern-ment, it would be to the interests&apos;bf fliis country to devalue the pound. Devaluation should give greater stability to tfce pound andmigftt have the short-term advantage of assisting in building up- the reserves of the sterling area. Exports from this country to theUnited States would bring in more sterling since the sterlingequivalent of their dollar earnings would be increased, and devalu-ation should secure that the prices of British manufactures were more effectively competitive in the United States. Admittedly, rawmaterials and food imported from the dollar area would cost more in sterling, but this would provide an incentive for the fullexploitation of non-dollar sources and might result in some reductionof dollar prices. One of the objects of the Washington talks wouldbe to ensure that the United States tariff was not administered ina way which detracted from the value of devaluation from theBritish point of view. It was not considered that devaluation would prejudice the Colonies adversely and some of them would benefit from increased sterling receipts from1 the&apos;sale of primary products in dollar areas. Most countries in the sterling area&apos; would probablyfollow the lead of the United Kingdom and devalue&apos;their currencies,but it was impossible to discuss the matter with them at this stage.
Attention was drawn to speculations in the press about devalu-ation and the date on which it might come into operation. these were doubtless due to intelligent forecasts of the probable courseof events during and after the Washington talks; The Cabinet were informed that the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of . theExchequer had it in mind to explain the intentions of the UnitedKingdom Government in regard to devaluation to the United states secretary of State and Secretary to the Treasury, at a preliminary meeting at which officials would not be present. It was mostimportant that Ministers in this country should not make any public reference to devaluation before the Washington talks or while they were in progress.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed in principle that the pound might be devalued if satisfactory understandings on consequential UnitedStates policy could be reached.(2) Authorised the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer to inform the Governments of the UnitedStates and Canada accordingly in the Washington talksand to discuss with them the extent to which the poundshould be devalued.External The Cabinet then discussed some of the external measures whichMeasures.      might be taken by this country, and the steps which might be takenby the United States and Canada, to meet the dollar crisis.Reference was made to the following points: :(a) From a political point of view, it was desirable to bring toan end the recurring financial crises which had seriouslyprejudiced the development of long-term policies by the UnitedStates and other western countries.(&amp;) It was clear from public statements made in Washington,and from Canadian sources that the United States and canadian government&apos;s would look to the Foreign Secretary and Chancellorof the Exchequer to put forward positive proposals in Washington.(c) While &quot;the Press in the United States and on the continent of Europe had been extremely critical of this country in recent months, there were signs that the United States Press were nowadopting a more understanding attitude, which was probably due in part to the fact that the United Kingdom Government had notendeavoured to counter the many unfair statements which had appeared recently in United States newspapers. On the other hand,there was much to be said for greater publicity in Europe about the contribution which this country had made to European recovery,which appeared to be inadequately appreciated abroad.(d) It would be necessary to question the policy of the UnitedStates War Department in requiring payment in dollars or gold for expenditure for which this country was liable in Germany and japan. This seemed to be contrary to the declared policy of theState Department and the United States Treasury.(e) The extent to which the United States Congress insisted onthe use of United States shipping for conveying to Europe suppliesunder the European Recovery Programme involved us in a serious loss of invisible exports. Apart from pressure by shipping interestsin the United States, the policy of Congress was to some degreedictated by strategic considerations and it might be desirable todiscuss the extent to which this country should enter into commit-ments to provide the United States with shipping in any major warin which the United States became involved.(/),Reference was made to the adverse balance of trade inrespect of oil, due to the rigid application of the principle of non-discrimination to which this country had agreed at the time whenthe American loan was negotiated. Preliminary discussions withthe European Administrator of the Economic Co-operation Ad-ministration suggested that the United States Government might37591-1 B,
be more forthcoming on non-discrimination than on the financing of Canadian wheat purchases from E.C.A. funds. Devaluationwould affect the oil situation by making sterling oil more attractive.In this and other respects the negotiation of a settlement with theUnited States Administration would occupy a considerable period,and the matter could not be finally cleared in the course of theforthcoming talks in Washington.(g) While it was desirable to reduce as far as practicable the dollar burden of emigrant remittances to Canada, a refusal to allowemigrants to take a small sum of sterling with them for use on arrival in Canada might seriously reduce the existing level ofemigration.Internal The Cabinet then discussed the references to reductions in measures. Government expenditure and to other internal measures in para-graphs 10-14, and in the summary of recommendations, of the draftbrief attached to CP. (49) 175. The Cabinet endorsed the steps which had already been taken to secure a reduction in government expenditure and agreed that the general aim should be to secure such reduction as was necessary in the public sector of expenditure,covering local authorities as well as Government Departments. Thereduction of public expenditure and any practicable curtailment of investment were to be regarded as measures to curb the inflationarytendencies which would otherwise follow upon devaluation. It was,however, the view of the Cabinet that the Foreign Secretary andthe Chancellor of the Exchequer should not discuss the details ofinternal measures with the United States and Canadian Govern-ments beyond saying that steps would be taken to prevent inflation.The Cabinet-(3) Agreed that reductions in public expenditure in thiscountry should not be discussed during the washington talks as a condition of any assistance by the United states or Canadian Governments; and that in any public announcement that might be made cuts in public expendi-ture should not be presented as connected with anyagreements reached in those talks.(4) Agreed that, on the conclusion of the Washington talks, theCabinet would consider what further measures were required to control inflationary pressure consequent ondevaluation. . /The following points were also made in the discussion: (h) Attention was drawn to the desirability of keeping other commonwealth Governments informed as fully as possible of thecourse of the Washington negotiations. The Cabinet were informedthat the necessary arrangements for this were being made.(i) In paragraph 22 of the memorandum annexed to cp. (49) 175 it was stated that, before Ministers left forWashington, an attempt would be made to estimate the value interms of dollars of the various short-term measures proposed in that memorandum. The Cabinet were informed that this estimate had now been drawn up; and the Chancellor of the Exchequer under-took to circulate it for the information of his colleagues.(/). Special attention was drawn to the conclusions set put inAppendix C of CP. (49) 175 regarding the limited extent to whichcommodity agreements could assist in increasing the dollar earnings of the sterling area. The Cabinet discussed and approved the con-clusions set out in this Appendix.In conclusion, the Prime Minister said that he had in mind that the progress of the Washington talks should be watched on the cabinets behalf by a small group of Ministers, consisting of thePresident of the Board of Trade, the Minister of Fuel and Power,the Economic Secretary to the Treasury and himself.
The Cabinet-(5) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for a small group of Ministers to watch the course of the washington talks on behalf of the Cabinet.Wages Policy.Retail TradeWages.(previous reference:C.M.(49)52ndConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Minister of Labour said that since the cabinets discussion on 12th August he had given further consideration to therecommendations of the Wages Councils for increased minimumwages in certain branches of the retail distributive trades. the issues involved had also been discussed with the Foreign secretary and the President of the Board of Trade, and with the Secretaryof the Trades Union Congress. He found great difficulty in rejectingoutright proposals for wage adjustments put forward by the wages councils. If he declined to make Wages Regulation Orders on thebasis of recommendations put forward by the Councils, wages inthese trades would continue to be unregulated; if, on the other hand,he directly or indirectly suggested rates of minimum wages whichhe would be prepared to approve, this would be tantamount to the fixing of wages by the Government. The minimum rates in certain branches of retail distribution were low and increases could be justi-fied within the framework of the White Paper on Personal Incomes,Costs and Prices : indeed, the revised rates were no higher than those already being paid by co-operative societies and various multiplestores. If the recommendations of these Councils were not approved,the matter was likely to be raised at the annual conference of theTrades Union Congress and subsequently in Parliament, and the case for withholding approval was not sufficiently strong to enable theGovernment to emerge with credit from any public discussion of the issues involved.In discussion it was argued that a refusal to accept these recom-mendations would do great harm to the procedure of industrialarbitration at a time when in other fields (e.g. the wages claims ofthe colliery winding men) the Government were encouragingrecourse to arbitration. Moreover, the negotiations about minimum rates of wages in retail distribution had been spread over a long period of time, and there would be serious criticism of any tacticswhich appeared to involve still further delays. The increasesjpro-posed were relatively small in amount. There was no reason to admitWithout examination claims for corresponding increases in profit margins since the increased labour costs should be met by increased efficiency. It was suggested that all the recommendations shouldnot be approved simultaneously, but a start should be made byapproving orders relating to some of the trades involved, notablyretail food and hairdressing, and this would enable more time to be devoted to the more difficult cases, such as the drapery trade, wherethe proposed rates had been referred back for further examination.The Cabinet-(1) Reversed their earlier decision of 12th August and authorised the Minister of Labour to approve such ofthe proposals for wage adjustments (described in cp. (49) 173) in the retail distributive trades as he con-sidered to be consistent with the principles set out in theWhite Paper on Personal Incomes, Costs and Prices.(2) Invited the Minister of Labour to arrange that the decisions in respect of the various trades concerned should not betaken and announced simultaneously but at intervals overthe next few weeks.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,29th August, 1949.
