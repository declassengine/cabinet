Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in     the. House of Commons in the following week,the House of The Lord President said that the Middlesex County CouncilCommons, were unlikely to withdraw their opposition to the Parliament SquareBill; arid he and the Lord Privy Seal agreed that, if this opposition were maintained, the Bill could not be passed before the end of thecurrent Session.Amendment 2.   When the Parliament Bill had been brought forward for theof the third time in the House of Lords on 29th November the motion for parliament its Second Reading had been negatived by 110 votes to 37.   TheAct. Cabinet were informed that, as a result of enquiries made since their(Previous meeting on 24th November, it could reasonably be assumed that this reference: action of the House of Lords would be regarded as a rejection of cm.

(49) 67thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations saidthat the Government of India had welcomed the suggestion that thelegislation required to preserve the existing position of India and indian citizens under the law of the United Kingdom and Coloniesafter India became a Republic on 26th January, 1950, should takethe form proposed in the draft India (Consequential Provision) bill which the Cabinet had discussed on 17th November. The SecondReading of the Bill was to be taken in the House of Commons on 5th December. The Secretary of State was consulting leadingrepresentatives of the Opposition Parties, and he had good reasonto believe that the Bill would pass through the House of Commonswithout controversy.Council of 4.   At the first meeting of the Assembly of the Council ofEurope. Europe an attempt had been made to break through the control(Previous       exercised by the Committee of Ministers over the meetings ofReference:      Standing Committees of the Assembly.   The proposals made forCM.(49)67th   this purpose had been rejected by the Committee of Ministers at conclusions,     their meeting on 3rd-5th November, when they had confirmed the minute 5.)      arrangement by which each country paid the expenses of its owndelegates, and had sanctioned meetings of only three of the standing committees of the Assembly.   The Secretariat of the Council had now, however, proposed that a meeting of a fourth committee (theEconomic Committee) should be held in Paris in December, on thebasis that the costs of the meeting would be defrayed from funds available to the Council though the delegates would look to theirrespective Governments to defray their expenses.   The ForeignOffice, basing themselves on the views expressed at the Novembermeeting of the Committee of Ministers and the decision taken bythe Cabinet on 17th November, had assumed that they should not pay any expenses incurred by the United Kingdom members of thisCommittee in attending this meeting.   They had taken steps toascertain how the other Governments were proposing to handle this situation, but they had not so.far received any replies to these enquiries.   It was, however, known that the Conservative memberof the Committee would attend this meeting, if it were held, andwould, if necessary, pay his own expenses; and the question had37966-2 b 2
therefore been raised whether the Labour members of the Committeeshould go at their own expense or whether other steps could be takento prevent the meeting from being held.The Cabinet were informed that the position had been discussed at a meeting of Government supporters who had attended theAssembly in Strasbourg. At this meeting there had been a general feeling that, if this Committee met and the United Kingdom were represented only by the Conservative member, there would be a revival of the criticism that the Government and the Labour party were not giving their whole-hearted support to the Council ofEurope. This sort of criticism was also likely to be voiced andexploited in many of the European countries. It was therefore1suggested that, if the meeting was to be held, and was to be attended by representatives of most of the members of the Council of Europe,the United Kingdom Government would be ill-advised to appear tobe boycotting it.On the other side it was argued that this meeting was being organised in defiance of the expressed views of the Committee ofMinisters, and was a direct challenge to their authority. Moreover,the meeting was to be held in Paris, at a time when important and difficult discussions would be taking place in the Organisation for european Economic Co-operation; and there was little doubt thatthe occasion would be exploited by those who were anxious to extend the authority of the Council of Europe to matters covered by that organisation. It seemed clear that some of the members of theCommittee of Ministers, under pressure from their own Parliaments,were showing reluctance to stand by the Committee&apos;s decision onthis point, to which they had been parties. This, however, was nota good reason why the United Kingdom Government should departfrom that decision: on the contrary, they should make every effort to persuade the other Governments concerned to stand by it. Anyother course could not fail to undermine the authority of the Com-mittee of Ministers. The Cabinet were informed that the foreign secretary was strongly of this opinion.Ministers recognised that it would not be practicable, by with-holding foreign currency or otherwise, to prevent United kingdom delegates from attending this meeting at their own expense. TheLabour members of the Committee would, however be willing tocomply with a request from the Government that they should notattend. And every effort should be made to ensure that as many aspossible of the other Governments concerned would take such steps as were open to them to dissuade their representatives fromattending.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to arrange for a statement to be made,in answer to a Parliamentary Question, not later than5th December, explaining the reasons why His Majesty&apos;sGovernment deprecated the proposal that a meeting ofthe Economic Committee of the Assembly of the Councilof Europe should be held in Paris in December.(2) Asked the Lord President to explain the position to the twoGovernment supporters who were members of this Com-mittee and to advise them that, if the meeting were held,they should not attend it.(3) Invited the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for for Foreign Affairs to arrange for further representa-tions to be made to all the Governments concerned with aview to persuading as many of them as possible to adhere to the decision taken by the Committee of Ministers attheir meeting on 3rd-5th November.
Parliament.legislative programme for the 1950Session.(previous reference;C.M.(49)35thConclusions,Minute 1.)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (49) 240) submitting a programme of government legislation for the 1950 Session.The Lord President said that, in view of the inevitableuncertainty about the length of this last Session of the present parliament, he could not ask the Cabinet to take firm decisions about the composition of this programme. He suggested that theyshould provisionally approve the list of Bills in Annex &quot;A&quot; of cp. (49) 240 and should leave it to the Legislation Committee tokeep the position under review and to add to the programme, as required, any of the Bills included in Annex &quot; B &quot; of that paper which might become ready for introduction in time to have areasonable prospect of passing into law before the Session ended.In this final Session it was more than usually important that asufficient number of big, medium and small Bills should be ready for presentation immediately the Session opened; and he hoped thatall the Departmental Ministers concerned would assist him byensuring that Bills included in Annex &quot; A &quot; of CP. (49) 240 weremade ready for introduction at the earliest possible moment.In discussion the following points were raised : (a) The Cabinet were informed that the Minister of Defencenow recognised that there was no prospect of securing the passageof the Court Martial Procedure Bill during the 1950 Session.(b) The Government might be embarrassed if the DiplomaticPrivileges (Extension) Bill were brought forward before the com-pletion of the inquiry which was to be held into the content and extent of diplomatic privilege as a result of complaints about theactivities of the Tass Agency. It was also arguable that this Billshould not take precedence over the legislation now in contemplationto confer diplomatic privilege on the representatives in this country of other Members of the Commonwealth. For both these reasons it would be preferable that this Bill should not be brought forwardearly in the 1950 Session.(c) The Home Secretary said that the Allied Forces (Amend-ment) Bill would be required if, as now seemed likely, an agreement was concluded between the Western Union Powers regarding thetreatment to be accorded to the Armed Forces of one of those powers in the territory of another.(d) Ministers agreed that none of the Bills in Annex &quot; B &quot; of cp. (49) 240 was likely to find a place in the programme for the1950 Session. In particular, a Leasehold Enfranchisement bill could hardly be passed in the life of the present Parliament. Thereport of the Leasehold Committee would not be received in timeto enab!&apos; the necessary legislation to be prepared. Indeed, itmight be more convenient politically if the report of that Committeewere not presented until after the Election.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed in principle that, subject to the omission of theCourt Martial Procedure Bill, the list of Bills in annex &quot; A &quot; of CP. (49) 240 should be accepted as thelegislative programme for the 1950 Session.(2) Invited the Legislation Committee to keep this programmeunder review according to the progress of the Session.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,1st December, 1949.
