(previous reference:G.M.(49)6thConclusions,Minute 1.) iDefence 1.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the PrimeEstimates.      Minister (CP. (49) 245) reporting the recommendations of theDefence Committee on the Defence Estimates for 1950-51.The Prime Minister said that the Defence Committee had givenprolonged consideration to the size and shape of the Armed Forcesover the next few years and had decided to recommend that theprovision for defence in the 1950-51 Estimates should amount to 780 million. They had agreed upon this figure on the under-standing that, if it were shown to be insufficient to meet the expendi-ture on essential equipment which the Defence Committee mightthereafter decide to be necessary for the Services, the balance shouldbe met by supplementary estimates. Substantial sums would now have to be spent on re-equipment, partly. because of obligationsundertaken in connection with Western Union and the Atlantic pact and partly because war stocks were becoming exhausted. There wasalso a marked fall in the appropriations-in-aid derived from thesale of surplus stores. Substantial economies in the administrationof the three Services had been approved and the propoius now beforethe Cabinet assumed that these economies were carried into effect.The Minister of Defence pointed out that, as a result of thelong and careful scrutiny of defence expenditure in the last fewmonths, he was satisfied that the Services were organised on aseconomical a basis as could be devised, in view of the heavyresponsibilities which they had to bear. The restriction of defence expenditure to  780 million in 1950-51 meant that grave risks wouldhave to be accepted.In discussion attention was drawn to the fact that under the plans proposed in CP. (49) 245 the Air Force would be small inrelation to the vital task which it would have to perform on theoutbreak of any war and, in particular, that it had been foundnecessary, in order to preserve a greater first line, to economise in itsreserves. The defence of the United Kingdom against air attack was a most important defence commitment and one on which no direct assistance was likely to be provided by Allied forces. would it not be possible, within the same total of expenditure, to increasethe reserves of the fighter force at the expense of some less vitalservic \ In reply it was pointed out that the proposals in cp. (49) 245 were deliberately aimed at doubling the first-linefighter strength, and making some increase in first-line bomberstrength, at the expense of the reserves of aircraft. From the pointof view of preventing war, a larger front-line strength was more effective than a balanced supply of reserves. From the point ofview of preparedness for war, it should be borne in mind that it took longer to train air crews and ground staff than to provide additional aircraft. Moreover, the cost of aircraft had greatlyincreased since the war and types tended to become obsolescent?uickly. There was, therefore, advantage in expanding trainingacilities, while recognising that reserves of aircraft would haveto be augmented at snort notice when a warning was received thathostilities might be expected in the near future.It was the view of the Cabinet that the strength of the fighteiforce in this country should be kept under constant review.There was general agreement that in present circumstances high priority must be given to the provision and maintenance of forces stationed throughout the world for the purpose of deterring a potential aggressor. This necessarily meant that larger numbers ofmen were required in the Army than would have been the case ifthe sole aim of policy was to secure an integrated fighting force ofall three arms for active hostilities.In regard to the ultimate threat of war, it was pointed out thatthe potential enemy had at his disposal formidable/land and airforces and that the naval threat was serious, particularly from38012-3 B 9
submarines and mines. In this connection, the Chief of the Air Staffdrew attention to the fact that the plan in CP. (49) 245 assumed a warning period before hostilities began, during which an acceleratedproduction of warlike stores could be undertaken. He estimated thatin present circumstances this period should be not less than eighteen months. This would run from the time when political indicationsappeared that a state of increased international tension was developing.The plan now before the Cabinet took full account of theassistance which other signatories to the Brussels Treaty andAtlantic Pact could provide in the event of war. It was difficult tomake any precise comparison between expenditure on defence by thiscountry and by the other signatories to the Brussels Treaty andAtlantic Pact. On a per capita basis the defence expenditure ofthe United States Government was considerably higher than ourown : it was difficult to find comparable figures in terms of national income. Certain countries in Western Europe, notably Belgium,were spending very much less on defence than this country, thoughthe expenditure by&quot; France and some other European countries was increasing.The general survey in CP. (49) 245 would be of value to theForeign Minister in discussing at the Colombo Conference whatcontribution other members of the Commonwealth might make to commonwealth defence.As regards the effects of the proposals in CP. (49) 245 on civil defence preparations, it was the general view of the Cabinet that itwas undesirable at present that overt action on a large scale shouldbe undertaken in the field of civil defence, since this might create amisleading impression at the present stage of the defence negotia-tions with other countries in Western Europe. The state of civil defence preparations would, however, have to be kept under constantexamination in relation to developments in the field of active defence.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the provision for defence in the 1950-51Estimates should amount to  780 million, on the under-standing that, if this amount was shown to be insufficient to meet the expenditure on essential equip-ment which the Defence Committee might thereafteragree to be necessary for the Services, the necessarybalance would be niet by way of supplementary estimates.No work should, however, be undertaken which wouldrequire finance by supplementary estimate, without the prior approval of the Defence Committee.(2) Took note of the general strategic conception on which theprovision for defence would be based, as outlined by theChiefs of Staff in Annex C of CP. (49) 245, but expressed the view that the strength of the fighter defenceof the United Kingdom should be kept under close examination.(3) Invited the Minister of Defence to bring forward on some future occasion his proposal for a three-year defence budget.(4) Agreed that, for security reasons, all copies of CP. (49) 245and the corresponding Defence Committee documentsshould be returned to the Secretary of the Cabinet.2. The Cabinet were informed that the men on strike at thepower stations at Brimsdown, Barking and Taylor&apos;s Lane were going back to work later that day and that there would be an orderlyhanding over of work from the troops to civilian workers. It was believed that the men on strike elsewhere would also return to workand there could therefore be a general withdrawal of the troops frompower stations.   A number of naval ratings had been brought toElectricityStrike.(previous reference erence:CM. (49) 59thConclusions,Minute 3.)
Woolwich in case of trouble at Battersea, Deptford or Fulham power stations and it was proposed to hold these men for the rest of theday, but thereafter to release them if the trouble seemed at an end.The Prime Minister said that, while the responsibility forinstituting any prosecutions under the Conspiracy and Protection ofProperty Act, 1875, rested with the Attorney-General, it would assist the Attorney in reaching a decision if he could be informedwhether further trouble among electricity supply workers was likelyto be caused by the initiation of prosecutions against some of thepresent strikers.The Minister of Labour said that, as this Act had neverpreviously been invoked, he thought its use might&apos; have undesirablerepercussions.The Cabinet were informed that the British ElectrifyAuthority had been anxious that prosecutions should be initiatedand material had been collected in respect of three of the ring-leaders, but the view of the Authority would change if the strikeended.The Attorney-General said that as the strike had nowended he would not propose to institute any proceedings underthe Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875.The Cabinet then considered whether civil actions for damagesshould be brought against the strikers by the British electricity authority. They were informed that the Chaiman of the authority had been disinclined to take civil proceedings, on the ground thatthe numbers involved were too great; but it was pointed out that inthe past equally large numbers of coal-miners had been penalised for breach of contract. The procedure had been to take a few cases tothe county court and to make corresponding deductions from pay inrespect of all who had broken their contract. It would be difficultto continue to use this procedure in the coal-mining industry if itwere not applied in flagrant cases elsewhere, such as the presentelectricity strike. The procedure brought home to the rank and filethe folly of having broken their engagements at the behest ofhumiliation which the ring-leaders suffered through the failure ofthe strike would soon be forgotten and further trouble might ensue.While the present strike seemed to have been broken, there mightwell be further trouble in the future since the political forces whichwere at the root Of the present strike would continue to operate. Theview was expressed that, if the British Electricity Authority did not wish to take civil proceedings for breach of contract because thestrike had been broken promptly and proceedings might savour ofvictimisation, they should at least announce their intention to takecivil proceedings for any future breaches of contract and shouldpost notices to that effect in power stations.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he proposed toexamine with the Chairman of the British Electricity Authority the efficacy of the arrangements for maintaining electricity supplies which had been made during the present strike. These had been reasonably successful, but he thought they could be improved upon.-.&apos;... The Minister of Fuel and Power said that in his further discussions with the Chairman of the British electricity authority he would bear in mind the views which had been expressed in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion.38012-33 3
3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (49) 248) inviting them to decide in principle to accord de jure recognition to the Communist Government of Chinaat an early date.The Foreign Secretary said that for the reasons indicated in his paper the interests of the United Kingdom Government would be best served by according early recognition to the Communist Govern-ment of China. He had done his best to ensure that a common policy would be followed in this matter by all Governments friendly to thiscountry; and, although it was now clear that the United StatesGovernment would not follow this lead, he had good reason tobelieve that a large number of other friendly Governments wouldbe willing to accord recognition in the near future. He had at onetime hoped that it would be possible to delay this decision until therehad been an opportunity for discussion with other commonwealth governments at the Commonwealth meeting on Foreign affairs which was to open at Colombo on 9th January; but the Governmentof India, in particular, were anxious to accord recognition beforethe end of the year and he now thought it would be wiser if theUnited Kingdom Government also chose a date towards the end ofthe current month. He did not wish to act much before then, sincethe Netherlands Government were anxious not to accord thisrecognition until after their transfer of power in Indonesia. Hethereafter recommended that recognition should be accorded duringthe course of the next three or four weeks, and asked that the cabinet should leave him discretion to determine the precise date. .In discussion the following points were raised : (a) The Secretary of Slate for Commonwealth Relations saidthat the Government of India would probably accord recognitionwell before the end of the current month, but would, understand our reasons for delaying our own recognition until a slightly later date.The Governments of Canada, Pakistan and Ceylon were prepared to accord recognition, and would probably be willing to do so on anyearly date which might be proposed by the United Kingdom Govern-ment. The South African Government, though realising that recognition was inevitable, did not wish to be among the first batchof countries to accord it. The views of the new Governments ofAustralia and New Zealand were not known; but they wouldprobably have preferred that there should be an opportunity fordiscussion at the Colombo Conference before recognition wasaccorded.(6) From the point of view of Colonial Governments it wouldbe preferable that recognition should be delayed until about29th December, so that effective arrangements for local publicitycould be made.(c) It would not be necessary to acknowledge the de facto control which the Nationalists still exercised over Formosa.    For in law? Formosa was still part of Japan; and our attitude towards theauthorities controlling it could properly be reserved until thequestion of sovereignty over Formosa was finally determined in theJapanese peace settlement.(d) The Home Secretary said that it was proposed that thepresent Chinese Ambassador in London and certain members of his staff should be allowed to continue to reside in this country if they wished to do so; &quot;Most of the Chinese temporarily resident in theUnited Kingdom could return to China without risk of hardship;but there would be a few who might have to be allowed to remainhere because their lives would be in danger if they returned to China.(e) It would be convenient if the Foreign Office could ascertainfor how long the Communist Government of China would continueto recognise passports and other travel documents issued by theprevious Government.
-The Cabinet-.-&apos;       - - . v(1) Agreed that the United Kingdom Government should accordde jure recognition to the Communist Government ofChina at an early date; and authorised the foreign secretary to determine the precise date on which suchrecognition should be accorded.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for the Govern-ments of the other members of the Commonwealth and of friendly foreign Powers (including the United States)to be informed of this decision and of the date on whichrecognition was to be accorded, and to endeavour tosecure that as many as possible of them should recognise the new Chinese Government on or about the same date.Recognitionof StaffAssociationsfm thePost Office.4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Postmaster-General (CP. (49) 241 (Revise)) on the recognition of staff associations in the Post Office.The Postmaster-General said that claims for recognition had recently been submitted by four breakaway associations in the PostOffice. It had for many years been the Departmental practice to regard about 40 per cent, membership of the organised staff of agrade or grades as a requirement for the consideration of claims torecognition, but no precise definition of policy on the subject hadbeen laid down until 1946. Since then the so-called &quot; Listowelformula &quot; had obtained general currency and was widely interpreted as automatically entitling an association to official recognition assoon as it could establish that it comprised 40 per cent, of the gradeor grades which it represented. The two largest recognisedassociations, the Union of Post Office Workers and the Post office engineering Union, had, however, challenged the existing basis of recognition on the ground that it encouraged the growth of break-away bodies, and recognition of the new associations on that basis would undoubtedly provoke great resentment. The consequences ofthis situation might weli be serious,, since it was essential to retain the goodwill and co-operation of the existing associations both in securing increased productivity and in the field of staff relationsgenerally. In these circumstances, he recommended that Post Officepolicy on the recognition of new associations should now be re-statedin the terms set out in Appendix E to CP. (49) 241 (Revise), andthat the new criteria should be applied currently to all associationsnot now recognised, whether or not they had already fulfilled the numerical requirements of the Listowel formula. He would proposeto afford the Staff Sides of the National and Departmental WhitleyCouncils an opportunity to comment on the revised policy.The Cabinet-Approved the recommendations made in paragraphs and 10 of CP. (49) 241 (Revise).economic affairs.(previous reference:C.M.(49)65thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP. (49) 247) covering a report on the economicsituation.In discussion the Chancellor of the Exchequer gave the Cabinetdetailed information of recent changes in the United Kingdomholdings of gold and dollars.The Cabinet^-Took note of CP. (49) 247. and of the statement made bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Scotland.LegislativeandAdministrativeDevolution.(previous reference :CM. (48) 6thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Scotland (CP. (49) 251) on the campaign in Scotland forlegislative and administrative devolution.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that the ScottishConvention had been successful in attracting some support for itsproposal that there should be a measure of legislative devolution toa Scottish Parliament, and both the Liberal and Communist parties were officially associated with it. The Conservative Party had rejected the proposal for a separate Parliament, but were likely topress strongly for administrative devolution. The Labour Party inScotland had at one time pledged its support for legislative devolution, but recent Conferences of the Party had agreed that thepolicy laid down in the White Paper on Scottish Affairs (Cmd. 7308)should be given a fair trial. He himself considered that the time was not opportune for raising the question of Scottish Home Rule,and that the machinery established in pursuance of the White Paper.policy should ensure that Scottish needs and interests were takenfully into account by Government and Parliament. He had resisteddemands for an enquiry into the financial and economic relations:between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom on the groundthat the available information was already published and that suchan investigation would involve a wasteful^version of effort.The Cabinet-Endorsed the policy outlined in CP. (49) 251.Parliament 7    The Cabinefs attention was drawn to a difficulty which hadSquare arisen between the two Houses of Parliament over an amendment(Improve-       to the Parliament Square (Improvements) Bill.Dients) Bill.   -       Tn the House of Lords on 13th December the Government had(Previous       accepted an amendment moved by Viscount Simon which was reference:      designed to ensure that the Buxton memorial fountain should become. (49) 70th   re-erected in the Square unless it were agreed by resolution of bothConclusions,     Houses that it should be set up on another site.. The Minister of minute 1.)      Works had subsequently been advised that on a matter of this kindit would be more in accordance with modern practice under theStatutory Instruments Act to leave the views of Parliament to be expressed by way of negative resolution rather than require theGovernment to obtain an affirmative resolution from each House.When, therefore, the Lords&apos; amendment came before the commons on 14th December he had moved an amendment which had the effectof substituting the negative for the affirmative resolution procedure.The Conservative Opposition in the Commons had protested againstthe Ministers action in rejecting one day what the Government had accepted in the Lords on the previous day, but the amendment hadbeen carried.   Further protests had now been made by ViscountSimon, who charged the Government with breach of faith and indicated his intention of insisting upon his original amendment. Itwas clear that, if he did so, the Bill would be lost.In discussion the Cabinet recognised that on merits theprocedure of negative resolution was more appropriate for a matterof this kind. But the alternative procedure oi affirmative resolutionhad been accepted in the Lords as the price to be paid for securingthe passage of the Bill before the end of the Session. The cabinet were assured that the Opposition in the Lords would not insist upon their other amendment (about the encroachment of the carriage-wayupon the Canning enclosure) which the Commons had rejected; andthe only issue which need now prevent the passage of the Bill wasthat arising from the misunderstanding about the amendmentrelating to the Buxton memorial fountain. Ministers felt that itwould be most unfortunate if the Bill were lost solely on this account.They appreciated the awkwardness of inviting their supporters in
the Commons to reverse a decision which they had taken on theprevious day; but they considered that on balance this was the lesserof the two evils.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Government should give effect to thesubstance of the undertakings given by the government spokesman in accepting on 13th December the amendmentmoved by Viscount Simon, on the Committee. Stage of the parliament Square (Improvements) Bill, relating to theBuxton memorial fountain; and invited the Lord privy seal to arrange for Viscount Simon to be consultedregarding the most convenient means of giving effect to thisdecision.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,15th December, 1949.
