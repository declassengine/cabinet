The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the week following the end of trie SummerRpcess., Political 2.   The Lord President said that Government supporters wereActivities disturbed at the probable effects of the recommendations of theof Civil Masterman Committee on political activities by civil servants,-   ItServants.        appeared that the line distinguishing between those classes of civil(Previous       servants who were to be prohibited from active participation in reference:      politics and those to whom a greater latitude was to be allowed had.(49)41st   been so drawn by the Committee as to exclude from political activityConclusions     a number of civil servants who were at present undertaking valuableMinute 4.) &apos;    political work. It was understood that similar anxiety was felt bymembers of the Opposition Parties; and it was likely that theGovernment would be pressed to find time for the Committee&apos;s reportto be debated in the House of Commons.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that action to give effect to the recommendations ofthe Masterman Committee should be suspended for thetime being. &apos;&quot;&apos; W(2) Agreed that the Lord President should announce in theHouse of Commons that no action would be taken to giveeffect to the Committee&apos;s recommendations until theyhad been further discussed by the National whitley council and, if necessary, debated in Parliament.House of 3.   A confused debate had taken place in the House of LordsLords Reform, on the previous day on the motion by the Marquess of Reading(Previous       proposing that women who were Peers in their own right should reference:      Pe enabled to sit and vote in the House of Lords.  The motion had .M.(49)47th   finally been moved in an amended form proposing that steps should conclusions,    be taken to obtain leave to introduce legislation as soon as practicableMinute 3.)      to confer upon women Peers who under existing conditions were not qualified to take their seats in the Hoqse of Lords the same rights,duties and privileges as were enjoyed by male Peers.   government supporters had been advised to vote against this motion on theground that it implied support of the hereditary principle as a basis for the composition of the House of Lords.   The motion had beencarried by 45 votes to 27.Some Ministers felt that it might prove embarrassing to theGovernment that their supporters had voted against a motionadvocating the application of the principle of sex equality. other ministers felt that it was more important for Government supportersto have avoided supporting the hereditary principle. The lord privy Seal explained that he had endeavoured, without success, to persuade Lord. Reading and his friends to frame their motion interms of recommending that in any future proposals for altering the composition of the House of Lords women should be treated onan equality with men. In the event, however, the motion had beenbrought forward in a form which recommended that the House ofLords should be reinforced purely on the basis of heredity; and hehad thought it out of the question to.advise Government supportersto vote in favour of a motion in this form. The&apos; issues had becomegreatly confused in the debate, and for this reason he doubted whether the result was likely to cause the Government any political embarrassment.37382-4b 2

On 19th May the Government had approved, subject to consultation with the National Joint Advisory Council, the pro-posals in CP. (49) 107 for excluding untrustworthy persons from participation in secret Government work undertaken by contractors.The Cabinet were now informed that the National joint advisory Council, while supporting the general principle of exclud-ing untrustworthy persons from such work, were not satisfied withthe procedure proposed for dealing with appeals in individual cases.They were in particular doubtful about the proposal that use shouldbe made of the existing appeal tribunal set up for similar cases in the Civil Service. In addition, the Trades Union Congress were anxious that no statement should be made about this scheme until after their Annual Conference in September. In these circumstances it was suggested that the announcement of the scheme should be postponed until the autumn.Some Ministers thought it unfortunate that the introductionof the scheme should be subject to this further delay. There was,however, general agreement that, in view of the attitude taken bythe representatives of both sides of industry on the National joint advisory Council, it would be inexpedient to introduce the scheme at the present time.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the introduction of the scheme outlined in cp. (49) 107 should be deferred for the time being:(2) Invited the Minister of Defence and the Minister of labour to consider whether any alterations should be made inthe scheme to meet the views expressed by the national joint Advisory Council.The EconomicSituation.(previous reference:C.M.(49)48thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the economicsituation on the basis of the memorandum (CP.(49) 159) circulatedby the Lord President.The Lord President recalled that, at their earlier discussion on25th July, the Cabinet had considered what-proposals might be presented to the United States and Canadian Governments in theforthcoming negotiations in Washington. The position of theUnited Kingdom representatives at this meeting would be seriouslyweakened if His Majesty&apos;s Government had failed in the meantimeto give convincing proof of their determination to take all practicable steps to strengthen the economic and financial position of the UnitedKingdom. If nothing further were done until September, confidence in this country would decline further; and the rapid diminution ofour reserves would leave us little freedom for negotiation or powerto resist pressure for the acceptance of distasteful proposals. Forthese reasons he had thought it advisable to draw attention in cp. (49) 159 to certain disquieting aspects of the internal situationin the belief that prompt action would both safeguard the achieve-ments of the past four years and strengthen the hands of the UnitedKingdom Ministers in the forthcoming negotiations. There was some danger in excessive preoccupation with the external aspectsof the crisis : close attention should also be given to internal policies.He was, for instance, greatly disturbed at the extent of the inflation-tionary tendencies which had been revealed by E.P.C (49) 77, bythe repeated demands for higher wages, and by the recent evidenceof public indifference to the gravity, of the economic situation. Inthese circumstances he thought it was the Government&apos;s duty, notonly to seek all possible means of expanding exports, but also toexercise the strictest economy in public expenditure and in the useof man-power. The level of public expenditure was disturbinglyhigh, and in E.P.C (49) 76 the Chancellor of the Exchequer hadforecast that it would continue to rise. It seemed difficult to believethat a reduction of, say, 5 per cent, could not be made in a total
Government expenditure amounting to some  3,000 million; ancLitwas essential, in his view, that any Supplementary Estimates shouldbe balanced by equivalent savings. Would it not be advisable fora Ministerial Committee to review immediately the whole field ofGovernment expenditure? Similarly, he thought it should bepossible to make a substantial reduction in the total man-poweremployed in public administration, which now amounted to some,455,000 persons.The Prime Minister suggested that it would be useful first toconsider what was the nature of the relationship between internalfinancial policy and the deficit in our dollar balance of payments.In discussion of this question some Ministers argued thatregard must be paid, not merely to the amount of public expenditure,but also to its character. Much of the current Government expen-diture represented capital investment of great national value, and much was in the nature of transfer from private to public expendi-ture. The deficit in our dollar balance of payments was not directlydue to the level of public expenditure and taxation. Reduction inGovernment expenditure was unlikely to have any substantial effecton costs of production : at most, it might make it possible to reduceor withdraw some forms of taxation, such as the purchase tax, whichmight have exercised some influence on applications for wage increases. Against this should be set the expenditure on food subsidies, the effect of which was in fact disinflationary, since their. withdrawal would stimulate demands for compensating wage increases. Our budgetary position was substantially sounder thanthat of most other countries, including the United States; and theextent to which capital expenditure had been financed from currentrevenue represented a remarkable achievement. Our present difficul-ties were mainly due, not to the Government^ internal financialand economic policies, but to the fall in the sales of sterling areacommodities to the Western Hemisphere.For these reasons it would be important that the UnitedKingdom representatives in the forthcoming discussions in washington should firmly resist any suggestion that our balance ofpayments difficulties were due to the current levels of public expenditure and taxation in the United Kingdom. While thereshould be the strictest economy in administration, there were no grounds for resorting to drastic reductions in Government expendi-*ture which might jeopardise approved Government policies. On theother hand, Ministers recognised that our balance of payments difficulties would be dangerously aggravated if an inflationarysituation were allowed to develop in the United Kingdom. Thus,indirectly, through the risk of inflation, there was a relation betweenthe internal economic situation and the deficit in the dollar balanceof payments. While a considerable measure of stability had been maintained during the past year, there were disturbing indications of increasing inflationary pressure and, if this developed, the exportdrive would be gravely hampered. Moreover, our efforts to reducethe dollar deficit, whether by cutting dollar imports or by expandingexports, would in themselves have an inflationary effect. this situation might be met either by budgetary measures or by alterna-tive means such as the restriction of credit or the reduction of thecapital investment programme.The United States and Canadian representatives would enter the forthcoming discussions with a strong belief that our difficulties were largely due to our inability to export at competitive prices asthe result of our high levels of Government expenditure and taxa-tion. It was suggested that, whatever the merits or demerits of this argument, it might prove impossible to secure their co-operation in establishing a satisfactory and enduring relation between the sterling and dollar worlds unless some concession could be made tothis point of view. Ministers thought, however, that it would bea serious mistake to take any action which could be interpreted as
an endorsement of views which were being put to political use by those in this country and the United States who were opposed tothe Governments policies. Any such action would gravely weaken the Governments position in this country and would be widelydeplored by those in the United States who were in sympathy withthe Governments economic and social aims. More would be gained by adhering firmly to the political principles to which the Govern-ment were committed than by subordinating United Kingdom policy to American economic theories. Moreover, the final decisions in washington would not be taken on financial and economic considera-tions alone: the United States Government could not afford to jeopardise, by an unduly rigid attitude in economic questions, theirpolicy for resisting the encroachments of Communism throughWestern Union and the Atlantic Pact.In further discussion, the following points were made: :(a) There was general agreement that it would be advisable to scrutinise Government expenditure with a view to securing sucheconomies as were consistent with the continued application of majorGovernment policies. A detailed investigation should be made before the Departmental Estimates were next presented to Parlia-ment, and particular attention should be given to the possibilitiesof securing a substantial reduction in the numbers employed in national Government and Local Government services. ministers were particularly concerned at the increase in local governmentstaffs. They were informed that proposals were now being worked out for simplifying the administrative relations between localauthorities and the central Government; and that, when these arrangements had come into force, strong pressure would be appliedto local authorities to reduce their staffs.(b) There was general agreement that renewed efforts must bemade to bring home to the public generally the facts of the present economic situation and, in particular, to re-affirm the need for strictadherence to the policy set out in the White Paper on personal incomes, Costs and Prices.(c) Our main difficulty lay in marketing consumer goods atcompetitive prices; our prices for engineering products were broadlycompetitive. The engineering industry had achieved a very high level of efficiency.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Economic Policy Committee to consider whatreductions might be made in Government expenditurewithout prejudice to major Government policies.(2) Agreed that the Economic Policy Committee snould consider what measures could be taken to counter any inflationarypressures which might develop.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion of the economic situation at a meeting on the following day.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,28th July, 1949.
