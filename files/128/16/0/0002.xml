Divorce Lass.(previous reference:CM. (49) 44thConclusions,Minute 2.)1. On 7th July the Cabinet had agreed that, on the report stage of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, theGovernment spokesman might offer the appointment of a RoyalCommission on the divorce laws if he thought that such an offer was necessary in order to secure the rejection of an amendment whichwas to have been moved by Lieut.-Colonel Liptbn,&apos; M.P. In theevent the Speaker had ruled this amendment out of order, and therehad therefore been no occasion to foreshadow the appointment of a royal Commission.The Cabinet- .Decided not to proceed further with the proposal for theappointment of a Royal Commission to review the law relating to divorce in England and Wales.Parliament.business in the Houseof Commons.industrial disputes.London DockStrikes.(previous reference:.CM, (49) 44thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The National Paries and Access to the Countryside Bill was due to obtain its Third Reading in the House of Commons on19th July; and the Minister of Town and Country Planning had indicated that it would be convenient if it could be passed into law before Parliament adjourned for the Summer Recess. The lord privy Seal said that it would be difficult for the House of lords to complete their proceedings on this Bill in the short time now available before the Recess. The Cabinet agreed that in thecircumstances completion of the proceedings on this Bill might haveto be postponed until the autumn.3. The Cabinet were informed of the latest developments inthe strike of stevedores in the London docks. The number of menon strike that morning was about 10,200; and a meeting of strikersheld earlier in the day at Victoria Park had voted in favour of continuing the strike. Nevertheless, there were still some 15,000men at work in the London docks, and it was suggested that greater emphasis should be laid on this in publicity about the strike.The Cabinet agreed that, in accordance with the announcementmade in the House of Commons on 8th July, His Majesty should now be advised to make a Proclamation of emergency under theEmergency Powers Act, 1920. The making of the Proclamationwould be formally notified to Parliament that afternoon.Emergency Regulations would be made forthwith, and parliament would be invited to approve them on 13th July. It was unlikely thatany lengthy debate would then be necessary; but, in order to markthe gravity of this recourse to the powers provided by the Act of1920, the Prime Minister, as well as the Home Secretary, should speak in this debate. The Attorney-General should also be availableto deal with any legal points which might be raised.Ministers next considered the action to be taken following the proclamation, and discussed a memorandum by the Attorney-General (CP. (49) 148) dealing with this and related questions.The A attorney-General said that his paper had been prepared at the request of the Emergencies Committee. The first step wouldbe to set up a Port Emergency Committee with power to act onbehalf of His Majesty, and provision for this had been included inthe Regulations to be made that day. He suggested that thisCommittee should give a direction that work should be resumed onthe unloading or loading of all ships now idle; and that it should further direct the Dock Labour Board to operate all the provisionsof the Dock Labour Scheme, including the disciplinary provisions ofarticles 16 and 17, which the Board had hitherto been reluctant to invoke. His paper dealt with two further matters : he had set outthe reasons for his view that there was a strike in relation to certainships and a lock-out in relation to others; and he had also drawn
attention to the limits of the powers available under the emergency powers Act, 1920.In discussion, it was argued that the Government would be opento criticism if, having declared a state of emergency, they failed totake further drastic and vigorous action to restore the situation inthe London docks. On the other hand, it was pointed out that thefirst step must be the appointment of a Port Emergency Committee,which would be responsible for future action under the general direction of the Emergencies Committee. It might be found thatthe stevedores were willing to accept instructions from the PortEmergency Committee more readily than from the existing Board.It was agreed that the Emergencies Committee should examine the suggestions for action contained in CP. (49) 148.In further discussion, the following points were made : (a) The procedure under which the stevedores were requiredto assemble each morning at specific call-rstands itself providedopportunities for agitators to influence large bodies of men in favourqi continuing the strike. Moreover, there was no prospect that individual stevedores would be willing under such conditions to start work on the two Canadian ships. Might it not be advisable to suspend for a period the daily call-over in the two docks in whichthe Canadian ships were lying 1(&amp;) The Chairman of the Port of London Authority had asked that the Committee to he set up under the Emergency regulations should not be called &quot; Port Emergency Committee/&apos; as there already existed a Committee of this name set up by the Port of london authority; and the Home Secretary undertook to consider thispoint.(c) Ministers expressed the opinion that the proposedEmergency Committee for the Port of London should be a smallexecutive body of independent persons not connected with the dock labour Board or the employers or Unions concerned. The PrimeMinister undertook to consult with the Minister of Labour and theMinister of Transport regarding the constitution and membership of the Committee.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed to advise His Majesty to make forthwith a&quot;Proclamation of emergency under the Emergency powers act, 1920.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the emergencies committee to discuss further the steps, to be taken inconnection with the London dock strike, and to reportto the Cabinet.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would consult with theMinister of Labour and the Minister of Transportregarding the constitution and membership of theproposed Emergency Committee for the Port of London.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Transport (CP. (49) 145) proposing the appointmentof a working party to review the Dock Labour Scheme.The Minister of Labour said that he would be glad of anopportunity to circulate his comments on this, paper; and theCabinet agreed that its discussion should be postponed. meanwhile it was important that there should be no public indication that theGovernment had under consideration the question of revising the dock Labour Scheme.The Cabinets-Agreed to postpone until a later meeting their considera-tion of the proposals put forward in CP.
