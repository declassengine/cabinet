The EconomicSituation.(previous reference erence:CM. (49) 60thConclusions;Minute 1.)Parliamentary^Arrangements.1; The Cabinet were informed that arrangements had nowbeen made for a general debate on the economic situation to be heldin the House of Commons on 26th and 27th October, The debate would be held on a Government motion. The Cabinet discussed theterms of the motion and agreed that it should ask for a declarationof support for the measures which the Government proposed to take.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord President to settle, in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Chief Whip, theterms of the motion for the forthcoming Parliamentary-debate on the economic situation.The Economic 2.

(49) 102 and 110) and on theInternal measures necessary to combat inflation (E.P.C. (49) 111).  They hadFinancial accepted the view that the opportunities afforded by the devaluationSituation. of sterling for expanding exports to hard-currency markets mightbe frustrated unless the Government took, not only positive actionto increase production and productivity, but also negative steps to correct the pull of the home market by the appropriate dismfla-tionary measures. It was not possible at that stage to form an accurate estimate of the extent of the inflationary pressure; thatwould have to be assessed in connection with the next Budget, whenit would be possible to judge more precisely the rise in the cost ofliving and the other effects of devaluation. But the inflationarythreat to the economy was serious and immediate, and no time shouldbe lost in applying some of the remedial measures required. TheEconomic Policy Committee had therefore agreed that action oughtto be taken now to secure reductions of between  250 million and 300 million in the forecasts of capital investment and Govern-ment expenditure, and that this sum should be roughlydivided between capital investment and Government expendi-ture. As indicated in CP. (49) 205, the Committee had recommended economies under these heads amounting in all to 256 - 5 million. This figure took account of a reduction of 7^ million in the cut originally proposed on the school building programme, and of a reduced saving of  700,000 on the legal aidscheme. The total fell substantially short of the total reduction of 275-280 million which should be made at this stage, and he therefore proposed that a further economy should be secured by reducing the subsidy on milk by \d. a pint. This would produce a saving of  24 million in Government expenditure without any significant effect on the cost of living. Since expectant mothers and school children could receive milk free, a reduction in the milksubsidy had the advantage that it would not affect those sectionsof the community to whom cheap milk was specially important.Alternatively, a comparable economy might be secured by reducingthe subsidy on butter by 4^. a lb. ( 12 million), on cheese by2d. a lb. ( 4 million) and by discontinuing the subsidy on fish( 4 million).The general view of Ministers was that it would not be advisable to seek to secure further savings by reducing the subsidy on milk. The public would react sharply to an increase in milkprices. The case for reducing the subsidy on butter was stronger,since the price of margarine would not be affected and the present37778-2 B 2
price of butter was very low and out of relation with the price whichwould eventually have to be paid when food subsidies were abandoned. There was, however, a risk that, if all these foodsubsides were reduced, a fresh cycle of wage claims would resultwhich would go far to frustrate the Government&apos;s efforts to checkinflation. There were not the same objections to discontinuing thesubsidy on fish. This possibility had already been carefully studied by the Departments concerned, and there was at least a reasonable chance that, if the subsidy were discontinued and price controlwithdrawn when supplies were plentiful, the restoration of compe-tition would increase the efficiency of the industry and prevent anysubstantial increase in prices. A significant saving in administra-tive expenses would also be secured. It would not, however, be advisable to take such action until the spring, when there was lessrisk of interruption of supplies on account of bad weather; and itmight not be advisable to withdraw the Exchequer grant to theindustry for the equalisation of transport costs. Subject to these points, Ministers agreed in principle that an announcement might now be made that the subsidy on fish would be discontinued at a convenient date.The Foreign Secretary said that, in view of the pressing needfor economy in administrative expenditure, he had reached the con-elusion that steps should be taken to effect a drastic reform in theorganisation of the Control Commission for Germany. This wouldinvolve an extensive devolution of responsibilities to the german authorities. Some time must necessarily elapse before this reform; could be put fully into effect, but it should eventually be possible to achieve by this means an annual saving of between  8 and  10million. It was, however, important that no public announcementrelating specifically to this item of saving should be made at thisstage.In further discussion of the proposals in CP. (49) 205, thefollowing points were made : (a) The savings included in Schedule III of E.P;C. (49) 111included  2f million from abandoning the policy of releasing allrequisitioned property by December 1952. To secure this saving itwould be necessary to retain requisitioned property for two or threeyears after 1952. The owners of these properties should be warnedat once that this was going to be done, since many Commercial firmswere making plans on the basis that they would recover possessionof their property at the end of 1952. . Moreover, the scheme wouldprobably require legislation before 1952, since it might not be practicable to extend the emergency powers for the full periodrequired. ,(b) In paragraph 11 of CP. (49) 205  he charge in respect ofprescriptions should be described as &quot; not exceeding one shilling.&quot;(c) It would be said on behalf of old people who had contributedfor many years to the National Health Insurance Scheme, including some who had contributed for sickness benefits but not for pension,that a charge on prescriptions would be a breach of the under-standing under which the National Insurance Fund took over theamounts standing to the credit of the older funds. This might revivethe old grievance that the Government was not paying ten-shillingpensions at 65 years of age. As a matter of administration, the simplest course would be to arrange that old age pensioners did not pay the charge on prescriptions. It should not be difficult to workout a practicable scheme for giving effect to this concession.id) The Chancellor of the Exchequer did not propose to ask forany curtailment of labour transference schemes or of the youthemployment service, which had been mentioned in Schedule IV ofE.P.C. (49) 111.(e) The postponement of the legal aid scheme would not give a saving of  2 million, since it would not be practicable to withhold
that part of the scheme which would take the place of the existing facilities, and this would ultimately cost about  1,300,000.(/) It had been agreed that the economies to be effected inconnection with the Festival of Britain should not be such as would seriously impair the Festival. On this basis the Lord President was confident of securing economies amounting to  600,000, and he hopedthat it might be possible to reach the full saving of  1 millionproposed by the Committee.(g) The reduction in Defence expenditure outlined in para-graph 16 of OP. (49) 205 related to the present financial year. TheChancellor of the Exchequer said that, pending decisions on thelong-term Defence programme, nothing could yet be said about thelevel of expenditure in future years.        ,. The Cabinet-(1) Approved the reductions in the Investment Programme andin Government expenditure proposed by the economic policy Committee and summarised in CP. (49) 205, butrejected the further suggestion for a reduction in thesubsidy on milk.(2) Agreed that the subsidy on fish should be discontinued andthe price of fish decontrolled, at a convenient date in the spring of 1950, and invited the Ministers of Food and agriculture and the Secretary of State for Scotland tomake the necessary arrangements, including an examina-tion of the extent to which the transport equalisationscheme should continue to be subsidised by theExchequer.(3) Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposal to reorganisethe staffing of the Control Commission for Germany, and agreed that the savings expected&apos;from this source shouldbe taken into account in the total savings to be announced on 24th October, even although the proposed reorganisa-tion could not be publicly mentioned at that stage.&apos; (4) Agreed that old age pensioners should not be required to paythe proposed charge for medical prescriptions.The Cabinet next discussed the form of the statement to bemade by the Prime Minister on 24th October. There was generalagreement that, in addition to the announcement of specific cuts in public expenditure, the statement should also refer to the Govern-menfs constructive plans for remedying the current economic situa-tion. The main positive remedy was increased productivity,especially in those industries for whose products new or expandedmarkets could be found in hard currency countries. It was truethat for the past two years policy had been directed towards securingincreased industrial productivity; but the needs and opportunities of the present situation must be vigorously stressed with a view to securing even greater efforts in this direction. In particular,Ministers considered that a call should now be made to the workers to make their contribution by working longer hours. A generalappeal would not be enough for this purpose : conditions differed from one industry to another : and the matter should be taken upthrough the appropriate negotiating machinery for each industry,leaving it to those bodies to determine what methods of securinglonger working hours wOuld be most appropriate&apos;in each industry.In principle, something between two and three additional hours aweek seemed to be required; and, as a rule, it would probably befound more convenient to avoid a return to Saturday working andto make instead a proportionate addition to the hours worked onthe other five weekdays. For these additional hours pay should normally be at overtime rates.    &apos;
In further discussion of this suggestion the following points were made: (h) The call for longer hours could not be addressed to workersgenerally throughout all industries. For example, in the buildingindustry it would be impossible to ask for increased production-and difficult even to call for increased productivity at a time whensubstantial cuts were to be made in the total volume of building.This was an additional reason for attempting to deal with thisquestion industry by industry.(i) The Government could not call for increased production in industries &quot;to which they were unable to assure a sufficient supplyof raw materials. This point should be kept in mind by theEconomic Policy Committee, who were that afternoon to considerthe dollar import programme for the period from July 1949 toDecember 1950, on which it had been proposed that reductions should be made in the import of such raw materials as cotton andsheet steel.(j) It would be easier to secure the full co-operation of theworkers in export industries if it were possible to give them some assurance of continuity in the demand for their products in the dollar markets. In many industries there was a natural reluctance,which was shared by the workers^ to abandon traditional markets inthe sterling area in favour of what might prove to be short-termopportunities in the dollar countries. Some assurances on this pointhad been obtained in the course of the financial discussions atWashington, but the United States Government had not yetauthorised the making of any public announcement.(k) In several industries the expansion of exports to dollar&apos;markets was a matter, not so much of increased production by theworkers, as of increased effort in salesmanship by managements.This was a point to be borne in mind in any general statement whichmight be made on this subject.In further discussion of the form of the Prime ministers statement the following points were also made : (I) The Minister of Health suggested that, in announcing the cut in housing, it should be made clear that this would be made to fall, not on the housing programmes of the local authorities, buton houses which were to be privately built for sale. The Seeteidryof State for Scotland pointed out, however, that if Scottish housingwas to bear its proportionate share, the cut could not be limited tothis part of the programme and there would have to be some feduc-tion in the local authority programme. After some discussion itwas agreed that a formula should be used which would safeguard the Scottish position: for example, it might be said that thegreatmajority of the cut would fall on houses which were to be privatelybuilt for sale.(m) On the question of presentation, it was agreed that thestatement should begin by announcing the cuts in expenditure andshould end with a reference to the positive remedy of increased productivity.in) Public corporations, local authorities and similar bodiesshould be encouraged to make administrative economies comparable to those which were to be made by Government Departments. Itwas agreed that a sentence to this effect might be included in thePrime Ministers statement. Where necessary, departmental ministers could then follow this up by making representations to the bodies concerned.(o) The statement should give the total of the savings to beachieved, figures of the savings expected from the main changes offjolicy, and some illustrative examples of the miscellaneous savingsisted in Schedules I-III and V of E.P.C. (49) 111;  It could not,however, purport to give a complete list of all the detailed measures
49CM. 61 (40)which, were to be taken. In these circumstances the cabinet considered whether it would be practicable to present a White Papergiving more detailed information for the purposes of the debate.The general feeling was, however, that the production of such a white Paper would be impracticable: for example, the details inSchedule I of E.P.C. (49) 111 did not take into account some of the economies already secured by certain Departments earlier in theyear, and many of the savings would mature at different times, withthe result that not all the figures were strictly comparable. further detailed information, in addition to that included in the PrimeMinisters original statement, could be given by Government spokes-men in the course of the debate.The Cabinet-(5) Invited the Prime Minister to consider the points raised in discussion in the preparation of the statement to bemade on 24th October.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,21s* October, 1949.
