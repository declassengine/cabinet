1. The Prime Minister said that he had now received formalrequests from the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of theLiberal Party in the House of Commons for the recall of Parliamentto debate the reduction of the dollar exchange value of the poundand the Washington talks. There was a general public impression that Parliament would be recalled and he thougnt it would be ofadvantage to the Government to have this opportunity to putforward the case for what had been done and to indicate the steps that had now to be taken.In subsequent discussion there was general agreement Parlia-ment should reassemble. The debate in the House of Commons shouldlast for three days and should take place on a motion, tabled bythe Government, which would support the action of the Governmentin devaluing the pound sterling and would pledge the co-operationof the country in implementing the understandings arrived at inthe Washington talks. The exact terms of the motion would beagreed at a later meeting of the Cabinet. Meanwhile it could be stated that the debate would take place on a Government motionand that the terms of the motion would be made known beforeParliament met. The Chancellor of the Exchequer would open the debate, the Prime Minister would wind up, and the Presidentof the Board of Trade and the Minister of Health would speak inthe course of the debate.The Government would move a motion in the same terms inthe House of Lords. The length of the debate would be a matter for discussion with the acting Leader of the Opposition in the Houseof Lords.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Government should formally represent tothe Lord Chancellor and to the Speaker that parliament should be recalled to discuss the Washington talks anddevaluation.(2) Invited the Lord President and the Chancellor of theExchequer to circulate, for consideration at their next meeting, the proposed terms of the Government motionto be tabled in both Houses.(3) Agreed that the debate in the House of Commons shouldlast for three days and that, after the debates, bothHouses should stand adjourned until 18th October.Washington The Lord Privy Seal said that he was anxious that Common-Talks, wealth Governments should be kept fully informed of the courseof the continuing talks in Washington on economic matters.The Cabinet-(4) Invited the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of theExchequer to make arrangements, through the Common-wealth Liaison Committee and by other means, by which commonwealth Governments would be kept fully informed of the course of the continuing talks oneconomic matters in Washington.Wages. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, when he saw repre-sentatives of the Trades Union Congress on Sunday, 18th September,to inform them of the reduction of the dollar exchange value of the pound, he had promised to meet them again with the Minister ofLabour at an early date. This meeting had now been arranged forMonday, 26th September, and he hoped to circulate a memorandumon wages policy by the Minister of Labour and himself for considera-tion by the Cabinet earlier on that day.In a preliminary discussion of this subject the following points were made : (a) It was suggested that what was needed was a precise andeasily understood policy about wages, e.g., a standstill for six months the EconomicSituation.(previous kef erence:CM.

If any exception were made in favour of lower-paid workers, a general movement in favour of wages increasesmight begin and get out of control.(6) A great deal of public education was still required on theneed to avoid increases in costs of production, if the full benefits of devaluation were to be obtained. Steps had already been takento arrange for broadcast talks and for meetings with the executivesof trade unions and with employers. It was suggested that a simpleleaflet might be prepared and given the widest possible distribution.(c) Some doubt was expressed whether the wages position couldbe held, unless some concession were allowed to the lower income groups. There was a certain amount of public sympathy with thelower-paid railway workers, coupled with a feeling that their case had been mishandled. If something could be done for the lower-paid workers it might be easier to hold the higher wages, although it hadto be recognised that skilled workers held tenaciously to wagedifferentials.(d) The position regarding profits would have to be watched.Stock Exchange speculation following the announcement of devalua-tion had created a bad impression.(e) Would it assist in holding wages at their present level if ministers and possibly Members of Parliament agreed to a voluntaryabatement of salary ? Doubt was expressed whether this step would achieve the desired result. It might suggest that cuts on the linesof those imposed in 1931 were in contemplation or that personal incomes derived from Government funds should be reduced beforeincomes from other sources were touched.The Cabinet-(5) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister of Labour would submit a memorandum on wages, policy for consideration at their next meeting.General 2.
