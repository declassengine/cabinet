Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in    the House of Commons in the following week.the House of In order to complete outstanding Government business, itCommons. would be necessary for the House to sit throughout the week,adjourning for the Summer Recess at 4 p.m. on Saturday, 30th July.On 12th May the Cabinet had agreed that the Parliament Billshould be introduced for the third time and given a Second reading in the Commons in the course of the summer so as to make plain theGovernment&apos;s intention to secure that the Bill was passed into lawby the end Of the year. Though it had not been possible to find.timeto take the Second Reading of the Bill before the Summer Recess, itwould be introduced in the House of Commons on 27th July.Iron andSteel Bill,(previous reference:CM. (49) 41stConclusions,Minute 2.)37383-12. The Minister of Supply recalled that the Iron and steel bill contained various provisions designed to prevent the companies which were to be brought under public ownership from taking, after certain dates specified in the Bill, action calculated to dissipate their assets before the vesting date. If, as was known to be their inten-tion, the Opposition in the House of Lords persisted, despite theviews of the Commons, in their amendment postponing the cominginto operation of the Bill until after the General Election, the bill would be technically dead until it could be reintroduced in a laterSession and the companies might claim that during that period theywere free to take the kind of anticipatory action to dissipate their assets which was prohibited, under penalty, by the Bill. TheMinister therefore asked for authority to state, during the commons&apos; discussion of the Lords&apos; Amendments on 25th July, that,if they lost the Bill this Session, the Government intended toreintroduce it at the earliest practicable opportunity and to include in it the same clauses about the dissipation of assets, operatingretrospectively from the same dates as those now specified in theBill. He also sought authority to send copies of this statement tothe companies affected inviting their special attention to it. he recognised that this would be an unusual course to take, since itwould anticipate the contents of The King&apos;s Speech in a futureSession; but he believed that there were special circumstances whichjustified this exceptional course.In discussion there was general agreement that it would be expedient to give phblic warning of the Governments intentions inthis matter, and that the Minister should make a statement in theHouse of Commons on the lines which he proposed. Ministersdoubted, however, -whether it would be wise for him to take thefurther step of circulating copies of this statement to the companies concerned. This might be misrepresented as an attempt to prejudge the eventual decision of Parliament. Moreover, circumstances might arise which would prevent the Government from reintroducing this bill until after the General Election; and in that event it might bealleged that the Minister had anticipated the decision of anotherParliament. It seemed probable that full publicity would be givento any statement on these lines which might be made by the minister in the House of Commons; and, if in the event that statement wasnot thought to have received sufficient ^publicity, the Cabinet could then consider whether any further steps should be taken to bring itspecially to the notice of the companies concerned.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Minister of Supply to make a statement, inthe Commons&apos; discussion of the Lords&apos; Amendments tothe Iron and Steel Bill, to the effect that, if the Bill were lost this Session, it was the Government&apos;s intention toreintroduce it at the earliest practicable opportunity and b 2
to include in it the same clauses about the dissipation of assets, operating retrospectively to the same, dates as were specified in the present Bill. -(2) Invited the Minister of Supply to settle the precise wording of this statement in consultation with the lord president.House of 3   -j^g cabinet discussed what line should be taken by the lords Reform. Government spokesman in the forthcoming debate in the House of(Previous Lords on 27th July on a motion by the Marquess of ReadingReference: proposing that legislation should be introduced in the presentCM. (48) 1st Parliament to enable women who were Peers in their own right to conclusions,    sit and vote in the House of Lords.Minute 5.) It was clear that legislation on this subject could not be carried in the present Parliament. But it was more difficult for theGovernment to define their attitude towards the substantiveproposal in the motion. On the one hand, they would not wish to appear to be opposing the principle of sex equality. On the otherhand, they must avoid appearing to support the hereditary basisof the existing composition of the House of Lords. And at thesame time they must avoid committing themselves to finding some alternative basis for the constitution of a Second Chamber.After discussion the Cabinet agreed that the government spokesman should take the general line that; while the abstractprinciple of sex equality had the full support of the Government, its practical application to the composition of the House of Lords wasa complex matter requiring detailed study which could notconveniently be undertaken at this late stage in the life of thepresent Parliament. With this in view the Lord Privy Seal mightpersuade the Marquess of Reading to put his motion into a more general and declaratory form.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord Privy Seal to handle the forthcoming.  * debate in the House of Lords in accordance with the views expressed in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion.Mineral 4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ChancellorDevelopment. 0f the Duchy of Lancaster (CP. (49) 152) reporting the recommen-dations of a Committee of Ministers which had considered proposals put forward by a Departmental Committee on Mineral Developmentunder the. chairmanship of Lord Westwood.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that theCommittee of Ministers recommended that legislation should beintroduced in the next Parliament to vest in the State the ownership of certain minerals to be specified in a schedule to the Bill, and thatthere should be power to amend the schedule from time to time byorder. A Mineral Development Commission should be set up to manage, on behalf of the State, the property rights in minerals and to foster the discovery and development of minerals. These recom-mendations were in accord with the proposals of the Westwood Com-mittee. The ministerial Committee thought that the commission should also have power in exceptional cases to exploit minerals and in suitable cases to own surface land &quot;above mineral deposits. The de-departmental responsibilities for the various aspects of mineral workinghad still to be worked out by the Government organisation committee, and a detailed examination would have to be made ofthe method by which development charges should be assessed and paid in respect of minerals and the manner in which taxation onmining operations should be levied.   While there, was need to
C.M. 47 (49)

expedite the work which Imperial Chemical Industries and Messrs. Fisons were carrying out in regard to the North Yorkshire potash deposits, the ministerial Committee did not agree with the Westwood Committee that these potash deposits should be separately nationalised. The Minister of Fuel and Power should make a statement in the House of Commons before the Summer Recess, explaining that the Government accepted the main recommendations of the Westwood Committee and would introduce the necessary legislation in due course.

In discussion the following points were made :-

(a) There was general agreement that the Minister of Fuel and Power should be responsible for all nationalised minerals, but there was still a good deal of work to be done by the government organisation Committee in examining how far this should affect the present production responsibilities of other Ministers.

(b) Was it necessary to set up a Mineral Development Commission? In the ordinary way this Commission would not be responsible for the exploitation of minerals and it was not clear that a division of the Ministry of Fuel and Power might not be better fitted to carry out the supervisory duties which were proposed for the Commission. The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research could advise where surveys of mineral reserves should be made and the extent to which these surveys were carried out would turn very largely on the amount of Exchequer money which was available for the purpose. This financial control might be exercised more conveniently through a Department than through a separate Commission. The Government were experiencing difficulty in finding suitable persons for appointment to public boards of this character and the technique of controlling the operation of supervisory boards had not yet been satisfactorily worked out. In favour of a separate Commission it was argued that a semi-independent body could more readily take risks and, if necessary, incur losses. The establishment of a separate Commission would also indicate that the Government were taking special action to ensure that the mineral resources of the country were properly exploited.

(c) The Board of Trade were in touch with Imperial Chemical Industries and Messrs. Fisons about the work which they were doing in connection with the North Yorkshire potash deposits, and were doing all that was practicable to expedite the development of the deposits.

The Cabinet-

(1) Agreed that the Minister of Fuel and Power should state in the House of Commons that the Government would in due course introduce legislation to give effect to the main recommendation of the Westwood Committee that the ownership of various metalliferous and non-metalliferous minerals should be vested in the State. It should be explained that the other recommendations of the Westwood Committee were under examination.

(2) Agreed that the Machinery of Government Committee should consider recommendations to be made by the Government Organisation Committee on the distribution between Ministers of production responsibilities for the minerals to be brought under public ownership and should, at the same time, consider whether there should be a Mineral Development Commission or whether the work proposed for that Commission should be undertaken by a Government Department.

(3) Invited the Minister of Town and Country Planning to arrange for an official committee to examine the method by which development charges should be assessed and paid in respect of minerals brought under public ownership.


(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for therecommendations of the Westwood Committee regardingmining taxation to be examined by the TuckerCommittee on the Taxation of Trading Profits.(5) Agreed that the North Yorkshire potash deposits should notbe brought under public ownership in advance of general legislation on this subject.5. The Cabinet considered a note by the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Minister of Defence (CP. (49) 138) covering areport by ah official working party on the control of the publicationof economic and industrial information.The Minister of Defence said that the Joint IntelligenceCommittee had recently drawn attention to the dangers involved inthe disclosure of economic and industrial information about theUnited Kingdom which might be of military value to a potential enemy, and their proposals for controlling the publication of such information had been endorsed by the Chiefs of Staff. He had agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer that, as a first step,the Joint Intelligence Committee&apos;s report should be examined bya working party of officials with a view to securing the greatestmeasure of agreement between all the Departments concerned on thegeneral lines of future policy in this matter. Both he and theChancellor of the Exchequer were in agreement with the working party&apos;s recommendations.In discussion the following points were made(a) It was stated in the working party&apos;s report that theMinistry of Civil Aviation were considering whether an appeal should be made to aircrews and passengers to refrain from takingair photographs of Key Points. Might not this serve to draw attention to the location of such Key points? The Minister ofDefence undertook to consider this point.(b) The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he was inagreement with the proposal to review existing policy regardingthe publication of petroleum statistics. He thought that there wasa risk that the working party&apos;s recommendations for safeguardingoperational intelligence might seriously prejudice technical progressin the oil, gas and electrical industries, but he was not opposed tothe suggestion that- there should be discussions on the questionbetween representatives of his Department, the Security Service andthe Boards concerned.The Cabinet-Approved the recommendations made in the report annexed to CP. (49) 138.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Duchy.of Lancaster (CP. (49) 153) recommending that the Government should not support the proposal for the con-struction of a Channel Tunnel. ,There was general agreement that on merits the balance of argument was against the construction of a Channel Tunnel. Inany event there was no prospect in the foreseeable future that thenecessary resources could be made available, having regard to the lowpriority which this project would have against essential development schemes.The general view of Ministers was that the Minister ofTransport should, in answer to an arranged Question, explain thatthe Government could not see its way to afford the necessaryresources for the construction of a Channel Tunnel which, in any
event, was probably now technically rather out of date&quot; having regardto the development of air travel and of rail ferries. If this public statement were made it would then be open to the government spokesmen in the Council of Europe at Strasbourg, if the issue was raised, to explain the Governments objections to the scheme.The Cabinet  &apos;(1) Approved the recommendation in CP. (49) 153 that theGovernment should not support the proposal for theconstruction of a Channel Tunnel.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport to make a short state-ment explaining the Governments objections, in answer to an arranged Question in the House of Commons.industrial disputes.London DockStrikes.(previous reference:CM. (49) 46thConclusions,Minute 7.)7. The Prime Minister said that late on the evening of19th July he had learned that the National Dock Labour Board had issued a notice ordering all dockers on strike to resume work on thefollowing Thursday and adding that disregard of this order would jeopardise the very existence of the Dock Labour Scheme. It had appeared to him and to those of his colleagues whom he had consulted that, whatever its intention, this reference to the futureof the Scheme would be read by dockers generally as implying thatthe Government were thinking of withdrawing the Scheme; andthat this would give the organisers of the strike a new excuse forprolonging the stoppage and probably extending it to other docks.This view had subsequently been confirmed by responsible tradesunion leaders. He had therefore issued an official statement making it clear that the notice given by the National Dock Labour board was issued without the authority of the Emergency Committee forthe Port of London and that the Government were not, in fact,intending to take any steps to bring to an end the Dock labour scheme. Lord Ammon, the Chairman of the Dock Labour Board,had taken the view that this action by the Government would undoall the good which he had expected to result from the notice issuedby the Board; and he had expressed sharp criticism of the Govern-ment&apos;s action. On the evening of 20th July, however, he had been seen by the Home Secretary, the Minister of Labour, the Ministerof Transport and the Chairman of the Emergency Committee, andhe had then taken up a more accommodating attitude. He had beenasked to agree that his Board would consult the Emergency Com-mittee on any question of policy and would give effect to their decisions, on the understanding that it would be open to the Board,if they differed on any fundamental issue, to bring their views beforethe appropriate Departmental Minister or, if necessary, the PrimeMinister himself, and that in such a case no action would be taken and no pronouncement of policy would be made by the Board until a decision had been given by the Government. Lord Ammon had said that this procedure would be completely satisfactory to him and had undertaken to recommend it to his colleagues on the Board.Nevertheless, the Press on 21st July reported further statements byLord Ammon which were critical of the Governments intervention in this matter; and it was not clear whether these statements hadbeen made before or after his interview with the Home Secretary.There was general agreement that it was wholly improper that lord Ammon, while still a member of the Government, should make public statements which were critical of the Governments handling of.this matter; and that this situation should be remedied withoutdelay.The Prime Minister undertook to see. Lord Ammon later that day and to consider what further statement couldcould be made.
SeohuanalandPi&apos;otec.to,t.e.chieftainship of the bamangwato tribe.8. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary ofState for Commonwealth Relations&quot; (OvPr (49) 155 and 157) on the succession to the Chieftainship of the BamangWato Tribe.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said thata difficult situation had been created by the marriage of SeretseKhama, Chief Designate of the Bamangwato Tribe, to an Englishgirl, By native custom the Chieftainship was hereditary, but thelocal Native Administration Proclamation provided that, on the occurrence of a vacancy, the tribe must designate the new Chieftainand submit his name for recognition by the United Kingdom HighCommissioner and confirmation by the Secretary of State. Seretse&apos;smarriage had taken place in England before the completion of hiseducation; and at that time there could be little doubt that therewas general disapproval of the marriage among the Bamangwato.Seretse had, however, visited the Protectorate recently and a tribalmeeting had been held at which a large majority of those presenthad acclaimed him as the hereditary heir to the Chieftainship. Thequestion of recognition had therefore become an immediate issue.There were two grounds for caution: first, it seemed doubtfulwhether the recent tribal meeting correctly reflected the true opinionof the Bamangwato on this issue : the High Commissioner consideredthat there was a serious risk that the consequences of recognisingSeretse as Chief might be so serious as to result in a complete breakdown of the native administration. Secondly, the recognitionof a Chief married to a white woman might have far-reaching and damaging effects on our relations with South Africa, where the.; easehad aroused strong feelings among the European population, andmight precipitate a renewal of the long-standing claim for thetransfer of the Bechuanaland Protectorate to the Union. In thecircumstances, it was clear that there must be time for reflectionand enquiry. The High Commissioner had suggested that a judicial enquiry should be held, under the provisions of the local NativeAdministration Proclamation, into Seretse&apos;s suitability for the chieftainship, but the Secretary of State thought that the first step should be to invite Seretse to visit London so that an attempt mightbe made to persuade him to relinquish voluntarily his claim to the chieftainship. &apos;The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he did not favour this latter course. If it became known that the Governmenthad attempted to influence Seretse in this way, they would be widelycriticised for interfering in matters of native administration in response to the pressure of European opinion in South Africa. Thenormal procedure in such circumstances was to hold a judicial enquiry in the manner provided for in the Native AdministrationProclamation. It was important that the whole question should be examined, not in terms of racial relations, but with regard to theneed for safeguarding the well-being of the Bamangwato and thefuture stability of the native administration.The general view of the Cabinet was that it would not be advisable at this stage to attempt to persuade Seretse to relinquishvoluntarily his claims to the Chieftainship. The fact of such inter-vention would undoubtedly become known, and would provideeffective material for hostile propaganda. Moreover, the Governvment would be placed in a very embarrassing position if the attempt should fail. On the other hand, it could not be supposed that the recognition of Seretse would provide a satisfactory or lastingsolution of the problem. The issue was not one of the merits ordemerits of mixed marriages, and the Government should vigorouslyrebut any suggestion that their attitude to this question was in anyway determined by purely racial considerations. The principalobjective of policy must be to safeguard the future well-being ofthe Bamangwato themselves, and there could be no doubt that the recognition of a Chieftain with a white wife might have conse-quences gravely prejudicial to good government and to the stability
115 CM. 47^(49)of the local native administration. As a matter of tactics; no attempt should be made to reach a hasty decision; and the holding of a judicial enquiry would afford time for reflection by all theparties concerned.Ministers pointed out that great care should be taken in framing the terms of reference for the enquiry. It would benecessary to ensure that general issues of racial relationship were excluded from the scope of the enquiry : on the other hand, the termsof reference should not be so narrow as to exclude the wider con-siderations which must ultimately determine the final decision.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that a judicial enquiry should be held under theprovisions 01 the Bechuanaland Protectorate NativeAdministration Proclamation into the suitability of seretse Khama for the Chieftainship of the Bamang-wato tribe.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations to consult with the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Privy Sealand the Secretary of State for the Colonies regardingthe terms of reference for the enquiry referred to inConclusion (1).       -   \Commonwealth 9.
