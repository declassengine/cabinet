Sir Stafford 1.   The Cabinet learned with regret of the illness of theCripps. Chancellor of the Exchequer, and expressed their sympathy andgood wishes for his early recovery. .The Prime Minister said that during the Chancellor^ absence* he would himself assume responsibility for Treasury business.  Inthis he would have the assistance of the President of the Board ofTrade and the Minister of Fuel and Power, as well as the Financialand Economic Secretaries of the Treasury.Germany.(previous reference erence:CM. (49) 34thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (49V154) reporting that stocks of food and materials in Berlin had now been built up to a point at which it was possibleto dispense with the airlift.The Foreign Secretary said that the British and United states military Governors in Germany had advised that, in view of the accumulation of stocks, the airlift could now be discontinued.Russia&apos;s future policy in Germany was, however, uncertain; and.matters should be so arranged that it would be possible to build upthe airlift again to its full scale within a period of ninety days.It was therefore recommended that two troop-carrier groups ofthe United States Air Force and two heavy transport squadrons of the Royal Air Force should remain in Germany, and that such other steps should be taken as would ensure that the airlift couldbe resumed if required.The Secretary of State for Air said that he supported theseproposals. Though he would have preferred to be able to withdrawthese transport squadrons entirely from Germany, he fully acceptedthe political need for maintaining there an organisation wnichwould be capable of resuming the airlift if occasion arose.The Cabinet-Approved the propose the airlift to Berlin.in CP. (49) 154 for discontinuingDivorce Lavs.(previous reference:CM. (49)45thConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Cabinet were informed that Lieut.-Colonel Lipton,M.P., had now given notice of a Parliamentary Question, for answerby the Prime Minister on 20th July, asking whether the Governmentwould- arrange for the appointment of a Royal Commission to enquire into the present state of the divorce laws.In discussion it was recognised that there would be a fairmeasure of support for the appointment of a Royal Commission.On the other hand there would be difficulty, and perhapscontroversy, over its membership; there could be no certainty thatit would produce unanimous findings; a,nd its report was likely tobe a source of embarrassment for the Government to which it was presented. It was also arguable that this was not a subject on which an enquiry could suitably be launched in the last year of a parliament&apos;s lifetime.It was the general view of Ministers that it would be inexpedient to institute such an enquiry, and that a simple negativeshould be returned to Lieut.-Colonel Lipton&apos;s Question.37352The Cabinet-Reaffirmed their decision not to proceed with the proposalfor the appointment of a Royal Commission to review thelaw relating to divorce in England and Wales.B 2
Inquiry intothe Press.(previous reference:CM. (46) 87thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (49) 147) on the Report of the Royal Commissionon^the Press.The Lord President said that this Report would shortly bediscussed in the House of Commons, possibly on 22nd July. he proposed that it should then be announced that the government accepted the Report, welcomed its proposal for the establishmentof a General Council of the Press, and favoured the introduction oflegislation to effect the various amendments of the law which wererecommended in the Report though this legislation could not be passed during the lifetime of the present Parliament.In discussion the following points were raised : (a) The Royal Commission had recommended that the laymembers of the proposed General Council should be nominated bythe Lord Chief Justice and the Lord President of the Court of session. It was the general view of the Cabinet that it would be unfortunate if the Judges were associated in this way with a matter which was on the verge of politics, and that it would be preferable that these appointments should be made by the Lord Chancellor.It was recognised that the Government could not themselves proposethis alternative, since it might be thought to have been promptedby a desire to introduce a political discretion into the choice of the lay members of the Council. The Lord Chief Justice and the lord president of the Court of Session might, however, be unwilling toassume the responsibility for making these appointments; and inthat event it would become easier to put forward the alternative of appointment by the Lord Chancellor.(6) The Royal Commission had recommended that powers ofenquiry similar to those of the Board of Trade under sections 172and 173 of the Companies Act, 1948, should be conferred on the registrar of Friendly Societies in respect of any societies registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts which publishednewspapers or periodicals or engaged in the business of a newsagency. The Co-operative Union would be consulted before theGovernment introduced legislation giving -effect to this particularrecommendation.(c) The Royal Commission had recommended that the monopolies and Restrictive Practices (Inquiry and Control) Act,1948, should be so amended as to bring within its scope localnewspaper monopolies extending over any substantial area. TheCommission had not, however, made it clear in their Report whatamendment of the Act was required for this purpose; and some further consideration would have to be given to this point in due course.The Cabinet-Decided to accept the Report of the Royal Commission onthe Press; and invited the Lord President to announce their decision in the forthcoming debate in the House ofCommons on the general lines indicated in CP. (49) 147.Anglo-NorwegianFisheriesDispute.(previous reference:CM. (49) 43rdConclusions,Minute 7.)5. On 30th June the Cabinet had agreed that the Anglo-Norwegian fisheries dispute should be referred to the international court of Justice unless agreement could be reached on a modus vivendi by the end of July.The Foreign Secretary said that further representations had now been made to him on behalf of the Norwegian Government, whodeprecated reference to the International Court as likely to provokeanti-British feeling in Norway. They proposed as a modus vivendiwhat they termed &quot; lenient enforcement &quot; between the Blue line and the Red Line on the section of the Norwegian coast still underdispute.
The Foreign Secretary said that, despite these further repre-sentations, he still felt that the right course was to refer the matter to the International Court and, subject to his colleagues&apos; views, he proposed to do so unilaterally unless the Norwegian Government hadby 30th July indicated their readiness to make a joint applicationto the Court.The Minister of Agriculture and the Secretary of State forScotland supported the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposal.The Cabinet Authorised the Foreign Secretary to submit this issue tothe International Court of Justice, and to do so byunilateral application unless by 30th July the norwegian government had indicated their readiness to submit a jointapplication to the Court.National dock labour Board.(previous reference:CM. (49) 45thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Transport (CP. (49) 145) suggesting that an enquiry should be instituted into the working of the Dock Labour Scheme, and by theMinister of Labour (CP. (49) 151) suggesting that the working ofthe Scheme should be examined in the first instance by officials of the ministries of Labour and Transport and that, when the presentLondon dock strike was over, an enquiry should be instituted intothe underlying causes of unrest in the docks.The Minister of Transport said that he was concerned becausethe Dock Labour Scheme, which had conferred great benefits ondock workers, seemed to be working unsatisfactorily. The national dock Labour Board were unable to assert their authority in times of stress, and the Scheme seemed to be operating in a way thatundermined the effectiveness of other authorities in the docks. Ifthe Government were to undertake a searching enquiry, into theworking of the Scheme, this might have a salutary effect on allconcerned; and he thought that the British Transport Commission,the Port Authorities and the Trade Unions should be asked toparticipate in the enquiry. Although he had set out in his memorandum a number of respects in which the organisation and operation Of the National Dock Labour Board might be improved,he did not wish to be understood to be making specific recommenda-tions on these points at the present stage : he desired merely thatthese possibilities, with any other proposals put forward, should be fully investigated in the course of the proposed enquiry.The Minister of Labour said that he was not satisfied that the troubles in the docks arose primarily from the operation of the dock Labour Scheme. Admittedly, the Board had not imposedstrict discipline, but the decision to rely on persuasion rather thandiscipline had been taken with the full agreement of the employers&apos;representatives on the Board. Most of the unofficial strikes in thepast year had related to disputes about pay and conditions ofservice and these were matters for the National Joint Council forthe Port Transport Industry, rather than the National Dock labour board. He did not think that any fundamental changes were required in the National Dock Labour Board; but there were some points, such as the appeal procedure and the appointment ofadditional independent members of the Board, on which modifica-tions might be desirable. He considered that, in the first instance,the field for enquiry should be explored by officials of his Depart-ment and of the Ministry of Transport. Meanwhile, thought couldbe given to the steps which should be taken to initiate a more fundamental enquiry into the general causes of unrest in the docks.
The Foreign Secretary said that he would not favour some ofthe particular suggestions mentioned in the memorandum by theMinister of Transport e.g., the transfer of responsibility for theNational Dock Labour Board from the Minister of Labour to theMinister of Transport, and the proposal that port authoritiesshould be associated with an enquiry into the operation of the dock labour Scheme. His main anxiety was, however, about the effects which would follow if it became known that at this juncture theGovernment were reviewing the working of the Dock labour scheme. Grave disquiet was bound to be aroused among dockworkers throughout the country, and encouragement would be givento all those unsettling elements which wished to bring to an end the Scheme and the benefits which it had conferred on dock workersgenerally. No doubt the Scheme showed defects and in due coursethese should be examined, but he would himself prefer that, even then, this enquiry should be part of a larger investigation covering the inefficiency of the docks as a whole. The matter should be handled cautiously and without undue haste. It might well bethat alterations and improvements should be introduced locallyrather than nationally, and should be related to the circumstancesof particular docks. The National Dock Labour Board had perhapsattempted to introduce too much centralisation and uniformity, anda measure of devolution might now be required.In further discussion, there was general agreement that thiswas not an appropriate time at which to launch a formal enquiry into the operation of the Dock Labour Scheme. The recent dockstrikes, and particularly the current London dock strike, were notnormal industrial disputes. The political forces which had createdtrouble in Avonmouth, Liverpool and elsewhere appeared to have lost influence; and there were some grounds for hoping that thesame change might soon occur in the London docks.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of CP. (49) 145 and 151.(2) Agreed that the time was not ripe for any formal enquiry into the operation of the Dock Labour Scheme or the underlying causes of unrest in the docks.industrial disputes.London DockStrikes.(previous reference:C.M.(49)45thConclusions,Minute 3.)7. The Minister of Labour made a report to the Cabinet onthe latest developments in the strike of stevedores in the london docks, and on the discussions held during the week-end between officials of the Ministry of Labour and representatives of thestevedores&apos; and lightermen&apos;s unions. The crux of the trouble nowlay in the strikers&apos; belief that the Canadian ship-owners hadrepudiated the agreement reached with the Canadian Seamen&apos;union some weeks ago; and it had been agreed that the ShippingFederation should be asked to arrange a meeting between represen-tatives of the two Unions and of the Canadian ship-owners at whicha further attempt might be made to elucidate the facts. He didnot think there was anything that his Department could achieveby further discussions with the Unions.The general view of Ministers was that no advantage wouldbe gained from continued negotiations between the Ministry ofLabour and the Unions concerned; and that it should be made clear to the Union leaders that the Government were not prepared to enterinto further discussions with them.The following points were also made : *(a) It might be helpful if the Executive of the Lightermen&apos;union could be persuaded to state publicly that, after a full examination of the position, they were satisfied that the Canadianship-owners had not attempted to repudiate the agreement reached with the Canadian Seamen&apos;s Union.
(b) It was suggested that the Transport and General Workers&apos;Union might be asked to try to persuade its members to dissociatethemselves from the stevedores and lightermen, and to return towork separately. Might not the Union send one of its senior officials to make a direct appeal to the men on the spot ? It was pointed out,however, that the Union would probably be reluctant to adopt thiscourse in view of the risk that the other Unions might subsequently be successful in reopening negotiations with the canadian authorities. ,.(c) Attention was drawn to the part played by CanadianCommunist agitators in inspiring and sustaining the strike, andsome dissatisfaction was expressed at the fact that no powers existedunder which these men could be deported. Ought not provision tohave been made for this in the Emergency Regulations ? against this, it was pointed out that the enactment of legislation to enableBritish subjects to be deported from the United Kingdom wouldinvolve a major departure from accepted policy, and that it wouldnot have been right to make such a fundamental change in the lawby an Emergency Regulation.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Minister of Labour should decline to enterinto further discussion with the Unions concerned inconnection with the London dock strike.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to submit a memorandum on thequestion whether powers should be taken to enable theGovernment to deport British subjects who, not beingcitizens of the United Kingdom, engaged in subversive activities in this country.Food.Meat Supplies.(previous reference:CM. (49) 19thConclusions,Minute 5.)8. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofFood (CP. (49) 144) on the prospects of reducing the UnitedKingdom&apos;s dependence on Argentine meat supplies.The Minister of Food said that the position had improved insome respects since his memorandum was circulated. Supplies fromUruguay had increased as the result of the contraction of heralternative markets; and larger amounts were now likely to be forthcoming from both France and Ireland. But these developmentsdid not affect his general conclusion that there was little prospect,over the next five years, of finding alternative sources of supplywhich would materially reduce our dependence on the Argentine.There were, however, prospects of increased Commonwealth produc-tion in the more remote future.In discussion, the following points were made : (a) The position revealed by CP. (49) 144 emphasised the needfor securing the maximum expansion of home production of meat,and it was suggested that the possibility of increasing the existingtargets should be examined.(&amp;) Some anxiety was expressed at the slow progress made bythe Australian Government in preparing plans for the large-scale development of meat production. The Cabinet were informed thatthe interest which the Prime Minister of Australia had shown inthis project was not generally felt in official circles in Australia.
The Cabinet-(1) Took note of CP. (49) 144 and of the points made in discussion.(2) Invited the Minister of Food to discuss the developmentof Australian meat production with the AustralianMinister for Defence and Post-War Reconstruction .during his visit to this country.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,ISth July, 1949.
