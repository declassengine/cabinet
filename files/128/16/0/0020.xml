Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.It was agreed that the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, aswell as the Attorney-General, should speak on the Governmentsbehalf in the debate on 7th November on the Married Women(Restraint upon Anticipation) Bill.In the debate on 10th November on the report of the national coal Board the second Government speech would be made, accordingto the course of the debate, either by the Lord President or by theParliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Fuel and Power.Following the Cabinefs discussion on 27th October about theIron and Steel Bill, the Ministers more immediately concerned hadformulated detailed proposals about the coming into force of theBill, which the Lord Privy Seal and the Lord Chancellor Were now,with the Prime Minister&apos;s approval, discussing with the Leaders ofthe Opposition in the House of Lords.JointConsultationIn Industry.(previous reference:CM. (49) 58thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofLabour (CP. (49) 217) on the development of joint consultation in industry.  - . ; : .     - - -The Minister of Labour said that his Department had taken thisquestion up with the national organisations of fifty-four separateindustries.. Of these, fourteen had agreed to recommend to their members a model form of constitution for the establishment of joint committees. Another thirteen had agreed to recommend the estab-lishment of joint machinery, while leaving the form- of that-machinery to be settled by agreement in individual factories. Insixteen industries the national organisations preferred to leave theinitiative wholly to the individual factories. In eight industries,the national organisations expressed themselves as content withthe position, even though there was no formal machinery for joint consultation; and three industries had not yet reached agreement on the establishment of joint consultative machinery. In this matter the record of the socialised industries was satisfactory. TheMinister thought that the next step in the negotiations with thenational organisations should be to persuade the second group ofthirteen industries to recommend a model form of constitution totheir members. The question was to be considered further by thejoint consultative committee which, with the agreement of theNational Joint Advisory Council, was being reconstituted to dealwith any general labour issues arising in connection with the cam-paign for increased production. The best hope for securing further progress lay in a campaign directed by Trade Union Executives totheir local officials and shop stewards to arouse the interest of theaverage employee.In discussion the following points were made : , (a) Although there was undoubtedly a lack of interest amongthe workers, some managements also showed little imagination intheir handling of this machinery. In some factories the joint com-mittee was not encouraged to discuss any matters of real importance.(b) Sustained efforts should be made to lift this project to ahigher level of enthusiasm. More publicity should be given to the achievements of joint committees in factories where they were operating successfully. And, in particular, further steps shouldbe taken to ensure that the successes achieved were made known, notmerely to the leaders, but also to the rank and file, of the workers.The Cabinet were informed that this aspect of the problem wasbeing considered by the Human Factors Panel of the Committee on industrial Productivity.
(c) Would it be helpful if Production Departments assumed responsibility for pressing this project upon the industries for whichthey were responsible ? They might be better able to arouse interestin it as a means of securing increased production. The Minister ofLabour said that he preferred that his Department should continueto retain sole responsibility for this plan. He feared that, if itwere too directly connected with the campaign for increased pro-duction, it would be misrepresented by the Communists.(d) The establishment of machinery for joint consultation inthe railway service had been delayed by obstruction on the part ofthe National Union of Railwaymen. This, however, had now been overcome; and it was hoped that the principle would now be applied,not only in the railway shops, but generally throughout the railwayservice.The Cabinet-Took note of CP. (49) 217 and invited the Minister ofLabour to continue his efforts to encourage the develop-ment of machinery for joint consultation throughout industry.CottonIndustry.3. In connection with the discussion recorded in the preceding minute reference was made to the need for securing increased efficiency in the cotton industry. In mills where machinery had beenadapted to enable each weaver to work six looms, the workers hadbeen enabled to increase both their production and their earnings; butemployers were slow to install such new machinery, especially whenthey were able without re-equipment to keep their mills running to full capacity. It was suggested that more drastic action should now be taken to compel such employers to install more modernmachinery. If this could not be done under existing powers, shouldnot fresh legislation be introduced for the purpose ? Would it be useful if the Government acquired, or manufactured, the new machinery and leased it to mill-owners who were unable, or unwilling, to buy it?The Cabinet-Invited the Production Committee to consider means ofincreasing the efficiency of the cotton industry.prison officers&apos; Pay.(Previous .Reference:CM. (49) 57thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the HomeSecretary (CP. (49) 219 and 222) on an application for an increasein pay made by the Prison Officers&apos; Association on behalf of the subordinate staffs in the English and Scottish prison services.The Home Secretary said that the prison population wasdouble the pre-war figure and, on account of a variety of circum-stances including the longer sentences imposed by the courts, was likely to remain at a high level for a considerable time. Prisonaccommodation was inadequate, even when allowance was made forthe considerable number of additional buildings which had beentaken over; and in many of the older prisons it was now necessaryto house prisoners three to a cell. Meanwhile, the number of prison officers in the basic grade was falling. Against an estimated needin England and Wales of 3,600 officers in 1949 and possibly 4,000in 1950, there were now less than 3,000, which was lower than the
strength last year. Moreover, the quality of the existing staff andof the Tecruits who were coming forward gave some ground fordisquiet. Prison officers had a starting wage of *9Bs. a week; with free quarters and uniform, and the Prison Officers&apos; Associationwere claiming a starting wage of 118s., with corresponding increases in other grades. The Prison Commissioners thought that a starting-wage of 110s. was necessary to attract recruits. Their proposals would cost  95,500 in the first year with an additional cost for overtime amounting to  14,500. Experience of police recruitment(outside the Metropolitan Police District) since the announcementof the increase in police pay supported the view that increased pay would lead to a greater flow of recruits to the prison service. TheChancellor of the Exchequer considered that the offer of any increasein the pay of prison officers would be contrary to the Governmentswages policy. The question had therefore been brought before theCabinet so that a decision could be taken by the Government as awhole. If the claim was to be rejected, it should be rejected on general economic grounds ^and not on its merits.In discussion, the following points were made: (a) The need to increase recruitment to the prison service wasnot so acute in Scotland as in England, because the Scottish prisonpopulation had not grown to the same extent. At the same time thefact that last year the majority of the recruits to the Scottish prison service had resigned after less than twelve months&apos; service suggestedthat conditions were not satisfactory.(b) On 26th September the Cabinet had abandoned the excep-tion in favour of under-manned industries in the White Paper on personal Incomes, Costs, and Prices and had substituted an excep-tion for poorly-paid workers. When regard was had to the moneyvalue of free quarters and uniform, the prison service could not beregarded as poorly-paid in comparison with other occupations. Itwas therefore difficult to argue that the general standstill on wages should not apply to it. Any willingness by the Government to con-cede a wage increase to prison officers would embarrass the EducationMinisters in resisting pressure for an increase in teachers&apos; pay, andmight also have repercussions on the pay of male attendants inmental defective institutions.(e) It was understood that the Prison Officers&apos; association would reject any offer which fell short of their full claim and wouldtake the matter to arbitration. The Government should do nothing to prevent the matter going to arbitration in the usual way. It was important to avoid giving any impression that the Government were seeking to interfere in present circumstances with the normal pro-procedures for arbitration on wages claims.id) All possible steps should be taken to avoid any breakdown in prison administration. If it were not practicable to stimulaterecruitment by an increase in prison officers&apos; pay, other measures should be taken to interest the right type of person in the prison service as a career.ie) Attention was drawn to the disparity between recruitment for provincial police forces in England and Wales and recruitment for the Metropolitan Police Force, The explanation might be foundin the closer personal relations between superintendents andinspectors on the one hand, and ordinary constables on the other, inthe smaller police forces compared with the Metropolitan police force. The Home Secretary might find it necessary to overhaul theorganisation of the Metropoltan Police with a view to securing abetter relationship between senior officers and constables.(/) Ministers would shortly be discussing various difficultieswhich arose in applying the standstill policy to the wages of variousgrades in the National Health Service (CP. (49) 220). It was felt,however, that these difficulties were sufficiently different from the
65 CM. 63 (49)problems that arose in the prison service to make it unnecessary to delay a decision on the question raised in CP. (49) 219.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Home Secretary should refuse to concede the increases in pay claimed by the Prison Officers&apos;Association on behalf of prison officers.(2) Agreed that, if the Prison Officers&apos; Association decided totake the matter to arbitration, the Government should oppose the claim on general economic grounds.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,3rd November, 1949.ft
