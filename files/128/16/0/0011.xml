China.(previous reference:C.M.(49)42ndConclusions,&apos; Minute 5.)37591-1. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Foreign Secre-tary (CP. (49) 180 and 184) describing recent developments in Chinaand outlining the policy which he proposed, subject to the views ofhis colleagues, to pursue.The Foreign Secretary said that, as would be seen fromCP. (49) 184, the Chinese Nationalist Government had returned an unsatisfactory reply to our request for facilities for the passage of relief ships to Shanghai; and lie had therefore intended to ask theCabinet to decide that British merchant vessels should be escortedpast the blockade into Shanghai. At the last moment, however, hislegal advisers in the &quot;Foreign Office had expressed the view that aninternational court might hold that this blockade was not illegal,and that in that event we should find difficulty in justifying our useof warships to escort1 merchant vessels into Shanghai. He nowproposed to seek the opinion of the Law Officers on this point; andhe asked the Cabinet to agree that the action proposed inparagraph 22 (2) of CP. (49) 180 might be taken if the Law Officersadvised that there was little risk of its being successfully challengedin an international court.The Cabinet were informed that the Chiefs of Staff consideredthe operation to be militarily feasible. Up to the mouth of theWhangpo River the main threat would be from air attack, and tomeet this the convoy should be accompanied by an aircraft carrierfrom Hong Kong with a cruiser in support. At the mouth of theriver there would be some risk of attack by surface vessels.. this could, however, be dealt with by the close escort. Assurances shouldbe obtained in advance that the ships would not be fired upon by communist forces on the river banks. It would not be practicable to provide any air cover during the journey up the river and back;and the risk of attack by Nationalist aircraft during this part ofthe operation must be accepted. Ministers should also understandthat any attack on the convoy in the open seas would have to betreated as an act of war, to which we should have to reply by air attack on the Nationalist bases in the Chusan peninsula and inFormosa. It would be preferable that the convoy should start from japan, since it would then have the advantage of surprise andwould be less liable to be attacked on its outward journey.The Cabinet were .also informed that no mine-sweepers wereavailable in the area to sweep a channel for the convoy. the nationalists had no mines or mine-layers of their own, but they had some Japanese mines which could be laid from junks.In discussion it was pointed out that the withdrawal of forces for this operation would impose some delay on the preparations forthe defence of Hong Kong; and that the withdrawal of the aircraft carrier, in particular, would involve a risk to the defences of theColony. If the Chinese Communists should launch an attack onHong Ke&amp;ff while the carrier was away, the air defence of the Colonywould suffer; and there was also the risk that the carrier might besunk in this operation. The Chief of the Air Staff said, however,that it would be unjustifiable to despatch the convoy without an aircraft carrier, since air attack was the main risk which the convoywould run; and he considered that the carrier, while desirable, wasnot indispensable for the defence of Hong Kong.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to seek the views of the LawOfficers on the question whether we could&quot; justify before an international court the legality of our action in usingwarships to escort British merchant vessels intoShanghai past the blockade which was being maintained by the Chinese Nationalist Government.(2) Agreed that, if the Law Officers answered this question inthe affirmative, arrangements should be made to escortBritish merchant vessels into Shanghai, as proposed inparagraph 22 (2) of CP.

(49) 180. ,,;    isiiZ(4) Agreed that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador; at Nanking shouldbe instructed tp withdraw for ponsultation as soon asit became clear that a,central Coinhiuniist Governmentof China was about tp be set up; and that these instruc-tions should be notified to the Governments of other commonwealth countries, the United States, France andother friendly Powers. ,(5) Invited the, Lord Privy Seal to arrange for other Common-wealth Governments to be informed at once of thedecisions recorded in Qpnciusions .(2)-(4) above; and asked the Foreign Secretary to take an; opportunity of explaining the position, in the light of his conversations with the United States Secretary of State, to therepresentatives of Commonwealth Governments at theUnited Nations Assembly.2. The Cabinet considered a membrahdum (CP. (49) 177)circulated by the Foreign Secretary^ tnd,the. Secretary of State forthe Colonies in response to tne Cabinet&apos;s request of ?3rd June thatthey snould submit their proposals on long-term policy in respectof Hong Kong.The Foreign, Secretary said that he and the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies had reached the conclusion that; while the UnitedKingdom Government should be prepared to discuss the future of hong Kong with a friendly, democratic and stable Government ofa unified China, the conditions under -which such discussions couldbe undertaken did not exist at present and were unlikely to exist in the foreseeable future. Until conditions changed, the UnitedKingdom Government intended to retain their position in HongKong and should so inform the Governments of other Common-wealth countries arid the United States, though they should refrainin public froni pronouncements which would exacerbate relationswith China. They therefore recommended that the Foreign Secre-tary should communicate this conclusion to the United states secretary of State and seek his support for it, and that the lord privy Seal should similarly inform other Commonwealth Govern-ments.In discussion it was pointed out that the conclusions suggestedin this memorandum went beyond the Cabinet&apos;s earlier decision(that Hong Kong should be defended against aggression), which was based on the principle that force, or a show of force, should not beallowed to bring about any change in the status of the Colony.This, however, was essentially a short-term policy, attd the cabinet had wished to have an opportunity of examining proposals for along-term policy. Some Ministers believed that our only chanceof maintaining our position in Hong Kong for any length of time was to enlist the support of the united States Government for apolicy of placing it7 under an international regime; and it was arguable that, if such a proposal was to be put forward at all, itshould be put forward quickly before, conditions in Chinadeteriorated any further. It was also arguable that, from the pointOf view of British prestige in the Far East; it would be preferable to take the initiative iii making such an offer rather than wait until a Chinese Government formally demanded that Hong Kong shouldbe handed back to China.  The Cabinet were also reminded that the

It was doubtful whether theUnited Kingdom Government would have any right to surrenderthe Leased. Territory to an international authority, and the deviceof granting a sub-lease to such an authority might not prove feasible.Finally, if international control were proposed, there might be difficulty in excluding the Soviet Government from any share in it.In further discussion attention was drawn to the proposal inparagraphs 12 and 16 of CP. (49) 177 that we should not discussthe futdre bf Hong Kong with a central Chinese Government unlessthat Government were &quot; friendly, democratic, stable and in controlof a united China.&quot; The inclusion in this formula of the condition that the Government must be &quot;democratic&quot; would, if accepted,have the effect of precluding us from discussing that question atany time with a Communist Government of China. It was thegeneral view of the Cabinet that the conclusion indicated inparagraph 16 of CP. (49) 177 might be accepted as an interimpolicy, subject to the omission of the words&quot; and democratic &quot; inthe second line of that paragraph; but that further consideration should be given in the near future to the possibility of establishingsome form of international control over Hong Kong and that if, on further reflection, the Foreign Secretary thought that this might prove to be a practicable course he might take an opportunity of ascertaining, in informal and exploratory conversations with theUnited States Secretary of State, whether the United StatesGovernment would be likely to support such a policy.The Cabinet-(1) Endorsed, as an interim policy, the conclusion set out inparagraph 16 of CP. (49) 177 subject to the omission of the words &apos;&apos; and democratic&apos;&apos; from the second lineof that paragraph.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to give further considerationto the suggestion that Hong Kong might be brought under some system of international control and, if he considered such a course to be practicable, to ascertainin informal and exploratory conversations with theUnited States Secretary of State whether the UnitedStates Government were likely to support such a policy.
In discussion the following points were&quot;-raised.&quot; -(a) There were limits to the numbers of/technical experts who could be &quot;provided to assist &quot;in the -development; of. Middle Eastcountries. It. might be necessary to offer higher, salaries for theseposts.:        .....     &apos;., &quot;      .- ... .       -r, 1(b) There was little prospect that the United Kingdom wouldbe able to.increase the financial or material assistance which was already being provided for economic development: in the middle east. Of the various methods of assistance mentioned in para-graph 29 of CP. (49) 183, the only heads un,der which we were likelyto be able to do more than we were doing already were the second and fifth, viz., the support of applications to the International bank and the provision of technical assistance.(c) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was unlikely to be able to agree that the annual subvention to the Arab Legionshould be increased from  3^ millions to  5^ millions, as proposedin paragraph 30 (a) of CP. (49) 183, unless this additional sumcould be found from the total provided in the Defence Estimates.It was suggested that some economy might be secured by givingsubventions for the maintenance of armed forces by certain middle east countries and making corresponding reductions in our own defence expenditure in the Middle East. It was agreed that this possibility should be considered by the Defence Committee.(d) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was doubtful about the proposal in paragraph 30 (c) of CP. (49) 183 for a further contribution of  1 million towards the relief of Arab refugees. Asat present advised he considered that any further contribution shouldbe limited to  250,000 or at most  500,000.(e) It would be useful if the substance of paragraphs 23-28 of cp. (49) 183 could be communicated to the Governments ofAustralia, New Zealand and South Africa, as background to the staff conversations which were shortly to be held with those countries.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statement on Middle East policy set out inthe memorandum annexed to CP. (49) 183; and agreedthat, subject to the points noted-in paragraphs (b)-(d)above, this memorandum might be accepted by theForeign Office as a general directive for all Middle Eastquestions.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence to arrange for the DefenceCommittee to consider to what extent our defence expen-- diture in the Middle East might be reduced if furthersubventions were made towards the maintenance of armed forces by certain Middle East countries.(3) Authorised the Commonwealth Relations Office to com-- &quot;\ -   municate to the Government of Australia, New zealand and South Africa the substance of paragraphs 23-28 ofthe memorandum annexed to CP.

itt tlieir own citizenship law. The Commonwealth Relations Officetherefore sought authority to enter into discussions with the indian government on this question.In discussion it was suggested that before this legislation w&amp;sintroduced, the Cabinet should define their attitude towards theliability to military service of Indian citizens resident in this country.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that legislation on the lines indicated in paragraph3 of CP. (49) 181 should be passed before the new indian constitution came into operation on 26th January, 1950.(2) Agreed that the Commonwealth Relations Office should beauthorised to inform the Government of India of thegeneral lines of this proposed legislation, should seek toelucidate their attitude on the nationality question, andshould try to secure their agreement that persons ofUnited Kingdom descent and connection who were quali-fied and desired to become Indian citizens should be ableto do so and at the same time to retain their status as british subjects or as United Kingdom citizens.(3) Agreed that a final decision on the nationality provisions to be included in the proposed legislation should be takenin the light of the outcome of these discussions with theIndian Government.(4) Invited the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations,in consultation with the Law Officers, to submit to theCabinet a memorandum on the liability to military serviceof Indian citizens resident in the United Kingdom.v 5. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the line to be takenby the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer inthe forthcoming economic discussions in Washington;They first considered a note by the President of the Board ofTrade (CP. (49) 179) covering a memorandum by the Treasury onthe sterling balances of the sterling area.In discussion there was general agreement that an attempt should be made in the Washington discussions to enlist the supportof the United States Government in dealing with the problem of sterling balances. It was recognised that there was&apos; little prospectof persuading the United States Government to lessen, by theprovision of dollars, the burden which these balances imposed onthe United Kingdom&apos;s balance of payments. It was also recognisedthat it would be politically inexpedient to bring any undue pressure to bear on India pr Pakistan to accept cancellation of their sterling-balances. Nevertheless, it would be useful if this problem couldbe fully explored in discussion Avith representatives of the UnitedStates Government This would at least provide an opportunity for making clear to the United States authorities the extent to whichthe United Kingdom had already contributed, through the drawing-down of the sterling balances, to measures of economic reconstructionwhich the United States would otherwise have been called upon to finance. .;.The Cabinet-,     (1) Took note of the memorandum annexed to CP. (49) 179,- and authorised the Foreign Secretary arid the Chancellor
of the Exchequer to discuss the problem of sterling balances, in the forthcoming discussions in Washington,on the lines indicated in that memorandum.The Cabinet next discussed a memorandum by the Minister of fuel and Power (CP. (49) 176) covering the report of a working party of officials on the problem of oil and dollars.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that in 1949-50 theproduction of the British oii companies would exceed, by 4 million tons, what was required to meet their sales in the sterling area andto third countries; and within the next few years this surpluswould rise to a point which would justify the removal of all restrictions on oil consumption in the sterling area. But the non-discrimination provisions of the Anglo-American Loan agreement would have the effect of precluding us from consuming this surplusproduction of oil unless at the same time we bought an additionalamount of dollar oil and thus increased our dollar deficit. In1949-50 the surplus production would be mainly in fuel oil; butin later years there was likely to be also a surplus of motor spirit.This was a position which it would become politically impossible todefend. The United States Government might argue that we couldprevent that position from arising by cutting back the expansion programme of the British oil companies; but that was a solution which we should decline to adopt, if only because it was inconsistent with the economic development of those Middle East countries inwhich our oil concessions were held. Our proper course wastherefore to press that Article 9 of the Loan Agreement, in its application to oil, should be so relaxed as to enable us to takeadvantage of this surplus production of the British companies.In discussion there was general agreement that the UnitedStates Government should be strongly pressed, in the forthcoming discussions in Washington, to agree to some relaxation of Article of the Loan Agreement. In the last few days there had beenindications that the United States authorities might be preparedto make concessions in this respect. Even if it proved, however,that they were unwilling to make any* general relaxation ofArticle 9, they should at least be .strongly pressed to agree thatits provisions should not be interpreted as applying to oil. If this could be agreed in principle with the United States Government, itshould be possible to arrive at some detailed agreement between theBritish and American oil companies which would enable us toconsume the future surplus production of the British companieswithout increasing our dollar expenditure on oil.In further discussion the following points were made : (a) It was suggested that it was unfortunate that the true facts of the oil situation had not been brought to the notice of ministers at an earlier stage. The Minister of Fuel and Power said that, ifthere had been delay, nothing had been lost thereby, since the british oil companies had not yet produced any surplus beyond what was required to meet their sales in the sterling area and to third countries. Moreover, the facts of the situation had changed sub-stantially in recent months: owing to fresh discoveries of oil inthe western hemisphere, the United States authorities were less concerned than they had been to exploit the oil resources of theMiddle East.(b) Some Ministers felt that in earlier discussions there hadbeen a tendency to over-estimate the value of British oil production as a means of saving dollar expenditure. Large expenditure of dollars and large allocations of steel had been authorised for theexpansion programme of the British oil companies on this basis;and it now seemed possible that too high a priority had been givento this programme. When the outcome of the Washington dis-cussions was known, Ministers should review their attitude towards this programme.
(c) It was suggested that Ministers should also consider atthat stage means of liquidating by 1952 the net dollar liability ofthe United Kingdom in respect of the sale of sterling oil to soft-currency countries. Was it reasonable that we should continue tosupply to European countries oil which involved us in dollar expenditure? Even though dollar invoicing was impracticable,could not other means be found of reducing this liability?The Cabinet-(2) Took note of the report on oil and dollars annexed to cp (49) 176.(3) Agreed that in the forthcoming discussions in Washingtonthe Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of theExchequer should press for the suspension of Article of the Anglo-American Loan Agreement; and, if thatconcession could not be obtained, should urge very strongly that the principle of non-discrimination shouldnot apply to oil in the sterling area and that means of reducing our dollar expenditure on oil should be sought by negotiations in London between the United KingdomGovernment and the American oil companies.(4) Agreed that the expansion programme of the British oil companies, and the continued supply to european countries of sterling oil involving dollar expenditure,should be further reviewed by the Cabinet in the lightof the outcome of the Washington discussions.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,29th August, 1949.
