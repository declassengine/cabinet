123CM. 71 (49)   126NeglectedChildren.(previous reference:CM.(47)29thConclusions,Minute 6.)1. The Cabinet discussed the line which the government spokesman should take in the debate in the House of Commons later that day on a motion, in the name of Mrs. Ayrton Gould, M.P., andothers, calling upon the Government to appoint an &apos;&apos; official committee&quot; to make recommendations for the more effectiveprevention of cruelty and neglect of children and for remedialtreatment. Some of the Ministers concerned were prepared to concede the appointment of a departmental committee for thispurpose, while others preferred to await the results of an examina-tion of the subject which was being conducted by an inter-departmental working party of officials.In favour of the appointment of a departmental committee of outside persons, it was argued that proposals for dealing with thisdelicate question would be more likely to command public acceptanceif they came from a committee including Members of Parliament andother persons of standing than if they resulted from considerationby a group of civil servants. Cases of child neglect aroused greatpopular interest and uneasiness, and it was desirable that some ofthose who voiced this public disquiet should participate in an effort to find constructive solutions. Neglect often arose from carelessnessrather than from deliberate cruelty, and imprisonment of the parentwas often an ineffective remedy. The courts were reluctant to usesuch institutions as existed for the reformation of parents, and thereport of a departmental committee would carry greater weight withmagistrates than a policy adopted by Ministers solely on the basis of advice by civil servants. Again, the National Society for thePrevention of Cruelty to Children probably required reorganisation,notably in regard to their tendency to rely almost exclusively on maleinspectors, and a committee of outsiders could do valuable work in securing improvements in this and other voluntary organisations.Such a committee could, like the Curtis Committee, hear evidence in private and thus avoid any sensational reporting of its proceedings by the press. If, after the debate of 22nd July last andthe present debate, bad cases came to light while the subject was still under examination, the Government would be in a stronger position if they had appointed a departmental committee than if the subject was still being considered between Departments.Against the appointment of a departmental committee, it waspointed out that the subject had wide ramifications, and it was notyet clear how a committee could be confined by its terms of referenceto exploring only those parts of the field in which Government action could properly be undertaken. In so far as neglect was associatedwith overcrowding or with the inability of the Government toprovide special accommodation for children who were mentallydefective or otherwise incapacitated, any report might merely drawspecial attention to conditions which the Government desired to remedy but found it difficult to deal with promptly under present economic conditions. In so far as, with the general improvement ofthe standard of living, child neglect was due primarily to the default of individual parents, the enquiry might range into difficult andembarrassing fields. A committee might not be able to make manysuggestions for the prevention of child neglect; and remedial measures, including any reorganisation of the National Society forthe Prevention of Cruelty to Children, might be better handled by officials who understood the working of the administrative machine.There was no reason to believe that child neglect was on the increase,although the number of cases brought into court (which had remainedmore or less Stationary) probably reflected the amount of work whichcould be undertaken by the National Society for the Prevention ofCruelty to Children rather than the extent of the problem.The general view of Ministers was that, before it was decided whether a departmental committee should be appointed, the existinginterdepartmental working group of officials should first complete their review of the field and should indicate in what respects therewere problems for which practical solutions might be found.38012-2b 2
The Cabinet-Agreed that the Home Secretary, in accepting the motion on child neglect on behalf of the Government, should explain that in present circumstances it would be inter-preted as referring to the interdepartmental working group of officials which was ascertaining the extent of the field for further enquiry; and that the Government, on receiptof the report of this group, would consider whether a departmental committee, including Members x*f parliament and.other persons of standing, should be appointed to investigate any aspects of the subject which meritedfurther enquiry by an independent body of this kind.Trade with canada.(previous reference erence:CM. (49) 57thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Cabinet&apos;s attention was drawn to statements made bythe Canadian Minister of Agriculture, before and during a debate in the Canadian House of Commons on 10th December, to the effectthat the reductions in the United Kingdom programme of importsfrom Canada represented a deliberate attempt to drive Canadianfood products out of the United Kingdom market. The cabinet took particular exception to the statement that this policy repre-sented a deliberate onslaught by United Kingdom officials uponCanadian trade, and to the suggestion that United Kingdom officialscontinued to buy from the United States food products which theydeclined to buy from Canada. It was specially unfortunate thatthese statements should be made so soon after the efforts made bythe United Kingdom Government, in response to representations by the Prime Minister of Canada, to remove any impression created by newspaper articles in this country that the recent deterioration in the United Kingdom dollar balance of payments was due to theeconomic policy of the Canadian Government.The Cabinet-Invited the Prime Minister to send a personal message tothe Prime Minister of Canada protesting against the termsof  these   statements  by  the   Canadian  Minister  ofAgriculture.Qil and dollars.(previous reference:CM. (49)54thConclusions,Minute 5.)ProposedAbolitionof petrol rationing inAustralia.3. The new Government of Australia had promised in theirelection campaign that, if they were returned to power, they wouldabolish the rationing of petrol in Australia.The Cabinefs attention was drawn to the serious consequences which this would have on the dollar balance of payments of the sterling area. They agreed that no time should be lost in asking the new Australian Government not to take this step without prior consulation with the United Kingdom Government.The Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations to arrange for a message to be sent to the United kingdom high Commissioner in Canberra, for delivery as soon as thenew Australian Government had taken office, urging them not to proceed with their proposal to abolish petrol rationing in Australia until they had had an opportunityfor consultation with the United Kingdom Government onthe consequences which this Would involve for the dollarbalance of the sterling area.
4. The President of the Board of Trade informed the cabinet of the line which he proposed to take in the debate on the film industry which was to be held in the House of Commons on14th December.The President added that, in the light of that debate, and after he had had rather more time to consider the report of the Committeewhich had been examining the structure of the film industry, hewould circulate to the Cabinet his long-term proposals for increasingthe efficiency of the industry and securing any necessary measure ofcontrol over its operation. He had undertaken to circulate such areport when the Cabinet last considered this question on24th March; but the work of the Committee on the structure of theindustry had been delayed by the death of its first Chairman,Lord Portal, and its report had only recently been submitted.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the line which the President of the Board ofTrade proposed to take in the forthcoming debate in theHouse of Commons on the film industry.(2) Took note that the President of the Board of Trade would submit to them shortly his proposals on the long-termfuture of the industry. &apos; &apos;Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,12th December, 1949.The film industry.(previous reference:C.M.(49)22ndConclusions,Minute 2.)
