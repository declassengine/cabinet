Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.101CM. 68 (4^     U31. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The debate on the Report of the Transport Commission on1st December would be taken on a motion which, following the precedent set in the recent debate on the Annual Report of theNational Coal Board, would do no more than invite the House to-take note of the Report.Civil Aviation.Inquiry intoAccident at prestwick.2. The Cabinet expressed concern at the action taken by theMinister of Civil Aviation in publishing, simultaneously with theissue of the report of the court of inquiry which had investigated an air accident at Prestwick in October 1948, a letter to the Presidentof the court stating that he and the Secretary of State for Air were satisfied that no part of the responsibility for the accident rested onthe staff of the air traffic control or the meteorological services at the airport. This had been the subject of a Private Notice Question inthe House of Commons on the previous day, and it seemed likely that it would attract further comment in Parliament.The Prime Minister said that he would discuss with theMinister of Civil Aviation the future handling of this situation.Enforcement 3,   The Prime Minister said that some public uneasiness had of Financial been created by the offer of rewards for information leading to theand Economic detection of offences under the Exchange Control Act; and he hadControls. to answer that day a Question by Lieutenant-Colonel Sir ThomasPayments to Moore, M.P., asking which Government Departments made aInformers.      practice of paying informers for reporting infringements of the law.The Cabinet were informed that the Revenue Departments hadspecific authority to pay small rewards to informers under statutesgoing back to the 18th century, and for many years past had also*paid from time to time, with Treasury authority, larger rewards inexcess of the statutory maximum of  50. Other Departments which made rewards to informers, without specific statutory authority,were the Board of Trade, Ministry of Food and Post Office. Thetotal amounts paid were small: the Inland Revenue, for example,,had paid a total of  1,100 over the last ten years in pursuance oftheir statutory authority, and the amount which they had paid in larger rewards with Treasury consent had totalled only  11,235 inthe whole of the period from 1916-38. But the information forwhich the rewards had been paid had sometimes led to the detectionof large-scale offences, and there was good reason to believe that someof the informers would not have come forward except in the hope ofreward.In discussion it was pointed out that the attitude of publicopinion towards common informers had undergone a substantial change since Parliament had last sanctioned the payment of suchrewards. Could any assurance be given that Departments would notreward informers whose disclosure of information involved a breach of a confidential relationship, e.g., between master and servant?In reply it was pointed out that the only criterion which a department could properly take into account in assessing a rewardwas the value of the information received. Payment of rewardsfor information was necessary for the effective enforcement of thelaw; and the enforcement of the Exchange Control Act, against which current criticism was specially directed, was an essentialmeasure for supporting the strength of sterling and maintaining-the reserves of foreign exchange. There was no evidence of anyabuse of the existing system of rewarding informers, and there were good reasons for upholding the continuance!of that system.37966-1
The Cabinet Agreed that there were no sufficient grounds for modifying the present practice of paying rewards for informationleading to the detection of offences against the law; andthat this system could properly be upheld against currentParliamentary criticism.Amendmentof the parliament act.(previous reference:-CM. (49) 34thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Lord Privy Heal said that, when the Government movedthe Second Reading of the Parliament Bill for the third time inthe House of Lords, the Leaders of the Conservative Oppositionintended to invite their supporters to vote against it, without anyreasoned amendment or any long debate. From the tactical pointof view this was to be welcomed; but he had been advised that a refusal to grant a Second Reading might not amount to a rejection of the Bill within the meaning of section 2 (1) of the parliament act, 1911, and in that event the Bill could not be presented for theRoyal Assent until the end of the Session. This might have a bearing on the question whether Parliament should be proroguedor adjourned in December.The Prime Minister said that he would take an opportunity of discussing this technical question of procedure with the ministers most directly concerned.Receipts andExpenditure ofthe british transport commission.(previous reference:C.M.(48)62ndConclusions,Minute 1.)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofTransport (CP. (49) 239) proposing that an application by theBritish Transport Commission for authority to increase railway-freight charges and dock charges should be referred for advice tothe Transport Tribunal under section 82 of the Transport Act, 1947.The Minister of Transport said that the first year&apos;s operationof the British Transport Commission had resulted in a net revenuedeficit of  4f million, and the deficit in the current year was estimated at  25 million. He was satisfied that the reorganisation of public transport under the Transport Act, ,1947, was sound, butit would be some time before the benefits of co-ordination could beachieved. The Commission would not have the monopoly of long-distance road haulage until 1st February, 1950, and the transferof road passenger services to the Commission on an area basis wouldtake much longer to complete. The railways were not paying their way because, while costs had gone up by 125 per cent., charges were only 55 per cent, above the pre-war rates. Similarly, the docks whichhad been taken over from the railway companies were not payingtheir way. He was opposed to any Government subsidy for public transport and he saw no alternative but to increase freight ratesas proposed by the Commission. He did not recommend any further increase in passenger fares, for gross receipts from passenger traffichad fallen since the recent increase in fares.In discussion, the following points were made : (a) The proposed increase in railway freight charges, &quot;ifunaccompanied by any action in respect of road transport, wouldaggravate a situation which was already unsatisfactory. There wassurplus carrying capacity on the railways and, from the nationalpoint of view, it was desirable that more goods should go by rail and less by road, since the provision of further road transport involved the use of steel, vehicle-making capacity and oil, and increased the costs of road maintenance. An increase in railway freight charges would drive more traffic to the roads and it would be difficult for the railways to recover that traffic at some later date.(b) An increase in railway freight charges would fall especiallyheavily on lower grade traffic, such as coal, iron ore and steel.Increased prices of these raw materials would affect the cost of
living and would handicap the export drive. Higher grade traffic would escape the increased charges by transfer to road transport.The British Transport Commission should be concentrating on methods of providing an efficient service for high-grade goods whichtraders would wish to employ because it was cheaper and more efficient than any service tney could provide themselves.(c) There was room for economy in the staffing of the railways,but the National Union of Railwaymen were not co-operating inthe reduction of staff and the withdrawal of restrictive practices by labour. This was not a matter which would come within the purview of the Transport Tribunal in any advice they might give to theMinister on the Commission^ proposals.(d) When the railways were privately owned, a fall in revenue would to some extent have been cushioned by a reduction in interest payments to the holders of ordinary stock. That stock had nowbeen replaced by fixed-interest Government stock, on which the Corn-mission had to find interest charges which did not vary from yearto year. It was, however, suggested that these interest charges didnot represent a serious burden per ton miles of goods carried.(e) Until long-distance road haulage became a monopoly ofthe Commission in the following year and until area road-passengerschemes were worked out, it would be difficult to secure an additional contribution to the Commission^ revenues from road services, butthere were other ways in which a transfer of traffic from rail to road transport might be discouraged. Although the Minister of Trans-port had asked for a reduction in the supply of commercial lorriesand public service vehicles to undertakings other than the Corn-mission, little or nothing had in fact been done in this direction. Itmight also be desirable to increase the taxation on road vehicles and on oil. In regard to undertakings carrying their own goods(under &quot; C &quot; licences) reliable information had now been collectedabout the tonnage carried and the purposes for which &quot; C &quot; licencevehicles were employed, and this suggested that &quot; C &quot; licenceholders were not encroaching seriously upon traffic which should properly be carried by the Commission. In regard to road passenger services, increases in wages, reductions in hours and increases inrunning costs (including the cost of oil) were making businesses lessprofitable than they had been. Long-distance road passenger services still appeared to be profitable, although low fares werecharged, and the Transport Act did not seem adequately to providefor the taking over of these undertakings by the Commission.In the light of these considerations the Cabinet then discussedwhether it would be practicable to arrange for the railway deficitto continue for a year or two, until the Commission had completed the co-ordination of rail and road transport. It was felt to be undesirable at this stage to impose additional railway freight charges, which would operate against the satisfactory division ofbusiness between road and rail services which it was hoped eventually to achieve. It was unreasonable to expect the British transport commission to complete the reorganisation of the public transportof this country in two years : it had taken much longer than that to reorganise London transport and the dock facilities in the Port ofLondon, both of which Were much smaller operations.Ministers discussed how any deficit might be carried for thenext year or so. One method would be for the Commission to borrow on a short-term basis from the Exchequer, but this was opento the objection that it might prove to be a disguised government subsidy unless satisfactory guarantees could be obtained that thelarge sums involved would be repaid. The injection of Exchequermoney into transport services might also make it difficult to enforcedrastic economies in railway working. An alternative methodmight be to increase the permanent capital of the Commission, if itcould be shown that additional capital was required to finance the transition to a co-ordinated scheme of transport; but this again
might retard any drastic reorganisation of transport services, witha view to securing more economical working, if &quot;it could be repre-sented as a watering of capital.There was general agreement that final conclusions could not bereached on this question without more information than was avail-able about the long-term plans of the Commission. What financial results did the Commission expect to achieve as co-ordination wasprogressively secured over the next three or five years? Was it reasonable to expect that there would soon be a net revenue surplussufficient to wipe off any deficit that might mount up until the endof 1950; or, on a less optimistic view, was there a prospect of abalancing of revenue and expenditure which would enable theGovernment to regard the present deficits as a temporarydifficulty of a transitional character? In this connection it waspointed out that, since railway costs had increased in recent yearsfar more than passenger fares and freight rates, it was difficult to-see how a state of balance could be reached without some increase in transport^charges.It was recognised that the information about future prospectswhich the Cabinet desired to secure could not be available for-consideration before the debate on the First Annual Report of theBritish Transport Commission in the House of Commons on1st December. Moreover, the Commission were incurring a deficit of million per week under present circumstances. There would,therefore, be some advantage in submitting the Commission^ appli-cation to the Transport Tribunal for advice. The Minister, in niscovering letter, should not express an opinion on the Commission^proposals but should simply seek the views^of the Tribunal. while there was a risk that interested parties might canvass the issuewhether passenger fares should not be increased, past experience of&quot;the Railway Rates Tribunal suggested that the Transport tribunal would regard passenger and goods traffic as distinct, and in any event the Commission would have no difficulty in showing that therecent increase in passenger fares had in fact led to a diminution of passenger traffic. The Minister should inform Parliament, inadvance of the debate on 1st December, that he had received anapplication from the British Transport Commission for the increaseof certain charges and had referred this application for advice to-the Transport Tribunal. In the debate the Minister could explain that the Government were considering the-wider aspects of the issues raised by the deficits on the operation of the Commission and would consider the advice received from the Tribunal in the light of their consideration of these wider issues.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Minister of Transport should seek theadvice of the Transport Tribunal on the applicationof the British Transport Commission for authority toincrease railway freight charges and dock charges, andshould consult the Lord President and the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer on the terms of the communication to besent to the Transport Tribunal.(2) Agreed that the Minister of Transport, after he had asked the Transport Tribunal to consider the Commission^application, should so inform the House of Commons andin the forthcoming debate should handle the generalsubject of the Commission^ finances in the manner indi-cated in the course of the Cabinets discussion.(3) Asked the Minister of Transport to arrange for the pre-paration of a three-year plan for completing theco-ordination of road and rail transport, to discuss withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer means of financing sucha plan, and to submit the resulting proposals forconsideration by the Cabinet.
Wages Policy.: Retail TradeWages.(Previous:Reference:*C.M.(49)53rdConclusions,-Minute, 2.)6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofLabour (CP. (49) 238) on retail trade wages.The Minister of Labour recalled&apos; that the Cabinet had agreed on 29th August that he should approve the Wages regulationproposals of the eight Wages Councils for the retail distributive trades. Wages Regulation Orders had been issued to confirm the proposals of six of these Councils, but the final proposals of theWages Councils of the Retail Drapery, Outfitting and FootwearTrades and of the Furnishing and Allied Trades had only recentlybeen received and were still awaiting confirmation. It might be argued that the confirmation of these proposals would be incon-sistent with the policy of stabilising wages on which the cabinet had agreed on 14th November. Nevertheless, he thought that therewere overriding arguments in favour of treating these cases asexceptions to the general wages standstill. The rates proposed bythe two Councils were in line with those recently approved for other sections of the retail trade, and in many shops they were already paid voluntarily. The proposals of the eight Wages Councilsformed part of a single policy designed to provide safeguards forthe lower-paid unorganised workers in retail distribution, and it was an accident that they had not all been confirmed before the announce-ment of the decision to devalue sterling. He was satisfied thatconfirmation of these proposals would not prejudice the enforcement of the statement on wages policy issued by the General Council ofthe Trades Union Congress on the previous day.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that the arbitrary cutsrecently made in certain retail prices were shortly due for review and that, if in the meantime wages in the industries concerned hadbeen increased by Order, the President of the Board of Trade wouldhave to take this factor into account in considering representations made to him by the trades. In that event he might have no alternative but to revoke some at least of the cuts. It was, however,the general view of Ministers that every effort should be made toavoid any reversal of policy on these retail prices.The Cabinet-Authorised the Minister of Labour to approve the wageregulation proposals submitted by the Wages Councils ofthe Retail Drapery, Outfitting and Footwear Trades andof the Furnishing and Allied Trades.Germany.AgreementbetweenAllied High-commissioners and Chancellorof GermanFederalRepublic.(previous reference:CM. (49) 67th-Conclusions,Minute 7.)7. The Foreign Secretary recalled that on 17th November theCabinet had endorsed the decisions reached at the meeting of foreign ministers in Paris as set out in the Directive to the Allied high commissioners annexed to CP. (49) 237. These had now beendiscussed with the German Federal Chancellor, and a Protocol ofAgreement (the text of which was contained in telegram No. 224,Basic, from Wahn) had been initialled by the High commissioners and the Chancellor on the previous day. In these discussionsDr. Adenauer had asked whether German shipyards could be allowedto build ships for export and to undertake the repair of foreignvessels. This had not been discussed in Paris, but he thought itwould be advisable to meet the German Government on this point.In discussion it was pointed out that there was already a worldsurplus of ship-repairing capacity; that in the United Kingdom this industry was contracting sharply; and that the workers were anxious about their future prospects. Was it not illogical to make a concession to Germany which might further aggravate this situa-tion ? And would it not be inconsistent with any plan of securingeconomic co-ordination in Western Europe ?
Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,24ih November, 1949.It was the general view of Ministers that it would not be practicable to maintain an effective ban on the construction of ships for export or the repair of foreign ships in German yards. Theextent of such work would be governed by the general restrictions imposed on shipbuilding and on steel production in Germany.Under present conditions there was no prospect of securing a comprehensive plan for co-ordinating shipbuilding and repairingcapacity in Western Europe, and a solution for the problems of the-shipbuilding industry in the United Kingdom must be sought inother directions. In this connection it was suggested that the possi-bility of establishing additional ship-repairing yards in the Southof England should be examined.The Cabinet-Agreed that it would not be advisable to reject the proposal made by the German Federal Chancellor that Germanshipyards should be permitted to construct ships for export,and to undertake repairs of foreign ships
