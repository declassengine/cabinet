PARLIAMENTARYAFFAIRS2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.EuropeanCommunityRegulationsThe Cabinet noted that the debate on certain European CommunityRegulations which was to take place on 3 July, following reports submitted by the House of Commons Scrutiny Committee, was likely to range widely and might lead to some discussion of theextent to which decisions by the United Kingdom Governmentwere liable to be circumscribed by Community requirements.A wide debate of this kind might, however, be positivelyadvantageous to the extent that a clear expression at this stage of the views of Parliament on these matters would contribute toachieving a satisfactory outcome to the renegotiation process.Debate on Pension      The Cabinet were informed that there was some prospect of thePolicy Government being defeated on the Opposition Motion aboutpension policy which was to be debated on 1 July.    The Motionwould call on the Secretary of State for Social Services to reverse her decision not to bring the reserve pension scheme intoearly effect and to refer to a Select Committee any proposalsshe might wish to make for changes in the pension arrangementsprovided for in the Social Security Act 1973.    Despite the risk ofdefeat, it was not proposed during the debate to concede theprinciple of setting up a Select Committee.    If the Opposition1CABINET 1. THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Government wereBUSINESS entering into a period of intensive work owing to the number of major policy issues which would shortly be coming forward forconsideration.    The effort which had been put into the develop-ment of a voluntary incomes policy had culminated in the recenthelpful statement by the Trades Union Congress - an outcome onwhich the Secretary of State for Employment was to be warmlycongratulated and of which the maximum advantage should betaken in the positive presentation of the Governments policies -but decisions on a considerable number of equally important matters would have to be taken before the beginning of the summer Recess.    Until then it would probably be necessary forthe Cabinet to meet twice a week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays,and Ministers should hold themselves available accordingly.The Cabinet -Took note of the Prime Ministers statement.
Motion were carried, it did not appear that the Governmentwould be obliged to regard it as an instruction which must becomplied with, though they would of course have to promise to give it serious consideration.    In these circumstances thebest course would be to try to secure the Motion&apos;s defeat.Date of SummerRecessThe Cabinet were informed that the Opposition were not beingas co-operative as had originally appeared likely in expediting the progress in the House of Commons of the Trade Union andLabour Relations Bill.    This would delay its introduction intothe House of Lords; and since time would have to be allowed for the Commons consideration of Lords amendments, it wouldnot now be possible, as had been hoped, for the House to risefor the Summer Recess on 19 July.    On present indications itmight be necessary to continue to sit for some or all of the week beginning 29 July.Report by services committee on CarParkingThe Cabinet noted that in their recent Report on Car Parkingfor the House of Commons the Services Committee had recommended that the Speaker&apos;s Court should no longer be usedfor parking.    This would cause Ministers considerableinconvenience.    The decision whether to accept the recommenda-tion rested with the Speaker, who was aware of the problems involved.    The question of ensuring that suitable facilities were available for ministers chauffeurs was not being overlooked.2
NUCLEAR 3.        The Cabinet considered nuclear tests.    Their discussionTESTS and the conclusions reached are recorded separately.CONCORDE 4. THE LORD CHANCELLOR recalled that the Cabinet attheir meeting on 23 May had agreed that it would be preferableprevious for the Concorde aircraft project to be cancelled if the consentReference: of the French Government, however reluctant, could be secured;CC(74) 17th but if not, the programme to build 16 aircraft should be conclusions, completed.    The Secretary of State for Industry had been minute 8 invited to. prepare, in consultation with other ministers concerned, a negotiating brief for the discussions with the FrenchGovernment.    But a substantive difficulty had emerged.    TheCabinet had originally envisaged that we should as a first stepexplore the views of the French Government, making clear ourown view of the strength of the economic case for cancelling the project;   and thereafter consider the outcome of these discussions before reaching a final decision.    The Secretary ofState however had taken the view that since the Cabinet1 s previous discussion a number of events had occurred whicheffectively put cancellation out of the question; and that to insist on it to the French would be both futile and damaging toour interests.    The Secretary of State had therefore proposedthat if the French Government were clearly to resist the option of cancelling the project when this was proposed to them, heshould be authorised to consent, without further reference to theCabinet, to the continuance of the programme to complete 16aircraft.    It had seemed desirable to him to refer this new proposal to the Cabinet.THE PRIME MINISTER said that on hearing of this from theLord Chancellor he had decided that he would himself raisethe question of Concorde with the French Prime Minister,M. Chirac, whom he and the Foreign and commonwealth secretary had met in Brussels the previous day;    M. Chirachowever had himself introduced it at the outset of theirconversation, citing it as one of three topics (the others beingthe Channel Tunnel and the Common Agricultural policy ) whichthe French Government would like to discviss when he sawPresident Giscard d&apos;Estaing in July.On the Common Agricultural Policy M. Chirac had expressedmuch concern, but seemed to have nothing new to say.    On theChannel Tunnel, it was clear that the new French Governmenthad decided that the project must take a lower priority, andM. Chirac had made a firm request that we should join withthem in deferring progress on it.    When it came to Concorde,however,, so far from being prepared to limit the programme,
M. Chirac had spoken in terms of producing 200 aircraft.    Inreply he himself had outlined the very strong economic arguments against the project, though he acknowledged thatwider issues were also at stake; while emphasising that theBritish Government had as yet taken no decision about thefuture of the project, he had underlined the importance, both for the industry and for the airlines, of dispelling uncertainty;and he had finally asked outright what the attitude of the FrenchGovernment would be towards a proposal that the project should be cancelled.    &quot;Negatif &apos;J M. Chirac had replied;  and had gone on to dismiss with contempt the environmental arguments against the project, and enlarge on its political, technologicaland economic benefits.M. Chirac had made it clear that the decision in this matter would rest with the President; but it was equally clear from his attitude that a proposal on our part to cancel the aircraft wouldbe firmly resisted by the French Government.    The present occasion would not be opportune for the Cabinet to reach any newdecision in the light of these developments.    He proposedhowever that the Ministers concerned should now prepare, forapproval by the Cabinet, a statement and brief for his forth-coming meeting with President Giscard d&apos;Estaing that wouldtake account of these factors and address itself to the detailed provisions that would be necessary to safeguard our positionand limit our liability if it proved necessary to continue with production of the aircraft.In discussion the view was expressed that a decision to proceedwith the project, while naturally welcome to opinion&quot; in theindustry and the areas where employment on the project was concentrated, was to be deplored on economic grounds, would impose a large additional burden on public expenditure, andwould be viewed with mixed feelings in the country at large.From this point of view it would be necessary to examine withthe greatest care the position of the French Government as ithad now emerged and the scope for limiting our liabilities.    but whatever the eventual outcome of the further discussions on concorde might be, it was clearly in our interests to make thebest use possible of the cards available to us, particularly overthe Channel Tunnel, where the French were themselves seeking to resile from a joint undertaking, and not to acquiesce withoutdemur to every French demand.    On the other hand it waspointed out that the Cabinet had already decided that if the FrenchGovernment refused their consent to cancellation, the programme to build 16 aircraft should continue; and indeed it seemed likely that there would be considerable difficulty in persuading thfeFrench Government even to limit the programme to that number.In that connection it was for consideration whether there would
be advantage in the Secretary of State for Industry having a discussion with the French Minister of Transport, perhapsaccompanied by the Attorney General, to establish the legal and technical parameters before the Prime Minister met theFrench President; or whether technical discussion should await the basic political deoision.    As to the question of usingConcorde as a bargaining counter in other negotiations, it shouldnot be forgotten that there was a deep commitment to the concorde project in the public mind, to which the Channel Tunnel and theCommon Agricultural Policy bore no relation; and on widergrounds it would be unfortunate if the present negotiations onrestructuring the Common Agricultural Policy, which theMinister for Agriculture had been conducting with conspicuoussuccess, were to become involved with a decision on the futureof Concorde.In further discussion it was noted that a number of theGovernments supporters in Parliament,  no doubt urged by thetrade unions whose members were associated with the concorde project, had been pressing for a Party meeting on the project.This might come at an awkward time in relation to discussions with the French Government, and it might be preferable for thePrime Minister not to make a statement on that occasion.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatin the light of his talks with the French Prime Minister (the record of which would be circulated to members of the Cabinet)and of their present discussion, the Ministerial Committee onthe Concorde Project should consider the lines of a negotiatingbrief for his forthcoming meeting with the Frendh President.The brief shoidd rehearse the arguments against unilateralcancellation, provide detailed arguments in support of our viewthat if the programme were to proceed it should be limited to16 aircraft and indicate the safeguards needed to limit ourHabilities.    It was likely that his meeting with the french president would take place during the third week of July, andthe Cabinet would wish to consider the negotiating briefbeforehand.    Meanwhile it was of the highest importance thatno inforrration about these matters should be divulged: and thenext meeting between the Secretary of State for Industry and theFrench Minister of Transport should not be held until after hisown meeting with the French President.The Cabinet -1.    Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.     &apos;  S
2.    Invited the Secretary of State for Industryto submit a draft negotiating brief, as indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up, to the ministerial Committee on the Concorde Project.3.    Invited the Lord Chancellor to arrange for the ministerial Committee on the Concorde Project tosubmit the negotiating brief for their approval beforethe Prime Minister&apos;s forthcoming discussions withthe French President.
5. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of building societyfinance.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that,as a result of the reduction in operating margins which had been caused by the recent increase in the composite rate of tax, thebuilding societies were under increasing pressure to increase the mortgage rate by ^ per cent.    The Ministers immediately concerned had discussed the position and had concluded that it was on political grounds essential to avoid any increase in the mortgage rate atpresent.    The remedial measure they had considered included areduction in the composite rate of taxation and a direct cash grant to the building societies (which would cost.about  6j  million amonth).    The former had been rejected, while the latter, though perhaps a course of last resort, was open to substantial objections.It had therefore been decided to investigate the possibility of persuading the building societies to run-down their reserves in the short term, on the understanding that if they fell below the minimumpermitted level they would be &quot;topped up&quot; as necessary with interest-free Government bonds.    This approach was now being investigated.    If it proved impracticable, or if the building societies declined to adopt it, it might be necessary to revert tothe idea of a direct cash grant.    It was also intended that the categories of house purchasers eligible for loans from localauthorities should be widened so as to include the first-time purchasers of new houses where it was expected that the transactionwould be completed in 1974.    The additional expenditure could bemet from within the current PESC allocation of the Department ofthe Environment.    It was not proposed at the present stage toestablish a committee of inquiry into long-term issues, or to setup a National Housing Finance Corporation, though it was hoped toarrange for a suitable reference to the latter to be included in theLabour party  s Election Manifesto.    He would keep the cabinet informed of the progress of the discussions with the building societies.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the statement bythe Secretary of State for the Environment:
TEACHERS&apos; 6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePENSIONS Lord President of the Council about Teachers&apos; Pensions (C(74) 62).THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that on28 November 1973 the then Secretary of State for Education and science had accepted in principle a Motion put down by the LabourParty, then in Opposition, calling for a reduction in the teachers&apos;pension contribution and the reckoning as to half for pensionpurpose of the war service of post-war entrants to teaching on thesame lines as applied to the Civil Service.    Since then thei social services Committee (SS) had considered a number of detailed points,which had now been satisfactorily settled, about the application ofthe war service provisions to teachers.    A major problem had however been presented by the repercussions which the concession to teachers would have elsewhere in the public service, particularlyin relation to the police, the fire service and the health professions.There was a danger of earlier retirements, with damaging effects on manpower; and the public expenditure implications were considerable - the total additional cost might be as much as 1QO million, more than half of which would fall within the next five years.    The majority of SS Committee had concluded that therewas no choice but to honour the firm commitment which had beengiven in respect of teachers, but that, though similar treatmentwould almost certainly in due course have to be extended to other groups, every effort should be made to limit the concession in thefirst place to teachers.    The Secretary of State for Social Servicesand the Minister of State, Home Office had, however, argued thatit would in practice be impossible to do this; that to widen the concession to all the groups concerned would represent an irrationaland unacceptable use of financial resources which were alreadyinadequate; and that, despite the difficulties, the only acceptablesolution was to give no concession to any group at all, including the teachers.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCEsaid that the teachers expected the early implementation of theresolution passed by the House of Commons and that discussions were in fact in progress.    The delay which had taken place waslosing much of the goodwill which had been gained by the original decision, and to resile from something to which both the major political parties were committed would cause a serious row withthe teachers and do much harm to the professions morale, whichwas already low.THE HOME SECRETARY stressed the serious repercussions whichwould follow for the police, and to a lesser extent the fire service.The prospect of earlier retirements was worrying.    The police had for many years been campaigning for the kind of concession nowproposed for the teachers but the pressure from them had successfully been resisted.    Continued resistance would however8
be quite impossible if the teachers were treated in the way nowproposed by SS Committee; and there were in fact no arguments which could be advanced with any prospect of success.    Butcontinued resistance would be possible if no concession were madeto any group; and this was in his view the right line to adopt,given that it was impossible to give high priority to the additional expenditure implied by the proposed concessions.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that shewas exposed to similar pressure from the doctors and nurses, andwould be unable to resist it if the proposed concession were madeto teachers.    The additional cost would be considerable and would represent an indefensible diversion from much more urgentobjectives of resources which were already inadequate.In discussion, it was argued that a similar approach would have tobe adopted towards all the groups who were in the same positionas the teachers.    But the economic position had changed for the worse since the debate in the House of Commons in November 1973,and this might make it possible to take the line that, although theprinciple was accepted for all groups, no undertaking could be given at present about the time at which it could be put into effect.    Asagainst this it was argued that there had been longstandingdiscontent amongst teachers about the provision made for war service in their pension scheme; and that it would not be possibleto go back on a concession which the Labour Party had proposedwhen in Opposition, which had been agreed by the House of commons and on giving effect to which the previous Government had openeddiscussions with the teachers.    Moreover, merely to deferimplementation of the scheme would not lead to any reduction in total expenditure, but only affect its timing.&quot;THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that if the proposed concession were made to the teachers a similar one could in principle not be denied to the other groups which were in the same position.    The commitment to the teachers was inescapable and must be honoured, and theSecretary of State for Education and Science should therefore resumehis discussions with the profession, on the basis that any additional cost would be met from within his Departments PESC allocation.While the Cabinet agreed in principle that similar arrangements should be applied to the other groups concerned, it would be forthe responsible Minis ters to decide on the timing; and in doing this they would no doubt have regard both to the tactical position in   .relation to the groups concerned and to the other competing demands on their PESC allocations, within which any additional expenditurearising would have to be contained.9
The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited theMinisters concerned to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office27 June 197410
COPY no cabinet confidential annex cc(74) 21st Conclusions, Minute 3Thursday 27 June 1974 at 11. 00 amNUCLEAR       THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was aware that some of hisTESTS colleagues felt that there should have been discussion in the cabinet before it was decided to carry out the recent test of a British nucleardevice in the United States.      There was however a long.standingconvention that particularly sensitive questions in the field offoreign affairs, defence, security and intelligence were not discussed in full Cabinet.    In the past this convention had applied to plans for nuclear testing: and the last British test, carried out in 1965, hadnot been approved by Cabinet.    The decision, taken by senior Ministersshortly after they came into Office, to go ahead with the recent testthus followed precedent.    It was however solely a decision to keep open the option of retaining a credible deterrent and did not prejudge any policy decision.    The policy decision on the future of the Britishnuclear deterrent would be taken in the context of the defence review,which - including the future of the nuclear deterrent - would bebrought to Cabinet at the appropriate moment.    In the meantime, as hehad stated in Parliament, there would be no further nuclear testing.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said that given the concern which had been expressed, he would, in consultation with the senior Ministers most immediately concerned review the procedures for authorising British nuclear tests, with particular regard to thesecurity aspects, and consider whether it would be reasonable to departfrom precedent so that plans to hold any future tests could be discussed in Cabinet.    They would then report to Cabinet.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up.Cabinet Office28 June 1974f
