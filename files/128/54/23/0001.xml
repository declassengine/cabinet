PARLIAMENTARY   1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the affairs House of Commons during the following week.    Efforts were beingmade to overcome the current delays in printing, which could impede the smooth conduct of Parliamentary business.jPresentationof GovernmentPoliciesTHE PRIME MINISTER said that a special effort must be made during the coming w&amp;eks to secure a more adequate presentation of the Governments policies and achievements.    Cabinet ministers and more junior members of the Government should therefore take every suitable opportunity for making public speeches and forappearing on radio and television.    It was important also that steps should be taken to secure adequate Press coverage.    Thiswas often difficult because of the unwillingness of most of the national press to give a fair presentation of Labour Party policy, with theresult that the reporting of Ministerial speeches and the use madeof Press handouts was usually selective and often non-existent; but these difficulties applied very much less to the provincial Press, andgood coverage there was frequently at least as valuable as in thenational Press.    As regards the substance of speeches, the aimmust be to secure overall a balanced and accurate presentation ofthe Governments policies and to avoid any possible ground for theConservative Press to suggest - as they were only too anxious to do -that Ministers were at odds.The Cabinet -Took note of the Prime Ministers statement.1Ii
2.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat better evaluation of the agreements reached with the Russiansduring the visit of the President of the United States, Mr Nixon, tothe Soviet Union should be possible after the American Secretary ofState, Dr Kissinger, had visited London on 8 July.   It was clear that little progress had been made on further measures to limit offensivestrategic weapons; but it had been agreed that each country would develop anti-ballistic missile defences on only one site, and bothwould srefrain from conducting underground nuclear tests of amagnitude greater than 150 kilotons, and we had welcomed this.The references in the communique to the Conference on security and Co-operation in Europe might indicate that President Nixonhad made concessions to the Russian desire for a meeting at the summit to mark the conclusion of the Conference, without havingobtained concessions from the Russians on matters affecting humanfreedoms.    If this turned out to be the case, there would be considerable concern among European countries.    It was howevertoo soon to be clear about this.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.

5. THE PRIME MINISTER said that, at their last meeting, theCabinet had agreed that the proposed statements by the Secretary ofState for Energy and the Paymaster General on North Sea oil shouldbe combined in a White Paper dealing with North Sea and Celtic Seaoil and gas.    They had also agreed that in view of the poHticalinterest in Scotland, the White Paper should deal with the scottish and Welsh implications rather than leaving these to later statements.It had not proved possible to circulate the draft White Paper for thepresent meeting, butit was still desirable to publish it as early aspossible in the following week.    The Secretary of State for scotland should discuss urgently with the-Secretary of State for Industry theway in which the White Paper should deal with his proposal for a scottish Development Agency,The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the statement by thePrime Minister.Cabinet Office4 July 1974
CONFIDENTIAL annex cc(74) 23rd Conclusions, Minute 3Thursday 4 July 1974 at 11. 00 amIn resumed discussion of the tactics of renegotiating our terms of membership of the European Economic Community (e.c.) it was argued that the Governments approach, as presented in the speechby the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs tothe Council of Ministers in Luxembourg on 4 June, was unlikely to achieve the aims expressed in the Manifesto or to meet the interestsof the country.    Continued membership on the terms which now seemed likely to be obtained could be gravely damaging, particularlyin the industrial and regional policy fields.    Indeed representativesof the Commission had indicated to the Secretary of State for industry that control over important areas had effectively passed to the Community.    The Treaty of Paris appeared to leave littlescope to national Governments to manage their steel industries;the Commission argued that the designation of particular areas for regional assistance must be primarily a matter for the Communityrather than for national Governments;  and, while Community rulesdid not appear to prevent state ownership of the shipbuilding industry,,crucial decisions as to its productive capacity were apparently tobe for the Community to settle.    These examples showed the extentto which power appeared to have passed from member Governmentscontrary to our interests in the formulation and execution of the policies required in this country.    Continued membership of the eec on this basis would raise constitutional issues of the greatest importance.    It appeared to involve a fundamental change in theresponsibility of Ministers to Parliament and in the collectiveauthority of Ministeraf    The Cabinet should have the opportunity toconsider issues of this kind as they arose during renegotiation.   it also appeared that opinion in Scotland and in Wales was generallyagainst our membership of the e.c.: if the Government persisted in seeking terms of membership which would be widely unacceptable,there was a real risk that this could eventually lead to the disintegration of the United Kingdom.EECRENEGOTIATIONStocktakingPreviousReference:CC(74) 22ndConclusions,Minute 4COPY NO   5 0CABINETa
It was further argued that the Luxembourg statement did not adequately set out or give equal weight to all our renegotiationobjectives.    &quot;Whereas the Election Manifesto had spoken of&quot;fundamental changes&quot; in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP),the Luxembourg speech had said that we sought changesconsistent with the broad principles on which the CAPwas based.    Moreover, there had been no prior collectiveendorsement of the statement that our renegotiation proposals, if accepted, could be effectively implemented without need for amendment to the Community Treaties.    It was generally thoughtthat there had been a change in tone between the Luxembourg speech and the Secretary of State&apos;s initial statement to the Council ofMinisters on 1 April; although clearly the tactics were a matter of negotiating judgment, this change of tone seemed to have causedsome collapse in the Labour Party&apos;s confidence in the Government1 determination to carry through the fundamental renegotiation towhich they were committed.    It was significant that while thequestion of the sovereignty of the British Parliament and theBritish people remained a major element in the renegotiation, this had received only an insignificant reference in the Luxembourgspeech.    This crisis of confidence faced the Government with a potentially very dangerous situation.    Divisions in the Party hadbeen healed in the past only by working out the compromise formulaof the Manifesto calling for fundamental renegotiation of the termsof entry, to be followed by reference of the outcome to the british people.    If the Governments supporters felt that this objective hadbeen modified in order to make renegotiation easier, there would be serious political consequences and the likelihood of a renewed split.Furthermore there were already signs that we would not achieve the objectives set out in the Luxembourg statement.    The President ofthe Commission had said that he did not regard the Community asbeing engaged in any &quot;renegotiation&quot;.    One of the BritishCommissioners (Mr George Thomson) had forecast that on theimportant issue of the Community Budget we should get no morethan a formula providing for adjustments to be made in the future ifit turned out that our contribution was inequitable; and that thiswould depend on an undertaking to commend the results of renegotiation to the British people.    In general, there now appearedto be a real possibility that our negotiating approach was not beingtaken sufficiently seriously by other Community countries.Consideration should therefore be given to adopting a more aggressiveline.    We should challenge the principle of the &quot;own resources&quot;system.   We should make it clear that unless satisfactory progress had been made by the end of the year we would not be prepared tomake the further changes in the import regime due at the beginningof 1975.    We should now undertake serious studies of the&apos;alternatives to membership based on a free trade grouping including the irish republic, Denmark and other European Free Trade Association2
countries.    If practicable, such a grouping could have a beneficial trading relationship with the e.c.;  and effectiveEast/West political co-operation arrangements would not be precluded within a Conference on Security and Co-operation inEurope (CSCE) framework.    The Government should alsodemonstrate the seriousness of their intention by preparing a white Paper on the arrangements for a referendum of the british people - recognising that the introduction of the ScrutinyCommittees did not touch the major sovereignty issue - and byexamining the possibility of amending Section 2(1) of the european communities Act.On the other hand, it was strongly argued that the points made bythe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary at the previous meetingof the Cabinet were valid.   Renegotiation had been firmly launchedon lines which were fully compatible with the terms of the manifesto.    The Luxembourg speech had set out all therenegotiating objectives (the budget; the CAP; commonwealth and developing countries; regional and industrial policy; and theissue of sovereignty) as specified in the programme for the 1974Election.    It was too soon to see how far we would achieve these objectives.    Views expressed by individual members of theCommission about the likely outcome were however largelyirrelevant since the decisions would be taken in the Council ofMinisters.    This was also the answer to statements by theCommission that the real power now rested with them.   Therehadbeenno toning down of our objectives in the Luxembourg speech, or in the bilateral talks which the Prime Minister had had with the He ads of otherEEC Governments.   All these appreciated that this was a serious and fundamental renegotiation, but the fact had to be faced that theywould be unlikely to make any significant concessions until theGovernment had obtained a working majority in a General Election.We were however already fully engaged in serious negotiations onthe CAP.    Our proposals for changes had been stated in detail tothe Agricultural Council and included a new approach to methods ofagricultural support; new criteria for CAP prices; and theadoption of the principle of national aids.    We had already driven,in effect, a coach and horses through the principles of the CAP by insisting on national subsidies for certain commodities during theCommunity price negotiations in March 1974, and by refusing toapply permanent intervention arrangements for beef.    Ourcriticisms of the beef arrangements were now being borne out bymarket difficulties, and there was a prospect that the community would soon agree to new arrangements, including a form of deficiency payment.    We had proposed improved arrangementsfor dairy products up to 1982 and beyond on which New Zealand had expressed satisfaction.    On sugar we were seeking to fulfil our commitment to secure long term access for the developing commonwealth countries.    Finally there were encouraging signs ofdevelopment in the Community&apos;s attitude towards the developing countries.
In settling our tactics, we had to judge what approach would be   *most likely to produce the results we wanted.    It was doubtfulwhether a more aggressive approach expressed in nationalisticterms would have greater chance of success.    While there were those in the Community who might well be happy to see us withdrawand would consider that the loss was ours, the leaders of mostCommunity countries had made it clear privately not only that they took renegotiation seriously but that they would consider how our objectives might be met, consistent with their own interests.There was no real evidence to shew that the Luxembourg speechhad led to any doubts or cynicism about the firmness of theGovernments intention to pursue the objectives of the Manifesto.However it could be argued that the case against membership on grounds of loss of sovereignty tended to be overstated.   Indeed itcould be dangerous to adopt an excessively nationalistic approachsince in many important areas it was no longer possible for any government alone to determine its own destiny or pursue effectivepolicies: and we were party to other Treaties or agreements(eg. North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, the General agreement on Tariffs and Trade,)     . 1 which effectively limited our freedomof individual action.It was also argued that much of the continuing opposition to our membership of the Community rested on a misunderstanding ofimportant facts.    There had been swift and radical changes in thesituation.    The Governments of India and of other commonwealth countries had made it clear that they supported our continued membership as a beneficial element within the Community.    Themost frequently heard arguments against Community membershiprested on the high cost of food;  and yet prices for many importantcategories of food within the Community were now considerablylower than the world prices to which we would be subject outsidethe Community.    It was essential that facts such as these shouldbe fully explained so that our Community membership should beseen in its true perspective.    The ultimate decision should be taken on an informed basis and in the light of the external factorsaffecting British prospects in the world.It was also argued that, although it might prove politically essentialto hold a referendum on membership once renegotiation was complete, the Government should consider very carefully theconstitutional implications of doing so.    The principle that particular issues could be decided by referendum was potentiallyfar more damaging to Parliamentary sovereignty than the issues of sovereignty that had been argued against our membership of theCommunity.
THE PRIME MINISTER, Slimming up the discussion, said that the-Cabinet had had a valuable discussion of the current position onrenegotiation: and they would need to continue to review progresscollectively from time to time.    Renegotiation had been launchedon a basis consistent with the Manifesto terms and with the policieson which the Labour Party had fought the last Election.    There hadbeen little progress so far and there would be serious difficulties in securing the results we wanted.    It was not to be expected that other Community Governments would commit themselves until theywere clearer about the political situation in the United Kingdom.At the end of the negotiations members of the Cabinet might takedifferent views about the results: but at the present stage it was essential that the Government as a whole should maintain a unifiedand coherent stance consistent with its past commitments and the manifesto.    Renegotiation was likely to start in earnest after theCommunity&apos;s summer break, and was unlikely to be concludedbefore the end of the year or the early months of 1975.    If therewere to be an Election here in the autumn, it would be necessaryfor the Governments Manifesto to mention the time scale for completion of the renegotiation and the way in which the british people would be consulted on the results.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the summing up oftheir discussion by the Prime Minister,Cabinet office July 1974
