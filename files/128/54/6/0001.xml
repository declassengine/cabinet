REPEAL OF THE    2. THE PRIME MINISTER said that four main points had beenINDUSTRIAL agreed at the meeting he had held on 21 March to di scuss theRELATIONS ACT     repeal of the Industrial Relations Act.i. PicketingThe note which the Secretary of State for Employment had sent tothe Trades Union Congress (TUC) referred in positive terms tothe right of peaceful picketing and the rights of pickets tocommunicate with occupants of vehicles for purposes of peacefulpersuasion, without quoting the law of obstruction.    Regulationson picketing would be drawn up- and published before the Bill to repeal the Act received the Royal Assent and the Secretary of state would indicate, during the passage of the Bill, the content of theRegulations.    The note cited the example of the orderly picketingconducted by the National Union of Mineworkers during their recent strike.ii. Legal ImmunitiesThe Bill would extend protection to persons inducing breaches ofcommercial contracts.   Although this proposal was controversial,it could be justified by reference to a recommendation of the donovan Commission. &quot;,,iii. The Closed ShopThere was a strong case on merits for safeguards for theindividual against arbitrary exclusion or expulsion from a tradeunion, on the lines recommended by the Donovan Commission.These safeguards however could not be included in the Bill itself;the note for the TUC stated, therefore, that the Government would .consider them later,iv. The National Industrial Relations court the TUC would be asked to agree to the proposal that unfinishedcases before the National Industrial Relations Court (NIRC) shouldbe transferred to the High Court or the Court of Session.    the attorney general s suggestion that cases which were still pendingshould be made subject to the pre-existing law would be looked atfurther and would not, in the meantime, be mentioned to the TUC.In discussion, it was argued that the rights of pickets to stopvehicles would be subject to critical scrutiny in Parliament; itwould be necessary to emphasise that the reference to the TradeDisputes Act 1906, excluded the picketing of homes, and that it was proposed to control the number and identification of those engaged2PreviousReference^CC(74) 5thConclusions,Minute 6
in picketing.    It would be necessary to ensure that oafeguardsfor the individual against arbitrary exclusion were not to be confined to trades unions, but would extend to professional bodies,such as those concerned with the medical and legal professions.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the revised proposals for amending legislation had been given to the tuc and Confederation of British Industry (CBI) on 22 March and published in the official report for that day.    The Secretary ofState for Employment would wish to be guided by the points madein discussion in his further talks with the TUC and CBI.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.EUROPEAN 3. THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES and community FOOD said that he had attended in the previous week a meeting of---                  the Council of Ministers (Agriculture) in Brussels to discussAgricultural prices for 1974-75 under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).Prices After lengthy negotiation, agreement had been reached on apackage of proposals which included special arrangements to meet our requirement to avoid increases in prices of basic foodstuffsin the shops.    These discussions had of course been in advanceof and without prejudice to the major question of renegotiation ofour terms of entry but in seeking to secure solutions to our special problems much goodwill and sympathy had been shown forthe British position by the Commission and other members of theCouncil.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet would wish to congratulate the Minister of Agricultureon the successful outcome of the meeting.Cabinet Office25 March 1974
