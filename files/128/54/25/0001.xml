PARLIAMENTARY    1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inUFFAIRS the House of Commons during the following week.    The debate onthe Motion on the Counter-Inflation (Abolition of Pay Board) Ordercould prove difficult since it was likely that the Conservative -opposition and the Liberals would oppose it.
2. -      THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the resignation of the Portuguese Prime Minister,Dr Palma Carlos, and four of his colleagues reflected divisionswithin the Government on internal policies, particularly in economic matters.    The Socialist Foreign Minister, Dr Soares, was in aposition of some difficulty; there was a measure of agreementbetween Communist and non-Socialist members of the Government,The Armed Forces Movement at present tended to support the rightwing on internal matters, but sided with the left wing about theneed to move quickly towards decolonisation of Portugal&apos;s overseaterritories.    There were some indications that General Spinolamight be tempted in due course to establish a presidential form ofgovernment; but at present the&apos;most likely outcome was forDr Carlos to be asked to attempt to form another Government.The Cabinet -1. Took note of the statement by theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary.The Cabinet was informed that the Council of Ministers (Agriculture)on 15-16 July would be considering proposals by the commission for changes in the arrangements for beef under the common agricultural Policy (CAP).    The Commission proposals presentedpotential political risks; they included the possibility of sales of cheap beef for certain classes of organisations and consumerswithin the Community, and they were of special importance to theUnited Kingdom both because of their relationship to our proposalsfor the renegotiation of the CAP and because of the great sensitivityof the current beef situation.    It would be particularly important toensure that no decisions were taken by the Commission which mightbe shown to be comparable to the decision in 1973 to sell 200, 000 tonsof cheap butter to the Soviet Union.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Minister of Agriculture would be circulating a minute to those ofhis colleagues most concerned setting out the approach he proposedto adopt on 15-16 July in the Council of Ministers, where the task would not be easy.    It was important for the Governments policy towards the Community Beef arrangements to be fully understood andhe would himself be making an appropriate reference to the subject ina forthcoming public speech.   The Foreign and commonwealth secretary would be considering whether, in the meeting of the Councilof Ministers (Foreign Affairs) on 22-23 July, to draw attention to theproblem in the Community beef market as a way of exposing further the failings of the CAP and thus helping to promote our renegotiationobjectives.The Cabinet -2.        Took note.CONFIDENTIAL
3.        THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said thatin his further meetings with representatives of the building societies Association he had asked them to maintain the mortgagerate at 11 per cent until about the end of the year; and in order tohelp them cope with the resultant pressure on building societymargins had offered them a Government reserve certificate, to beencashable at the end of a society&apos;s current financial year if it were then needed, to ensure that the society&apos;s reserve ratio did not fall below the level which qualified it for trustee status.    The building societies had rejected the proposed scheme, as a measure likely to lead to the Government having too much control over their activities, and had said that they expected to cope with the problemsof margins, without raising the mortgage rate, for a few moremonths.    They had agreed to recommend to their Council meetingon Friday 12 July, that the mortgage rate should be maintained at11 per cent for three months on the understanding that matters couldbe further reviewed thereafter.    It seemed likely that the council would accept this recommendation, and that they would then ask theGovernment to make available the fourth  100 million tranche of the  500 million line of credit.    It was also likely that the Council ;would want the Government to release the fifth tranche in august and he proposed that the Government should do so if the requestwere in fact made.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said theCabinet congratulated the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster onthe outcome of these negotiations.    The probability of the building societies holding their mortgage rates was conditional on themovement of interest rates generally but it was very satisfactorythat the rate looked as though it would be held until the autumn.The Cabinet agreed that the further tranches of the  500 millionline of credit should, if required, be made&quot; available by the environment Secretary in consultation with the Chancellor of theExchequer.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister1 summing up of their discussion.3 .
4.        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (C(74) 68) about possible changes to assisted areaboundaries,THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the ministerial committee on Economic Policy (EC) had recently discussed possiblechanges to assisted area boundaries on the basis of a report by officials which recommended that no changes should be made forthe present, but that the matter should be looked at again towardsthe end of the year in the light of decisions on steel closures and of possible changes in the regional employment pattern.    EC had agreedthat there was a strong case for a fundamental review of assisted areapolicy at an appropriate time; but were divided on whether thereshould be some immediate changes in advance of such a review.If immediate changes were to be made the proposal was thatMerseyside and North West Wales should be upgraded fromdevelopment to special development areas, Edinburgh and theCardiff travel to work area (excluding Newport) from intermediateto development areas, and Chesterfield should become an inter-mediate area.    The cost of such a package would be about 20 million a year.    The economic arguments in favour ofit were not strong - it would only tend to dilute the effectiveness of existing measures - and though political advantage might be gained from making certain changes, his colleagues would wish to bear inmind that with the present constraints on public expenditure the cost would have to be met from savings in other programmes.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that the proposalsnow before the Cabinet stemmed from his original suggestion that changes should be made to correct three outstanding anomalies -Merseyside, Chesterfield and Edinburgh - for each of which therewas a strong case both in the light of their industrial and employmentproblems and in comparison with similar areas which alreadyenjoyed a higher degree of assistance.    In their discussion EChad accepted that there were strong arguments for including NorthWest Wales and Cardiff in the package; though there might be some risk that the upgrading of Cardiff would be publicly interpreted as apremonition that the East Moors steelworks would be closed.    At a cost of about  20 million a year these changes would represent a modest but useful expenditure on direct assistance to areas ofparticular concern to the Government, and might with advantage be included with the other measures to deal with the current J&apos;\economic situation that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was at present considering.    They would also bear out the undertaking in the Labour Party Manifesto, reinforced by the commitment in the queen&apos;s Speech, that the Government would give a high priority, ^to itsregional policies.4
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that he had     ,serious doubts about the value of these changes on regional grounds.From such a pattern Scotland was bound to lose.    Of the  20 million a year that they would cost,  19 million would go to England and wales and the total population of the special development areas would beincreased by over three-quarters of a million further diluting the attraction of the existing areas: a glance at the map showed thatthe areas now proposed for upgrading would act as a barrier tomobile industry, which was mainly to be found in the South Eastquarter of Great Britain, from moving further North to areas of greater need.    Unless additional resources were to be devoted to scotland, he would find it difficult to agree the proposals.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WALES said that on economic grounds there was a strong case for upgrading the status of SouthEast and North East, as well as North West Wales; but he recognisedthat the extent of the problem in North East Wales would depend largely on the outcome of the steel reorganisation, and at present he did not wish to do more than call attention to it.    In the SouthEast there had been a long campaign for improving the status ofCardiff, and although he recognised that a final decision on steelclosures had still to be made, there must inevitably be a substantialloss of jobs in the next two years.    Moreover, if Cardiff were to betreated dissimilarly from Edinburgh, the Government would be seriously criticised by Welsh opinion and the Nationalist Movementwould benefit accordingly.    The case for upgrading North &quot;West wales was very strong: a comparatively small amount of money was at stake;  but traditional industry was declining inexorably, unemploy-ment was long established and now rising, and workers were driftingaway.In discussion there was widespread agreement that the whole pattern of regional assistance needed a thorough review; but it was recognised that such a review could not well be undertaken beforethe autumn.    In the meantime the realistic choice lay betweenmaking all the changes canvassed, or none of them.    It was urgedthat there were strong arguments in favour of each change, andthere would be clear political advantage to the Government indemonstrating its concern for these areas: a modest degreeof regional reflation would chime with the needs of the present economic situation.   Although the changes would have to be notified to the Commission of the European Economic Community, it was not thought likely that any objection would be raised to them.    On theother hand it was argued that changes in assisted status would bringno immediate benefit to the areas concerned, and the political advantage that would be gained in them might well be offset byill-feeling among areas that had not been selected; there was alsoa risk of raising unnecessary fears about their economic condition and prospects.    Granted the need for a thorough review of regional
policy, it would be unwise to anticipate its conclusions by makingshort-term changes whose benefits might prove to be illusory:there were more effective ways in which expenditure of this ordercould immediately be deployed in support of the governments policies.THE PRIME MINISTER,, summing up the discussion, said thatthe Cabinet accepted that if changes to assisted areas were nowto be made, they should be those identified in C(74) 68; but themajority of the Cabinet was not at present in favour of such a step.It would in any case be inappropriate to take a decision in this fieldbefore they had been informed of certain economic measures whichthe Chancellor of the Exchequer was considering.    If desired, thequestion of changes in assisted area boundaries could be reopenedafter the Chancellor&apos;s intentions were known.The Cabinet -Agreed not at present to pursue the changes toassisted area boundaries identified in C(74) 68.
5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Industry (C(74) 69) about interdepartmentalstudies by officials of the proposals for taking into public ownership the shipbuilding and aircraft industries.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that at its meeting on 4 July (IDV(74) 2nd Meeting), the Ministerial Committeeon Industrial Development had agreed in principle that the shipbuilding industry (including ship repairing and marine engineering) and aircraft industry should be taken into public ownership.    A number of detailed points required further study and he had been invited to arrange for this to be carried out by   jtwo interdepartmental groups of officials.    The shipbuilding group would study the structure of the proposed nationalised body; the role of the National Enterprise Board (not); the special requierements of warship building;  the possibility of expanding intochemical as well as marine engineering; and the timing to befollowed.    The future of Harland and Wolff however would be excluded from the group&apos;s terms of reference, since this was bestconsidered in the context of the economy of Northern Ireland as awhole.The group on the aircraft industry would consider the form oflegislation needed; the role of the not; the corporate structure of the new body; the firms to be nationalised; the reserve powersneeded to safeguard military aircraft and guided weapon capability;and the likely future size and shape of the industry.    ShortBrothers and Harland would be excluded from the review.    Theprinciples and timing of compensation for both shipbuilding and aircraft nationalisation would be separately considered by theDepartment of Industry and the Treasury.In discussion, it was pointed out that if guided weapons were included with the aircraft industry the Government might be facedwith awkward choices over authorising the supply of arms toforeign countries.   A distinction could be drawn between licensingprivate firms to sell arms, including guided weapons, and direct government participation through a nationalised body.    On theother hand, it was argued that the Government already played a significant part in arms sales; engines and air frames for military purposes were sold to foreign Governments by Rolls-Royce and short Brothers and Harland, in which the Government directly heldshares.    It was unlikely that nationalisation in itself would call forany review of the policy for arms sales to overseas countries.In further discussion, it was pointed out that the present proposalsenvisaged separate Bills for the nationalisation of the shipbuilding industry and the aircraft industry;  and a new Industry Bill.   Whethera place could be found for all three in the legislative programme forthe next Session required further consideration, and no commitment to this could be given.7
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that&apos;the Secretary of State for Industry should arrange for the group onthe aircraft industry to consider whether it was practicable and desirable to differentiate guided weapons from aircraft, in view ofthe points made in discussion.    This aspect should then bediscussed further in the Ministerial Committee on IndustrialDevelopment.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited the secretary of State for Industry to be guided accordingly.6. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT saidthat several difficulties had arisen in applying the recommendationsof the Pay Board report on London weighting.    The Governmentshould work out a consistent line for handling the variousnegotiations.    It would be wrong for the Government to encouragean employer to pay more than the allowances recommended by the pay Board, but it would be unwise to seek to impose any absoluteveto as he had promised that there would be free negotiations.The Government should let the negotiations continue and see whatconclusion they reached.    Meanwhile they should not attempt to dictate the outcome, although they might say in general terms thatthey would wish the negotiators to remain within the total sumsrecommended by the Pay Board.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCEsaid that the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy had agreedthat the Ministers responsible for particular groups should seek toensure that offers on London weighting were consistent with theprinciples and did not exceed the totals set out in the Pay Boardreport.    He had acted on that decision.   Although the Teachers1Remuneration Act gave him the right of veto he had avoided any suggestion of a veto in this case.    He had persuaded the employers to remain within the Pay Board total at the Burnham Committees,but the negotiations would probably break down.    Though the inner London employers and those in the surrounding countiesmight agree to remain within the Pay Board limits, the outerLondon employers would wish to pay more.    He would find itnecessary io bring the matter back to the Cabinet if other groupsbroke through the limit or if the teachers were to decide to callan official strike to begin next term.8
In discussion it was mentioned that there were also problems affecting the police and the local authorities.    It was argued that although it was Government policy to try to ensure that the total inthe Pay Board report was not exceeded, any suggestion of aGovernment veto would cause the Trades Union Congress to discussthat rather than the merits of the case for paying more or less tothose who worked in London.THE PRIME MINISTER said that there had not been time to reach any conclusion and that the question should be brought back to thenext meeting of the Cabinet if there were any further developments.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet OfficeU July 19749
