NORTHERN IRELAND 12.        NATIONALISED INDUSTRY PRICES 2ii
1. The Cabinet considered the situation in Northern Ireland.Their discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded separately.1
2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C(74) 28) on Nationalised Industry prices.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the PrimeMinister had asked for a review of the timing of the price increases by the nationalised industries.    The position wassummarised in the Annex to his paper.    This showed the effectivedates of the proposed tariff increases and the dates when thefirst increased payments would fall due; in the case of electricity and telephone charges the dates of payment were several weekslater than the effective dates.    The table also showed the directeffects on the Retail Price Index (RPI); these were averaged overthe year and did net allow for seasonal variations in the incidence of fuel costs.    The table showed that the effective dates of 3 ofthe tariff increases would come close together in the first half ofJune.    These were fee increases in railway fares and in^oetal-and telephone charges.    The increase in railway fares would be felt at once: in his Budget Speech he had undertaken that it wouldtake effect in the summer and there would be difficulties in post-postponing it beyond the middle of June.    It would add only 0. 08 per cent to the RPI.    Similarly the increases in postal charges would be felt at once; they had been promised for the summer, and would add only 0. 07 per cent to the RPI.    The increase in telephonecharges would ad 0.13 per cent to the RPI but would not be felt bythe consumer until the next telephone bills were paid from July to october.The following points were made in discussion:-a. The increase in electricity charges would be feltat once by those who paid through coin meters, and these included a large proportion of the poorer section of thecommunity.    It was anomalous that a nationalised industrysuch as the electricity industry should give preferential rates to the larger consumers, particularly at a time of inflation when the Government would have to concentrateits efforts on protecting the poorest sections of thecommunity.    Although any interference with the tariff policy of a nationalised industry would affect its management and would therefore need time to consider, there was acase for asking the electricity industry to consider whetherits tariff policy could not be slanted more in conformitywith the social priorities of the Government.b. The British Rail Board had already agreed to exempt the shortest journeys from the fares increases and to mitigate the increase on journeys between 3 and 15miles; to some extent this would help to relieve the burden on the working-class commuter.    The timing of theproposed fare increases must be governed by the need togive at least a month&apos;s notice to the Transport SalariedStaffs&apos; Association.2
c.      The cost of postage had a symbolic importancebecause it was regarded by the public as an index of inflation.    Deferment of this increase would cost only  7 million a month.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that it would be desirable to avoid the bunching of price increases in the first half of June.    For this purpose theincrease in railway fares should be deferred for about a week,until the last week of June, and the increase in postal charges for about 2 weeks.    The point that had been raised about electricitytariffs should be further examined, though there would not betime to reach a conclusion before the new charges came intoeffect in May and July.    Before the winter it would also bedesirable to consider the increase in the price of paraffin, whichcould have a serious effect on the poorest part of the community.The Cabinet -1.      Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.2.      Invited the Secretary of State for the Environmentto arrange for the proposed increase in railway faresto be deferred for a week.3.      Invited the Secretary of State for Industry toarrange for the proposed increase in postal charges tobe postponed for 2 weeks..4.      Invited the Secretary of State for Energy -i.     to consider whether the electricity boards should be asked to modify their pricing policyin favour of the small consumers; and,ii.    to consider whether any action could betaken to mitigate the effect of the increase inthe cost of paraffin.Cabinet Office11 April 19743

The pattern of violence had changed and consistedlargely of attacks with fire bombs prepared and placed by women,and the placing of car bombs by civilians who were not themselvesterrorists but who were acting under extreme duress.    Theprevention of violence in these forms was a virtually impossible taskfor the Army; and it was a misuse of the armed forces to employlarge numbers of them on the task of searching people.    He wishedto inform his colleagues in strict confidence that within the next fewdays the Army would attempt to seal off all approaches to Belfast.But as the attempts to control the town centre had shown, thisdrastic move was unlikely to prevent violence altogether.    steps would also be taken to ensure that shop keepers took greater care to take precautions against fire bombs; those who failed to do so would find it much harder to obtain compensation for any damagethey suffered.    The suppression of violence would only be achieved if the community co-operated, and if the Royal Ulster Constabularycould, with community participation, be made more effective.    TheCatholics were, however, reluctant to help to improve the Policebefore the Sunningdale Agreements had been fulfilled, and theattitude of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) reflectedthis view.    He hoped that progress could be made with the IrishGovernment to improve co-operation and liaison on security; andthat the Joint Anglo/Irish Commission on Law Enforcement would come forward with useful proposals, though it seemed unlikely thatthey would make a clear recommendation in the matter of extradition,which was of prime importance to Protestant opinion.    The future ofthe Sunningdale Agreements confronted us with a dilemma.    If theywere not concluded there was the danger that the Irish Governmentand the SDLP would find it impossible to continue their support of power sharing within the Northern Ireland Executive; but if weforced the Agreements through in present circumstances,Mr Brian Faulkner, the Chief Executive, would be totally rejected by1^ TOP SECRET
Protestant opinion and this would bring power sharing to an end.Although it was unwise to make confident predictions aboutdevelopments in Northern Ireland, where the political climate couldchange unexpectedly, he was bound to warn his colleagues that thepolitical situation was extremely fragile and there was a danger ofpolitical collapse.    It was essential, however, that we should showconfidence in our present policies and press ahead with them; forotherwise the danger of collapse would be even greater.In discussion it was pointed out that although the tactics now being followed by the terrorists persuaded the population that violencewas on the increase, the total figures for shootings and bombingsshowed a decline.    The functions  given to the Army, and the tacticsto be followed, should be reviewed: in the past two weeks a group ofover 200 men from the Spearhead Battalion in this country had beenflown to Northern Ireland and had taken part very successfully in operations with forces there.    It was suggested that in view of thedanger of political collapse it was important to make contingencyplans for alternative courses that might be followed if the presentmachinery of government, and in particular the Executive and theAssembly, broke down.    It was   likely in those circumstances thatwe would have to revert, for a time, to government by direct rule.But whereas in 1972 the imposition of direct rule created a climate ofhope, a reversion to direct rule would represent a failure of policies and the prospects of reinstituting power sharing would be remote.In the worst circumstances there might be strong pressures in thiscountry for our withdrawal from Northern Ireland and although theconsequences of this would be very grave and carry much danger,for Great Britain as well as for Northern Ireland and the Republic,it would be advisable to examine those consequences as part of the contingency planning.    It was also suggested that if there were afurther serious deterioration in the situation, it would be important to ensure by means of consultation in one form or another, that thethree Parties in Parliament maintained a common position.    An all-Party conference should not be excluded, and might lead to a jointconference with representatives from Northern Ireland and theRepublic.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that hewould arrange for a small group of Ministers to make a preliminarystudy of various contingency plans, so that, if there should be acomplete breakdown in the situation, the Cabinet would not be facedwith proposals for which there had been inadequate planning.    At thisstage they should not exclude plans on the ground that they were unlikely to be adopted.   This applied even to a policy of withdrawal, the objec-tions to which had been fully recognised in discussion.  The Cabinet hadnecessarily discussed matters of great sensitivity.    If it became&quot;known that they had done so, the consequences would be very grave,and the situation in Northern Ireland might pass totally out of our2
