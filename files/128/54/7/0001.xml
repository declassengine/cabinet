FOREIGNAFFAIRS1.        The Cabinet considered their policy towards Chile.Their discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded separately.ChileTHE foreign secretary lSSTATEMENT TOTHE COUNCILOF ministers on 1 APRIL 19742.        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary (C(74) 17) covering a draft statement which he proposed t6 make at the meeting of theCouncil of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) on 1 April.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the final text of this statement could not be settled in the absence of the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary who had left the meeting to seeDr Kissinger.    But provided the Cabinet were content with the broad substance he would discuss any drafting amendments withthe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary later in the day.In discussion a number of amendments to the draft statement were proposed.    It was suggested that the passage referring to access for Commonwealth supplies should bring out theGovernments concern over the position of those commonwealth countries which were not eligible for association with theEuropean Community.    There could be advantage if this passagealso differentiated between the needs of the temperate and the developing suppliers if this did not necessitate undue draftingchanges.    When we came to consider our negotiating aims inthis field it would, however, be necessary to examine carefully the short and long term supply prospects for the crops inquestion.    It was also argued that the final paragraph of thedraft statement might be inconsistent with the undertaking givenin the Labour Party Manifesto that whilst negotiations were in process the Government would stop further processes of integration.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet was agreed that the Foreign and Commonwealth secretary should state our approach to re-negotiation to the Council ofMinisters on 1/2 April on the general lines proposed.    He would discuss with the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary draftingchanges in the light of the Cabinefs comments.    More generally,it was important that Ministers should be consistent in their instructions to officials on participation in the continuing businessof the Community and that any doubtful cases should be referredto the Ministerial Committee on European Community Questions.
The Cabinet -1.      Took note with approval of the PrimeMinisters summing up of the discussion.2.      Invited the Foreign and commonwealth secretary at the meeting of the Council ofMinisters on 1/2 April to make a statement ofthe Governments approach to re-negotiation andto arrange for the text to be published as a white paper.2

PARLIAMENTARY 3, The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenAFFAIRS in the House of Commons during the following week.    Subjectto the progress of business, it was intended that the house should rise for the Easter adjournment on 11 April and resumeon 29 April.It was reported that a Private Member&apos;s Motion of no confidence in the Government was due to be discussed on 5 April.    Thebest tactics would be to treat it with contempt by seeking tohave it talked out or, if Mr Fell, the Member concerned, couldmuster sufficient support to carry the closure Motion, bycompletely abstaining from opposition.Development of THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Government had made aGovernment satisfactory start and was in good standing with the public, whoPolicy did not want an early general election.    The previous day&apos;s,  discussions with the Trades Union Congress had gone well,despite the misleading reports which had appeared in certain,sections of the Press.    But all policy proposals, includingproposals for legislation, must be considered against the back-ground that this was not a Government which had a firmParliamentary majority and could look forward to a long tenure of office, and that a relatively early general election must beregarded as likely, though if possible at a time of theGovernments own choosing.    In view of this, it was important that early progress should be made in developing those aspectsof Government policy which would be of particular electoralimportance: one of these was mortgage finance and relationswith the building societies, to which urgent attention should nowbe given by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretaryof State for the Environment.    It was however also highly desirable that the legislation repealing the Industrial relations act should have reached the Statute Book before a generalelection took place.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime ministers statement.3
4. The Cabinet gave further consideration to thearrangements for the 1974 uprating of social security benefits.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that it was proposed to take all stages of the National Insurance Bill in theHouse of Commons in one day during tfce week beginning 8 april and that the Bill must therefore be published on 29 March.    Ithad been agreed by the Ministers concerned that the Bill should require the 1975 uprating to take place on the basis thatpensions would be kept in line with average national earnings;but they had not yet been able- to agree on the provisions to bemade for the timing of that uprating.    The present lawprovided for uprating to come into effect not before 15 november and not after the end of December.    The Secretary of State for social Services, for good political and presentational reasons,argued that the 1975 uprating should come into effect not later than the end of July in that year; but the Chancellor.&apos; of theExchequer, again for good reasons, preferred a later date.In discussion, it was argued that the Labour Party was firmlycommitted to the principle of annual reviews.    The amount of &quot;the 1974 uprating, which the Cabinet had approved on 14 March,was related to a 12-month period only; and therefore any suggestion that it would be expected to cover a longer period,of up to 16 months, would lead to charges of bad faith andprovoke serious alarm amongst Government supporters.    Therewould also be a strong possibility of Opposition amendments,which it would be very difficult to resist, providing for upratingat 6-monthly intervals.    If such amendments were pressed theGovernment might have either to give way or to risk defeat; and either course would go a long way towards dissipating the goodwill which had accrued from the Governments prompt actionto give effect to their undertaking that pensions would be increased as a matter of top priority.    It would be possible to return to anautumn uprating in 1976 by ensuring that the amount of the 1975uprating was sufficient to enable it to last for more than 12 monthsAs against this, it was argued that a July uprating greatly limited the Chancellor of the Exchequers room f6r manoeuvre in relationto the timing of the budget, because the administrative arrange-ments needed to give effect to an uprating by the end of July were so complex that a decision had to be taken and announced inMarch.   An alternative course would in theory be to announce the amount of the uprating in advance of the budget statement;but this would be undesirable because it would not be possible to announce at the same time how the additional expenditure was tobe met; and this would be liable to have serious adverse effects on confidence.    A better course, which would preserve the \,1974 UPRATINGOF SOCIALSECURITYBENEFITSPreviousReference:CC(74) 3rdIConclusions,Minute 7
maximum freedom of action for the Government, might therefore be for the Bill to provide that the 1975 upratingwould come into effect not later than the end of November, butthat, if it were later than the end of July, arrangements wouldbe made to ensure that pensioners did not suffer financially asa result.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that,although there were strong arguments in both directions, theCabinet agreed that it was on balance preferable that theNational Insurance Bill should&apos;provide for the 1975 uprating tocome into effect not later than the end of July 1975.    Theprovision should apply only to that individual uprating, leaving the way open for a subsequent return to autumn upratings.    the detailed arrangements for announcing the amount of the 1975uprating, the method of financing it and other related matters should be settled at the time by the Ministers concerned.The Cabinet -1.      Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2.      Invited the Secretary of State for social services to arrange for a provision to beincluded in the National Insurance Bill on thelines indicated in the Prime Minister!s summing up.5
5.        The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the Channel tunnel project.    They considered two memoranda by the Secretary ofState for the Environment (C(74) 8 and 16), and they also had beforethem a memorandum by the Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS)(C(74) 12) on the same subject.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT recalled that he had been invited to submit further information on a numberof issues which had arisen in the Cabinets discussion on 26 March.His colleagues would doubtless not wish to abandon the position which they had adopted in Opposition, that they were not opposed inprinciple to a Channel Tunnel, but wanted a re-examination of alternative transport strategies;  the question was whether work onPhase 2 of the project (which consisted of digging pilot sections ofiche service tunnels, completing design work, and negotiating thefinal financial terms) should be stopped while such a re-examinationtook place.    If that re-examination were to lead to the projectbeing abandoned, the suspension of Phase 2 would have saved a small amount of money; but if the case for the Tunnel were confirmed, to stop and then restart the project - even if that were practicable -would add greatly to the cost.    Indeed, the implications of inter-rupting the work now in progress were such that our partners wouldprobably regard it as tantamount to abandonment, of which the cost tothe Government now would be about  8^ million.    On the other hand,there was a specific break at the end of Phase 2, in mid-1975; andeven when the Treaty had been ratified, there would be no commit&quot;ment to proceed beyond this point until a further Agreement (No. 3)was signed.    Thus the Governments options would be fully safaguarded if work on Phase 2 were to be continued; and the LawOfficers concurred in this view.    Although the Tunnel authority would not be able to discriminate between thrdugh rail traffic andvehicle ferry traffic, and the Government would be bound to provideaccess for both, there was no restriction under any of the agreements on the Governments discretion to increase rail traffic or to adjust the scale of provision at the Cheriton terminal; and changes in thebalance between road and rail traffic would not affect the structure of the Tunnel.    The traffic, revenue and financial forecasts whichhad been published the previous summer would require re-examination in the light of developments, notably the change in the energysituation; work on this was already in hand; the assumptions andmethodology would have to be agreed with the two Governments.It would not be practicable for this joint reassessment to be trans-ferred completely to other consultants; but he proposed to employ an outside economist to assist in examining the adequacy of the financialforecasts and would consider further, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the question of an outside assessment ofthe consultants views.
As regards the cost of this investment, it must be remembered thattraffic with the Continent would continue to grow, and if the Tunnelwere not built, more investment must eventually be devoted to theair and sea services in the South East, with their associated roads,ports and airport facilities.    These alternatives to the tunnel would equally involve investment on a very heavy scale.    He did not however seek the agreement of the Cabinet to the project as a whole,but simply to the continuance of Phase 2, in order that the optionscould be kept open while a thorough reappraisal was made.    he therefore invited the Cabinet to endorse the conclusions in paragraph 14of C(74) 8.In discussion doubts were expressed whether the effect of proceeding with Phase 2 would not, for all the formal safeguards, confer anirresistable momentum in favour of continuing.     It was argued thatthe project in its present form had been opposed by the government when they were in opposition;  and they should be wary of committing themselves to any degree of support for a concept on whose meritsneither Parliament nor the country had been invited to pronounce.The requirement for a further reappraisal of the present scheme would do nothing to remove the inflexibility of a fixed cross-Channellink in comparison with investment in other forms of transport, nor to redress the lack of balance in regional investment.    On the otherhand, it was acknowledged that the Tunnel would help to give effectto the Governments policy for the increased use of rail transport,and should lead to valuable economies in the use of energy; and on financial grounds the arguments in C(74) 16 made a compelling case for completing Phase 2.    It was suggested however that the proposed legislation should provide for any decision to go beyond Phase 2 to besubject to specific Parliamentary approval.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that on balance the Cabinet agreed that Phase 2 of the project shouldcontinue,   subject to a most searching reappraisal of all aspectsof the scheme, and on the firm understanding that the Government was completely uncommitted about the future of the scheme.    In thisreappraisal they attached particular importance to securing a thorough and unbiased assessment of the consultants&apos; views, and theSecretary of State should make arrangements to that end.The Cabinet -1.      Approved the recommendations in paragraph 14 ofC(74) 8, on the understanding that this did not commit theGovernment to approval in principle of the ChannelTunnel project.7
2.      Invited the Secretary of State for the Environment,in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Central Policy Review Staff, to arrange for anindependent outside assessment to be made of the assumptions and judgments put forward by the consultants to the project.3.      Invited the Secretary of State for the Environment,in consultation with the Lord President of the Council,to arrange for the proposed legislation to include provisions to secure the specific approval of Parliamentto any further commitment to the Channel Tunnel project.Cabinet Office28 March 1974v- .;v&apos;.,v&apos;v.. -    : &apos; s8

IIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT -COPY NO        35!&apos; &apos; &apos; ^ /cabinet confidential annex cc(74) 7th Conclusions, Minute 1Thursday 28 March 1974 at 11. 00 amFOREIGN THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AND commonwealth affairs AFFAIRS said that the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee had decided on the policy we should adopt towards Chile.    our ambassador would be instructed to represent to the ruling JuntaChile our concern at the treatment of political prisoners; we would be associated with any future representations to be made by the united nations;  we would adopt a more flexible policy  on the admission ofChilean refugees; no new export licences for arms would be granted,but we would honour the existing contracts for the construction oftwo frigates and two submarines and for the refitting of a Chileandestroyer now in one of our yards;  the aid programme would cease,apart from the support of Chilean students coming to Britain and thecompletion of one or two technical assistance projects.     these decisions were to have been announced by him and by the Ministerof Overseas Development in answer to Parliamentary Questions theprevious day.    A misleading article in the Press had, however, soalarmed a number of Government supporters that 90 of them had expressed their concern at what might be announced, and had urgedin particular that the warships should not be delivered.    He had therefore considered it necessary to amend his proposed reply onthis point and instead of announcing that the contracts for the warships would be honoured, he had said that existing contractswere being urgently reviewed.    The reply to the parliamentary question had been well received on the Government benches but it now remained to reach a decision on the warships in the knowledge that a section of the ParHamentary Party was opposed to deliveringthem to the Chilean Government.    All the contracts had been made and delivery was due to take place this year and next.    A consider-able number of Chileans were already here in connection with thework; crews were under training and one of the frigates was carryingout sea trials with a Chilean crew.    If the transfer was to be prevented the vessels would in effect have to be impounded.    Thiswas a step which we had never taken, so far as he knew, except intime of war.    The Chilean Government would undoubtedly retaliate.
We must expect our trade to be seriously affected, including our purchases of copper which amounted to 20 per cent of our needs.The consequences might be wider.    We had in recent yearsreceived orders to supply arms and ships to a number of latin american countries, including Mexico, Venezuela and Brazil, to a value of  200 million.    If we were seen to break contracts some ofthese orders might well be at risk.    While, therefore, he fully understood the views of those who were opposed to delivering the warships, a decision, which would need to be taken as soon aspossible, would also need to have regard to the serious consequences for us of a refusal to honour the contracts.THE PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that among a section of the Governments supporters there was strong opposition to delivering the vessels.    If the Cabinet confirmed thedecision of the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee and announcedthis without first having arranged for some form of consultationwith back -benchers, there could well be an embarrassingly hostile reaction.    He was in the course of establishing    Parliamentarygroups on a variety of subjects and he recommended that theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary and the Secretary of State for defence should meet the appropriate group before the Cabinetreached a decision. iIn discussion it was noted that the last Labour Party Conference had supported the view that there should be no more sales of arms toChile.    It could reasonably be argued that the contracts for the warships should therefore be broken.    If the Government wished to honour the contracts it was important that there should at the veryleast be prior consultation with its supporters.    If the considerations were put to them objectively there might well be support for thedecision reached by the Defence and Oversea^ Policy Committee.If, however, the opposition were sufficiently strong, ministers might come to the conclusion that the contracts should be broken,and the financial penalties and the effect on employment in the shipyards and on present and future trade be accepted.    It was recognised that discussion with the relevant group might encouragepressure for discussion in the Parliamentary Party as a whole.It was argued, on the other hand, that the conclusion reached by theDefence and Oversea   Policy Committee was clearly correct, andthat the consequences of reversing the decision would be sodamaging to the national interest that the decision should be confirmed without delay.    It was also suggested that if a minister were to talk to a Parliamentary group in the absence of a cabinet decision on policy, both the Minister himself and the government might find themselves in difficulties.    Unless the Minister laiddown a clear line of policy he could hardly hope to influence the group.If he laid down&apos;a clear line which was not based on a Cabinet decision

Unless the Minister laiddown a clear line of policy he could hardly hope to influence the group.If he laid down a clear line which was not based on a Cabinet decision
and which was rejected by the group he would be personallydiscredited unless his colleagues subsequently confirmed that line.It would be preferable to face dissent as a result of a cabinet decision already reached, rather than take a decision followingconsultation in which the group had rejected a MinisterJs proposals.There were obj elections to asking a Minister to talk to a group on a consultative basis, and it was better that a decision should be taken and that explanation and persuasion should then be used to moderateopposition.) It .7 &apos;THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that it was important that Government supporters should not feel that decisions were taken without regard to their views.    There had earlier beenfull opportunity for the Party to express its views on relations withChile, and there had been very little disagreement on the policy to befollowed.    The conclusions reached by the Defence and overseas policy Committee satisfied that policy to a very large extent,although examination in office of the facts showed that it would not bein our interests to break the existing contracts for the warships.The majority of the Cabinet seemed to share that view but therewas no need for the Cabinet to reach a final decision that day.    Thediscussion had however shown the difficulty of finding a form of consultation with the Parliamentary Party which would minimisepossible difficulties for Ministers individually and collectively.    on balance the Cabinet thought it right to accept the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary&quot;s offer to explain the matter to aspecialist group of Members, using the arguments which led to theconclusions reached by the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee,but without saying that a decision had been reached or appearing toleave the decision with the group.    This would be a delicate task and the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary could be assured thathis colleagues would not say anything to make.it more difficult.After the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had spoken to theParliamentary group the Cabinet should move as soon as possible toa decision which should be taken in advance of any discussion withthe Parliamentary Party as a whole.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office28 March 19743
