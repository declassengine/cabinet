SubjectPRICES POLICY1974 UPRATING OF SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITSiii
1. THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had already urged hiscolleagues to study &quot;Questions of Procedure for Ministers&quot;(C(P)(74) 1) very carefully.    He wanted now to emphasise that,although it was important that the Governments policies shouldbe publicly presented to the best advantage, Ministers should exercise caution in agreeing to give interviews to the media,including the foreign press.    Ministers who thought it right togive such interviews should normally confine their remarks to matters for which they were directly responsible; in particular,pronouncements should not be made about fiscal questions,matters involving public expenditure or foreign relations (which of course included this country&apos;s relationship-with the european economic Community) unless there had been full prior consultationwith the responsible Ministers.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Prime Minister.2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.It was noted that there was a possibility that the Government couldbe defeated on the amendment to the Address in Reply to theGracious Speech which the Conservative Party had put down for debate on 18 March, though it seemed doubtful whether either theConservative or the Liberal Party wished in fact to precipitate anearly general election.    The situation could in any case beconsidered at the meeting of the Cabinet which had already been planned for the morning following the debate.    In the meantime,it would be useful for the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary,in a public speech which he would be making on the evening of15 March, to stress the importance in the national interest thatthere should be stability in Government at the present time.
FOREIGN 3. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN ANDAFFAIRS COMMONWEALTH AFFAIRS said that it would be necessary to review our policy on naval visits to certain countries.    Pendingthe outcome of this review a visit to Athens by 2 ships of theRoyal Navy which was to have taken place that day had been cancelled.    Visits to Portugal would also be suspended, but for practical reasons vessels of the Royal Navy should be allowed to/ visit the Azores.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that, in general,it was desirable to avoid cancelling visits at very short notice.A review of our policy should be conducted jointly by the2 Departments, and they had agreed that this should be done.The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary and the Secretary ofState for Defence.4. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN ireland said that the success of the Protestant candidates opposed to theSunningdale Agreement in winning 11 seats in the General Electionhad been a severe blow to Mr Faulkner and his supporters in theNorthern Ireland Assembly, and had affected morale in the Executive.We must continue to make it clear that the Executive and theprinciple of power-sharing had our full support.    We shouldcontinue to work for progress on the Sunningdale Agreement; itwould be unwise to yield to pressure from those who were opposed to this.The Cabinet - I took note of the statement by the Secretary of Statefor Northern Ireland.NORTHERNIRELAND
5.        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C(74) 4) on public expenditure in 1974-75.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the countryconfronted an economic situation which might well be the worstwhich had ever been faced in peacetime, and which was deteriorating.    In the past year inflation had been running at over10 per cent; the balance of payments deficit had been around 1, 500 million;  the borrowing requirement had been  4, 000million;  and growth had virtually come to a halt by the end of theyear.    In the absence of any change in economic policies, inflationthis year would be over 15 per cent;    the balance of payments deficitwould increase to about  4, 000 million, which implied a significant increase quite apart from the deficit arising from higher oil prices;the borrowing requirement would be about  3, 000 million; and theprospects for growth were highly uncertain.    The 3-day week hadmultiplied the problems by reducing the gross domestic product by10 per cent during the first 2 months of the year, with a cut in industrial output of 20-30 per cent.    Industry was now short ofboth money and stocks, and there was great uncertainty about howrapidly the economy would recover.    There were also uncertaintiesabout the future trend of commodity prices and the prospects for world trade.! IIt was clear that there would be no scope for any increase in living standards this year, although there might be some improvement inthe second half of the year compared with the present depressedlevel.    The threshold agreements which had been included in stage 3 of the Conservative Governments Counter-Inflation policy would act as a straitjacket to policy.    While not many such agreements had yet been made, they were likely to be generalised,and the 7 per cent threshold level would probably be reached inApril, with the agreements being triggered about 9 times duringthe rest of the year.    While this would make it economically virtuousto subsidise the cost of living, it would also limit ^e Governmentsfreedom of action, particularly in the use of indirect taxation.Against this background his aim would be to ensure that during aperiod of sacrifice the burdens would be fairly shared.    He wouldalso aim to make the maximum use of manpower and materials toincrease growth as rapidly as possible.    It would be necessary toshift resources from private consumption into the balance ofpayments and investment, but not so rapidly as to dislocate the economy and lead to large increases in unemployment.    In order to clear the way for his final Budget decisions, it would be necessaryto decide the total level of public expenditure by the end of the week.He had already made progress in settling the expenditure on food subsidies, and the Cabinet would be discussing the size of the uprating of social security benefits later in the meeting.    on nationalised industry prices, the Cabinet had already agreed to a
substantial increase in the price of industrial coal, and he considered that it would be necessary to accept increases inpostal and telecommunication charges and railway fares.    TheGovernment would also be faced with a very difficult judgment on steel and electricity prices.    On defence, he proposed that thereduction announced by the previous Government of  175 million in 1974-75 should be increased to  250 million; and that anannouncement of this should be linked with the intention, announced by the Government when they were last in office, to withdraw from East of Suez except Hong Kong.    On the major expenditureprojects mentioned in paragraph 6 of his memorandum, he hoped to reach agreement with the Secretary of State for the Environmenton a holding position for the Channel Tunnel project, and on a suspension of expenditure on Maplin, at least for the coming yearand preferably longer.    On the Concorde project, he had circulated a minute to members of the Cabinet setting out the facts, and therewas already Parliamentary pressure for these to be disclosed.He hoped that as a first step the facts could be made availablepublicly.    In his view the project should be cancelled, but this wasa matter which the Cabinet would need to discuss separately.He would shortly be putting proposals to the Cabinet for the reviewof public expenditure programmes for the years from 1975-76onwards.    For 1974-75, he invited the Cabinet to agree that netadditions to public expenditure should be limited to those affectingpersonal incomes and expenditure, as indicated in paragraph 2 ofC(74) 4; and that in view of these additional expenditures and therisk of subsidies being needed for the nationalised industries,any other net additions to public expenditure programmes in 1974-75must be avoided.In discussion, there was general agreement with the approachproposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.    The limitationproposed on public expenditure in 1974-75 would bear severely on some programmes, particularly those which had been cut by theprevious Administration in December.    Some Ministers might therefore wish to propose some variation within their totalallocation.    The Cabinet would however have an early opportunityto discuss the arrangements for reviewing expenditure in 1975-76and subsequent years; and it might also be appropriate, later inthe year, to review public sector building programmes in the lightof the prospects for the construction industry.    The following further points were also made in connection with particularexpenditure programmes.
Before a substantive decision was taken on the future of the concorde project, it should be fully discussed by the Cabinet, whowould need not only a statement of the financial costs involved, butalso an estimate of the social costs, including unemployment,social security benefits, and retraining.    There would be a very strong reaction from the French Government to any proposal forcancellation, and the Attorney General should be asked to advise on the legal position.   Tt was also for consideration whether thefinal decision should be announced in the Budget or whether, forexample, a Select Committee should be appointed.    But whateverfinal decision was reached, there seemed to be overwhelmingadvantage in revealing the facts at the earliest opportunity afterthe General Election, as a background to the decisions   whichthe Government would subsequently announce;  and the FrenchGovernment could not reasonably object to this since they had recently themselves issued a Press statement unilaterally.    Itwould be desirable to give advance warning to the FrenchGovernment, the manufacturers and the trades unions that a statementof the facts was being issued.    The statement might give rise to ademand for an immediate Debate, but in that case the Governmentshould avoid commenting on the substance and take credit for havingbrought the facts to light.    The way in which the matter should be handled in the Budget should be further considered in the light ofpublic reaction to the statement.Proposals for the future of the Channel Tunnel and Maplin Airportprojects would shortly be brought before the Cabinet.    Full account would need to be taken of the effect on other airports if Maplin wasnot built.The Secretary of State for Defence would co-operate with theChancellor of the Exchequer in seeking ways of achieving theadditional reduction which he had proposed.    It would however not be easy because reductions, whether in manpower or in equipmentprojects, tended in the short run to entail additional expenditure onredundancy payments and cancellation charges.    Moreover, whilean announcement about withdrawal from East of Suez might heLp tostrengthen the credibility of the expenditure cuts, it would be unwise to take this step without proper consultation, which might takesanother 2 or 3 weeks.
There would be particular problems in regard to agriculture, given that the Government was committed to expansion and that our farmers were getting lower prices than in the original member countries ofthe European Economic Community, but were faced with large increases in the cost of feeding-stuffs.    The Governmentscommitment was however limited to the maximum economic expansion of agriculture, and there was room for argumentas to the level of expansion that could be considered economic.The December reductions in the education programme cculd leadto some limitation of teacher establishments, with the result thata number of teachers leaving training colleges might not find employment.    The reduction of 20 per cent in capital expenditure during the year would require a reduction of 50 per cent in newstarts, so that the school building programme would be limitedto accommodating increased numbers in areas where the school population was expanding.    The inner city areas, which were particularly deserving of help, would therefore suffer disproportionate-tionately.    While at the present time there was no room for reversal of any of the December cuts, the matter might be reviewed later inthe year in any general review of construction programmes.Increases would be needed in postal and telecommunications charges,A decision on steel prices would be more difficult, and needed furtherconsideration.    In the electricity industry, the forecast deficit was now around  500 million, and an increase would be proposed takingdue account of the possible effect on threshold agreements.    Whereincreases were proposed for domestic consumers, the ministers concerned should consult the Secretaries of State for Prices and consumer Protection and for Social Services on the implications for the low-paid and pensioners.    Even with the increases insupplementary benefits which were now being proposed, an increasein supplementary heating allowances was likely to be necessary to offset higher bills for electricity and paraffin; and if some help ofthis kind could be given it might enable larger general price increases to be made.    There was a case for placing most of the burden of theprice increases on industry, since our exports appeared at present to be underpriced in export markets.    Nevertheless, industry alsofaced considerable liquidity problems; and the most importantproblem to be tackled at present was inflation, which was more serious here than in our main competitor countries.    By the endof the year, we might again be becoming ion competitive in export markets, and a policy of increasing industrial costs to achieve atemporary increase in export prices could therefore be damaging.
A choice would however need to be made between the various ways of allocating the price increases, given that, at the margin, an increasein one sector released funds for subsidies elsewhere.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the broad approach proposed by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer in G(74) 4.    Individual Ministers should discuss the detailed implications for their programmes with the Chief Secretary,Treasury, as necessary.    The Cabinet would be considering later inthe meeting the proposals regarding the uprating of social security benefits.    It was important that no proposals for increased expenditure should be revealed before the Chancellor of theExchequer was abler in his Budget statement, to demonstratehow they would be financed.    The Cabinet would need to giveearly consideration to the future of the Concorde project, ChannelTunnel and Maplin Airport, in the light of memoranda circulated bythe Ministers concerned, which should take account of the social aswell as the economic implications.    In the meantime, the cabinet agreed that the Secretary of State for Industry should release astatement of the facts concerning the Concorde project for public discussion.    A draft of this statement should be cleared with himself and with the Lord President, the Foreign and commonwealth secretary, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the attorney general;  ai/d prior warning of its issue should be given to theFrench Government, and the manufacturers and trades unions.The Cabinet would consider at a later meeting the arrangementsfor preparation of public expenditure programmes for 1975-76 and thereafter; and noted that it might be desirable to review public sectorbuilding programmes later in the year, in the light of the prospectivelevel of demand on the construction industry.The Cabinet -1. Approved the recommendation in paragraph 8of C(74) 4.2. Invited the Secretary of State for Industry -a. To issue a statement of the facts of the concorde project, as indicated by the PrimeMinister in his summing up.b. In consultation with the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary, the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, the Secretary of State for employment and the Attorney General, to circulate a memorandum on the concorde project for consideration by the Cabinet.&apos; 7 v
3. Invited the Secretary of State for the environment to circulate memoranda on thefuture of the Channel Tunnel and Maplin Airport.4.        Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to circulate a memorandum on arrangements for preparation of public expenditure programmes for 1975-76 and later years.PRICES 6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofPOLICY State for Prices and Consumer Protection (C(74) 5) on prices policy.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR PRICES AND consumer protection said that she sought the agreement of her colleagues to the urgent preparation of a Bill giving powers to:i. authorise expenditure on subsidies,ii. prescribe prices and margins for subsidised goods,iii. prescribe prices and margins for certain other essential foods,iv. vary decisions of the Price Commission,v. require prices to be displayed and goods to be markedwith unit prices.In considering the payment of subsidies she had been obliged to reject the idea of operating through the mechanism of the ValueAdded Tax; this would have required the rewriting of a computerprogramme which would have taken months to complete.    She had decided to concentrate on certain essential foods and to use existingmechanisms as far as possible.    She proposed therefore to subsidisebread and milk, both of which were weighted heavily in the retail price index (RPI);  also cheese, butter and sugar, in spite of certain difficulties that would arise in relation to the European economic community.    She would like to add one other protein food to the list and was investigating the possibilities of eggs, bacon or ham.    Itwould be necessary to introduce the subsidy on bread immediately in order to forestall a price increase.    The other subsidies wouldbe announced in the Budget.    The cost would be in the region of 400 million a year, excluding the existing milk subsidy.    Thetotal would depend mainly on the cost of holding bread prices atthe present level.    She thought it right to retain the Price commission as an independent agency to control prices in accordance with ageneral price code, as it would be unwise to involve the Government
in the detailed control of prices; but she proposed to initiatestatutory consultation on three amendments to the Code: first to impose a general reduction of 10 per cent on all distributors&apos; gross margins;  secondly to impose a minimum period of threemonths between price increases; and thirdly if possible to dealwith price increases on existing stocks.    She would aim to bringthe Bill, the subsidies and the amendments to the Price Code intoeffect more or less at the same time in April.    In the longer termshe would like to reconsider the provision for allowable costs in thePrice Code, and to consider whether the presentation of companyaccounts could be made to distinguish between profits on home salesand on exports.     The proposed amendments to the Price Code hadbeen deliberately stated in uncompromising terms.    The confederation of British Industry and the Retail Consortium would object strongly tosome ofthem, and it might be necessary to offer some concessions inorder to get the proposals through Parliament.    There might in .particular be a real case for allowing some exemptions for the sake of investment; the more tightly gross margins were squeezed themore necessary such exemptions would become.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had held a meeting the previous day to discuss the abolition of the Pay Board.    The meeting had .agreed that the power to abolish the Pay Board should be included within this Bill.    The prospects of Parliamentary approval seemedbetter at present than they might be later and the provision would improve the prospects for the negotiations with the Trades UnionCongress on a voluntary incomes policy .    The clause would however be drafted in such a way that its deletion in Parliament wotild notdamage the rest of the Bill.    It would enable the Secretary of state to abolish the Pay Board by means of an order requiring an affirmative Resolution of the House, and it would be made clearthat this would not be done until some progressed been made in working out a voluntary policy.In discussion it was argued that the public would expect a more general introduction of cash margin controls.    They would alsoexpect action on sharp increases in the prices of foods such asspaghetti which might not be regarded as essential foods.    against this it was argued that the control of prices and margins would haveto be limited to a small number of essential foods in order to enablethe firms to cover their losses by cross-subsidisation from theirprofits on other foods.    The proposed 10 per cent cut in marginswould be reinforced where necessary by the use of paragraph 80of the Price Code, which enabled the Commission to recommenda reduction in margins where the cost of any goods rose substantially.The costs of the whole policy would have to be borne by industry,which was already facing cash flow difficulties and deferments of investment.    Many firms, particularly manufacturers hit by frequentincreases in world prices, would need to take advantage of any provisions for special exemption.
In further discussion it was argued that the principal short-term aim should be to delay the first triggering of the threshold agreements;there was a danger of two triggerings in April.    However, the subsidies could reduce the RPI by only 1 per cent and it would benecessary to look for other ways to moderate or at least to delayincreases in the cost of living.    In presenting these measures tothe public, Ministers would have to make it clear that they could do no more than moderate the price increases which would otherwise have taken place.    It would be rash to set any particular target, aseconomists differed widely in their judgements about the rate of price increases that could be expected ovex the next few months.    In the longer run there was still the possibility of downturn in commodity prices.The following points were made in further discussion -a. It was illogical to deal separately with the milk subsidy,which should now be treated as a consumer subsidy like therest.    If the milk subsidy were brought within the Bill itwould be necessary to raise the financial ceiling to accommodate itti ,b. Although the whole Bill should apply to NorthernIreland it would be reasonable to make the Northern IrelandExecutive responsible for the powers in ii., iii. and v, of thestatement by the Secretary of State for Prices and consumer protection.c. Although the existing Price Code exempted steelbecause of our obligations under the European Coal andSteel Community, it would be desirable if possible to controlsteel prices, particularly the price of tinplate which featuredheavily in consumer expenditure.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discus sionj said that theCabinet agreed that the Secretary of State for Prices and consumer protection should set in hand urgently the preparation of a Bill on thelines proposed in her paper, with the addition of an enabling clausefor the abolition of the Pay Board.    She should consult further withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food about the inclusion of the milk subsidy; andwith the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland about the powersto be assigned to the Northern Ireland Executive.    It would alsobe helpful if she would circulate a note to her colleagues givingthe answers to questions that they might be asked about the proposals:in particular, why there were to be no subsidies on meat, chicken, orfish.    It would be desirable to re-examine the policy on price controland subsidies during the summer in the light of the movement ofcommodity prices.
The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister and invited theSecretary of State for Prices and consumer protection to be guided accordingly.7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Social Services (C(74) 6) about the 1974 uprating of social security benefits.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SECURITY said that theGovernment were committed by the Election Manifesto to increasepensions to  10 for single people and  16 for married couples.    Atthe time when her memorandum had been circulated two points hadbeen outstanding - the method of financing the uprating and the date from which the increases should be implemented.    On the first point,she had now been able to reach agreement with the Chancellor of theExchequer.    For reasons of demand management he had found itnecessary, despite the substantial surplus at present in the national insurance Fund, to seek substantial increases in contributions.Agreement had been reached on arrangements which would protect the least well paid by imposing progressively heavier burdens onthe better off.    There would be a substantial increase in the flat rate contribution payable by employers.    So far as employees were concerned, the flat rate contribution would be reduced but there wouldbe substantial progressive increases in the earnings relatedcontributions.    The overall effect was that the contributionspayable by those earning less than  25 a week would be slightlyreduced while the contributions payable by those earning morethan that amount would be progressively increased by amountsrising to a maximum of 57p at the proposed new earnings ceiling of  62 a week.So far as the date of implementation was concerned, it was important,in view of the Manifesto commitment, that there should be no avoidable delay.    The earliest date which was administrativelypossible was 22 July, and this should be accepted as the objective.The Social Policy Committee of the Trades Union Congress (TUC)had, at a recent meeting with her, indicated that they hoped for implementation in April;  and deferment until October, which wasthe date preferred by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, would causegreat disappointment.    In the interests of early implementation she had decided not to propose increases in a number of benefits whichwere urgently in need of review.    But in its progress through theHouse of Commons the Bill would be open to amendment to secureimprovement in these benefits, and it might be difficult to resist
such amendments except on the ground that the Bill had been drafted in such a way as to make possible implementation at the earliestpossible date.    Moreover, deferment of the operative date untilthe autumn would mean that by October 1975 pensioners would belittle better off under the Governments scheme than they wouldhave been under the proposals put forward in the ConservativeParty1 s Election Manifesto, which involved six-monthly uprating.In discussion, it was argued that in order to protect those who hadlow incomes but did not qualify for supplementary benefit, it wouldbe necessary to make improvements in the rent and rate rebateschemes; and this would represent a further significant net additionto public expenditure.    A still further addition,, of the order of . 80 million, would come from the payment later this year of the 10 Christmas bonus tc the continuance of which the Labour party had committed itself.In further discussion, it was argued that there were strong financial reasons for preferring implementation in October.    The extra costof implementation in July was very considerable - it would in fact bethe equivalent of an addition of about lp to the standard rate of incometax.    Uprating would moreover have an unfavourable effect on the retail price index, which it was desirable to defer as long as possible.It also could not be overlooked that it might well prove Impossible inthe event of an uprating in July to hold the position that there should beno further uprating until October 1975.    The position was made allthe more difficult by the additional expenditure arising from the christmas bonus and likely changes in the rent and rate rebateschemes.    There was in fact no commitment to implementationbefore the autumn;  and although there would no doubt be dis appoint-ment that immediate implementation was administrativelyimpossible, it was doubtful whether October would produce a significantly more unfavourable reaction than July,    An interimdate however - for example, 1 September - had little merit: its financial benefits would be relatively small, but it would not beearly enough to satisfy those wanting very rapid implementation.. &apos; &apos; - &apos;On the other hand, it was argued that the uprating of pensions hadbeen firmly identified as the Governments first priority.    The factthat it was to be put into effect at the earliest moment which wasadministratively possible would be of great help in the discussions with the TUC on voluntary arrangements for dealing with pay; andit would make easier the continuance of the Pay Board until asatisfactory agreement had been reached on voluntary arrangements.Moreover, the possibility of an early Election made it very desirablethat the Government should be able to show that they had acted as rapidly as possible to give effect to their undertaking to increasepensions.    In any event it was publicly known that implementationby the end of July was administratively possible;  and there would
be great difficulty in explaining the reasons for any delay beyond thatdate.    If, however, 22 July were to be achievable, an immediate decision was needed because the necessary arrangements would haveto be put in hand at once.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the proposals which had been worked out for financing the proposed uprating of pensions and congratulatedthe Ministers concerned on the ingenious solution which had beenfound.    As regards timing, the Cabinet agreed on balance that thenew rates should be payable from 22 July rather than from a date inOctober, in view particularly of the assistance that an early date would give to the discussions with the TUC on voluntary arrangements for pay.    But the Cabinet recognised thatimplementation in July might oblige the Chancellor of theExchequer to seek a higher increase in taxation and greaterreductions in some areas of public expenditure than would otherwise have been necessary;  and he was entitled to expectco-operation from his colleagues if further expenditure reductions in fact proved necessary.    The Cabinet&apos;s decisions would be announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the context ofthe Budget; and the Secretary of State for Social Services should put in hand the steps needed to secure implementation on 22 July,including the preparation of legislation. ) IThe Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office14 March 1974
