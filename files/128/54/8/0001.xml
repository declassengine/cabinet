1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.It was proposed that all stages of the National Insurance Billshould be taken in the House of Commons on 10 April.    It was understood that the Opposition would be moving an amendmentproviding for uprating at intervals of six months, and it was virtually certain that such an amendment would be carried.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, saidthat the next step should be for the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Secretary of State for Social Services, in consultation withthe Chief Whip, to consider urgently the feasibility and thefinancial and other implications of six-monthly upratings and toreport their conclusions to the Cabinet at its next meeting.    TheLord President should also consider and report to the Cabinet onthe scope for procedural measures, which would no doubt includethe very restrictive drafting of financial resolutions, to preventParliament from forcing on the Government provisions involvingunjustified and unacceptable increases in public expenditure.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theMinisters concerned to proceed accordingly.2. THE PRIME MINISTER said that later that day he had to answer Parliamentary Questions about the Governments attitudetowards the default by the Clay Cross councillors on the housing finance Act.    He proposed to give a holding reply.    This would indicate that the difficulties had arisen from the[ unprecedentedsituation created by the fact that the measures in the housing finance Acts were forced upon local government with unreasonablespeed.    The policy of the Labour Party when in opposition hadbeen that, in the case of Clay Cross only, efforts should be madeto secure reimbursement to the councillors concerned for thefinancial penalties they suffered; but no commitment had been given that this would involve a charge upon public funds.    Regardingdisqualification generally, the accounts of local authorities were still being examined by the District Auditors in the course of their annual audits, and not until this had been completed would theGovernment be able to know the full extent of the problem and %omake representations to Parliament.    It was proposed that in association with this reply a statement should be circulated in theOfficial Report dealing with the decisions taken and the statements made by the Labour Party when in opposition,i M;CONFIDENTIAL
In discussion, it was argued that at this stage a holding reply wasthe only course which was open.    The District Auditors would nothave completed their examination of the accounts of all the localauthorities concerned until the autumn;  and not until then would itbe possible to assess either the full financial implications for alldefaulting councillors or the scale on which the question ofdisqualification might arise.    At that stage, it would be necessaryfor policy decisions to be taken;  and all the options - includinglegislation providing for some form of amnesty - would have to be examined.    The Labour Party, when in opposition, had given a commitment to remove disqualifications; and there was nothing inthe statement &quot;which would preclude this.    As regards reimburse-ment, there were strong feelings within the Labour Party in both directions; but many people, including manyin the areasurrounding Clay Cross, had little sympathy with the Clay Crosscouncillors, many of whom were regarded as not being supporters of the Labour Party.    Any suggestion of the use of public fundsmight thus arouse considerable resentment.    In general, it was important to ensure that the reply could not be interpreted as inany way encouraging disregard of the law.THE PRIME MINISTER., summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that a holding reply should be given on the lines proposed.    It would, however, be preferable not to circxxlate inthe Official Report the particulars of statements which had beenmade by present Ministers when in opposition; b\it the materialcould be used in dealing with supplementary Questions and otherinquiries.    The Cabinet        also agreed that the reply shouldspecifically indicate not merely that there was no commitment touse public funds for reimbursement but that the Government didnot intend that they should be used for this purpose.     Tfee reply shouldalso refer specifically to the importance of-ensuring that whatever action was finally talc en should be fair to the many councillors whohad reluctantly implemented the Acts.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.2
3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARYinformed the Cabinet that as agreed at their last meeting he had made a statement at the Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) on1 April 1974 outlining the Governments approach to the renegotiation of our terms of entry to the Community.    Althoughthe French Foreign Minister had made a hostile statement andother member Governments had reacted adversely in public, provate conversations with some delegations in Luxembourg had revealedwillingness to seek a satisfactory solution.    Apart from atendency (particularly in the smaller countries) to emphasise the&quot;European idea&quot;, the point to which greatest importance appearedto be attached was the difficulty&apos;of any attempt to renegotiate theCommunity Treaties.    The Germans, who were generally inclined to be helpful, had made it clear that they would opposerenegotiation of the Treaties, partly on the practical ground thatthe changes would have to go through the German Parliament;  andpartly because such changes would set a precedent for any other country which was dissatisfied with Community arrangements.These reactions confirmed the Governments view that the bestapproach would be to attempt, if possible, to achieve our objectivesby modifying Community policies without changes in the Treaties.The Foreign Ministers had also discussed political co-operation and particularly relations between the United States and theCommunity in the context of the dialogue with Arab oil-producing countries.    The French Foreign Minister had taken up an isolatedposition in these discussions, reflecting a basic suspicion ofUnited States motives towards Europe and the French Governmentsobjective of preventing the United States from influencingCommunity affairs.    There would be a further poHticalco-operation meeting early in May;  tactically it was advantageousthat this meeting would shortly precede the Council at which he was due to table detailed United Kingdom negotiating objectives.The French Presidential elections might cause some delay in theCommunity^ work and hence in our plans for renegotiation.    Thefirst poll in the election was likely to take place either on28 April or 5 May but if this were to be indecisive (as seemed verypossible) a second poll must follow within two weeks.Consequently the Council meeting proposed for 7 May might be postponed.    But it was nevertheless important to press ahead with the definition of our renegotiating objectives with a view totabling them at the next Council meeting.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet noted the report by the Foreign and commonwealth secretary on his statement to the Council of Ministers.    It was important that the Cabinet should have adequate time to consider3
the objectives for renegotiation;  it might be appropriate to set   *aside a whole day or a half day for discussion before the nextCouncil meeting.    It would be helpful for the issues first to beconsidered in detail by the Ministerial Committee on european community Strategy (ECS) and the Foreign and commonwealth secretary would be arranging for comprehensive position papersto be prepared.The Cabinet -1. Took note with approval of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of the discussion.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that he hadreceived a message from the French Minister of Transport to saythat he would be unable, in view of the Presidential election, to go ahead with the planned talks on Concorde, and to ask that theBritish Government should not make public commitments about future policy in the interim.    Although work should certainlycontinue within the British Government in examining and costingthe various options there now seemed no possibility of the Cabinetbeing able to reach a firm decision until after the French election.The Cabinet -2. Took note of the statement by the Secretaryof State for Industry,4
4.      \ The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Secretaryof State for the Environment (C(74) 20) and the Central policy review Staff (C(74) 22) about building societies and housing finance.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said thatin February the building societies had had a net outflow of funds of about  15 million, while in March the outflow was likely to be between  20 and  40 million.    If this trend continued the outputof private houses was likely to fall to little more than 100, 000 ayear.    Moreover, the building societies now seriously feared thatthere might be a collapse of confidence, followed by a run on theirfunds.    The Council of the Building Societies Association (BSA)was meeting on the following Tuesday and, in-the absence of any action by the Government, was likely to recommend an increasein the investment rate to 11 per cent and in the mortgage rate to13 per cent.    In his view, such an increase in the mortgage rate was totally unacceptable - it would give a further twist to the pricespiral and would have extremely unfavourable political repercussions.    To prevent an increase, additional money mustbe injected into private housing, and this could be done either bytapping new sources of private funds or by a Government subsidy.As regards the former, one possibility, as: suggested in. the noteby officials attached to his memorandum, might be to arrange arediscounting facility through the Bank of England.    This wouldin effect be a loan which would either be repaid by the building societies when conditions were more favourable or be quicklyreplaced by a Eurodollar loan, which it might be possible toarrange within a few weeks.    But measures of this kind, thoughuseful, would not be regarded as adequate by the building societies and seemed unlikely of themselves to prevent an increase in the mortgage rate.    Unwelcome though it was, .a direct government subsidy might therefore have to be considered.    The cost of anacross-the-board subsidy sufficient to reduce the mortgage rateby 1 per cent would be about  12 million a month gross, and no provision had so far been made in Public Expenditure survey committee allocations.    If such a subsidy had to be introduced,it should be for a limited period only - say 6 months - during whicha high-powered committee should be set up and instructed, as amatter of urgency, to examine radical long-term solutions.In discussion, it was argued that it was of major political importance to prevent any further increase in the mortgage rate,all the more so in view of the action which had already been takento freeze rents - it would be disastrous to give the impression that the Government were not concerned to protect owner-occupiers.    It was in any event right on merits that very high priority should be given to the housing programme in both the5
public and the private sectors.    It was, however, doubtfulwhether an across-the-board subsidy was necessary or desirable.It would not be practicable to insulate owner-occupiers from themarket;  and in any event they had little cause to complain in viewof the appreciation of the value of their asset.    Indeed, the rate of increase of the mortgage rate had not in itself been excessive, andthe major part of the heavy burden falling on house purchasers was attributable to the increase in house prices.    Moreover, anacross-the-board subsidy would be very expensive and would destroy the strategy underlying the budget.    If, therefore, a subsidy had to be considered, it should be a limited one,restricted to first-time purchasers (at a cost of about  1-^ million a month) or possibly to people who had taken mortgages within thelast three years.    It was, however, doubtful whether even this wasnecessary.    Measures were now being taken to reduce general interest rates and could be expected to produce significant resultswithin the next few months.    The problem for the, building societieswas therefore a short-term one and might be dealt with by some form of rediscounting facility offered.by the Bank of England, orby a Eurodollar loan.    The latter was almost.certainly obtainableand the Government should be prepared to assist and to offer anyguarantee which might be needed.    If the building societies stillfound themselves under pressure in the period before general interest rates declined, they might be asked to run down their reserves, with a Government guarantee if necessary.    If, even with these measures, the building societies were unwilling to hold their present interest rates, the best course might be to seek to persuade them to limit the increase in the mortgage rate to12 per cent, but on the basis that for existing mortgages repaymentswould be held at their present level until the end of the year - aproposition to which it was thought that most of the major societieswould agree.    Some form of limited subsidy? for example tofirst-time purchasers, might then have to be considered.In further discussion, it was argued that the building societieswere likely to be sceptical about any decline in general interest rates and therefore be reluctant to hold down their rates.    Inthat event they would have to be told that the Government wouldmake clear that the odium of increased rates rested directly on them.    Such a situation would reinforce the case, which wasanyway strong, for a thorough-going review of the building societies&apos; organisation and methods, which were becoming increasingly outdated.    It was arguable that the banks should play a bigger part in providing finance for housing;  and a possibleimmediate step would be to apply the Price Code much morestringently to the banks so as to give them an incentive to diverta substantial proportion of the very high profits now being earnedinto financing housing.    There was a strong case for setting up acommittee as a matter of urgency to go into all these longer-termmatters.6
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the &apos;cost of mortgages and the scale of the house building programmewere issues of major political importance which could welldetermine the outcome of the next election.    In the long-term theGovernment should aim to reduce the mortgage rate, if possible to something below 10 per cent.    In the immediate future, however,they must concentrate on preventing any increase,    The Secretaryof State for the Environment and the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster should have urgent discussions with the BSA and should report the outcome to the Cabinet at their meeting on the followingTuesday.    Against the background of the measures being taken toreduce general interest rates, they should offer the BSA assistancewith securing a Eurodollar loan, including if necessary a government guarantee, and with arranging a rediscounting facility with theBank of England.    By these means it should be possible to avoid the need for the building societies to increase their investmentrate;  and if, in the very short-term, they experienced any shortageof funds this might be dealt with by urging them to run down their reserves, a Government guarantee being offered if necessary.If the outcome of the meeting with the BSA were unfavourable,consideration could be given to some form of direct subsidy;  butthe Cabinet had not yet reached a conclusion on this and thepossibility should not be mentioned to the BSA.    These measures would deal only with the immediate situation.    Longer-termsolutions must be urgently examined, including the desirability of fundamental changes in the nature, structure and functions of thebuilding society movement and the possibility of involving the banksin the provision of finance for housing.    A committee, perhapsincluding non-Ministerial members, should be set up to go into these matters and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for the Environment, should urgentlysubmit to the Cabinet proposals as to the composition and termsof reference of such a committee.The Cabinet - it1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2. Invited the Secretary of State for the environment and the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster to hold immediate discussions with theBuilding Societies Association on the lines indicated in the Prime Ministers summing up and to report the outcome to the Cabinet at their next meeting.7
3. Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer,in consultation with the Secretary of State for the environment, to circulate to the Cabinet proposals as to the composition and terms of reference of acommittee to examine long-term questions inrelation to building societies and housing finance.ILEGISLATIVE       5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the LordIPROGRAMME        President of the Council (C(74) 21) on the legislative programme[1974-75 for the 1974-75 Session.THE LORD PRESIDENT said that with a Session of uncertainlength, a very limited number of days for legislation before the summer Recess and the problems created by the lack of an overall majority in the House of Commons it was essential that theGovernment should concentrate on getting through as quickly aspossible a limited number of Bills to which they attached the greatest importance.    These were the Bills in the Top Priority category inthe main programme and the Essential Bills.    The Top Prioritycategory included not only Bills of vital political importance suchas Repeal of the Industrial Relations Act 1971, Furnished Tenanciesand Prices, but also Bills which were of lesser importance but were nevertheless urgent, such as Representation of the People,and less urgent Bills inherited from the previous administration which had been introduced in order to fill gaps at the start of the session.    The programme would be kept under constant review andthe timing of the introduction of Bills in the Priority category wouldhave to depend on how the Session progressed.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet approved the legislative programme set out in the annex to C(74) 21,    The Lord Privy Seal should discuss further with the Lord President and the Secretary of Sta^e for the environment the possibility of arranging for the early introduction into the Lords of Control of Pollution and Road Traffic;  and if theSecretary of State for Social Services concluded, in the light of herdiscussions with the Chancellor of the Exchequer about national insurance contributions, that it was essential for Social Security Act1973 Amendment to receive Royal Assent before the Summer Recess,she should discuss the matter further with the Lord President.Consideration should also be given to the possibility of finding anearly place for a very short Northern Ireland Bill on Firearms.It was particularly important that White Papers should be prepared on proposals in major Bills which were not going to receive anearly introduction.8
The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C(74) 18) about the Speaker1 s Conference on electoral law.THE HOME SECRETARY said that the Speaker1 s Conference hadunfinished business left over from the last Parliament and beforeinviting the Speaker to reconstitute it he wished the Cabinet toconsider the tactical handling of three matters which might beregarded as appropriate to the Conference.    The first two, whichwere dealt with in his memorm dum, were proportional representation and a ban on publication of opinion polls in theperiod immediately before an election; these v/ere obviouslyappropriate to the Speaker&apos;s Conference.    The third arose out ofthe need to deal with a proposal tc appoint a Royal Commission onemployee censorship of the content of Press advertising which lord Orr-Ewing would be putting forward in the Lords next week:the underlying issue here was the expenditureIon advertising for political purposes of allegedly non-party organisations like aims of Industry.    Since this kind of expenditure fell outside the present law on electoral expenses, it too might appropriately be referredto the Conference,     Proportional representation was the most difficult issue, however, since, although there was no question ofthe Government itself wanting to pursue it, there was a danger thatif the Government failed to take any initiative in the matter, itmight come to be regarded as the only Party which was not disposedeven to consider the case for electoral reform of this kind.    Itwas very likely that the Liberals would propose to include it in theterms of reference and it would be preferable not to leave theinitiative in their hands.In discussion it was argued that once the possibility of proportional representation was put forward by the Government as a subject forstudy it would become a major political issue which would be to theadvantage only of the Opposition Parties.    No form of proportional representation could do other than damage the Labour Party&apos;sprospects at general elections.    It was relevant that the KilbrandonCommission in proposing devolution to Scotland and Wales haditself recommended a form of proportional representation for thosecountries in recognition of the fact that only by so doing could theregular Labour majorities based on the existing Parliamentaryconstituencies be eliminated.    There was no urgent need to
reconstitute the Speaker&apos;s Conference.    There was no pressure for it among Government supporters in the House and for theGovernment to take the initiative in setting it up and puttingproportional representation in its terms of reference would raise considerable disquiet in the Labour Party throughout thecountry.    It should be borne in mind that the Conference could produce interim reports very quickly and if they were to do so onthis matter both the content and timing could easily be politicallydamaging to the Government.    Given the possibility of a GeneralElection later this year it would be preferable to defer setting upthe Conference until after the Summer Recess.    It was not thought likely.that the Speaker would himself wish to see itreconstituted immediately. ;THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said theCabinet were agreed that it would be preferable not to suggest atthis stage that the Speaker&apos;s Conference should be reconstituted.They recognised that there were dangers in inaction;  in particular the Government might not be able to defeat a Commons Motion, if one were tabled, calling for a Select Committee to consider the merits of proportional representation.    If the present Parliamentcontinued into the autumn, however, it would probably then bedesirable to reconstitute the Speaker&apos;s Conference, although even then it was arguable that it might be preferable to respond to asuggestion by the Opposition Parties that the Conference should consider proportional representation rather than for theGovernment to propose it.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited theHome Secretary to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office4 April 197410
