1. THE HOME SECRETARY referred to the statement he had made to the House of Commons the previous evening about the attack on Princess Anne and Captain Phillips.    Those who hadbeen injured in the incident were now reported to be out of danger,and the assailant, who had three minor previous convictions forburglary and receiving, was being charged with attempted murder.There were so far no signs that he had any political motivation orany connection with other persons or organisations.    Hisintentions appeared to have been to kidnap for ransom; but therewere some indications of mental abnormality.    The Queen wasbeing kept in touch by telephone to Indone sia, and he would bepreparing a written report to await her on her return to thiscountry.    There was no indication of any lapse in security, buta full inquiry would be held, necessarily in secret, to see whatlessons could be drawn from the incident and whether anytightening up in security arrangements was necessary.    He wouldmake a further statement in the House of Commons later in theday, though, since the case was sub judice, it would necessarily have to be in guarded terms.    For the same reason specialconfidentiality attached to the information which he had given tothe Cabinet,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatit was satisfactory that no lives had been lost and that there wasno evidence of political motivation.    The Cabinet noted the steps taken by the Home Secretary, and agreed that messages of sympathy should be sent from the Government to the Princessand her husband and to those who had been injured while seeking to defend them.    It would be important to continue to handle thematter in such a way as to minimise unfavourable politicalreactions from sections of opinion especially concerned with thelaw and order issue.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.
PARLIAMENTARY 2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in affairs the House of Commons during the following week.Rate Support It was reported that there might be difficulty in securingGrant Parliamentary approval to the Rate Support Grant Order for england and Wales, which was to be discussed on 25 March.    the constituencies of a number of Government supporters had beenadversely affected by the proposed changes in the distribution ofthe domestic element of rate support grant.    Many members ofthe Conservative Party had been similarly affected, and mightoppose the Order;  and the Liberal Party had already declared their intention of doing so.    It was important that all members of theGovernment, including junior Ministers, should be present and vote unless they were paired.    In the present evenly balanced stateof the Parties, it was essential that pairing arrangements should always be made through the Whips: informal arrangements madeon a personal basis would no longer be adequate.    The Whipswould of course bear in mind the political importance of Ministersbeing able to accept engagements outside London during the week;but priority must be given to protecting the Governments positionin Parliament.Motor Vehicles(Speed limits on Motorways)\ (Amendment)RegulationsIt was reported that the Motor Vehicles (Speed Limits onMotorways) (Amendment) Regulations, which would requireAffirmative Resolution, were to be considered on 28 March.They would increase the speed limit on motorways to 70 mph fromthe present level of 50 mph, but would not disturb the 50 mphlimit on other roads.    It had become necessary to act quickly to end the danger to      motorway users caused through the increasing tendency to ignore the 50 mph limit.   iThe regulations would be made later that day and laid on the following day.    Thenew arrangements were, however, an interim measure and it wasthe intention, as soon as it was agreed that fuel supplies permitted,to remove the 50 mph limit on all roads.2
3.        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Social Services about charges for family planning (C(74) 9).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said thatthe previous Government had made plans for introducing a comprehensive family planning service provided through clinics,hospitals and general practitioners, with contraceptive drugs and supplies being subject to the ordinary prescription charges.    Thisraised an immediate problem.    On 1 April, as a result of there organisation of the National Health Service, all clinics wouldbe transferred to Area Health Authorities; and the application ofthe previous Governments proposals would mean that charges forcontraceptive supplies would then become payable even at clinicsin the areas of those local authorities which at present werelevying no charges for family planning.    There were about 30such areas, mainly Labour controlled.    Such a situation wouldbe totally unacceptable politically, and it was doubtful whether theRegulations which would have to be made would secureParliamentary acceptance.    She therefore proposed that nocharges should be made for family planning services providedthrough clinics after 1 April.    The additional cost in England andWales would be in the region of  j million.It seemed clearly right that a comprehensive family planningservice should be provided.    This would require the participation of general practitioners and hospitals.    Modifications would inconsequence be necessary in general practitioners&apos; contracts.Suitable new arrangements had been negotiated and she proposedthat they should forthwith be submitted for pricing to the Doctors&apos;and Dentists&apos; Review Body (DDRB).    Provision had been made bythe Public Expenditure Survey Committee (PESC) for additional expenditure of  5 million a year arising from the recommendation to be made by the DDRB; but the claim submitted by the general practitioners would imply annual expenditure of about  20 million.She would therefore make clear that it would not be possible toauthorise the participation of general practitioners in providingfamily planning services if the cost were greater than could resonably be accepted in present circumstances.    PESCprovision had also been made for the expenditure of an additional 12 million a year on contraceptive supplies, of which it had been assumed that  2 million would be recovered through prescription charges.    It would however be embarrassing politically andanomalous in practice to levy prescription charges on contraceptivessupplied through general practitioners and hospitals but not on those supplied through clinics;  and she therefore proposed thatno charges should be levied in the former cases.    The cost of sucha concession in 1974-75 would be trifling; in 1975-76 it would beabout  if million and in the following year about  3 million.
-THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet approved the Secretary of State&apos;s proposals on thebasis that the whole of the additional expenditure would be found from within her Departments existing PESC provision.    she should take an early opportunity of making clear publicly that this concession, together with the decision which she and the Chancellorof the Exchequer had already taken to waive prescription charges in respect of children;aged 15 and women aged 60-65, representedall that the Government could at present do in the area ofprescription charges.    If she wished to refer to the decision oncharges for family planning in replying to the parliamentary questions which had been put down for answer during the following week, the terms of the replies should be agreed with the Chancellorof the Exchequer.    Procedurally it was important that the rulesset out in paragraph 7 of C(P)(74) 1 regarding the discussion withthe Treasury of all proposals involving expenditure beforecirculation to the Cabinet should be carefully observed:  and alsothat any manpower implications should be specifically indicated.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for Social Services to be guided accordingly.4
4, The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for the Environment (C(74) 8) about the Channel tunnel project.    They also had before them a memorandum by theCentral Policy Review Staff (CPRS) on the same subject (C(74) 12).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said thatthe Channel Tunnel scheme had been initiated by the previousLabour Administration.    In Opposition, they had not opposed a tunnel in principle, but had criticised particular aspects of thescheme which had evolved, particularly the undue emphasis on road traffic as against through rail services, and the proposalsfor the terminal at Cheriton.    They were therefore already committed to a fundamental reappraisal of the project, and onthis he agreed with the CPRS, although he did not agree with their particular suggestion regarding consultants.    Phase II of the project provided an opportunity for the project to be reassessed,and there would be relatively little financial difference between thecost of abandoning the project now or at the end of Phase II.    he proposed therefore that Phase II should be allowed to continue, butthat it should be accompanied by a review of a more fundamentalcharacter than had been proposed by the previous Government, andthat there should meanwhile be no commitment to Phase HI.    he also proposed that, in order to keep options open, the necessary legislation should be introduced.In discussion, it was argued that an economic case for the ChannelTunnel project had not yet been made out.    During the next fewyears, while we were still awaiting the benefits of North Sea oil,productive investment ought to be given priority over investment of this kind.    There were particularly strong objections to theproposed Cheriton terminal, and to the bias in the present scheme in favour of road traffic; and it was disturbing to note from paragraph 7 of C(74) 8 that only minor modifications to the scheme now seemed possible.    The benefits which the project was claimed to confer on other regions were also extremely questionable: it seemed more likely in practice to divert environmentalexpenditure from other regions to the South East.    It would be easier to stop the project at a stage when there was no appreciableamount of employment at risk.    Experience of other major projectshad shown how easily, as a project gathered momentum and vested interests built up, non-commitment could drift into commitment.The cost of allowing the Phase II studies to continue was notnegligible; and there might also be difficulty in findingParliamentary time for legislation which was not of the highest priority.    It would appear inconsistent to allow this project tocontinue when other major projects were being completely halted.There appeared to be a strong case, therefore, for abandoning the project now,&quot;    If not, all further expenditure on it should be frozenuntil a full reassessment had been completed with the help of independent consultants.
On the other hand, it was argued that the project had been agreed in principle as long ago as 1966.    Some development of transport facilities to the Continent would be needed in any event, and themain case for the tunnel had been that it would help to strengthen the British railway system..   On these grounds it was strongly supported by the railway trades unions, and an efficient railway system was also important as a support for productive industry.If the project were abandoned now, it would be many years before any similar project could be started;  and now that the Treaty hadbeen signed, failure to take steps to ratify it would be equivalent toabandonment of the project.    Our present commitment was limitedto Phase II, with an option to abandon the project at any time and pay the costs which had been incurred up to that point.    the example of Maplin had already demonstrated that it would bepossible to cancel later on if the review showed this to be the right course.    It would be wrong to conclude from paragraph 7 ofC(74) 8 that only minor modifications were now possible.    Majormodifications would probably need to be made, particularly to tiltthe balance of the project back towards rail services.    Theinformation at present available did not provide a basis for adecision in favour of outright cancellation now.    A radicalreassessment was required, with which the Treasury and the cprs might desirably be associated.    This should also cover thefinancial aspects: it might be preferable, for example, to bringthe project wholly within the public sector.    But the precise extentof our present commitment, and our potential liability to compensate the other partners in the event of abandonment, firstneeded to be clarified in consultation with the Law Officers.    If itwas possible to freeze or reduce the expenditure on Phase II whilethe studies were being completed, this course might have considerable attraction.    It was however uncertain whether thiswould necessarily reduce the ultimate cost, bearing in mind thatsome of the Phase II work would anyway be required as part of theprocess of reassessment.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were not ready to reach a conclusion on whether to abandon the Channel Tunnel project now or to defer a final decision until later in the year.    In the light of the discussion, the Secretary ofState for the Environment, in consultation with the Law Officers,should circulate a further memorandum for consideration by theCabinet during the following week.    This memorandum shouldclarify the extent of the existing contractual and Treaty commitments and the potential liability to pay compensation in the event ofabandonment.    In particular, it should indicate whether it wouldbe possible to reduce expenditure under Phase II for a few monthswhile the reassessment could take place.    It should also deal withthe point raised on paragraph 7 of C(74) 8 about the likely extent of6
the modifications which might be needed and could be negotiatedwith the other partners to the project.    The Secretary of state should consider further the scope for using independent consultantsin the reassessment of the project.    He should also discuss withthe Lord President and me Chief Whip the problems that would arise in finding Parliamentary time for the necessary legislation.He should further discuss with the Lord President and theChancellor of the Exchequer what could be said about the project in the Budget statement in advance of a firm decision by theCabinet.The Cabinet -1. Invited the Secretary of State for the environment, in consultation with the Law Officers,to circulate a further memorandum to the Cabinet,covering the points indicated by the Prime minister in his summing up,2.        Agreed to resume their discussion duringthe following week.
5.        The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary of Statefor Industry (C(74) 10) and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C(74) 13)about the future of the Concorde aircraft project, and a memorandumby the Attorney General (C(74) 14) drawing attention to the legalconsiderations involved.    They also had before them a note by theSecretary of State for Industry (C(74) 15) to which was attached acopy of his statement to Parliament on 18 March.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that he was notat this stage seeking a final decision from the Cabinet about thefuture of Concorde.    His statement in Parliament that week had shown that on any basis of estimating the project was uneconomic;but many of the key figures were uncertain: there were, forexample, varying estimates of the operating losses which british airways would incur and of the number of jobs at stake; theestimates of cancellation costs were minima, with no allowance for any special redundancy measures.    But the essential questionconcerned the political handling of a project for which theresponsibility was now shared by four successive Administrations.The Attorney General had drawn attention in his memorandum tothe legal risks involved in withdrawing unilaterally from the enterprise.    The French Government had already intimated theirunwillingness to discuss the option of cancellation unless it wereformally proposed to them.    They might propose to trade their consent to cancellation for revived British support for the A300Bairbus; or they might wish to continue Concorde as a Frenchproject with British firms as sub-contractors.    Any proposals ofthis kind must be treated with the greatest reserve.    Above all,however, the Governments commitment to real consultation withthe trade union movement would be gravely damaged by a decisionto cancel Concorde which gave the trade unions no opportunity tomake their views known.    Nor had adequate thought been given tothe industrial and social consequences of cancellation, which mightwell be more far-reaching than the official estimates implied.    he appreciated the considerations of public expenditure which had led the Chancellor of the Exchequer to urge that the Cabinet should notdelay a decision.    But it would be impossible to preserve theconfidentiality of such a decision in negotiation with the FrenchGovernment, and once it became known, the Government&apos;s creditwith the trade unions would be destroyed.    He accepted the LawOfficers1 reservations, as set out in C(74) 14, about having these issues examined by a Select Committee, and was prepared towithdraw this proposal; though he believed that strong pressuremight develop for such an arrangement.    But the Government mustnot appear to approach this difficult decision affecting workers&apos;livelihoods, trade union sensibilities and national feelings in anauthoritarian or uncaring way.    He therefore proposed that asmall Ministerial committee be set up to consider and cost all the 8 .
alternatives, including cancellation and its consequences, and toreceive representations from interested outside bodies;  that heshould now hold discussions with the French Government and probetheir attitude to all the available options;  and that a final cabinet decision be reached and announced, if possible by agreement withthe French Government, by early May.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER reminded his colleagues that the economic arguments for cancellation were overwhelming.Although the current estimates might be challenged in detail, theorders of magnitude were sufficiently established: it would beimpossible to avoid very heavy losses on the production, salesand operation of Concorde.    On the other side, it was important not to overestimate the effects of cancellation on employment:the cancellation of military aircraft projects in 1965, for instance,had involved a total workforce of about 28, 000, few of whom in theevent had become redundant.    There was force in the view thatthe skills of the Concorde workforce should be put to better use inthe national interest.    The social and regional consequences of cancellation, and the special measures that might be needed to dealwith the particular problems of the Bristol area, might be examined by an interdepartmental group of officials.    But thoughfurther consultation might be necessary before a final decision wasreached, the Government should not put into commission itsresponsibility for taking that decision;  and he urged his colleaguesat least to settle that cancellation was their ultimate objective.It would be dangerous to open negotiations with the FrenchGovernment without a firm end in view.    Nor need we suppose thatthe French Governments public support for the project wasmonolithic: he had reason to believe that there were strongpressures in favour of cancelling in 1964 and that these stillexisted.    He therefore suggested that he should be authorised tosay in his Budget speech that while decisions on the existingdevelopment and production programmes would remain to be taken after consultations with the French and other interested parties,the Government had decided not to authorise any additionaldevelopment or production.THE ATTORNEY GENERAL said that the Law Officers were givingurgent consideration to the extent of the United Kingdom&apos;scommitment (if any) to the French Government under the 1962Treaty and to the legal considerations that should be borne in mindin negotiating with the French Government about the concorde project, and hoped to be able to give an early Opinion.    Had thisbeen a project in which the United Kingdom alone were concerned,he would have much sympathy with the Chancellor of the Exchequersproposal for an early decision in principle; but we were in partnership with the French, and might have to pay a heavy cost for9  .
unilateral action to withdraw.    It was therefore of great importance that nothing be said publicly or in negotiations with the FrenchGovernment which could commit the Government to any particularview of the legal position or prejudice a contention which they might in due course wish to advance.    The Law Officers were likely toadvise that if the United Kingdom were to withdraw from the projectagainst the wishes of the French, the extent to which the Governmenthad explained and discussed the position with the French before reaching that decision might be a very important consideration in determining whether they were legally justified in their action: itwould therefore be imprudent for the Government to announce adecision to cancel without first having agreed all the relevant facts and explored bona fide with the French Government all the possible courses of action short of cancellation.    If in following this course the possibility of cancelling the project, or suspending work on it,were to emerge as a clear option, a refusal by the French to entertain this would work to our advantage.    But there would begrave risks in the United Kingdom starting negotiations on the basisof a unilateral decision to withdraw from the project, and he couldnot recommend such a course to his colleagues.In discussion there was general agreement that a decision about theprojecfs future must await further consultation and study.    Leadersof the trade unions concerned, and civil authorities had already expressed their desire to make representations to the Government;and it would be unacceptable to cancel the project without havingfully examined the social and economic consequences.    It might prove necessary, despite the general objections to such a course ofaction, to establish a special redundancy scheme, at a cost of some 20 million, for the workers involved, and the co-operation of thetrade unions would be essential to its success.   At the same time,the Government should beware of letting the opportunity to cancel the project slip through their fingers.    It could not be expected thatsuch a decision would be welcomed on all sides, and it would need a strong and determined effort by the Government to carry it through.    Nor would it be desirable to solve the problem of concorde at the cost of leaving the aircraft industry at its presentsize.    Rationalisation of the industry at any time was bound to bea painful process;  and in this respect there might be a realopportunity to turn the cancellation of Concorde to wider advantage.In further discussion it was suggested that the French government might decline to consider the option of cancellation unless theUnited Kingdom were prepared to consider their proposal forfurther development of the aircraft and additional orders.    In theinterests of negotiation it would hardly be possible to refuse this,and it would be important to ensure that the impression was notconveyed in the Budget statement that the Government had refused toconsider this option.    But in theory at least that option was not closedby the form of words proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer inC(74)13.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that although the current of most of the Cabinet!s discussion wastowax*ds cancelling Concorde, they agreed that it would be inappropriate to reach a definite decision at this stage.    TheSecretary of State for Industry should open discussions with theFrench Government at the earliest opportunity;  and he should be supported by legal as well as other advisers.    The Chancellor ofthe Exchequer should refer to Concorde in his Budget statement on the lines he proposed.    The Cabinet agreed not to pursue theproposal to invite a Select Committee of the House of Commons toconsider the project; but the social, industrial and regionalimplications, of cancellation, and its effect on the aircraft industry,should all be further examined before a final conclusion wasreached.    It would be convenient for these tasks to be undertaken by interdepartmental groups of officials.    These should report toa small Ministerial committee which would supervise thenegotiations, consider representations from the trade unions andother interests concerned, and prepare a report on the whole position for submission to the Cabinet by the beginning of May.The Cabinet -1. Invited the Secretary of State for Industry,in consultation with the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary and the Law Officers,to open consultations with the French government about the future of the Concorde aircraft project in the light of their discussion.2. Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinetto arrange for interdepartmental groups of officials to examine urgently the social, industrial and regional consequences of a decision to cancelConcorde, and the effect that such a decision wouldhave on the size and shape of the United Kingdomaircraft industry,3.        Agreed that a Committee of ministers should be established to supervise the negotiationswith the French Government, receive reports fromthe interdepartmental groups of officials, considerrepresentations from the trade unions and otheroutside bodies, and prepare a report on all aspectsof the project for the Cabinet by the beginning of May.4. Authorised the Chancellor of the exchequer to refer to Concorde in his Budget statement in theterms proposed in C(74) 13.5.        Took note that the Law Officers were to prepare an opinion on the matters referred to in C(74) 14.11
REPEAL OFTHE industrial relations ACTPreviousReference:CC(74) 4tliConclusionsMinute 26. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Employment (C(74) 11) on the repeal ofthe Industrial Relations Act.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that itwas of paramount importance to put the proposals in his memorandum to the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and the confederation of British Industry (CBI) on 22 March.    They didnot at any point go beyond what had been agreed between the LabourParty and the TUC.    He had discussed the provision for picketingwith the Home Secretary and he had discussed with the LordChancellor the transitional arrangements for disposing of theremaining cases before the National Industrial Relations Court.He had altered his proposals in the light of their comments andwas prepared to consult further with Ministers who had raisedpoints on his paper.    He had already had to postpone the submission of his proposals to the TUC and the CBI and a further postponement would be difficult to explain.    He hoped that he mighthave authority to send them his proposals ii..imediately.In discussion it was argued that both the transitional provisions and the provisions for picketing raised important problems that had not yet been resolved between Ministers.    The provisions forpicketing in particular ought not to be decided without discussion in Cabinet, for which there was no time at that meeting.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet did not have time for a full discussion of these issues attheir present meeting.    On the other hand the Government had suffered in 1969 through entering into discussions with the TUCwithout adequate discussion in Cabinet.    Furthermore there was always a risk that proposals put to the TUC would not remainsecret.    There was urgency in this case and he would thereforehold a meeting later that day with the Secretary of State for employment, the Lord Chancellor, the Attorney General, theLord Advocate, and the Secretaries of State for the home department, the Environment and Social Services.    The group would give authority to the Secretary of State to send the proposals to the TUC and the CBI and would report their conclusions to thefull Cabinet on 25 March.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office12
