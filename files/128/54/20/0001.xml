PARLIAMENTARY    1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in affairs the House of Commons during the following week.INCOMES \ 2.        The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary ofPOLICY State for Employment on voluntary collective bargaining in the yearahead (C(74) 59) and on the future approach to public sector pay negotiations (C(74) 58).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that in his paper on voluntary collective bargaining (C(74) 59) he reported the outcome of his discussions with the Trades.Union Congress (TUC)and the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) about collective bargaining after the abolition of statutory pay controls, and putforward his proposals for moving to voluntary arrangements.    on present plans the Order to aboHsh the pay controls would be laidearly in July and he would make a Statement to the House of Commonssaying what he expected to follow the statutory controls.   He would hope to announce at the same time the Chairman, terms of reference and date for establishing the Royal Commission on income distribution and Wealth and to give a date for the establishmentof the Conciliation and Arbitration Service.    The TUC EconomicCommittee had approved a draft statement oh the factors whichshould influence unions in pay negotiations after the return to voluntary collective bargaining.    They intended to issue thestatement on 26 June, assuming General Council agreement on that day, and it would be reported to Congress in September.    The draft statement was a highly intelligent document and was as helpful asthe Government could wish in a number of respects, including the emphasis on the limited scope for increases in consumption and theneed to concentrate on maintaining rather than increasing realincomes; the need to stick to the 12-month rule and avoid the renegotiation of existing settlements;  and the need to take accountof threshold payments already received.    The draft guidance listeda number of objectives which could increase earnings above the basic aim of maintaining real incomes.    Among these, the achievement of equal pay by the end of 1975 was a legal requirement.The objective of increasing low pay could not be disputed by theGovernment as an ultimate objective; the TUC might find this necessary in order to persuade union members generally to acceptthe rest of their guidance, though they were already thinking in termsof a minimum of  28 rather than  25.    He thought that there was agood chance that the draft would be approved by the General Councilon 26 June.    The TUC insisted that their statement should beunilateral.    They believed, he thought rightly, that their guidancewas more likely to be heeded within the union movement if it came from the movement itself and was not seen as the outcome ofcollusion with employers or the Government.    He had consideredPreviousReference:CC(74) 17thConclusions,Minute 41
issuing the Government statement as a White Paper but he sawoverriding advantage in letting the TUC document stand alone asthe single written statement of guidance to union negotiators.When he met the CBI he impressed upon them thedesirability of ensuring that whatever they said did notundermine the TUC guidance.     The first draft ofa Government statement was appended to his paper; he suggestedthat it should not be discussed at this stage in Cabinet but that ministers should let him have their comments in writing.    It wasimpossible to guarantee that the TUC guidelines would be observed.Some breaches had already been found unavoidable, for instancefor the drivers of oil tankers;  some unions had already come outin opposition to the policy and others would come under pressure to do so.    However the General Secretary of the TUC and someother union leaders were speaking in favour of the policy at unionconferences and were being well received.    He believed that thepolicy would in general be accepted and that fears of a wageexplosion after the abolition of statutory controls would proveunjustified.His other paper, on public sector pay negotiations (C(74) 58),considered the implications of the voluntary pay arrangements forthe Governments relationship with other public sector employersover pay negotiations.    The recommendations were that theGovernment should try to get Stage 3 settlements wherever possiblein current negotiations before the end of the statutory controls;that the Government should seek to avoid breaches of the 12 months&apos;rule in the autumn by the coal or electricity industries; that theGovernment should base their own approach in pay negotiations asemployer on the TUC guidance; and that the Government should carry on a close exchange of views, well in advance of each majorpay negotiation, with the nationalised industries and local authorityemployers.    For this last purpose Ministers should see the nationalised industry chairmen and local authority employers.Some confusion had arisen about the provision in the Pay Code forthreshold agreements.    The Pay. Board were adopting a rigidinterpretation by which agreements must be concluded by 21 June,and this was causing strikes and threats of industrial action.    Ifthe Pay Board could not be induced to adopt a more flexibleinterpretation it might be necessary to change the Code, though itwould seem unsatisfactory to do this so shortly before its abolition.In discussion it was agreed that the draft statement by the TUCwas satisfactory and showed that there had been a considerablechange of mood over the last few months.    It was argued, however,that since only about half the work force belonged to the tradeunions, it would be helpful if the CBI could be induced to issue
positive guidance to employers in the same sense.    This would apply particularly to middle management salaries, in which a spateof increases could otherwise be expected as soon as the paycontrols were removed.    The Government ought also to be makingcontingency plans for the possibility that the guidelines might be disregarded.    One possibility in that event might be to strengthen the proposed Royal Commission, perhaps by giving it staff fromthe Pay Board, so that it could take over the role of monitoringpay increases.    On the other hand the TUC might oppose this asthey would regard it as a step back towards the imposition of wagenorms;  an alternative might be to strengthen the monitoringfunctions of the Department of Employment.As regards public sector pay it was argued that the emphasis in thedraft TUC and Government statements on the need tb improve efficiency and unit costs would not help the Government to satisfygroups such as the hospital consultants whose productivity could notbe measured in those terms.    There might be a need here for some flexibility.    On the other hand great care must be taken to avoidopening the way to any breach of the guidance by the miners; andfor this purpose it would be essential for the Government to stickfirmly to the 12-month rule.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the negotiations with the TUC and the CBI hadbeen well handled.    The helpful speeches by trades union leaders were particularly welcome.    The Cabinet endorsed therecommendations in the two papers circulated by the Secretary ofState for Employment.    The Secretary of State should continue, inthe light, of the discussion, to pursue his talks with the TUC and the cbi with a view to the TUC guidance being issued on 26 June.    Heshould clear with the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of theExchequer the text of an interim statement to be issued by theGovernment at that stage commenting on the TUC guidance.    Asregards the substantive Government statement, of which a draft was appended to C(74) 59, Ministers should send their commentsto the Secretary of State for Employment and the Secretary of Statefor Prices and Consumer Protection should discuss with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for employment whether a passage should be included on the proposedreview of the Price Code.    The Secretary of State for employment should circulate a revised draft for clearance by Cabinet onThursday 4 July, so that the statement could be issued about 8 July,though the timing might have to be reconsidered in the light of theconference of the National Union of Mineworkers.    The chancellor and the Secretary of State for Employment should meet the nationalised industry chairmen and the Secretaries of State for the environment and Scotland should meet the local authority employersas proposed&apos;in the note attached to C(74) 58.3
