1.        The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary ofState for Northern Ireland (C(74) 64) covering a draft White paper on Northern Ireland.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said thatthe draft White Paper would be published on 4 July, subject to cabinet approval   of the draft which was before them.    The draftsummarised the developments in Northern Ireland which led to thepassing of the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973 and the setting up of the Northern Ireland Executive; gave an account ofthe circumstances which brought about the fall of the Executive;contained a section on the arrangements for financing NorthernIreland, a subject which he proposed to explain more fully in afurther paper to be published at a later date; contained a furthersection on law and order; and ended with the most importantsection, describing the proposals which would be contained in thenew Northern Ireland Constitution Bill which would shortly beintroduced.    The constitutional proposals were in accordance withthe policy approved by the Cabinet on 13 June.    legislative authority previously enjoyed by the Northern Ireland Assembly wouldbe transferred to Parliament and the Secretary of State for NorthernIreland would be accountable to Parliament.    These arrangements would have to continue while we were seeking new constitutional arrangements for Northern Ireland.    The White Paper described the proposal to hold elections to a Constitutional Convention, whichwould be required to make recommendations in the light of whichproposals could be put to Parliament.    He wished to draw theattention of the Cabinet particularly to paragraphs 44 and 45 whichdeclared the need for the people of Northern Ireland to play their full part in determining their own future, and stated three facts which must be recognised: any pattern of government in NorthernIreland must be acceptable to the United Kingdom as a whole; aspecial relationship existed between Northern Ireland and theRepublic of Ireland; and any solution in Northern Ireland must provide for some form of power sharing. \\THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that provision for the appointment of an independent chairman of theConvention was of special importance.    In order to avoid suspicionor misunderstanding it should be made clear that he would besomeone from Northern Ireland.    The Cabinet agreed that theWhite Paper should be published on 4 July as proposed.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion, and invited theSecretary of State for Northern Ireland to proceed accordingly.
2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Energy (C(74) 65) to which was attached a draft parliamentary statement announcing the Governments policy withregard to the exploitation of North Sea oil.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the ministerial Committee on Energy had invited him to submit to theCabinet for their approval a draft statement outlining theGovernments proposals in respect of North Sea oil.1    It beganby setting the proposals firmly in the context of the Labour PartyElection Manifesto, and referred to the developments in the worldenergy scene that made it essential for the Government to reach anew relationship with the oil companies.    It then outlined action under five heads:    legislation to impose an additional tax oncompanies&apos; profits from the Continental Shelf and to close variousloopholes in the rules governing existing taxation on their profits;conditions for Government participation in future licences;proposals to renegotiate existing licences to include government participation; the establishment of a British National OilCorporation (BNOC); and measures to control production and therate of depletion of North Sea oil.    The Committee had consideredthat in view of the speculation that was now developing about theGovernments intentions, it would be desirable to make this statement at the earliest opportunity.    On the other hand, he was under an obligation to consult British Petroleum before an announcement wasmade, and it would be desirable also to inform the United states administration in advance, as well as the British Gas Corporation,the National Goal Board and those major oil companies whoselicences he would hope to renegotiate.    A further factor was thatthe Secretary of State for Scotland (who was unable to be present at their discussion) was proposing to make a statement on the way in which the benefits of North Sea oil might be deployed to theadvantage of Scotland, and it was not clear that he would be readyto do so in this tiLmescale.    An early statement would add to the chances of a Parliamentary debate being demanded before the recess; and although on some grounds this would be welcome, itmight lead to difficulty in negotiation with the oil companies,particularly if the other Parties were to combine to defeat theGovernments proposals.In discussion, attention was drawn to the basis on which it was proposed that existing licences should be renegotiated.    TheGovernment had in mind a range of fiscal policies, beginning with changes in the framework of Corporation Tax which would be announced in the context of the present statement and being followed later by an Excess Revenue Tax, which would provide])astrong inducement to the companies to negotiate participation ((agreements.    But there would be serious objection to these measures
appearing purely as a device to persuade the companies to enterparticipation agreements; this would be repugnant to internationallaw and might lead to heavy claims for compensation.    It was particularly important at the present time that no pretext should begiven to the international oil companies to threaten to withdraw their stake in the North Sea on the grounds, as the conservative party had alleged during the previous Election campaign, that theLabour Party was putting forward confiscatory proposals.    On theother hand, it was suggested that both the statement of theGovernments objectives and the references to the proposed BNOCshould be made more explicit: any statement of objectives shouldnot appear to overlook the undertaking in the. Manifesto that theGovernment would move towards majority public participation onall licences.    In general, the need to conciliate the oil companies and international opinion must be carefully weighed against theimportance, on broader political grounds, of a clear and vigorousstatement of policy: this was particularly true of the Scottishaspects.    The statement should therefore fully acknowledge theinterest of Scotland and Wales in the prospective benefits from oildevelopments and in this context the terms used by the PrimeMinister in his speech in Edinburgh during the previous Electionmight well be recalled.In further discussion it was suggested that the statement as draftedwas too lengthy, particularly if it were to be accompanied by astatement by the Paymaster General on the fiscal implications,and a further statement, possibly at a later date, by the Secretaryof State for Scotland.    There would be advantage in combining allthese statements in a single White Paper.    As to the timing, therewere strong arguments in favour of making a statement at an earlydate: this was a major aspect of Government policy, on which therewas a good story to tell: the Government should not hesitate tovindicate its policies and welcome a debate for this purpose, themore so as it would be of great importance to their politicalstanding in Scotland. ITHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the proposals which the Secretary of State had outlined in his draft statement.    They considered that there wouldbe advantage in announcing the Governmenfs intentions toParliament as soon as possible, and that for this purpose a white paper should be prepared covering the proposals in general, the tax changes which would be announced at the same time, and the implications for Scotland and Wales.    This should be introduced by a short statement, which need do no more than recall the commit&quot;ment undertaken by the Government and list the five main elements of the proposals.    The White Paper should be published as early aspossible the following week; to this end it would be helpful if theCabinet could consider a draft, particularly covering the Scottish
and Welsh aspects, at their next meeting.   If this were to prove impracticable in the time available he would consider what other arrangements might be made for collective approval by Ministers.The Cabinet recognised that an early announcement would probablylead to pressure for a debate, which need not be resisted; he mighthimself wish to take part in such a debate in order to challenge the leader of the Opposition on bis party  s response to theGovernments proposals./&apos;!The Cabinet       &quot;Invited the Secretary of State for Energy, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales,to submit urgently a draft White Paper on theGovernments policy for North Sea oil, together withthe text of a short statement introducing it, asindicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up.
STATEMENT ON       3.        The Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary of StateNUCLEAR for Energy (C(74) 66) to which was attached a draft WhiteR.EACTOR POLICY    Paper on the Governments policy on nuclear reactor systems.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY recalled that theCabinet at their meeting on 13 June had approved his proposals for the choice of a nuclear reactor system, and had invited him to submit a White Paper in the light of discussions with the nuclear interests.    The decision in favour of theSteam Generating Heavy Water Reactor (SGHWR) had asexpected been most unwelcome to the National NuclearCorporation (NNC) and the General Electric Company (G.C),their major shareholder.    Sir Arnold Weinstock, the managing Director of G.C, had asked to be relieved of hisshares in the NNC; but there were indications that he might beprepared to continue as a supplier.    The Chairman of theCentral Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) was similarlyhostile to the Governments choice; though he had not sought to resign.    He was pursuing his consultations with the nuclearinterests, particularly with G.C, whose industrial commitmentand outstanding management would be of the greatest value tothe success of the SGHWR.    Meanwhile he sought the agreementof the Cabinet to making his statement during the second week ofJuly and attaching to the White Paper the report of the nuclear power Advisory Board.In discussion it was noted that the announcement of theGovernments choice, though likely to prove widely acceptable to public opinion in this country, would-be received abroad withdisappointment, particularly in the United States and France;and there would need to be careful preparation with governments concerned.    It would be advantageous to stress the extent of co-operation with Canada which would flow fromthis decision.    The CEGB, no doubt influenced by theirChairman&apos;s attitude, had suggested that the SGHWR programme was too ambitious, and were probably hoping that if it failedthey would be able to revert to orders for the Light WaterReactor (LWR).    It was further suggested that if G.C were towithdraw from the NNC, there might be a case for theGovernment increasing their present holding of 15 per cent tomajority participation in the Corporation; for the presenthowever the attempt should be made to preserve relations withGEC, whose technical competence the Government wouldcertainly not wish to impugn.    On the question of timing, itwas remarked that the Governments decision in favour of theSGHWR was now widely rumoured.    In the absence of any official statement, misleading accounts of the advice tendered to the Government were being put about, and misunderstanding of the Governments attitude might develop.    On this accountthere would be advantage in making a statement as soon aspossible; though it must be expected that this would lead to a request for a Parliamentary debate.previous reference:CC (74) 19thConclusions,Minute 5
The following comments were made on the text of the draft white Paper:-Paragraph 6Fifth sentence - It would be preferable to say that thereliability of the system and confidence in it would contribute to a good economic bargain.Paragraph 14The first sentence seemed peremptory, and should not appearto exclude the possibility of G.C exporting the LWR themselves.A preferable formulation would be that the Government havingcarefully considered the merits of the two systems had concluded that the SGHWR had clear advantages over the LWR.Paragraph 18There was great uncertainty over the risks and problems ofradioactive waste;  this paragraph should avoid any suggestion of complacency, and emphasise the importance of careful siting.Paragraph 20This paragraph might with advantage acknowledge thatdifferences of opinion had occurred but express the hope thatthe interests concerned would now support the government&apos;s policy.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe Cabinet approved the publication of the White Paper,subject to the amendments suggested in their discussion.The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary and the Lord President, should arrange for the text to be revised and published during thesecond half of the next week, following the announcement onNorth Sea oil which they had discussed under the previous item.The Cabinet -1.      Approved C(74) 66, subject to the points made by the Prime Minister in his summing up oftheir discussion.2.      Invited the Secretary of State for Energy, inconsultation with the Foreign and commonwealth secretary and the Lord President, to arrange for theWhite Paper to be published in the second half of thefollowing week.
EECRENEGOTIATION:STOCKTAKINGPreviousReference:CC(74) 16thConclusions,Minute 3 \\4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary (C(74) 61) describing the stage reached in renegotiation and covering the questionsof sovereignty and political co-operation.    The Foreign and commonwealth Secretary had also circulated (C(74) 60) acopy of his statement on 4 June to the Council of Ministers andan analysis of the attitudes of Commonwealth Governmentstowards renegotiation.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat in conducting the renegotiation of our terms of membership of the European Economic Community (e.c.)he was following closely the programme set out in the LabourParty Manifesto.    It would however be unrealistic to expectin any negotiation to achieve all the original objectives.    Atthe end of the negotiation the Government would have to decide whether the package of changes that could be agreed was suchas to make it better for the country to remain a member or towithdraw.    Renegotiation was inevitably a long process.    Itsstart had been delayed by the death of President Pompidou andthe resignation of Chancellor Brandt, and it was now clear that other e.c. Government would not be prepared to make real progress in advance of the United Kingdom General Election.It was, however, important that the Government, in presenting the subject both domestically and in Europe should emphasisetheir determination not to allow renegotiation to drag onindefinitely and to give the British people the opportunity toexpress their opinion at the end of the renegotiation.    He hadbeen dismayed at the bureaucracy of the Commission, but while some Governments shared our desire to curb thesebureaucratic excesses, the Italians welcomed Communitydirection because of their inability to manage their own affairs,and the German Government had good reasons for promoting the concept of European unity as a safeguard against a resurgence ofGerman nationalism.Renegotiation had been firmly launched by his statement to theCouncil of Ministers in Luxembourg on 4 June.    The bestprogress so far had been on matters concerning theCommonwealth and developing countries.     Commonwealthapprehensions about our membership of the Community haddiminished over the last 18 months and (partly because of highcommodity prices) there was no desire to return to traditionaltrading patterns.    The Commonwealth saw the e.c. marketas offering new opportunities and regarded the labour government as a friendly spokesman within the Community.Some important issues, in particular sugar, had still to besettled, but recent decisions indicated that the Community
might in future become less of a &quot;rich man&apos;s club&quot;.    the associated countries and those eligible for Association(including both Anglophone and Francophone African States)would shortly meet the Community in Jamaica to discussarrangements under Protocol 22 of the Treaty of Accession.The Community mandate would open new areas of the EECmarket to these countries and would not seek trade reciprocity.There were good prospects of agreement by the end of the year on a new Convention of Association.Little progress had yet been made on renegotiation of theCommunity budget.    The United Kingdom contribution was clearly inequitable but the other member states would be most reluctant to agree to changes.    A formula under which each member paid according to its ability seemed a reasonablerequest.    It would be fair, and since it would be self-correcting, would undermine the case of those other members who argued that we should become relatively more prosperousin the future.    The Commission was producing a stocktaking ofthe situation; there might be an interim report to the Councilin July but there would be no substantial negotiation before theautumn.In the regional field our aim must continue to be to safeguard our freedom to give all necessary assistance in development areas.    But given the strong competition for available invest-ment funds it was to our advantage that there should beCommunity rules governing regional aids, and we should therefore play a full part in evolving such rules.    &quot;We should avoid giving the impression that we wished to block the regional Development Fund (RDF); though the size anddistribution of the RDF could not be settled until the renegotia-tion of the b&apos;.&apos;dgetary contributions had been concluded.The Legislation Committee had embarked on a study of the role of Parliament in the context of renegotiation.    It was important to give full support to the Scrutiny Committee arrangements,which were intended to enable Parliament to give its views on community proposals before they were discussed in theCouncil of Ministers.    This need cause no embarrassment inthe Council.   All members recognised and accepted theconsensus approach; it was up to us how we chose to interpretour vital national interests.   Discussions with Councilcolleagues had revealed that the words &quot;European Union&quot;contained in the Communique of the Summit Meeting of October1972 had no practical content.    The Community was nowattempting to discover what the different member states might mean by this concept.    There was no danger to United Kingdomsovereignty from this work.    We were a party to it and could&apos;8. &apos; &apos;i ..:
control both the content and the pace.    The &quot;politicalco-operation machinery&quot; was however of great value.    Weshould consider developing it further and when the time came to judge the results of renegotiation we should need to bring theadvantages of political co-operation into the final judgment.In discussion it was argued that in pursuing their renegotiationobjectives the Government should have regard to the unpalatableterms of the Treaty of Accession and in particular the impositionon the United Kingdom of a written constitution detracting fromthe powers of Parliament.    The Treaty had been signed againstthe wishes of the majority of the British people.    On cominginto Office the Government had rightly decided against the&quot;empty chair&quot; approach, but the pressures of ongoing business and the need to preserve a good climate for renegotiation hadweakened our bargaining power.    Only the Community budgetwould be subject to any special procedure in renegotiation.By operating through the normal machinery of the community on other matters and not laying down a firm timetable for the renegotiation, other members might not consider our proposalssufficiently seriously.    Despite earlier criticisms of the &quot;own resources&quot;systern, we had not attacked as a matter of principle the right of the Community to impose taxes in the UnitedKingdom, and we could be in further difficulty by the end of theyear over Treaty provisions on capital movements.    A further questions was the possible need to amend the european communities Act.    It was for consideration as a matter of tactics whether we should now make it known that we were notprepared either to make the tariff changes due on 1 January1975 or to move to the 1975 key for the budget contribution untilsatisfactory progress had been made in renegotiation.THE PRIME MINISTER said that insufficient time remained tocarry the discussion further and suggested that the cabinet should resume it at their next meeting.        ifThe Cabinet -Agreed to resume their discussion of renegotiationon 4 July.Cabinet Office2 July 19749
