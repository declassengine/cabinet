PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS 12. MEMBERS1 OUTSIDE FINANCIAL INTERESTS 1
1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord Presidentof the Council (C(74) 35) on Members&apos; outside financial interests.THE LORD PRESIDENT said that many months of discussion betweenthe Parties in the House of Commons about the declaration andregistration of Members1 outside financial interests had resultedin agreement on the arrangements which were embodied in the draft resolutions annexed to his memorandum.    These reinforced theexisting practice of the House about disclosures of interests in debate and provided for the setting up of a register of Members1interests.    The agreement was for a voluntary register and,because of the great difficulty that had been experienced in arriving at a workable definition of what constituted a registrable financial interest, the draft resolution dealt with this in two parts: first,there was provision for registration of a specific but fairly narrowrange of interests and, secondly, there was an open-endedprovision for a Member to add to the register other interests which he thought the House might regard as relevant.    Thismatter was essentially one for decision by the House of Commonsitself, and it therefore seemed right that a free vote should beallowed.   But the Government had to make its own views clear and give a lead by tabling the necessary resolutions.   As to thequestion whether the register should be voluntary or compulsory,it would not be possible to proceed by all-Party agreement with a compulsory register; but it was now known that the great weightof opinion in the Parliamentary Labour Party was in favour of a compulsory register, and in view of this and of events which had occurred since the completion of the talks with the other Parties,he thought it better for the Government to table a resolutionproviding for a compulsory register on the lines indicated inthe Annex to his memorandum.    Proceeding in this way, it wouldbe unnecessary to produce a precise legal definition of a regjs-trable interest, and the courts would not be involved: it would befor the House itself to decide whether a Member was in breach ofthe resolutions and what the consequences should be.In discussion it was generally agreed that the issue was now urgent and that it should be left ultimately to a free vote in the House.   Itwas, however, certain to provoke intense criticism by the liason committee and the Parliamentary Labour Party if the Governmenttabled the resolutions without consultation with them.    The liason committee had discussed the subject the previous evening and hadtaken the view that this was primarily a matter for Parliament,
They had been dissuaded from preparing proposals of their own onlyon the promise that the Cabinets proposals would be put to themurgently.    It was likely that there would be a substantial majorityfor a compulsory register although a minority of Members werefirmly opposed to it.    Against this it was argued that whileconsultation with the Parliamentary Labour Party was obviouslyright, the Government must form a view and give a lead on thismatter.    In view of the strength of opinion it was clear,, however,that a Government proposal for anything less than a compulsoryregister would not get the backing of the Governments own sup-porters, and there was general agreement that the draft resolutions agreed in inter-Party discussions would haveto be amended to this end.In further discussion it was argued that the Government should,in announcing its intentions to propose - for a free vote - a compulsory register, also propose that Parliamentary journalistsshould be required to register their outfiW-einterests.    Some ofthem received retainers by outside firms, some were employed as public relations consultants, others undertook second jobs,while others were prepared to disclose the lobby sources of theirmaterial to other newspapers incognito.    It was highly desirablethat these facts should be brought to light.    On the other hand, itwas argued that while there was a clear justification for requiringelected representatives of the people to disclose publicly theinterests which might influence their judgment, no preciselycomparable justification existed for employees whose newspaperemployers happened to require their services in the Parliamentarylobby.    Moreover, the case for public registration of Members5interests had been exhaustively examined, whereas virtually no public consideration had yet been given to the position of Parliamen-tary journalists.    It might be preferable, therefore, for theGovernment not to take the initiative in proposing a registerfor Parliamentary journalists in any announcement on Members1interests but, in response to any question by a back-bencher, tomake it clear that the case for this was being considered.In continued discussion it was argued that the resolutions as draftedwere very imprecise as to what could be regarded as a registrableinterest.    In particular, the open-ended resolution 2(b) would leave irresponsible Members substantial freedom to evaderegistration of relevant interests while conscientious members would be worried into registering personal interests which mightwell be trivial and would be an unacceptable public exposure of theirprivate affairs.    To make this vague requirement compulsorywould compound the problems of the conscientious while failing to deal with the unscrupulous.    It would be better to omit thisproposal and-to strengthen both resolution 1 and resolution 2(a)
by greater definition of what constituted an interest.    In particular,it should be made clear that nominee holdings were relevant, as were benefits in kind, and that shareholdings frequently becamerelevant at a level much below that of a controlling interest.    Theessential requirement was to register the &quot;paid relationship&quot;.    Itwas also desirable to ensure that visits abroad, and major share-holdings, were recorded.    On the other hand it was argued that ayear of inter-Party discussion had demonstrated the impossibility of defining interests in a precise and fair way which would still leave it open to a Member to protect himself by registering an interest not caputured by the definition.    The growth of the public relations industry had made it almost impracticable to produce a comprehensive definition.    Excessive detail in the resolutions wouldnot be helpful; but it should be recognised that in the course of timewell-understood interpretations of the resolutions would grow up.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that the setting up of a register of Members&apos;outside financial interests was now urgently needed and that it shouldbe on a compulsory basis.    The proposal for a voluntary registerwhich had been arrived at in agreement with the other main Partieswas no longer adequate and the Government could not now recommendthis.    The issue was, however, ultimately one for the House itselfto decide; and this should be done by way of a free vote onresolutions to be tabled by the Leader of the House, whichthe House could amend as it saw fit in the light of debate.It was right for the Government to give a lead in this matter by tabling the necessary resolutions, but that should be doneonly after careful consultation with the Liaison Committee ofthe Parliamentary Labour Party,    The draft resolutions annexed to the Lord Presidents memorandum should, be modified to take account of the difficulties involved in making the register open-endedby omitting resolution 2(b) and amending resolution 1 to provide that members should declare any personal interest, whether financial orin kind, direct or indirect.    Resolution 2(a) should be amended tomake it mandatory and to require registration of a substantial aswell as a controlling financial interest, but without attempting atthis stage to quantify any limits on what should be registered.    Theproposal to establish a comparable register of Parliamentaryjournalists&apos; interests should be considered further but shouldnot be dealt with in the resolutions relating to Members&apos; interests or in any announcement about them, although in reply to questionsit could be made clear that the Government was considering theneed for such a register.    The procedure now would be for theLord President to inform the Liaison Committee that the cabinet had considered this matter and concluded that a compulsory registerwas desirable, and to invite their, views on the terms of the draft resolutions, as amended, to be tabled by the Government,.    K it then appeared that there was any substantial difference between&apos; 3 - I s
the views of the Party and of the Cabinet, the matter should bebrought back to the Cabinet for further consideration.    If however the Governments approach was substantially endorsed, any furtherconsideration of more detailed points relating to the terms of theresolution to be tabled should be dealt with as a matter of Parliamen-tary procedure by the Legislation Committee, which should take account of the points about definition of interest which had beenmade in the Cabinets discussion.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion, and invited theLord President of the Council to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office2 May 19744
