COPY NO*5CABINETNORTHERNIRELANDPreviousReference;CC(74) 11thConclusions,Minute confidential annex cc(74) 18th ConclusionsFriday 24 May 1974 at 6. 00 pmThe Cabinet had before them a note (C(74) 56) on the current situation in Northern Ireland which suggested a possible courseof action.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he and a small number of hiscolleagues had held talks earlier in the day with Mr Brian Faulkner,the Chief of the Northern Ireland Executive, Mr Gerry Fitt, deputy chief Executive, and Mr Oliver Napier, the legal member.    It was clear that the political situation was dangerous.    The UlsterWorkers Council (UWC) supported by a number of Protestantpolitical and para-military groups, were dictating the course ofevents.    They had succeeded in closing most of the factories;   shopswere allowed to Open only with their permission; they werecontrolling the distribution of fuel supplies and food, and werediscriminating against the Catholic population;  the output of thepower stations had been much reduced;  the&quot;&apos; absence of transportmeant that many Government servants were unable to get to workand this was creating particular problems over social securitypayments.    There were reports that the UWC intended within thenext few days to take over two major bakeries in Belfast.    Theauthority of the Government and of the Northern Ireland executive had been seriously undermined.    The UWC and their associatesclaimed, falsely, that their purpose was limited to securing theabandonment of the Sunning dale Agreements and the holding of freshelections to the Assembly.    In fact they were intent on destroying the Constitution and its provisions for power-sharing, and onestablishing a government of Protestant extremists.    It was essential that the Government should assert its authority, and itwas clear that unless firm action were taken quickly the NorthernIreland Executive would not survive the weekend.    The executive had urged that the Army should take over the distribution of oil andpetrol to 21 service stations, where the Northern Ireland Ministryof Commerce&apos;would be responsible for its allocation to priority users
He had undertaken to discuss this request with the Cabinet.    Servicetechnicians were available to work in the electricity power stationsif Northern Ireland labour withdrew, but it was doubtful whether theArmy personnel would be able to run the stations without the supervision of the middle management grades, who might be unwilling to continue to work.    He was not therefore proposing that action on oil and petrol should be accompanied by action at thepower stations.    Gas production in Belfast was continuing, but hadstopped in Londonderry because of the lack of certain chemicals.The Executive attached importance to improving our public relationsactivities and had suggested that he should make a broadcast.    there seemed little doubt that many Protestants were beginning to supportthe UWC because they believed that it was winning.    Any step we took to counter the UWC carried with it the risk that the situation would escalate.    The Executive believed however that if we showeddetermination from the beginning, much Protestant support would be recovered.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said thatif the Executive were to collapse it was important that the Governmentshould not be open to the charge that they were responsible for this because they had refused the request that had been put to them by theExecutive.    It was also important, however, that if we agreed tothe request, the Executive should bear their proper share ofresponsibility in carrying out the arrangements for the distributionof petrol.    He was not in favour of putting the Army specialists intothe electricity power stations at this stage but he hoped the Armycould arrange to deliver the necessary chemicals to the LondonderryGas Works.    At present the security situation was fairly quiet.    TheProvisional Wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) had beenadopting a low profile.    There was good reason to believe that they and the Official Wing were in touch with each other about jointmeasures to protect Catholic areas if violence should erupt.    Thereliability of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) was insomedoubt: west of the Barm it was very uncertain;  east of the Bann theRUC were somewhat more reHable.    There was also a good deal ofvariation from place to place in the reliability of the Ulster DefenceRegiment.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that in the past few days upwards of 1500 reinforcements had been sent to NorthernIreland.    If it were decided to take over the distribution of oil andpetrol the necessary drivers and technicians could be sent to northern Ireland quickly; but the operation would make heavy demands on the Army who would have to protect the suppHes in transit and the service stations from which they were to be distributed.    In considering this proposal he thought it important tobear in mind that we would not be able to distribute more petrol thanthe UWC were at present distributing;  and since the UWC would be2
able to increase pressure in other directions we might find that the demonstration of our will and capacity to govern was less thanconvincing.    It would not be possible for the armed forces to takeover the running of the country if the UWC secured the withdrawalof labour generally.    He wished to confirm that the Army did not expect to be able to run the electricity power stations if middlemanagement withdrew;  and although he had a substantial groupstanding by to help in the gas stations, they too would needsupervision.    We could not expect to obtain management personnel from Great Britain to take the place of the Northern Irelandpersonnel.    Finally, it was important that his colleagues should know that the Chief of the General Staff was concerned about theextent to which it was right to use troops for tasks of the kind theywere discussing, in a situation where life and limb were not directly threatened.In discussion it was suggested that intervention over petrol suppliesmight not be enough to demonstrate that it was we and the Executivewho were governing Northern Ireland.    There was a danger,therefore, that the Executive would make further successivedemands and that if, as seemed likely, we were unable to continueto meet their demands, the Executive would collapse.    There might therefore be an argument for allowing matters,to take their course and facing the possible collapse of the Executive in the expectation that the Protestant community would ultimately weary of the hardships they were suffering and would reject the UWC.    In themeantime we would stand firm on the constitutional issues andthere would be no question of our withdrawing from NorthernIreland.    It was also suggested, however, that such a policy wouldprobably lead to communal strife and this might spread to GreatBritain in view of the large numbers of Irish, from bothcommunities, living here.    This argued in favour of responding tothe Executive&apos;s request while recognising that if this action did not succeed we would be faced with further demands to which, for practical or other reasons, wc might be unable to agree.    Theimportance of keeping in touch with the Conservative opposition was also noted: it was most important to avoid a collapse of thebipartisan approach to Northern Ireland.In further discussion it was suggested that consideration should begiven to introducing financial and economic sanctions, including thefuture of Harland and Wolff.    In view of the reports that there wasdiscrimination against the Catholic community in the provision offood supplies, consideration should be given to using the Army todeHver food to the Catholics if the need arose.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Army should undertake the distribution of oil and petrol to selected service stations, and protect the stations.The Army should also deliver the necessary chemicals to the gasworks in Londonderry.    Further consideration should be given tothe use of the Army in distributing food to the Catholic community,and an immediate study of the feasibility of such action should beundertaken.    These actions were not to be taken as implying any commitment to intervene further in running the means of productionand distribution, and were to be regarded as consistent with thepolicy of maintaining the Executive in office so long as that might iibe possible, while allowing the population to experience the hard itconsequences of supporting the UWC.    The Cabinet would be called together again if necessary, but he asked them to agree that, withinthe policy they had discussed, urgent decisions could be taken bythe Ministers concerned in consultation with him.    It was nowclearly necessary to consider the various constitutional and securitycontingencies that might arise and he would be pur suing thisquestion with his colleagues.    A study of financial and economic sanctions should be completed as soon as possible.    He would givea Ministerial broadcast, probably the following evening.    It was important that the UWC should not have advance warning of theaction the Army would be taking.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2.        Agreed that within the limits of the policy they had discussed urgent deci sions. should be takenby the Ministers concerned in consultation with thePrime Minister,3,        Invited the secretary of State for Defence toissue the necessary instructions to the GOC NorthernIreland, to carry out the action which had been approved.4. Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for NorthernIreland and such other Ministers as might be necessary,to arrange for a paper to be prepared on financial andeconomic sanctions.Cabinet Office28 May 1974  -4
