1. THE PRIME MINISTER recalled that the memorandum on ,Questions of Procedure for Ministers (C(P)(74) 1) required thatall memoranda for the Cabinet and for Committees of the cabinet should be circulated at least 48 hours in advance.    There had-been a number of recent departures from this rule.    urgent matters occasionally arose where it could not be observed; butit was of the greatest importance that it should be strictly adhered to wherever possible.    Ministers must also understand that evenon urgent matters it might be impossible for the Cabinet to reach decisions if they had not had time adequately to brief themselves,particularly when there had not been interdepartmental consultationbefore a memorandum was circulated.    C(P)(74) 1 also requiredany Minister who wished to make a statement in the House ofCommons to give the Lord President advance notice.    It was essential that this rule also should be strictly observed: failure to do so might react very unfavourably on the smooth conduct ofPar liame ntary bus ine s s.2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the week following the whitsun recess.    It had not yet been decided whether 13 June should beused for further progress with the Prices Bill or for a debate onEurope.    There was a strong case on several grounds for usingthat day for a European debate, and this was the course favoured by the Opposition; the difficulty was that the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary had an engagement outside London that afternoon which it might not be easy for him to break or re-arrange.3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Social Services about the timing of legislation for the 10 Christmas bonus (C(74) 47).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said thatat  their meeting on 17 May the Social Services Committee had agreed that a  10 Christmas bonus should again be payable to pensioners this year, and that the categories of those entitled toit should be widened as compared with earlier years.    They had,however, not been able to agree on the timing of the legislation or of an announcement of the Governments intentions; in particular,it had not been settled whether the appropriate provisions should beincluded in the Bill increasing national insurance contributions with effect from April 1975, which on present plans would be receivingits Second Reading in the House of Commons before the summer recess.    She herself favoured a Bill dealing with both matters.First, the inclusion of the bonus provisions would sweeten the1
contribution increases which the Bill would be imposing.Secondly, in view of the present difficulties which were being experienced with staff in the Department of Health and social security (DHSS), it would be necessary for early consultations totake place with the Staff Side, whose wiUingness to undertake theadditional work involved in an extension of entitlement to the   10bonus must be in some doubt; the consultations would have to be started soon and there would then be a substantial risk of a leakage of the Governments plans.    These risks could be minimised if aBill were published at an early date.    Thirdly, since payment ofthe bonus would be in the week beginning 18 November the necessary legislation would have to reach the Statute Book by the beginning ofthat month at latest.    The contributions Bill might well have not got further than the Second Reading stage by. the summer recess;and it seemed unrealistic to plan on the basis of two separate Billshaving to reach the Statute Book by early November.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that from abudgetary point of view he would prefer to keep all options open for as long as possible, and therefore to provide for the  10 bonusin a separate Bill which would not be introduced until after the recess.    Moreover, since the staff of the DHSS might not be willing to co-operate in the proposed extension of entitlement tothe bonus, it seemed desirable that consultations with them shouldhave been completed before the Government gave any formalindication of their intentions.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that the   10 bonus should be provided for in aseparate Bill which would be introduced after the summer recess and which, if previous practice were adhered to, would probablycomplete all its stages in the House of Commons in a single day.This seemed the most satisfactory course presentationally; andit would have the further benefit that the Government would not be committed to widening the categories entitled to the bonus inadvance of knowing whether the co-operation of the DHSS staff would be forthcoming.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for Social Services to be guided accordingly.2
4, The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (C(74) 54) on the pay claims of nurses, teachers and post Office workers.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that his memoran-dum set out the conclusions that had been reached by the ministerial committee on Economic Policy (EC) subject to endorsement by theCabinet.    The Committee had agreed that the strength of feeling among the nurses and the merits of their case made it essentialto offer them some concession and that if this were done it wouldbe difficult to withhold similar concessions for the teachers andthe Post Office workers.    They recommended therefore that thereshould be independent pay reviews for the nurses and the teachers;the review for the nurses should be undertaken by the doctors andDentists1 Review Body (DDRB) provided that this was acceptable tothe Staff Side and the Review Body;  and the review for the teachersshould probably be done by an ad hoc body.    The Committee agreedthat the settlement for the nurses would be retrospective to the dateof the announcement of the review; they took no decision onretrospection for the teachers, but he was prepared to acceptthe advice of officials that their review also should be retrospectiveto the date of its announcement.    The Secretary of State for social services would have liked to be able to say that the DDRB would be free to recommend an interim payment for the nurses if they feltthat the situation warranted it, but the general feeling in theCommittee was that the repercussions of this would be dangerous.The Post Office workers were already negotiating and the committee agreed that they might be told that the resulting settlements could be implemented after the end of the statutory controls but not backdatedbefore that.    He would hope that the cost of this would be met by increases in the Post Office tariffs.He recognised that these recommendations of the Committee might result in a general opening up of the settlements already reached in stage 3 with serious inflationary consequences.    Nevertheless he hadnot opposed them.    He thought that the most important consideration was that there would be a better chance of getting a voluntary policyproperly launched if these three difficult public service cases were dealt with before the meeting of the Trades Union Congress (TUC)in September,    Exceptional treatment of these cases could bejustified on the grounds that before introducing new voluntaryguidelines it was necessary to correct the adverse effects of thestatutory policy on some sectors of the public service,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said thatshe had seen Lord Halsbury, the Chairman of the DDRB, who had agreed that the review of nurses1 pay should be undertaken not bythe DDRB itself but by a special panel including some women.    Inview of the decision to backdate the result of the review to the date- .   &apos;   3
of its announcement she would not now press for an interim payment.She would see the nurses1 Staff Side later in the day and would announce the review in Parliament in the afternoon,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE saidthat he would prefer to set in hand an ad hoc review of teachers&apos; paythan to offer free negotiations in the Burnham Committees.    a negotiated settlement would require an open decision1 that he wouldnot use his veto, whereas he need express no opinion on the resultsof an ad hoc review until they came to the Burnham Committees for formal approval.    A review would be more likely to meet the needfor an adequate pay structure for career teachers.    He proposed tomeet the teachers&apos; unions the following day and to announce the review in a Written Parliamentary Answer the same afternoon.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that he agreed with the Secretary of State for Education and Science.    He would favour a single ad hoc review body to cover Scotland as weU as england and Wales.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that he agreedthat the Post Office unions must be made to recognise the effect oftheir pay claims on tariff increases. He proposed to meet themthat afternoon and in spite of the embarrassment that might resultin his relations with them he would agree to defer any public announcement for the time being, so that the three announcementsshould not come too closely together.In discussion It was argued that the retrospective implementation of the nurses&apos; review combined with the payments resulting fromthe triggering of the threshold agreements could produce a pay increase for the nurses of about 30 per cent.    The figure for the teachers would be similar.    If these figures were taken as settinga pattern for future pay increases the consequences for prices wouldbe extremely serious.    On the other hand it was argued that thoughthe Government could not give directions to the review bodies, the review bodies could be relied on to take account of all relevant factors; and although the threshold agreements which were availableto all were not strictly relevant to questions of relativities, it was likely that they would in practice be taken into account.    The aimmust be to try to establish the principle that pay claims in the nextwage round would take account of the threshold payments made inthe current wage round, so that unions would not expect to be compensated twice for the same price increases.    In any casethe best hope of persuading the trade union movement to acquiesce in exceptional treatment for nurses and teachers seemed to lie indisposing of these cases in the interval between the end of thestatutory pay pqHcy and the meeting of the TUC in September,4
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the conclusions of the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Policy.    The settlements for nurses and teachers shouldtake effect from the dates of the announcement of the reviews;  andthe settlement for the Post Office workers should be implementedafter the end of the statutory controls.    The review for the teachersshould be undertaken by a single ad hoc body covering England,Scotland and Wales.    The Cabinet agreed that the secretaries of State for Social Services, for Education and Science and for industry should make separate announcements as they proposed.The Ministers responsible for relations with the pay review bodiesshould do anything they could to ensure that uvtheir recommendations the review bodies would take adequate account of the payments madeunder threshold agreements.The Cabinet -1. Endorsed the conclusions of the ministerial committee on Economic Policy.; .. I1 -2.        Invited the Secretaries of State for social services, for Industry and for Edcuation and science to make separate announcements onthe lines that they had proposed.5.

Their discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded separately.7, The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord Presidentof the Council (C(74) 53) to which was attached a note by the Ministerof State, Civil Service Department, making proposals for an improvedpay offer for Government scientists.THE MINISTER OF STATE, CIVIL SERVICE DEPARTMENT, saidthat the method of determining scientists&apos; pay had been in dispute between the Official Side and the Institution of Professional CivilServants (IPCS) since 1971.    Their prolonged negotiations had been interrupted by the statutory incomes policy, and scientists&apos; pay had fallen badly behind.    The scientists were angry and had startedindustrial action.    In April 1974 a report by the Pay Board, that both sides were committed to accept, recommended that scientists1pay in future should be determined by pay research rather than by internal Civil Service relativities.    Since it would not be possibleto mount a pay research survey before 1 January 1976, the cabinet had agreed on 2 May that the scientists should be given a pay settlement outside Stage 3 by means of a consent.The IPCS Conference in their militant mood would have rejectedany proposal that was put to them, but now that the Conference was over he thought that it should be possible to produce an offer thatwould be accepted.    The proposal in his paper was to add an extra 150 increment to the top of the scale for Higher Scientific Officers;to shorten the scale for Scientific Officers by one point;  and toimprove the rate of progression for Assistant Scientific Officersby splitting their scale.    These proposals, although less than theIPCS had claimed, would probably be enough to settle the dispute;and although they did not result directly from any pay researchevidence he thought that they could be justified as an interimsettlement broadly based on the Pay Board&apos;s report.6
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that the scientists had suffered badly as a resultof the successive stages of the incomes policy, and accepted theproposals in the paper by the Minister of State, Civil service department.The Cabinet -  jjTook note with approval of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister and invited theLord President of the Council to proceed accordingly.7
8. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Lord Chancellor(C(74) 48) and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C(74) 55), and a noteby the Secretary of State for Industry (C(74) 51) about the future of the concorde aircraft project.    They also had before them a note by the attorney General (C(74) 46) to which were attached the Opinion of theLaw Officers on the consequences of unilateral withdrawal from the project and a memorandum on the question of damages,THE LORD CHANCELLOR recalled that the Cabinet at their discussion on 21 March had agreed that a Committee of Ministers should be formed to examine all the issues relevant to the future of the project.Discussions with the French Government had been interrupted by the calling of the French Presidential Election, but the new Governmentcould be expected to be ready to resume the talks early in June,Before then we should establish our own view of the project anddefine our objectives.    The realistic choice lay between stoppingentirely and continuing with the programme to complete 16 aircraft,whose construction was already well advanced: the financial benefit from completing fewer than 16 would at this stage be outweighed bythe political disadvantages;  on the other hand, for five of the 16aircraft there were still no orders, and there was consequentlyno sound reason for building any more.    In their deliberationsthe Committee had taken account of a number of factors.Cancellation would make about 13,400 jobs redundant, and they recommended that in this event there should be a special redundancyscheme, and other measures of assistance.    The effect of cancellation on the aircraft industry as a whole was not likelyto be significant; but cancellation was strongly opposed by thetrade unions, particularly the Confederation of Shipbuilding and engineering Unions (CSEU),    Once production had ceased it wouldbe extremely difficult to restart the programme.    The effect of either choice on the balance of payments was not likely to be crucial;but British Airways (BA) insisted that they could only operateConcorde at a considerable loss, though they admitted that their estimate of  110 million over ten years had a widemargin of uncertainty; there was also the risk that Concorde might stillbe refused permission to land at New York, Tokyo or Sydney,or to overfly countries super sonically.    The Law Officers hadtaken the view that the arguments in favour of cancellation werestronger now than in 1964, when a number of factors relating tothe aircrafts marketability were still unclear; though theyacknowledged that the French could argue that marketabilitycould only be proved when the aircraft had entered service.The Foreign and Commonwealth Office had drawn attentionto the damaging implications of a unilateral decision on our part to withdraw from the project.    The cost of completing the programme of 16 aircraft was estimated at  361 million,or  400 million if only 11 aircraft were sold; the cost of cancellation would be  120 million, with the possibility of
a further  150 million if maximum damages were to be awardedagainst us.    On the whole, the balance of opinion in the Committee  ,would prefer the project to be cancelled, provided that the agreementof the French Government, however reluctant, could be secured.But if the French Government were determined to continue, the damage in political terms, to say nothing of possible financialdamages, could be so great as to make cancellation decidedlyunattractive.    In those circumstances the Committee consideredthat we should complete 16 aircraft.    Accordingly he recommendedthat his colleagues should take an early opportunity of exploring thenew French Governments views about the project and their attitude to the question of cancellation, and should then review the positionand make their decision.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that it was now generally accepted that Concorde should never have been started,and that it would be convenient if the project could now be stoppedwithout unpleasant and expensive consequences; but M Giscardd&apos;Estaing&apos;s statement in the election campaign had made it clearthat such a course would not be acceptable to the new FrenchGovernment.    The United Kingdom had how spent   545 million on Concorde and the cost of cancellation, plus damages, could bring the amount to over  800 million, for which there wouldbe nothing whatever to show.    On the other hand, to complete the 16 aircraft might cost only a further  90 million spread over five years,    Concorde was unquestionably a supreme technologicalachievement, and the only project in which we could justifiably claimto have beaten the rest of the world.    Although it had originally beenwished on Bristol by the Government of the day, half a generation ofthe highest engineering skills had now been lavished on it, and experience elsewhere suggested that if it were now stopped theseskills would not easily be reabsorbed.    All new technologies werecostly to launch, but supersonic travel was here to stay; provingflights for Concorde were already being arranged, and there wasa real possibility of further orders - Iranair was already seriouslyinterested.    The cancellation of Concorde would gravely damage boththe reputation of British engineering and our credibility as a reliablepartner in collaborative ventures; it would flatly rebuff the advice ofthe Trades Union Congress and the CSEU.    The sudden rupture of so large a programme would have no parallel in British industrialexperience;  it would impose a severe psychological shock on thecountry at large, and the political repercussions, both in bristol and more widely^ might be difficult to contain: the example ofUpper Clyde Shipbuilders should not be forgotten.    Above all,common sense demanded that a programme which was so nearlycompleted should be finished.    He accepted that the final decision must be taken by the Cabinet; but he must warn his colleague s thatif we were to withdraw from the project and the French were to bring their part of it to completion, it might prove difficult for theGovernment to overcome the reproach of having thrown awayfor nothing the product of so much effort and expense over so many years.
THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he sympathisedwith many of the Secretary of State for Industry&apos;s arguments, whichhad indeed been advanced in 1965 over the cancellation of the TSR2;but the economic case against proceeding with Concorde was asstrong as ever, and the essential question - which lay at the rootof so many of our unsuccessful ventures - was whether the economic arguments should be given due weight or relegated to the background.To complete 16 aircraft would cost at least  361 million - nearly 100 million more than the total of the cancellation cbsts and themaximum damages that might be awarded against us if the french were to take us to court and succeed in their claim.    The LawOfficers had however advised that even if the French took us to court we would have a reasonable prospect of winning; and on this assumption, it would cost  245 million more to complete theprogramme than to stop it.    To continue would only postpone the day when the loss of jobs and the other industrial consequencesmust be faced;  and there would be renewed pressure from theFrench as well as from the British interests to build more aircraft and, eventually, to develop a second generation model to recoup the losses of the first.    If the aircraft industry were to be nationalised,as had been proposed, it would be a most inauspicious start to saddleit with a project which had been publicly demonstrated to be grosslyuneconomic.    Public expenditure in the next few years would be under severe constraint, and when the Government came to settletheir social priorities there would inevitably be acute competition for such resources as were available; it would be dangerous if inthese matters they were to subordinate their judgment to the opinions of the trade unions.    The funds devoted to Concordecould have a major impact on the housing programme or other services that commanded a high priority in the Governmentssocial strategy.    He therefore urged his colleagues to accept that our aim should be to cancel the project, -and that this shouldbe proposed to the French Government.    If the French were notto agree, we should still be prepared to cancel unilaterally, in theknowledge that our legal position was reasonably secure.In discussion there was a wide measure of agreement that thepreferable course would be to cancel the project.    But it was urged that in the pursuit of cancellation the interests of the aircraft industry, especially the fate of other collaborative projects, our general relations with the French Government, and the interestsof those employed on the project must not be overlooked.    It was argued that the cost of rupturing the programme unilaterally mightwell be so high as to make completion of the 16 aircraft the better course: though it was recognised that this might only defer thewinding up of the programme, it would allow time for properarrangements to be made for the welfare of the workers.   further orders, however, might arrive: the VC10 was an example where theairlines1 initial lack of interest had been decisively repudiated by the
passenger response - too late, however, for production to takeadvantage of it.    Iranair was showing keen interest in Concorde,and our Ambassador&apos;s view was that if we continued with the projectthey would be ready to order two aircraft.    If this ordermaterialised, it would tend to support the French contentionagainst cancellation, that the aircraft could not as yet be provedunmarketable.    The possibility must also be considered that evenif we were to withdraw from the programme, the French might continue it and put the aircraft into service: it would be better to continue the programme rather than accept such a humiliation.On the other hand it was pointed out that the extent of Concorde&apos;spassenger appeal would be seriously affected if its landing siteswere restricted and it was not allowed to overfly countriessupersonically.    The analogy with the VC10 should not be pressedtoo far, since the VC10 was essentially an improved version of an aircraft type - the Boeing 707 - already widely in service, ratherthan the pioneer of a new generation; and if Concorde had to wait for further orders as long as the VC10 had done, an enormousinvestment in aircraft for stock would have to be committed.Nor should it be forgotten that the huge expenditure incurred on the Concorde programme, which would involve a continuingsubsidy of BA, would in effect be devoted to enabling a fewprivileged passengers to fly faster at the taxpayers&apos; expense:such a wasteful use of scarce resources might well be regardedas uncharacteristic of a socialist Administration.    The new french president himself had always been a sceptic about the Concordeprogramme, and was now likely to find himself under severebudgetary constraint in attempting to satisfy his electoral promises.This might therefore be as favourable an opportunity as any to open discussions with the French Government on the possibility ofcancelling Concorde.On the question of negotiations it was suggested that if the proposalto cancel the project was to have any chance of succeeding, theFrench Government must be convinced that this was our realobjective, and not simply a tactical manoeuvre designed to secure a compromise on the production of 16 aircraft.    The negotiatingbrief for these discussions would need to be drawn up with great care, and it was desirable, since it would inevitably raise questionsof wide political importance, that it should be approved by theCabinet,    In this connection, it would be inadvisable to proceedimmediately with the publication of BA&apos;s appraisal, since thiswould be likely to be represented by the French as prejudicing the aircraft&apos;s prospects.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe Cabinet endorsed the conclusions of the Ministerial Committee,that it would be preferable for the project to be cancelled if the
consent of the French Government - however reluctant - could besecured; but that if they did not consent, we should not withdrawunilaterally from the project but should complete the programme to build 16 aircraft.    They agreed that the next step would be to explore the views of the French Government.    In doing this, itwould be necessary to make it clear that in our view there werecompelling arguments in favour of cancellation, but not to imply that we were determined at all costs to withdraw.    The cabinet would wish to consider the outcome of these discussions before reaching a final decision.    The Secretary of State for industry should prepare a negotiating brief accordingly, consulting theLord Chancellor, the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary,the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Attorney General, and submit it to the Cabinet for approval.    Pending the discussions with the French Government no action should be taken to publish3A&apos;s appraisal of the project.The Cabinet -L Approved C(74) 48.2, Invited the Secretary of State for Industry toprepare a negotiating brief for discussions with theFrench Government, as indicated by the PrimeMinister in his summing up, and to circulate it for their approval.   r3. Invited the Secretary of State for Tradeto defer for the time being the publication of british airways&apos; appraisal of Concorde&apos;s operating costs.
9.        The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the rules which should govern the political activities of Special Advisers.They had before them a memorandum by the Lord President ofthe Council (C(74) 50).THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that at their previous meeting the Cabinet had agreed that it would in principlebe desirable to remove the inhibitions on Special Advisers taking part in political activities solely because they were paid from public funds, while maintaining sufficient defences against a conflict of interests; and he had been invited to circulate a memorandumexamining the matter in greater detail from that point of view.So far as parliamentary candidature was concerned, the effect ofthe Servants of The Crown (Parliamentary Candidature) Order I960was that civil servants, including Special Advisers paid from public funds, were required to resign on being adopted as parliamentarycandidates.    It would, however, be possible to amend the Orderso as to make an exception in favour of Special Advisers.    TheOrder would not be subject to parliamentary control but it would nodoubt be desirable to draw the attention of Parliament to what was proposed.    It would also be necessary to explain the situation to theStaff Side, who would not necessarily react favourably.    As regardsmembership of a local authority, the present position was that itwas within the discretion allowed to Departments to permit SpecialAdvisers to serve on local authorities.    The decision should betaken in each case by the Minister concerned, who would have toaccept responsibility for ensuring that no question of conflict aroseeither with the policies for which he was responsible or with thoseof his colleagues.    It would be desirable to lay down certain rules -for example, that a Special Adviser should not speak publicly or inthe council on matters for which his Minister had responsibility,nor serve on any committee considering such matters; he shouldalso observe great discretion in relation to policies for which other ministers were responsible and should not prematurely disclose tothe council any information obtained in the course of his officialduties.    So far as a Peer was concerned, there was no reason why he should not act as a Special Adviser provided that he did not speakor vote in the House of Lords on matters of Party political controversy without the permission of his Minister,    It thereforeappeared that there was no insuperable obstacle to the relaxation ofthe rules covering the political activities of special advisers; buthe would propose to discuss the matter with the Opposition before any changes were announced.The Cabinet -Approved the proposals in C(74) 50 and invited the Lord President of the Council to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office23 May 197413
1974[PRATINGSOCIAL&apos;SECURITYBENEFITSI previous reference:fcc(74) 14thConclusions,minute copy no cabinet confidential annex cc(74) 17th Conclusions, Minute 5Thursday 23 May 1974 at 10.15 am the Cabinet had before them a minute from the Secretary ofState for Social Services to the, Prime Minister dated 21 May about a revised offer which might be made to the Staff Side of the Departmentof Health and Social Security (DHSS) to induce them to undertake theadditional work arising from the uprating of pensions, due to take effect on 22 July.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that theCabinet had agreed at their previous discussion that, in addition toovertime payments, a leave bonus should be offered to the staffinvolved in the work of uprating pensions and other benefits, in recognition of the additional effort required to complete the work by 22 July.    The Civil and Public Services Association (CPSA), whorepresented the majority of the staff involved, had fallen into thehands of militants.    Their Executive had rejected the offer andwere continuing to ban work on the uprating, even in normal hours.From the following week some pensioners would be without pensionbooks and although the Post Office might be instructed to paypensions on the stubs of the old books, there was no certainty that their staff would undertake this without some payment.    Itwas impracticable for the Post Office to handle claims for supplementary or sickness benefit, and these would fall tobe dealt with by the social service departments of local authorities,many of whom were incapable of handling this work.    This serious situation demanded a revised offer.    She proposed to offer a leavebonus of one day for every 25 hours of overtime, up to a total of four days&apos; leave, with the pro vis1 o that staff who preferred to havea day&apos;s pay instead of a day&apos;s leave might receive this again up tothe maximum of four days.    This proposal had the backing ofMr Murray, the General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress(TUC), who had done his best to curb the militant element in theCPSA;  it would also be acceptable to the Society of Civil Servants,whose members were also involved.    Although an improvement onthe earlier offer, it was considerably less than the initial union
demand for a cash bonus to everyone in the Department, whether directly associated with the pension payments or not.    A majorconfrontation with the staff would undoubtedly mean a lengthypostponement of uprating of pension payments, disruption ofthe supplementary benefits service and risked forfeiting the goodwill of the TUC and the general public.    If she tookdisciplinary action against those refusing to handle pensionuprating in normal hours there might be a general spread ofindustrial action in the Civil Service.    In these circumstances,the compromise she proposed was, in her view, inescapable.THE MINISTER OF STATE, CIVIL SERVICE DEPARTMENT, saidthat it was a cardinal principle of handling Civil Service pay thatsettlements should be achieved nationally in negotiations betweenthe staff associations and the Official Side, based on fair comparisonsand backed by the findings of the Pay Research Unit.    If it becamenormal practice for Departmental staff, who were dissatisfied with national agreements, to press claims for special treatment with their departmental Minister this would undermine the basis of nationalsettlements and cause many similar cases to that of DHSS to bebrought to other Ministers and ultimately before the Cabinet,The overtime payments now in force for the Civil Service borecomparison with those in industry; time and a half was paid forthe first 18 hours, and double time thereafter and for any overtimeon Saturdays and Sundays.    By agreeing to a bonus in addition,whether in the form of leave or pay, the Government would bepaying twice over.    The principle of a special allowance had however already been conceded by the Cabinet and he was readyto agree to the revised offer of the leave bonus, but he strongly opposed the suggestion that payment might be taken in lieu of thisleave.In discussion, it was pointed out that a prolonged confrontation,leading to an increasing number of pensioaers being without pensionbooks, and the postponement of the payment of the higher rate ofpension, could have the most severe consequences for theGovernment, particularly if it remained unresolved at a timeotherwise favourable for holding a General Election.    By agreeingin principle to a leave bonus the Government had already concededthat they were prepared to pay twice, and the uprating of pensionsagainst a tight timetable could be regarded as a unique case.    If a straight option of leave or cash was repugnant, there was merit in adopting a compromise which would allow a cash payment if the bonus leave had not been taken within sis months.    Payment in lieu of leave which would otherwise have been forgone was a practice already followed elsewhere, for example in the police.
On the other hand, it was strongly argued that to offer any concession involving cash payments would have repercussions on other civil servants who were required to work prolongedovertime in a variety of circumstances.    Those in NorthernIreland, for example, had to work long hours in very arduousconditions; Ministry of Defence civil servants in this countryalso had to work prolonged overtime associated with the NorthernIreland emergency; the staff of the Inland Revenue and of customs and Excise would claim similar treatment if revisions of taxationrequired overtime work.    Prison and immigration staff might seek to press their claims.    To concede a cash payment would thereforeopen up the prospect of wide repercussions, as well as demons-   jitrating that a militant minority could wring concessions from theGovernment.    The Government was already accused of giving waytoo readily to militant unions, and this was a good opportunity toshow support for the moderates.    If it could be made clear to thepublic that the payment of pensions was being held up by theindustrial action of civil servants, public sympathy for the pensioners might force the CPSA to settle.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that,although they fully appreciated the danger that the continuation of industrial action could disrupt the payment of pensions, andmight even spread, the majority of the Cabinet felt that to offercash in lieu of the leave bonus would have grave repercussionselsewhere in the public service.    The Secretary of State for social services should therefore ensure, when her officials met the DHSSStaff Side later that day, that the offer should be confined to a leavebonus of one day for every 25 hours of overtime worked inconnection with the pensions uprating, with a maximum of four days&apos; leave.    No prospect of any cash concession shouldbe held out; it was important to strengthen the moderate elementamongst the staff against their militant colleagues.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for Social Services to be guided accordingly.
0COP(salariesIeviewJODYMrdnterimeportpreviousfleference:C(74) 16thConclusions,Pinute 6COPY NO     gCABINETCONFIDENTIAL ANNEXiiCC(74) 17th Conclusions, Minute 6Thursday 23 May 1974 at 10.15 am the Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord President of theCouncil (C(74) 52) about the recommendations regarding thresholdarrangements in the third interim report of the Top Salaries review body (TSRB), and the timing of an announcement of the Governmentsdecisions on the report,THE MINISTER OF STATE, CIVIL SERVICE DEPARTMENT, saidthat threshold arrangements had been recommended by the TSRB andalso by the Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Review Body (DDRB), whose report had now been received.    At Cabinet on 16 May it had been suggestedthat, in order to avoid anomalies in the Civil Service, thresholdarrangements might be allowed for those with salaries of up to 10, 000 a year but not for those above that level.    It was howeverdifficult to construct any satisfactory half-way house, particularlyin the case of the doctors.    The TSRB recommendation on thresholdarrangements had been described during the previous cabinet discussion as derisory, but this could be regarded as an argument in favour of acceptance rather than rejection.    If the Governmentwere to reject the recommendation of a Review Body on a minormatter, this would call in question the status of the Review Bodies,and might even possibly lead to resignations from them.THE LORD PRESIDENT said that the arguments against givingthreshold arrangements to the higher-paid were strongj but theCabinet would also wish to consider the arguments rehearsed inC(74) 52.    On the question of timing, it would seem better to make an announcement now rather than to leave it until after the statutorypay controls had been dismantled.    Whatever conclusion was reached on threshold arrangements, he recommended that the Governmentshould publish the TSRB report and announce their decision on it immediately.1
In discussion it was argued that it was undesirable that higher-paidgroups should receive pay awards under an automatic system whenother groups had to fight to achieve theirs.    Even if it might now benecessary to publish the present TSRB report, the accompanyingGovernment statement should be designed to avoid repercussionselsewhere, and it should indicate that the whole system by whichthe pay of higher-paid groups was determined would be consideredby the Royal Commission on Incomes Distribution when it was setup.    Meanwhile, the rejection of threshold arrangements for thoseearning over  10, 000 a year would at least be a gesture to show thatthe achievement of greater social equality remained a fundamentalGovernment objective.    However, it was also necessary to adopt    ja coherent approach towards the achievement of that objective.There did not appear to be any satisfactory way of limiting thresholdarrangements by reference to a particular cut-off level.     Thiswould, for example, penalise whole-time hospital consultants ascompared with part-time consultants, which would run counter tothe general policy for the hospital service.    After tax, the thresholdarrangements would give only a small net benefit to higher-paidgroups, and the anomalies created by their rejection would impose a permanent penalty on those retiring on pension.    Moreover, theDDRB had taken the threshold arrangements into account in framingtheir recommendations about the basic pay increases for doctors and dentists.    If the threshold recommendation were rejected, the doctors and dentists would fall behind, and it would appear incon-sistent to do this and then expect threshold arrangements to be takeninto account in determining the appropriate pay increase for nurses.It would also be difficult to announce that nurses1 pay was to be thesubject of independent review at the same time as interfering with a recommendation of an independent Review Body.    It might thereforebe better to accept the recommendations for threshold arrangements,but to make this one of the reasons for referring the whole matter tothe Royal Commission on Income Distribution.On the other hand, it was argued that we were at present in a difficult period of transition from statutory to voluntary payarrangements.    The discussion of the nature of the voluntary arrangements would be extremely delicate, and it was vital toavoid anything which would make this process more difficult.During this period, some anomalies might need to be temporarilyaccepted, as frequently happened in other fields of employment.Threshold arrangements were designed to help the low-paid, andit was undesirable to allow them to spread to higher-paid groups.The Royal Commission on Income Distribution must be seen to bean effective part of the new policy on incomes, and it should be askedto look at the whole question of high salaries.    This examination should however not be limited to the public service but should extendalso to salaries paid in the private sector.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theGovernments decision must reflect their general objective of greater social equality.    The Royal Commission on income distribution must be seen to be an effective instrument in the pursuit of this objective?  and it would be an essential element inthe new voluntary pay arrangements which the Secretary of Statefor Employment was at present seeking to promote.    In themeantime, the Government must avoid any step which would hinderhis achievement of this difficult task.    The recommendationsconcerning threshold agreements, both in the third interim reportof the TSRB and in the report now submitted by the DDRB, should therefore be rejected.    The other recommendations in the TSRBthird interim report should be accepted; the report should now bepublished, and the Governments decision on it announced, as soonas possible.    In announcing the decision, account should be taken of the presentational points mentioned during the cabinets discussion.    Further study should be given to the problem of theeffect on pensions of pay anomalies arising from the rejection ofthe recommendation of threshold arrangements.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the summing up cf their discussion by the Prime Minister.2.        Invited the Lord President and the Ministerof State, Civil Service Department -i. to publish the third interim reportof the Top Salaries Review Body, and to announce that the Government- wouldimplement its recommendations except forthe recommendation concerning thresholdarrangements; I!ii. to examine the problem of the effecton pensions of pay anomalies arising fromthe rejection of the recommendation   [\    /concerning threshold arrangements.Cabinet Office28 May 19743
