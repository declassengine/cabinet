The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (C(74) 63) on the rescheduling of Chile&apos;s external debt.THE PAYMASTER GENERAL said that Chile had defaulted on herexternal debt in 1971, and in 1972 debts falling due up to the endof that year were rescheduled in agreement with ChileS Westerncreditors, including the United Kingdom.    Chile again defaultedand a number of the Western creditors, known as the Paris Club, had reached a multilateral agreement this year on the basis on whichChileS debt repayments for 1973 and 1974 might be rescheduled.The multilateral agreement would be implemented through bilateral agreements between Chile and individual creditor countries.Negotiations between the Export Credit Guarantees Department(ECGD), and the Central Bank of Chile on a bilateral agreement had reached an advanced stage.    He now sought the agreement ofthe Cabinet to the conclusion of this agreement.    A number of questions had been asked by his colleagues about this agreement.He therefore wished to explain that rescheduling did not amount toa new loan: it was an arrangement to enable creditors to get their money, which in the absence of rescheduling would not be paid.The terms were related to the ability of the debtor country to pay and on this the Paris Club received advice from the international monetary Fund.    Under the 1972 arrangements 70 per cent of the debts were rescheduled; in discussions with President AlendessGovernment in 1973 we had offered ; to reschedule 90 per cent ofthe debts, but these discussions had not been concluded when thatGovernment fell; the current negotiations provided for 80 per centrescheduling.    It had been asked whether rescheduling would helpChile to pay for the warships being supplied by this country.    the contract for the warships provided for cash progress paymentsamounting to  7.6 million, and for loans covered by ECGD andamounting to  33. 2 million which covered the rest of the purchase price.    Repayment of the loans was spread over the period 1973-.1980.    The cash progress payments were not covered byrescheduling and Chile had not defaulted on them.    Ownership ofthe warships had passed to Chile when the first cash progresspayment was made.    The loan repayments due for 1973 and 1974,amounting to  7. 2 million, would be covered by the reschedulingarrangements.    They represented rather less than one-third ofthe total of  25 million debt covered by the arrangements.    At themeeting of the Paris Club the chairman had proposed that in reaching bilateral agreements with Chile member countries should ,make clear their views on the need for the restoration of human rights in Chile, and the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had agreed that we should do this.1
THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theSocialist International had called upon Governments to link theconclusion of bilateral negotiations with Chile with the restorationof human rights there.    Since coming into office the Governmenthad played a leading part in pressing the Government of Chile on human rights.    It was on our initiative that the Economic and social Council of the United Nations had agreed in May torepresentations to the Chilean Junta.    In the same month, and again on our initiative, the members of the European economic community had agreed to intervene with the Junta on behalf of9 persons who were under sentence of death; but this interventionhad proved unnecessary since the death sentences had beencommuted.    Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador had, on instructions,made strong representations to the Chilean Government: in june the Ambassador had delivered a Note to the Chilean ForeignMinister, and we had not accepted the Chilean objection that wewere attempting to intervene in their domestic affairs.    Althoughit could not be proved that this pressure had led to some improve-ment, it was a matter of fact that executions had stopped, deathsentences had been commuted and a number of people had been released, including the former President of the Chilean RadicalParty who had been freed from confinement on Dawson Island andallowed to return to bis practice as a lawyer.    We would continueto press the Chilean Government.In discussion it was claimed that the proposed bilateral agreement would cause much concern among the Government1 s supporters.Many of the latter had been much disturbed that we had notfrustrated the sale of the warships: and whatever the technicalitiesit would now appear that this sale had itself increased Chile&apos;s debt and that rescheduling of the latter was necessary to allow Chile topay for them.    We should therefore examine whether, ifrescheduling did not take place and the Chileans failed inconsequence to make loan repayments on the warships, we wouldhave   grounds for preventing the removal of the ships.    Alternativelywe should tell the Chilean Government that rescheduling would not beagreed unless they restored human rights in full.    It was pointedout however that the advantage to Chile lay in the multilateral natureof the agreements to reschedule debts.    The United States hadalready concluded an agreement and a number of other countries were proposing to do so.    This would be sufficient to establishChilean creditworthiness.    A unilateral decision by us to refuse toreschedule, or to impose such political conditions as would leadChile to refuse our bilateral agreement, would have as its only result that our creditors would not get paid.    Chile would suffer nodisadvantage.    The warships belonged to them; and there were no grounds on which we could recover them legally.    Chilean crewswere already on board some of the ships and entitled to take them
away at any time, so we would be obliged to take the vessels by force; and if we were to do that, the Chileans could sue for thereturn of payments already made and could take us to theInternational Court.    It seemed likely that the pressure we had brought to bear on Chile by other means had contributed to some improvement in the situation in that country; if we refused toreschedule the debts or if we sought to interfere with the warshipsour ability to influence the Junta would be ended.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the,first consideration must be to improve the lot of the Junta&apos;svictims and to help towards the restoration of human rights inChile.    At the recent meeting of the Socialist International theexiled Secretary General of the Chilean Radical Party had been veryappreciative of our efforts.    We would continue to put pressure onthe Junta.    The Cabinet recognised the strength of feeling aboutthe warships, and this to some extent coloured the prssentdiscussion about rescheduling.    A decision on the warships had however been taken and it was clear that a negative attitude on our part towards rescheduHng the debt did not offer a means ofrecovering the ships.    Rescheduling was in our interest, ascreditors, and the bilateral agreement should be concluded.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office9 July 1974I]i3
