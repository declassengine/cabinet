PARLIAMENTARY    1. THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet would wish toAFFAIRS congratulate the Ministers who had spoken in the previous day&apos;debate about the economic situation on the successful outcome.BeaverbrookNewspapersLimitedThe Cabinet considered the best method for informing Parliamentof the present position in relation to the intention of BeaverbrookNewspapers Limited to cease publication in Scotland at the end ofMarch.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that although there were longer term questions which would needattention, the immediate issue was the prospect of early closureand the loss of jobs which would thus be caused.    Private NoticeQuestions would no doubt be put down and would probably beaccepted by the Speaker; but it would be preferable that a very early Ministerial statement should be volunteered.    It should bemade in the House of Commons by the Secretary of State for Tradeand its terms should be agreed with the Secretaries of State for employment, for Prices and Consumer Protection and for Scotland,and with himself.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for Trade to be guided accordingly.discussions with THETRADES UNIONCONGRESS2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Employment (C(74) 7) on the handling of the discussions with the Trades Union Congress (TUC).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the tuc were ready to have a top-level meeting with the Government.In order to avoid an adverse reaction, the Government should nottry to concentrate at the meeting on the search for a voluntaryincomes policy but should discuss the whole range of government policies and priorities and the views now expressed in the TUCsEconomic Review.    The meeting should aim to reach a generalagreement on the Governments social and economic approach,leaving the detailed discussions on specific elements of the social contract to individual contacts between the TUC and the ministers responsible.    Within that context he would arrange separateinformal meetings with the TUC on the establishment of voluntary1
arrangements for pay*    Meanwhile he would like to proceedurgently with the preparation of a Bill to repeal the industrial relations Act on the lines that he had set out in a minute to thePrime Minister and certain other members of the Cabinet.    TheLord Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Prices and consumer Protection had offered comments which he would liketo discuss with them but he hoped that the Cabinet would give him the authority to set in hand immediately the drafting of the bill and to submit his proposals in outline to the TUC and the confederation of British Industry (CBI).THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that the discussions with the TUC should openwith a meeting on the lines proposed in the paper, at which theGovernment would explain the situation as it appeared to them andwould invite the comments of the TUC.    He would take the chairhimself at that meeting, which he would hold shortly after theBudget.    From then onwards the main contacts with the TUCshould be through informal meetings with Departmental Ministers.It would be wrong to start a series of formal top-level discussions with all the attendant publicity.    As regards the Bill to repeal theIndustrial Relations Act, the Cabinet would like an opportunity toconsider it later in the week on the basis of a Cabinet paper to be circulated by the Secretary of State for Employment.    ministers who wished to offer comments should send them to the Secretaryof State for Employment, with copies to the rest of the Cabinet.Meanwhile the Secretary of State for Employment had authority toset in hand the drafting of the Bill but should not submit proposals to the TUC or the CBI pending discussion by the Cabinet.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the summing up oftheir discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the Secretary of State for employment to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office19 March 19742
