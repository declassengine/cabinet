tPARLIAMENTARYAFFAIRS1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the week following the easter recess.Inquiry intoBroadcastingTHE HOME SECRETARY said that he proposed, before the easter Recess, to announce the Governments intention to setup an inquiry into broadcasting under the chairmanship ofLord Annan.    It would have substantially the same field of work as the inquiry which had been established in 1970 and subsequentlydiscontinued when the Conservative Government took office;but he would, in consultation with the Prime Minister, settle the terms of reference and the membership of the inquiry afterthe Easter Recess.The cabinet took note, with approval, of the Home Secretary&apos;sstatement.BeaverbrookNewspapersLimitedPreviousReference:CC(74) 4thConclusions,Minute 1The Cabinet were informed that an urgent decision was needed on the request from the workers at the Beaverbrook plant in glasgow that there should be some Government assistance towards a study of the feasibility of keeping the establishment in operation.    A meeting of the workers was to take place on10th April and it was desirable that a decision should have beentaken and announced by then.    Moreover, the subject was likelyto be raised in the course of the Debate on the Motion for the adjournment of the House of Commons for the Easter Recess.The request for financial assistance had recently been discussed by the Ministerial Committee on Public  Enterprises, who hadnoted that an important point of principle was\ involved in thedecision whether to give any form of Government assistance tothe newspaper industry.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, saidthat the Lord President should arraage for the ministers principally concerned to discuss the matter further later that day so that an early announcement could be made of theGovernments attitude towards the request for assistance with afeasibility study.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.
2. THE PRIME MINISTER said that on his visit to Paris toattend the memorial service for President Pompidou, he had held talks with the French Prime Minister, M Messmer; theFederal German Chancellor, Herr Brandt; the Japanese PrimeMinister, Mr Tanaka;  President Podgorny of the Soviet Union,who was particularly concerned to discuss questions of tradeand technology; and President Nixon of the United States, with whom he had a wide-ranging discussion of international questions.He would arrange for any points of particular departmentalinterest emerging from these talks to be communicated to hiscolleagues.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Prime Minister2
3. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of building societies and mortgage finance.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT saidthat, following the Cabinefs discussion on 4 April, theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and himself had discussed with the negotiators representing the Building SocietiesAssociation (BSA) the possibility of arranging a Government loanwhich would make unnecessary any increase in the mortgagerate above its present level of 11 per cent.    The upshot wasthat, after two lengthy meetings, the negotiators had agreed to commend to the BSA Council a proposal under which theGovernment would arrange a facility consisting of loanstotalling  100 million, which would be available as from April 1974at an annual rate of interest of 10jr per cent, together with afurther  400 million which, if circumstances required, wouldbe available from the end of April onwards, at an average rateof  100 million a month, on terms and rates to be agreed.    Itwould be a condition of the loan which was to be made availablein April that no change would be recommended in the investment and mortgage rates during that month.    The loans were to be repaid as soon as possible, either from new sources of funds orfrom net receipts accruing from a reflux of investment income.The terms of the  100 million loan available in April involved asmall element of Government subsidy, in that the interestcharged would be 10^ per cent, whereas the current minimumlending rate of the Bank of England was 12% per cent.    If theloan remained outstanding for a year, the cost would be if million.    The negotiators thought that the Government&apos;soffer would be accepted by the BSA Council and in particular byall the largest building societies; but if it were not, an early statement would have to be made by the Government describing the offer which had been made and indicating that the responsibilityfor any increase in the mortgage rate must be laid at the door ofthe building societies.In discussion it was recognised that the Governments offer -though much the best arrangement which could be made atpresent - was of course only a temporary solution and was in thenature of a bridging loan to tide the building societies over untilother sources of finance were available.    It was desirable thatthe loan should be repaid as soon as possible, and the negotiation of a Eurodollar loan offered a good prospect of this.    It was uncertain whether it would be possible to offer the building societies equally favourable terms for any further instalmentsfrom the additional  400 million which was to be made available if needed.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe Cabinet noted the very satisfactory outcome of thediscussions with the BSA negotiators and congratulated theMinisters concerned.    The decision reached by the BSA council should be reported to the Cabinet at their meeting the next day;but if the Governments offer was not accepted, it would have tobe made clear that the responsibility for any consequent increase in the mortgage rate lay entirely with the building societies.    As regards the future, the Chancellor of the exchequer had indicated that he would wish to be personally involved in thefinancial aspects of any further,,negotiations with the building societies; and it was important also that he and the Secretary ofState for the Environment should as soon as possible circulate tothe Cabinet proposals as to the composition and terms ofreference of the committee which it had been agreed should beset up to examine longer-term issues.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.4
4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by theLord President (C(74) 27) and the Secretary of State for social services (C(74) 26) about the National Insurance Bill.THE LORD PRESIDENT said that he had been asked to considerwhether the Government could take action to prevent the puttingdown and consideration of amendments to the National insurance bill which would require six-monthly upratings of social security benefits.    The selection of amendments and scope for debate wereultimately matters for the Speaker but, subject to that overriding consideration! it seemed clear that there was no certain way inwhich the Government could prevent the tabling of amendments which would have the effect either of introducing six-monthlyupratings permanently or of securing that the next uprating was inApril 1975.    The terms of the Money Resolution might not suffice to exclude such amendments and, if called, they could well becarried.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES agreed thatthe Government risked defeat on such an amendment, and it wasnecessary to consider urgently, therefore, the feasibility and costof carrying out six-monthly upratings.    Her Departmentsinvestigation had shown that they ware administratively feasible and indeed that regular April and October upratings would, if adequatenumbers of permanent staff were provided, be preferable in the eyes of the staff associations to annual upratings carried out inovertime and with casual staff.    As to cost, the addition would beof the order of  250 million, on the basis of an assumed 20 per cent increase in earnings in the next year.   Thsxe were strong objectionsto pre-empting resources of this order, which could only be at theexpense of other groups, such as the disabled; and if the issue were raised only in debate it would not be difficult  politically to mount aconvincing case against six-monthly upratings.    There would however be difficulty in the event of a vote on an amendment;  andin that situation the best the Government could do! might be to acceptthe view of the House and to ensure that the terms of the amendmentwere technically sound, if need be by tabling a Government amend-ment at a later stage.In discussion it was agreed that the merits of the case were over-overwhelmingly against six-monthly upratings.    Not only did they absorbsocial services resources which would otherwise be available forother high priority groups such as the disabled, for larger families and for developments in education, but they would result in a heavierburden of contributions and, to the extent that these had increasinglyto be met by employers, would put higher costs on to industry.    Themeasures which the Government had already taken to help pensionershad been well received by the elderly in the population, and it was unlikely that there would be pubHc pressure to move to six-monthly
upratings at the expense of other groups still in need of help.Nevertheless, the risk of defeat in the Commons was real.    Itwould however be unwise to make any kind of commitment to repeal the six-monthly provision at some later date - for example,after an election.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that a powerful case could be mounted againstsix-monthly upratings: they resulted in the wrong priorities in social services expenditure and in extra costs to contributors tothe national insurance scheme, especially to companies who, in1975 particularly, would be faced with many higher costs whileattempting to hold down prices.    If an Opposition amendment tosecure six-monthly upratings, or an uprating in April 1975, were successfully carried against these arguments at Committee Stage,the Government should accept it without entering into any commit-ments for the future either by way of permanent provision for six-monthly upratings or for reversion to annual upratings at a later date.    It would, however, be necessary to ensure that the resultantlegislation was technically sound and Government amendments forthis purpose should be tabled as necessary on Report Stage in the commons, rather than in the Lords.    Very rapid action would be needed, as all stages in the Commons were being taken on one day.The Secretary of State for Social Services should therefore ensurethat the Opposition amendments were studied as soon as possible sothat she could advise the Chief Whip promptly on the action needed in the Commons.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion, and invited theSecretary of State for Social Services and theChief Whip to be guided accordingly.CHILEPreviousReference:CC(74) 7thS Conclusions,j Minute 15.        The Cabinet resumed their discussion on policy towardsChile.    Their discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded separately.
Pi1 *[HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy NO       n  -6 dCABINETCONFIDENTIAL annex cc(74) 9th Conclusions, Minute 5Tuesday 9 April 1974 at 10. 00 amCHILE THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN and commonwealth AFFAIRS said that in accordance with theprevious discussion in Cabinet he and the Secretary of State for defence had met a group of Government supporters in the house to discuss our policy towards Chile.    There was no doubt that thesupply of warships to Chile was widely disliked in theParliamentary Party; over a hundred members had called uponthe Government to prevent delivery.    On the other hand only about 27 Members had attended the meeting, and while only a fewhad spoken, it was his impression that they divided fairly equallyinto those who considered that we should prevent the delivery toChile of the warships being built under contract in this country,and those who thought that the contracts should be fulfilled.    Thediscussion with the Parliamentary group had been useful; he hadexposed the problem frankly; and even those who were opposed todelivering the warships appeared to recognise the formidabledifficulties which would be presented by a decision to frustrate the contracts.    It was important to realise that the vessels were-already the property of the Chilean Government: three of them were flying the Chilean flag and had Chilean crews on board.The contracts were between the Chilean Government and theshipbuilders.    Export licences were not required.    He was advised that legislation would almost certainly be necessary if wewere to prevent delivery, and this legislation would need to be retrospective since the contracts had already been made.    Actionof this kind would be without precedent in peacetime and it mightwell have serious international consequences going beyond ourrelations with Chile.There had been indications from the Chilean Government that ifthe warships were not delivered we would be denied supplies ofChilean copper, which amounted to 20 per cent of our requirements.It was possible that we might in time be able to make good our requirements by obtaining supplies from Zambia, but in themeantime we would have to buy through the copper markets inPreviousReference:CC(74) 7thConclusions,Minute 1
London and New York and pay the very high prices now beingcommanded by copper on the world market.    Stocks held by industry were low and the consequences of a shortage would besevere for the building and light and heavy engineering industries, and thus for the employment situation.In November 1973 they had, when in Opposition, moved a Motioncalling for changes in the then Governments policy towards Chile.The decisions which had now been taken and which he and theMinister of Overseas Development had announced on 27 March,covered all the demands in the November Motion with the arguableexception of the demand that the sale of arms to Chile should be prevented.    It had been decided, and announced, that no newsales would be made.    All that was at issue was the delivery ofthe warships, which had already been sold.    In view of thisrecord of promises fulfilled, and of the great difficulties and disadvantages which would attend a refusal to allow the warships tobe delivered, he strongly recommended to his colleagues that the warships should be allowed to go to Chile.In discussion it was pointed out that we were at present fulfillingorders to the value of  210 million for naval equipment to besupplied to other countries in Latin America, and there was theprospect of further orders worth  260 million to be obtained in thenext few years.    Much of this business would be put at risk of weprevented delivery to Chile.    It was also argued, however, thatsales of arms were discreditable in themselves and that under any reasonable interpretation of the Motion put down in November the warships should not be allowed to go to Chile.    Such a decision might involve severe penalties, but these should be accepted.    the credibility of the Party and of the Government was more important than our reputation in Latin America as reliable suppliers of arms.It was stated, however, that if our power &quot;to prevent deliverydepended upon the passage of new legislation, it would be impossibleto obtain a majority for such legislation: a considerable number ofGovernment supporters would not be prepared to vote for it.It was also noted that Rolls Royce (1971) Limited were under contract to overhaul engines of the Hawker Hunter aircraft sold to Chile at their factory at East Kilbride, and it was suggestedthat this service should be terminated.THE PRIME MINISTER, after further discussion, said that theCabinet had been faced with a difficult decision.    There was ageneral dislike of stipplying the Chilean Junta with warships.The Government had, however, lost no time in fulfilling virtuallythe whole of the policy towards Chile which it had advocated when in Opposition, and a decision to frustrate the contracts for the warships would risk many penalties, domestic and international.
After considering all the arguments which had been put forward theview of the Cabinet was decidedly in favour of accepting theForeign and Commonwealth SecretaryJs recommendation that weshould not seek to frustrate the contracts at this stage.    TheSecretary of State for Industry would circulate to his colleagues a paper on the arrangements for overhauling Chilean aircraftengines at East Kilbride, and this would be considered at a future meeting.The Cabinet -1.    Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister^ summing up of their discussion.2.    Invited the Secretary of State for Industry to circulate a paper on the arrangements foroverhauling Chilean aircraft engines.Cabinet Office9 April 19743
