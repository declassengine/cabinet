1. THE PRIME MINISTER said that a memorandum on Questionsof Procedure for Ministers (C(P)(74) 1) would shortly be circulated toall members of the Government and should be carefully studied.    Itwas important, in order to ensure that the Government&apos;s business wassmoothly and efficiently handled, that the procedural rules set out inthe memorandum were strictly observed.    Any Minister wishing tomake an announcement on an important policy question, whether inParliament or elsewhere, should clear it in advance with the lord president of the Council, particularly as regards timing.The Cabinet -Took note of the Prime minister&apos;s statement.ELECTRICITY 2.        THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that, afterRESTRICTIONS        consultations with the Confederation of British Industry, the TradesUnion Congress, the Central Electricity Generating Board and other interests concerned, he had concluded that it would be possibleimmediately to return to five-day working.    He had accordinglymade the necessary Order, which would come into effect at midnight on 8-9 March.    The restrictions on the use of electricity for heatingand lighting in industrial and commercial premises and on street lighting would continue for the time being.    He expected that it wouldbe possible to bring these also to an end very shortly, although, for practical reasons, it would take local authorities some time fully to restore street lighting.    The way was thus open for industrial production to return to normal although this would not be achievedimmediately in some sectors because of shortages of components.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Secretary of Statefor Energy,3.        The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.    It was for theOpposition to decide how time should be allocated during the debate on the Address, and therefore it might be possible to give only short notice to Ministers who would be required to speak during the Debate.It would be necessary for the Cabinet to settle the Governmentslegislative programme as soon as possible; and Ministers werebeing asked urgently to submit their Departments&apos; legislative proposals.    As a result of the even balance of Party strength in the House of Commons, it was likely that the Committee stage of controversial Bills would frequently have to be taken on the floor of the House, and this would restrict the volume of legislation whichthe Government could hope to undertake.:     - -i      ;     ,        . fCONFIDENTIALi governmentI ProcedurePARLIAMENTARYAFFAIRS
bUEEN&apos;SSPEECH-Ion theOPENING[OFPARLIAMENTPreviousReference::CC(74) 1stConclusions,Minute 34, The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord President ofthe Council (C(74) 1), to which was annexed a draft of The Queen&apos;sSpeech on the Opening of Parliament.The Cabinet considered the draft Speech paragraph by paragraph.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the draft, subject to a number of amendments whichhad been suggested in discussion.    The programme outlined in thedraft Speech would justify an initial Session of at least a year; buta final decision whether or not to prorogue Parliament in the autumn of 1974 need not be taken for some months.    The Speech was couched in terms which would not commit the Government to introduce legislation during the initial Session beyond the relatively fewBills to which it was clear that immediate priority must be given.Commitments involving public expenditure were dealt with onprecisely the same basis.   It was essential that, in their speechesduring the Debate on the Address and elsewhere, Ministers shouldstrictly adhere to this approach.    In particular, no commitmentsinvolving public expenditure should be given in advance of collectivedecisions by Ministers;  and the Cabinet would not be able to reach conclusions on spending priorities until there had been full discussionof the economic situation.    Where the draft Speech containedcommitments - for example, in relation to increases in pensionsand social security benefits - no promises should at this stage bemade as to the date from which they would take effect.The cabinet took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.iMINE WORKERS&apos;jPAY^DISPUTEIPrevious^Reference:CC(74) 1stConclusions,jMinute 15. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said thatthe National Coal Board (NCB) had reached agreement with theNational Union of Mineworkers (NUM) on a settlement that would increase basic wage rates to  45 for face workers,  36 for otherunderground workers, and  32 for surface workers.    In order todo this the NCB had been authorised to increase their offer to a totalof  108-1 million, equivalent to an increase of 32 per cent.    It hadbeen clear that a settlement could not have been reached on the basisof the Pay Board&apos;s relativities report.    The NCB had successfully resisted a further NUM claim for backdating to November 1973.    TheNCB had also undertaken to give a threshold agreement on the lines ofthe Pay Code; on present forecasts this would, by the end of the year,add  3.60 a week to the value of the settlement, and this was not included in the estimate of total cost.    The arrangements for putting the settlement through the Pay Board procedure and giving formalMinisterial consent would be completed as quickly as possible.
The mineworkers1 settlement would inevitably have an effect on thegeneral prospect for pay settlements, which was already disturbing.Stage 3 of the Conservative Governments policy was originallyestimated to give rise to an increase of 11 per cent in earnings.But on present forecasts the threshold agreements would now betriggered nine times, starting in April, and by the end of the yearearnings would then be 19-20 per cent higher than a year earlier,and prices 15 per cent higher.    The direct repercussions of the mineworkers&apos; settlement might not be too great because of the assurance of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) that their case was unique.    There was however a formidable list of demands which would come forward in the next three or four months, andwhich would be intensified even if the TUC did all in their powerto restrain them,,Against this background, it would be necessary to consider theposition which the Government should adopt for the immediatefuture and in the longer term.    As regards the immediate future,the TUC wanted the Pay Board to be abolished, but thia requiredlegislation and could not be done at once.    The fact that the Stage 3limit had been lifted for the mineworkers did not therefore mean thatit had been lifted for all other claims;  and he hoped that during thisinterim period Ministers dealing with claims which came to their departments would not say or imply that the Stage 3 limit had been removed altogether.    While there could be no question of going backon the Governments commitment, the Counter-Inflation Act 1973remained in force until it was altered, and it could only be overriddenby using the power of Ministerial consent given by the Act; this might need to be invoked in some cases.    He would aim, in had discussions with the General Secretary of the TUC, to ensure thatthere was no misunderstanding about the position during the interim period; and then to reach agreement on a fuller statement on the wayof arriving at a general indication of the kind of settlements that wereto be made on a voluntary basis.    In the light of these discussions,he would circulate a note suggesting the line that should be taken onthis subject in the Debate on the Address.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the cost of themineworkers1 settlement would increase the NCB&apos;s deficit in 1974-75to some  400 million.    He proposed therefore to encourage the board to make an immediate increase in the price of industrial coal, but not of domestic coal.In discussion the following points were made -a. The TUC were unlikely in practice to expect that the pay Board could be aboHshed overnight, and indeed some oftheir members might prefer Otherwise.    Departments would however heed guidance on the way in which they should deal
with current cases.    The doctors and Dentists&apos; Review Body,for example, were at present taking evidence; and theBritish Medical Association had indicated that they werenot prepared to accept the Stage 3 limit.    It would howeverseem preferable for Ministers to hold back from endorsingclaims going beyond that limit until the Governments future policy had been further developed.b. There would be advantage in relating an immediate increase in the price of industrial coal to the cost of the mineworkers&apos; settlement.    In presenting this, attentioncould also be drawn to the high cost of the industrial actionitself.    It would however be preferable not to extend theprice increase to domestic coal, since this would significantlyincrease the retail price index and aggravate the serious problem pcsed by the threshold agreements.    The more general problem of prices in the nationalised industries as a whole would need further urgent consideration by theMinisters concerned.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the secretaries of State for Employment and for Energy were to becongratulated on the speedy conclusion of a settlement of the mineworkers&apos; dispute.    On the development of future policy,the Cabinet endorsed the general approach which the Secretaryof State for Employment had suggested.    In the light of hispreliminary discussions with the General Secretary of the TUC,the Secretary of State for Employment should circulate a noteindicating the line which he proposed to take during the debate on the Address.    While discussions on future policy were continuing, Ministers dealing with particular pay claims should seek to avoid endorsing proposals for pay increases going beyond those permitted by the legislation currently in force.    the secretaries of State for Employment and for Pricesjand consumer protection should study urgently the legislation which would be needed to amend the Counter-Inflation Act 1973, and should arrangefor the preparation of a memorandum on this subject as soon aspossible.    The Cabinet agreed that there should be an increasein the price of industrial coal, but that an increase in the priceof domestic coal should be avoided for the time being.    Furtherearly consideration would need to be given to the more general problem of nationalised industry prices.
The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.I I2. Invited the Secretary of State for employment. To circulate a note on the line whichhe proposed to adopt in the Debate on the address.b. In consultation with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and the Secretary of State for prices and Consumer Protection, to consider urgently the legislation needed to amend the counter-Inflation Act 1973.3e        Invited the Secretary of State for Energy, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer,to authorise the National Coal Board to make animmediate increase in the price of industrial coal*Cabinet Office8 March 1974
