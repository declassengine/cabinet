QUESTIONS OF      1. The Cabinet&apos;s discussion and the conclusions reached arePROCEDURE recorded separately.FOR MINISTERSPublic SpeechesREPEAL OFTHE industrial relations ACTPreviousPreference:CC(?4) 10thConclusions.Minute 22. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Employment (C(74) 30) on the proposed safeguards fortrades union members in the Bill to repeal the Industrial relations act.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that, in response to representations from the Trades Union Congress (TUC),he now proposed to drop from the Bill the Clause, which the cabinet had previously approved, providing machinery for appeals to aspecial tribunal by union members against unreasonable expulsionor exclusion from a union.    The TUC had advanced good reasonsfor objecting to the inclusion of this provision in the present Bill.They argued that it was unnecessary since union members could have recourse to the High Court;  that the unions had done a greatdeal to improve their disciplinary procedures; that the matter hadnot been covered in the discussions that members of the Governmenthad held with the TUC before obtaining office;  and that the length ofthe Clause gave it an undue prominence in a short Bill.    TheGovernment should be chary of a provision which could give rise toawards of compensation against unions that could be difficult toenforce.    Even if, in the face of Government insistence, the TUCmight eventually be persuaded to accept the Clause, they would thinkit necessary to make the kind of representations to the Governmentthat would be damaging to good relations between them.    he recommonded therefore that the Clause should be dropped.   Duringthe passage of the Bill he would draw on the arguments which hadbeen deployed by the TUC, ax?d take the line that the right course was to consider with them what further action might be needed,including provision in the subsequent Protection of employment bill, to supplement the existing safeguards for union members.    the tuc would be ready to enter into discussions on that basis.    the tuc had also indicated that they would like the provision forconscientious objectors to be deferred to the second Bill, but hewould not advocate this, particularly in view of the recentreferences to it in the Press.    He would,, however, consult the tuc further about this provision in case they wished to suggest any amendment of it in the second Bill.    He accordingly invited hiscolleagues to agree that the Clause providing for appeals againstexpulsion or exclusion from a union should be dropped from thepresent Bill, but that the provision for conscientious objectorsshould be retained.1
In discussion it was argued that the TUC objections to the proposedtribunal seemed unreasonable; their members could already have recourse to the High Court and their rejection of safeguards wouldbe likely to harden the attitude of the courts against the unions.Moreover, since the present means test would deny legal aid tothose earning more than a modest level, many High Court casesmight be financed by politically motivated employers or newspapers..In the earlier discussions with the TUC, they had not been able tosubstantiate claims that voluntary safeguards would be fully effective, and the Government might now be in a better position to institute some inquiry into this point.    The TUC might favourdelaying the safeguard provision until the second Bill because they hoped that at that stage they would be better able to persuade theGovernment to drop it altogether; but for the same reason theOpposition would press for the safeguard to be included in thepresent Bill, and postponement would expose the Government toaccusations of subordination to the TUC.    The risk of suchcriticism was illustrated by the immediate reaction to the recent decision to refund  10 million that the unions had paid in taxes asa result of the Industrial Relations Act,    The Government had made numerous concessions to the unions and the time had come tosee what the unions had to offer in return ,    By including thisprovision in the present Bill me Government would demonstrate that they were not instruments of the TUC, but were taking their decisions on grounds of public interest.    Failing this, the TUCshould at least be asked to agree that if, by the time of the secondBill, they had not achieved effective voluntary arrangements, theywould co-operate in working out a suitable provision for inclusion in the second Bill.    This might be made more palatable to theunions if the provision were to apply to expulsion procedures of professional bodies as well as to trades unions.On the other hand it was argued that the Government had come to office on a programme of conciliation instead of confrontation withthe trades unions.    The country would judge them by theirsuccess in carrying out such a programme which depended vitallyon retaining the goodwill of the unions.    The measures that theGovernment had offered as its side of the social contract were suchas it would have wished to take in any case.   As regards the union side, it would be constitutionally impossible for the TUC to givespecific undertakings on wages, but the first few weeks under thepresent Government had already shown a dramatic decline in thenumber of stoppages.    The circular issued to the unions by theGeneral Secretary of the TUC on 11 April gave more than theGovernment might reasonably have expected, and the TUC hadalready intervened helpfully in more than one dispute.    The refundof  10 million for taxation could be fully justified by reference tostatements of Ministers in the previous Government, who had2 .
claimed, wrongly as it turned out, that the unions could avoid the tax by registering as friendly societies;  and the constitutionalobjections to retrospective tax legislation did not apply to measures designed to relieve the taxpayer.   Against this background, a deferment of the safeguard provision, particularly if it were accompanied by a firm undertaking to include it in thesecond Bill, need not be seen as a surrender to the unions.    Theprovision was in any case logically more appropriate to the secondBill.    Such a deferment would also give the opportunity for more detailed discussion with the TUC, with the advantage to theGovernment not only of a gain in TUC goodwill but also of possibleimprovement in the technical form of the legislation,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the provision for conscientious objectorsshould remain in the present Bill, but that the safeguard provisionfor appeals to a special tribunal against unreasonable expulsionshould be deferred^    However, they were doubtful whether the tuc would find it possible to provide adequate safeguards of theirown for the individual, and they did not favour setting up anindependent inquiry into the matter.    The TUC should thereforebe told that the safeguard provision would be included in the secondBill, although if the TUC brought forward alternative proposals inthe meanwhile, the Government would be prepared to look at them.The Governments position on this point should be made clearduring the Debate on the Second Reading of the Bill;  and the TUCshould also be warned that if the Opposition sought to insert a safe guard provision into the Bill, the Government might have to counter this by putting forward their own proposals.    more generally. Ministers should take every opportunity to stress theGovernments commitment to a policy of conciliation, and thegood results that that policy was already achieving.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister,and invited the Secretary of State for employment to proceed accordingly.3
3. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICESsaid that the programme for uprating social security benefits inJuly 1974 was now being seriously jeopardised by industrial actionamong the staff responsible for implementing it.    In a number ofregions the staff were refusing to work overtime, either on the uprating or on other work, and were also refusing to work withcasual staff.    If the present situation continued, the delay in the uprating of supplementary benefit could be as much as 16 weeks,with slightly smaller delays in the case of contributory benefits;and, at the extreme, the position might be reached wheredisablement benefit was up to a year in arrears.    She had now hadtalks with the Staff Side and had offered the-maximum concessions which had been agreed interdepartmentally, but these had not beenacceptable to the staff associations concerned, the Civil and public services Association and the Society of Civil Servants.    She wouldlike therefore to examine the possibility of a small further concession, which she believed would be sufficient to obtain theco-operation of the staff so that the uprating could proceed as planned,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet had taken note of the situation reported by the Secretaryof State for Social Services, and they would wish to consider it attheir next meeting.    In the meantime, the Secretary of State for social Services should discuss the matter further with the lord president and the Secretary of State for Employment, and should then circulate a memorandum to the Cabinet for consideration.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister,and invited the Secretary of State for social services to proceed accordingly.//4
IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy NO        35CABINETCONFIDENTIAL annex cc(74) 12th Conclusions Minute 1Thursday 25 April 1974 at 10. 30.am the PRIME MINISTER said that the memorandum on Questions ofProcedure for Ministers made it clear that in any public speechesthey should exercise special care in referring to subjects whichwere the responsibility of other Ministers.    The principle of collective responsibility applied; they should keep within the ambitof approved Government policy and should not anticipate decisionsnot yet made public;  and in all cases of doubt they should consult the Minister concerned.    On a few recent occasions the rules hadnot been observed.    A speech made by the Secretary of State for defence the previous day had been interpreted in some quarters,particularly in Northern Ireland, as indicating that the government might be influenced by a growing public demand in Britain that our troops should be removed from Northern Ireland.    Subsequentattempts to correct this misinterpretation of the speech had notbeen entirely successful.    He understood that the Secretary ofState for Northern Ireland had not been consulted about the speech.In any Ministerial statements about Northern Ireland it was important that every word should be weighed most carefully.    TheSecretary of State for Northern Ireland must always be consulted,in the same way as the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth Affairs, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theSecretary of State for Defence, for example, had to be consulted about references to questions falling within their departmental responsibility.    On this occasion he too should have1 been consultedespecially in view of his recent visit to Belfast and his closeconcern with current developments in Northern Ireland.Arrangements for advance distribution of the text of the speech had also been unsatisfactory:  copies had been delivered to the PartyHeadquarters after the speech was due to start.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said thatthe effect in Northern Ireland had been very damaging.    TheSocial Democratic and Labour Party Members of the executive had been particularly disturbed.    The Provisional Wing of the
Irish Republican Army would have been encouraged in their belief that the Government could be brought to make concessions to themby the pressure of violence.    The efforts which were being made,with some success, to maintain the solidarity of the Executive, hadreceived a setback.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that he regretted that he had not consulted the Secretary of State for northern Ireland.    In that part of his speech which dealt with northern Ireland, his concern had been to urge support for theGovernments policies.    His purpose in referring to the existenceof pressure to pull out troops was to emphasise to the people ofNorthern Ireland that this pressure could grow unless they themselves played a more positive and constructive role.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thathe would issue a reminder, to be seen by all Ministers and theirPrivate Offices, about the need to observe the rules contained inthe memorandum on Questions of Procedure.    He would make astatement reaffirming the Governments policy in Northern Irelandand their determination not to be diverted from that policy  by themen of violence.    It might be useful if other Ministers were tofollow this up in speeches, during the coming weeks, but ourreaction would need to be carefully judged and Ministers should consult the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.2
