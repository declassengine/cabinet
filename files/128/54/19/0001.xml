9PARLIAMENTARY     1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenAFFAIRS in the House of Commons during the following week.Parliamentary The Cabinet were informed that the Speaker had repeatedlyStatements expressed uneasiness about the number and length of the ministerial statements which were at present being made at theend of question time.    Ministers should therefore makestatements only when it was clearly necessary to do so; andwhen a statement was unavoidable it should be kept as shortas possible.FOREIGNAFFAIRSFrench NuclearTests2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH secretary said that in a Written Reply to a Parliamentary Question that afternoon he would, while expressing regret at the decision ofthe French Government to hold a programme of nuclear testsin the atmosphere in the Pacific, express satisfaction thatthese were to be the last of the French atmospheric tests.At the same time he would announce that we would monitorthe radio active fall out in the interests of the health of people living in the region.    He had already expressed our concern theprevious day to the French Ambassador, whose reactionsuggested that there would be resentment on the part of theFrench Government.    These representations had been necessary,but he would refrain from any further public comment and hopedthat his colleagues would agree to do the same.European Community: THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatPoliticalCo-operationMachineryhe had used the Political Co-operation Machinery for raising the question of sanctions in Rhodesia, and for discussingPortugal and the future of Portuguese territories in Africa.There had also been exchanges on the meetings between the europeans and the Arabs, collectively, and on the desirabilityof a meeting between the Europeans and the Israelis.Conference on security andCo-operation inEuropeTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that discussions in the Conference on Security and Co-operation inEurope were moving slowly.    We and our partners had made some concession to the Russians on the subject of theinviolability of frontiers, but had received no correspondingconcession on the freedom of movement.   The Russians attached great importance to completing the Conference with a meeting
tat the highest level.    We should use this desire to persuade the Russians that they must offer more in the field of humanfreedom, including freedom to travel: and should do our best to ensure that President Nixon of the United States did not giveaway this card when he visited Moscow.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY, said thatthe talks in Vienna on the mutual and balanced reductibn of forces were also proceeding slowly.    The Russians wanted ageneral reduction on both sides from the beginning.    we wanted the first stage to consist only of reductions in theAmerican and Russian forces.    We must expect discussion tobe lengthy: we must be patient and persistent.North Atlantic THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatAlliance he would be visiting Canada the following week for a meeting ofthe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation which would mark its25th Anniversary,    A draft declaration had been preparedreaffirming the purposes of the Alliance as both detente and defence.    Progress in the exchanges between the americans and Russians on Strategic Arms Limitation was slow, and president Nixon of the United States was unlikely to be able to conclude any agreement of importance when he visited Moscow.The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.Chilean Debt THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES saidthat she understood that we had been engaged in a renegotiationof payment of Chile^ external debts.    It had been suggestedthat the purpose of this renegotiation was to enable the chilean government to pay for the frigates purchased from us.    Iftrue this would be a matter of great concern and she asked thatthe Cabinet should be informed of the position before final decisions were reached,THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Chief Secretary, Treasury,would arrange for a paper to be circulated to the Cabinet.ForesReductions
3. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT saidthat there was an urgent need for a decision on a review of the rating system, which might be carried out either by an all-Party SelectCommittee or by a small independent expert Committee.    He had hoped to discuss this matter at the present Cabinet but recognisedthat it was impracticable to do so in the absence of the Chancellorof the Exchequer.    In order to expedite matters he suggested thata small ad hoc group of Ministers might consider the issue as amatter of urgency.  &quot;Hi1&apos; /;     ji -THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thathe would arrange for such a group to meet under his own chairman-ship.    The other members would be the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the Secretary of State for the Environment, the Secretary of State for industry, the Secretary of State for Education and Science, theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Secretary of State for V/ales.The Cabinet -Took note.4. The Cabinet considered the situation in Northern Ireland.Their discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded separately.I!
5. THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Ministerial Committee onEnergy at their meeting the previous day had considered proposals bythe Secretary of State for Energy about the choice of a reactor system for nuclear power stations.    After a very thorough discussion theCommittee had unanimously approved the Secretary of State&apos;sproposals; but in view of the importance of the question had invited the Secretary of State to report the outcome of their discussion to theCabinet.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that no orders for nuclear power stations had been placed since 1970.    The previous government had put off a decision, and Labour&apos;s Programme for ,Britain had promised to devote more resources to the building of nuclear power stations.    He had chaired two meetings of the nuclear power Advisory Board established by the previous Government, but had received no clear advice from them; he had also metrepresentatives of the trade unions and staff associations of themain industrial interests, and had considered the views expressedin the report of the Select Committee on Science and Technology andin debate in the House of Commons on 2 May.    No option commandedgeneral agreement, and any choice would entail some commercialrisk; but in his view the primary considerations were safety,reliability in operation,, and the need to support British technology,and on these grounds he considered that the Steam Generating HeavyWater Reactor (SJGHWR) should be adopted for the next nuclear orders.In this judgment he was fortified by the fact that the Central PoHcyReview Staff had independently reached the same conclusion;  andalthough the weight of argument had seemed compelling even beforethe recent disaster to the chemical plant at Flixborough, that eventfurther reinforced the need to ensure that the Governments choice of nuclear reactor would command public confidence.A prototype of the SGHWR had worked successfully for six years atWinfrith, and there had been good experience with an analogousCanadian system (CANDU).    The Chief Inspector&apos; of NuclearInstallations had advised that there should be no fundamentaldifficulty in clearing an SGHWR design, initially for remotesites, without delaying the start of construction.    The otherthermal systems all had substantial disadvantages: Magnox,which now provided 10 per cent of our supply of electricity, was an outdated design and would be prohibitively expensive to reorder;the Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactors had encountered many difficulties and were unlikely to provide satisfactory operating experience for atleast another two years; the High-Temperature Reactor would not be adequately proven before the early 19G0s; CANDU would require muchmore heavy water than the SGHWR, and used natural rather than low-enriched uranium.    The claims of the Light Water Reactor (LWR)were passionately advocated and opposed.    Doubts about its safetyhad yet to be convincingly allayed, however, and the NuclearInstallations Inspectorate might not be able to clear it for nearly- * S4
two years, or be able to do so without design modifications.    Adoptionof the SGHWR would need to be accompanied by a deal with the canadians on heavy water and heavy water technology, on engineering,manufacturing and construction experience and on opportunities for united Kingdom manufacturers to supply nuclear and conventionalplant for CANDUs sold in Canada and overseas; and preliminary discussions to this end had already taken place.The Committee had recognised that investment in the SGHWR would need to be pursued with caution.    By about 1978 there would be widerexperience of nuclear power systems, and the relative cost of investment in them and in fossil-fuel systems might have substantiallychanged.    He therefore proposed to place orders between now and1978 for about 4, 0O0MW of nuclear plant: the balance of the requirement, between 8S 000 and 12,000MW, would be providedby fossil-fuelled plant, rather more than would be needed if theLWR were adopted.    But although the choice of the SGHWR would meet the views expressed by the Select Committee on Science and technology and would be particularly welcomed by the South ofScotland Electricity Board, there would be strong resistance fromthe Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB), the NationalNuclear Corporation and the General Electric Company - theCorporation^ main shareholder - who all supported the LWR.The Chairman of the CEGB might demand a formal instruction to order the SGHWR, and might even resign.    The Committeehad agreed therefore that he should discuss the implications ofthe decision in favour of the SGHWR with the nuclear interestsbefore any public announcement was made.    In the light of these further discussions he would circulate a draft &quot;White Paper to theCabinet, with a view to publishing it early in July and accompanyingit with a statement to Parliament.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet endorsed the view of the Ministerial Committee on Energythat the SGHWR should be chosen for the next nuclear power stationorders.     The question of safety weighed heavily in reaching thisdecision, and account must be taken of the doubts about the safety of the LWR which had been expressed by Sir Alan Cottrell, who wasa leading metallurgist, as well as by Lord Hinton, the formerChairman of the CEGB, and the Select Committee on Science and technology.    The Secretary of State for Industry, who was unableto be present at their discussion, had expressed his full support forthe choice of the SGHWR, and the Cabinet had been reminded that theconstruction of the SGHWR was likely to produce valuable orders forBritish firms, particularly in boilermaking.    The first site for anSGHWR station would probably be in Scotland; it had been designatedfor some time, and local opinion was apparently strongly in favour of construction proceeding.    Nonetheless, in summing up thediscussion of.the Ministerial Committee on Energy, he had5  ij
stressed the need for all proposals for the siting of nuclear power stations to be most carefully scrutinised by the Government before there was any question of an application for planning permission orother public move to develop a particular site.    He had asked theMinisters concerned to ensure that each proposal came before theCommittee in good time for thorough examination and subsequentapproval by the Cabinet.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister,Cabinet Office13 June 1974
copy NOCABINETNORTHERNIRELANDPreviousReference:CC(74) 18thConclusionsCONFIDENTIAL annex cc(74) 19th Conclusions, Minute 4Thursday 13 June 1974 at 10. 30 am the SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that before outlining some proposals about future policy he soughtagreement to the legislation needed for the government of theProvince in the meantime.    At present this was being carriedon under provisions of the Constitution Act which allowed us tocreate a &quot;caretaker&quot; government for a limited period.    Underthese arrangements his role was not dissimilar to that of a Governor,while his Ministerial colleagues in the Northern Ireland Officeconstituted the Executive which, under the law as it now stood,was accountable to the Northern Ireland Assembly.    The Assemblywas, however, prorogued.    It was therefore necessary to transfer to Parliament the Assembly&apos;s legislative authority and to make himaccountable to Parliament.    He proposed that there should be a short bill, which would also provide for an Order in Council procedure to relieve the legislative burden which would otherwise be placed uponParliament.    The Bill would need to be passed before the Recess.Turning to the political situation, the Secretary of State said that theNorthern Ireland Executive had rested on uncertain foundationsbecause Mr Brian Faulkner&apos;s supporters in the Assembly had beenlosing the support of the Protestant community.    The recent generalwithdrawal of labour which had been the immediate cause of the collapse of the Executive was in effect an industrial strike under-taken for political purposes.    Recent events had however had amarked effect on the political scene.    Loyalist opinion, which hadtraditionally rallied under the Unionist Party and had then split up under a number of established political leaders, had now becomeeven more fragmented.    Many of the working class no longer looked to the politicians for leadership.    On the Catholic side the morale ofthe Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) had been badly shakenby the collapse of the Executive and by the fear that the Party would lose support to the extremists.    The Provisional Irish republican army (IRA) had been impressed by the demonstration of the powerof the Protestant working class to achieve results by striking
without recourse to violence; and the IRA were at present keeping a low profile.    There was one strand of opinion which was widespread and gaining strength: the feeling that the people of Northern ireland should be given a chance to find their own solution.    On the Protestantside there was a demand for new elections.    He proposed thatelections should be held in the autumn for a Consultative convention which would have the task of recommending future constitutional arrangements.    The elections should be under the single transferable vote system of proportional representation which had been used forthe elections to the Assembly and which he had reason to think wouldbe generally acceptable.    This would need legislation which might, iftime allowed, be included in the Bill he had. already mentioned.There should also be a White Paper.    Although we would not seek to prejudge the outcome of discussions in the Constitutional Conven-tion it would be necessary in the Bill and in the White Paper toestablish a number of principles: any new constitutional arrangements would have to be acceptable to both communities in Northern Ireland, and this in turn would require some formof power-sharing; there would have to be some recognition ofthe need for co-operation between North and South; and somerevision of the present financial arrangements would have to beaccepted since in the longer term it was unreasonable that NorthernIreland, which was at present funded out of the Consolidated Fund,should be free from the restraints under which the Departments ofGovernment in the rest of the United Kingdom were obliged to operate.   After the Convention had reported, we would have to judge what should go into the legislation which would need to be passed by Parliament in order to establish new constitutional arrangements.    We would therefore have a role to play in settingup arrangements for the Convention and in implementing such of its recommendations as we accepted, but we would not interfere in theConvention^ proceedings.He would probably need another two or three weeks to continue had discussions in Northern Ireland before he would be able to judge whether these proposals were likely to be acceptable there.    Themain difficulty was likely to lie with the SDLP.    His discussions would be designed to probe opinion, and he would not reveal the natureof his proposals.    It was important that it should not become known that we were considering holding elections to a ConstitutionalConvention, for this might lead some sections of Opinion, andin particular the SDLP, to take up rigid positions.In discussion it was suggested that the publication of a White Papermight create difficulties in Northern Ireland on the ground that it waspre-empting the purpose of the Convention and unreasonablylimiting its freedom to come forward with recommendations.Alternatively, a White Paper might prejudge the decisions that
we might wish to take when we had received the report of theConvention.    Furthermore if in the White Paper and in the proposed bill we introduced too many safeguards the Protestants might refuseto co-operate; while if we introduced too few safeguards theCatholics might withhold co-operation.    It would be a difficult and delicate task to draft principles to be included in the white paper and the Bill.    It was also suggested that although we shouldbe prepared to exercise our financial power when it was useful to doso, we should also bear in mind that Northern Ireland was a part of theUnited Kingdom faced with exceptional problems and that we would beopen to criticism if we appeared to be taking a narrow view of theprovision of funds to the Province.    It was also noted that althoughNorthern Ireland was passing through a particularly difficult periodpolitically, there were signs of a growing realism there which mightopen up possibilities of progress which had not previously existed.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed on the need for early legislation transferring toParliament the legislative authority previously enjoyed by theNorthern Ireland Assembly and making the Secretary of Statefor Northern Ireland accountable to Parliament.    It was also agreed that we must seek new means of finding a political solutionand that the proposal for elections to a Constitutional Conventionappeared to offer the best way forward.    Substantial argumentshad been advanced against the proposal to publish a White Paper.But the legislation itself would have to be short, and a somewhatfuller description of the principles the Convention would have to observe would be needed.    It might be sufficient if, instead of a white Paper, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland were tomake a statement to Parliament.    The Secretary of State should report to the Cabinet the outcome of the discussions which he wouldbe holding in Northern Ireland in the coming weeks, and should propose a text of a White Paper or a statement so that the cabinet might decide whether the points made in discussion had been met.Whether or not the Convention led to a new constitutionalitarrangement for Northern Ireland, careful consideration would have to be given to the arrangements under which central funds were provided.    The new arrangement might be in the natureof a reconstituted power-sharing Executive in some form.Alternatively, it was conceivable that the Convention might suggest an independent Northern Ireland, with guarantees forthe minority;  in this case it would be important to be able toapply sanctions if these guarantees were not being observed,and financial sanctions could be particularly effective.    Fullintegration of Northern Ireland with Great Britain was not a viable option; and a return to one-Party Protestant rule onthe model of the former Stormont was also unacceptable.    he wished to urge upon his colleagues the importance of ensuring that the proposals they had been discussing should remainconfidential.
