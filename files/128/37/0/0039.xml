The Foreign Secretary said that hostilities had been renewedbetween the Kurds and the Iraqi Government, who were adoptingruthless methods in order to overcome Kurdish resistance. We were examining, as a matter of urgency, means of protecting Britishsubjects in the area concerned; but we had also to consider whether to delay delivery of the military equipment which we had recentlypromised to supply to Iraq. Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Baghdadhad advised that these deliveries should be held up for some months.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that, although therewould in any case be considerable delay before much of this equipment could be delivered, the rockets which were needed forthe operations against the Kurds could be supplied from stock. Itwas in our interest to maintain the good relations which we had recently re-established with the Iraqi Armed Forces. On the otherhand the operations against the Kurds might have repercussions in neighbouring countries, particularly in Persia, and might possiblylead to Soviet intervention. Moreover, the Kurds had played a valuable part in resisting Communist penetration of Iraq; and theGovernment might be criticised if, at this juncture, they supplied the iraqi Government with weapons which could be used to repress theKurdish community.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that deliveries of military equipment to Iraq shouldcontinue but that for the time being the flow should bereduced to the minimum.The Foreign Secretary said that in Greece M. Karamanlis&apos;Government had resigned, ostensibly on the grounds of the refusal of the King of the Hellenes to cancel his State Visit to the UnitedKingdom but in fact largely for internal political reasons. An interim government had been formed under M. Pipinelis; and it seemed probable that the Royal visit would now take place.Malaysia(previous reference :C.C. (63) 34thConclusions,Minute 8)The Cabinet (2) Took note that the Foreign Secretary, in consultation withthe Home Secretary, would consider the security precautions to be adopted during the forthcoming StateVisit of the King and Queen of the Hellenes and would inform the Prime Minister of the measures proposed.The Foreign Secretary said that relations between indonesia and Malaya had improved, at least superficially, as a result of therecent meeting between the Malayan, Indonesian and PhilippineForeign Ministers.C.C. 39 (63)Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Lord President of the Council said that during the debate in the House of Commons on 17th June about the resignation of theformer Secretary of State for War, Mr. Profumo, two Members ofthe Opposition, Mr. Wigg, M.P., and Mr. Paget, M.P., had called in question the integrity of his own public comment on Mr. Profumo&apos;conduct. Their remarks had been couched in terms which he couldnot allow to pass unanswered; and he would therefore feel boundto take an early opportunity of rebutting them in the House of Lords.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Lord President of theCouncil.
Laos(previous reference :C.C. (63) 26lhConclusions,Minute 3)South Africa(previous reference :C.C. (63) 36thConclusions.Minute 7)The Foreign Secretary said that the situation in Laos was deteriorating. Although Prince Souvanna Phouma had suffered nodecisive military defeat, there was an increasing risk of a directconfrontation between the Pathet Lao and the SEATO Powers.Meanwhile, despite our representations, the Soviet Government were making no effort to overcome the obstructive behaviour of the Polishmember of the International Control Commission.The Foreign Secretary drew the attention of the Cabinet to thevaledictory despatch of Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in South Africa,Sir John Maud, (C. (63) 102) and suggested that some of the issues which it raised should be discussed at a future meeting.The Cabinet-(3) Took note of these statements by the Foreign Secretary.resignation of theSecretaryof Statefor War(previous reference:C.C.(63) 38thConclusions)*3. The Prime Minister said that he was grateful to the cabinet for the support which they had given him in the difficult task whichhe had faced in the Parliamentary debate on 17th June about the resignation of the former Secretary of State for War, Mr. Profumo.At the end of that debate the Government had undertaken toconsider whether any further enquiry into the circumstances ofMr. Profumo&apos;s resignation was necessary and, if so, to discuss withthe Opposition what form it should take. After considering the issues involved, he had reached the conclusion that, in the light of therecent episode, some investigation of the operation of the security service and their relationship with the police in connection with matters of national security was required. But he had also had totake account of the fact that, arising largely out of the recent episode,rumours were now circulating which affected the honour andintegrity of public life in this country and, if they were true, might involve a further security risk. The public interest, therefore, required the Government to establish an enquiry which would embrace thesecurity aspects not only of the recent casd but also of the otherallegations which he had mentioned.The Opposition would probably seek to insist that any further enquiry should be conducted by a Select Committee of the Houseof Commons. There were considerable objections, however, to thissuggestion. In so far as there was any question of examining themanner in which Ministers had discharged their responsibilities inconnection with the circumstances of Mr. Profumo&apos;s resignation,this was a matter to be discussed on the floor of the House ofCommons and was not suitable for investigation by a SelectCommittee. It had already been debated on 17th June; and if theOpposition tabled a Motion for the appointment of a SelectCommittee it would have to be debated again.There were additional objections to a Select Committee. Itsprocedure would be liable to be cumbrous and time-consuming,especially since the chairman would have no control over themembers and the proceedings could therefore be prolongedindefinitely. Moreover, it would inevitably reflect a divergence of purpose between the political parties represented on it; and publicopinion, which now sought an impartial and objective enquiry, wouldattach less value to an investigation which would appear to be influenced by party political considerations. Finally, a SelectCommittee, even if sitting in camera, would be inappropriate to an investigation of the Security Service and a discussion of sensitivesecurity issues.* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
For these reasons the enquiry should be conducted by anindependent member of the judiciary; and the Master of the Rolls,Lord Denning, had agreed, with the Lord Chancellors consent and approval, to make himself available for this purpose. His terms ofreference should be:&quot; To examine, in the light of the circumstances leading tothe resignation of the former Secretary of State for War,Mr. J. D. Profumo, the operation of the Security Service and the adequacy of their co-operation with the police in matters of security; to investigate any information or material which may come to his attention in this connection and to consider any evidence there may be for believing that national security hasbeen, or may be, endangered; and to report thereon.&quot;It would be appropriate that, initially, Lord Denning should proceed on his own authority. But, if he found that he could not obtain the information which he needed without the powers to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents,it would be necessary for the Government to invite Parliament topass a Resolution investing him with the necessary authority.In discussion there was general agreement with the course ofaction which the Prime Minister had suggested. Although theproposed procedure might carry more conviction and be implementedwith less delay if Lord Denning were invested from the outset with power to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents, such powers could be provided only under the tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, and there would be considerableobjection to constituting Lord Denning in effect a Tribunal underthis Act. He would then be required by the terms of the statute to conduct his enquiry in public, in the absence of any special reasonto the contrary; and experience on other occasions when theprocedure of the 1921 Act had been invoked had amply illustrated the unfortunate results which were liable to ensue if a Tribunalsought to meet this requirement only in part, on the groundthat security might otherwise be endangered. Moreover, if theGovernment established a Tribunal under the 1921 Act with termsof reference as proposed by the Prime Minister, they would appearto be acquiescing in a situation in which any person could withimpunity call in question the good name of a member of theGovernment on the basis of rumour alone and the Government couldbe compelled, as a result, to adopt the most stringent methods inorder to refute the allegations. It would be intolerable that public affairs should have to be conducted on this basis; and it would clearly be preferable that Lord Denning&apos;s appointment should beseen as essentially an offer by the Government to provide anopportunity for individuals responsible for promoting defamatoryrumours to substantiate those rumours in so far as they could. Theywould be protected by the normal principle of qualified privilegeagainst the risk of subsequent action for slander or libel, providedthat their action was not malicious. But, if they were promptedprimarily by malice and therefore rejected the opportunity to submit their allegations to the test of enquiry, they could be dismissed asscandalmongers, from whom the Government had nothing to fear.Some individuals, however, might be reluctant to come forward onthe ground that, although they would be acting in good faith inreporting the allegations which they had heard, they could not regard the principle of qualified privilege as affording them adequate protection. If Lord Denning was for this reason prevented fromobtaining evidence which he regarded as potentially important, hecould at that stage ask the Government to invest him with compulsory powers; and the Government would then be betterplaced to invite Parliament to take the necessary action, since their primary purpose would be seen to be to protect the hesitant witnessrather than to promote an inquisition into idle rumour and scandal.
Federation of rhodesia and nyasaland(previous reference:C.C. (63) 37thConclusions,Minute 1)4. The First Secretary of State said that, in the light of the reply from the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia, Mr. Winston Field,to his latest letter, it now seemed probable that all the Governmentsconcerned would be willing to attend the projected conference onthe dissolution of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Therewere indications, however, that the Federal Prime Minister,Sir Roy Welensky, would seek to frustrate the conference as far aspossible and, in particular, to impose on the United KingdomGovernment liability for the Federal Public Debt.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the First Secretary of State.Cabinet Office, S.W. I,20th June, 1963.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the proposal that a further enquiry should be instituted, embracing both the operationof the Security Service and the security implications ofrumours and allegations now in circulation, on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister.
