SECRET 3C.C. 43 (63)Parliament 1.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.House ofLords ReformPeerage Bill(previous reference:C:C. (63) 42ndConclusions,Minute 1)2. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the attitude whichthe Government should adopt towards an amendment to the PeerageBill, designed to ensure that the Bill would take effect on receiving the Royal Assent rather than on the dissolution of Parliament.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that, inconsultation with the Chief Whip, he had taken steps to ascertain the views of the Governmenfs supporters on this point. The weightof opinion appeared to favour rejection of the amendment. Thisreinforced his own view that the Government should adhere to theirstated intention that the Bill should take effect from the dissolution of Parliament and that this must be regarded as an integral element in the arrangements to implement the Report of the Joint SelectCommittee on the reform of the House of Lords. It was possible,however, that the amendment would be carried; and he proposedthat, in that event, it should be accepted as the view of the House.The Cabinet Agreed that in the debate on the amendment to the PeerageBill which was designed to ensure that the Bill would take effect on receiving the Royal Assent rather than on the dissolution of Parliament, Government spokesmen shouldbe guided by the considerations indicated by the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster.The Yemen(previous reference:CC. (63) 28thConclusions,Minute 2)3521-33. The Foreign Secretary said that a party of British service personnel had been detained in the Yemen, after wanderinginadvertently into Yemeni territory from Lahej. We had now beeninformed, through United States channels, that the Yemeniauthorities were willing to hand them over to the United states representative if the United Kingdom Government would undertaketo prevent any repetition of the incident. In the circumstances itwould be appropriate to express our regret and to indicate that weshould take steps designed to ensure that the incident did not recur.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the recovery of British Service personneldetained in the Yemen should be arranged on the lines proposed by the Foreign Secretary.The Foreign Secretary said that the representative of theSecretary-General of the United Nations who had been appointedto supervise the disengagement of the Egyptian and Saudi Arabianforces from the civil war in the Yemen had reported a reneweddeterioration in the situation. It seemed probable that neither theEgyptian nor the Saudi Arabian Government intended to honourtheir undertaking to withdraw their troops; and there were signs that sporadic fighting between the Royalist and Republican forces would be resumed. In these circumstances there could be noquestion of our recognising the Republican regime.The Cabinet (2) Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.SECRETa 2
CommercialPolicyExport ofAircraftto China(previous reference:C.C. (63) 11thConclusions,Minute 6)4. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that the UnitedStates Government were seeking to oppose the export from thiscountry of six Viscount aircraft to Communist China on the grounds that these aircraft incorporated items of strategic significance in theform of certain navigational equipment which, althoughmanufactured under licence in this country, was of United Statesdesign.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that the equipment inquestion, which was a standard fitment in Viscount aircraft soldthroughout the world, had been obtained from stocks held by british european Airways and not direct from the manufacturers. although this fact might not mitigate the objections of the United StatesGovernment to the transaction, it might help to protect the companyconcerned, who were under effective United States control, from being involved in the dispute. Meanwhile, the export of the aircraft to China should proceed.The Cabinet Agreed that, despite objections raised by the Governmentof the United States, the proposed export of six Viscountaircraft to Communist China should be allowed to proceed.NorthAtlanticTreatyOrganisationNuclearForce:Mixed-MannedComponent(previous reference:C.C. (63) 42ndConclusions,Minute 2)5, The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the proposal bythe United States Government to establish a mixed-manned fleet of surface vessels as part of the nuclear forces of the North atlantic treaty Organisation (NATO).It had already been accepted by the Governments military advisers that it would not be impracticable to create a force of thiskind. But there were still unresolved doubts about both itsoperational effectiveness and its juridical status. Soviet forces wouldprobably be able to identify the vessels involved without greatdifficulty; and, even though they might be unable to keep the wholeforce under constant observation, they would possess a fairlycomplete picture of its deployment at any given moment. They would therefore be well placed to harass individual vessels and might bemore disposed to do so if the status of the force in terms ofinternational law could not be satisfactorily established. Either forthis reason or because of the likelihood of Soviet attack in a periodof tension, it might be necessary to provide the force with escort vessels. In that case its cost would rise very substantially.The most serious military objection to the force, however, arose in relation not so much to its effectiveness and cost as to the factthat the additional nuclear capability which it would represent wouldbe superfluous. Current NATO strategy had been evolved some yearsago, at a time when the West had an unquestioned nuclearsuperiority and, for technical reasons, certain Soviet targets includedin NATO planning could not be reached except by aircraft based inEurope. It was now being suggested that, as these aircraft becameobsolescent, they should be replaced by missiles of at least equivalentrange. But it could be held that in the altered circumstances ofto-day this strategy was no longer valid. In the event of major Sovietaggression the main strategic forces of the West would inevitably be brought into play; and the scale of destruction on both sideswould be so great that the war would end very rapidly. There was thus no longer a NATO requirement for strategic weapons. The task of NATO&apos;s forces, in our view, was not to fight a war, if necessary,but to deter it; and their nuclear armoury should be confined toweapons of interdiction. Until these issues had been resolved andthe new pattern of NATO strategy was clear it would be premature to accept any commitment in relation to the proposed mixed-manned force.But, although we were seeking to enlist support for a revisedstrategy in the current discussions in NATO, our views might not
prevail. In that event there would be a continuing NATOrequirement for strategic weapons; and, for military reasons, it mightbe preferable that these weapons should be seaborne rather thanland-based. In view of the high cost of submarines and the limitedcapability of shallow-draught floating platforms, surface ships of thekind envisaged for the mixed-manned force might be held to be most appropriate for this purpose. It was thus possible that theresult of the current NATO strategic review might be to confirm amilitary requirement for the kind of force which the United StatesGovernment were now proposing. We should be the less favourablyplaced to sustain our alternative view that strategic weapons werenot required by NATO forces in that we had ourselves assigned our strategic V-bomber force to NATO and had undertaken that ourPolaris submarines, which also represented a strategic capability,would be similarly assigned when they became available.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) It had become clear that the Government could notcommand support in Parliament for United Kingdom participation in a mixed-manned force on the lines now proposed. Even anundertaking on our part to participate in technical discussions aboutthe mixed-manned force would be regarded as implying some degreeof commitment to contribute to the creation of the force.(b) On the other hand the Government could not ignore the growing feeling in Europe, which was not confined to Germany, thatthe European partners in NATO were entitled to some more effectiveshare in the control of the nuclear weapons on which their ultimatedefence depended. An offer to engage in discussions in NATO onthe problems of the management and control of NATO nuclearforces, of whatever kind and from whatever source they might beprovided, would be an indication that we recognised and respectedthis feeling; and it would be less open to political objection than an offer to take part in technical examination of the mixed-manned force itself.(c) The principal motive of the United States Government in proposing the mixed-manned force was a desire to contain theaspirations of Western Germany to acquire an independent nuclearcapability of her own. It was uncertain, however, how far theGerman Government would feel that they could afford to indulgethese aspirations. If they embarked on the manufacture of nuclear weapons, they would be in breach of the Paris and LondonAgreements of 1954 and would expose themselves to the risk notonly that the other members of NATO would feel no longer boundto discharge the commitment to defend West German territory whichthey had accepted under the same Agreements but also that weshould regard ourselves as released from our own undertaking to station United Kingdom forces in Germany for a period of fifty years. It seemed unlikely that they would lightly court this risk. Onthe other hand they would be in no danger of breaking their treaty obligations if they acquired nuclear weapons from the FrenchGovernment instead of manufacturing them themselves; and theFrench Government might be the more disposed to contemplate a transaction of this kind in the light of the mounting cost of their ownforce de frappe. The United States Government might well have concluded that, if they could commit the German Government tothe substantial expenditure entailed by membership of the mixed-manned force, they would make it financially impossible for themto come to any understanding of this kind with the FrenchGovernment; and they would thus prevent the emergence of any independent European nuclear capability.(d) The German Government had responded to this UnitedStates initiative the more willingly in that United States spokesmenhad  hinted  that,  in  certain  circumstances,  the  United  States
Government might be prepared to waive their veto over the use of nuclear weapons stationed in Europe. But it would be politically impossible for us to acquiesce in any development of this kind; andwe must therefore face the fact that a mixed-manned force, which remained subject to the veto of the United States Government, wouldbe unlikely in the longer term to satisfy German aspirations. In that case it was for consideration whether we should seek to persuade theUnited States Government to defer a decision on the mixed-manned force for as long as possible and endeavour, in the interim, to devisesome alternative project for the establishment of a genuinelyEuropean nuclear deterrent. This would have to be based on, and to start with, co-operation between ourselves and the FrenchGovernment; and it would have the additional advantage of recognising that any European defence policy which ignored france was unrealistic, that the French Government were unlikely to endorse the concept of the mixed-manned force and that, if we subscribed tothat concept, we should merely widen the gulf between the FrenchGovernment and ourselves and increase still further the difficulty of devising a rational policy for the defence of Europe. The FrenchGovernment had shown themselves not unwilling to co-operate with us in specific projects e.g., the Concord aircraft where they hadjudged that they could not expect to gain the full benefit of technological development except on the basis of a partnership of knowledge and endeavour; and they might be prepared to adopt asimilar attitude towards the concept of an independent Europeannuclear deterrent.(e) On the other hand such a deterrent could not become effective for some years and would therefore lag permanently behinda United States deterrent which was already more than adequate to any foreseeable requirement; it would impose on Europe a new and heavy burden of expenditure; and, since we should not beprepared to waive our veto on its use, it would be as unlikely as the mixed-manned force to satisfy German aspirations.The Prime Minister said that, in the light of the cabinets discussion, he would seek, in his forthcoming discussion with thePresident of the United States, to persuade him to agree that nofurther action should be taken in connection with the creation of theproposed mixed-manned force until the current review of NATOstrategy and force goals had demonstrated whether there was, or was not, a NATO military requirement for such a force. He would indicate that we would be prepared to participate, simultaneously with the NATO review, in an examination of the problems of thepolitical management and control of the nuclear weapons at NATO&apos;disposal; but he would make it clear that it would be impossiblefor us, without further consideration by the Cabinet, to take part inany technical discussion about the mixed-manned force itself, onthe ground that public opinion in this country would be liable to regard such discussion as committing the United Kingdom inprinciple to contribute to the creation of the force. He would emphasise, above all, that only by proceeding on these lines could we hope to avoid giving the Soviet Government an excuse for rejecting the initiative which we had recently taken in offering to renew discussion on a treaty to ban nuclear tests and to prevent theproliferation of nuclear weapons, which was, and must remain, the primary objective of Western policy.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, that the Prime Minister wouldbe guided, in his forthcoming exchange of views with thePresident of the United States about the proposed mixed-manned nuclear force, by the considerations which had emerged during their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,27th June, 1963.
