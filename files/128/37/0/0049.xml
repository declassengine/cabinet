FuturePensionsIncreases(previous reference:C.C. (62) 45thConclusions,Minute 3)3781-3a 21. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the chief secretary, Treasury, and the Minister of Defence (C. (63) 136 and 137respectively) on problems of public service pensions.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the present procedure for reviewing public service pensions, which had resulted in fivePensions (Increase) Acts since 1945, had been criticised on the groundthat measures were introduced only in response to public pressureand were subject to the delay inherent in legislation. He had undertaken to consider whether some improvement was possible but had reached the conclusion that, while the existing system was opento criticism in some respects, it was defensible in principle and was preferable to any of the alternatives which had been suggested. all of these the introduction of &quot; parity &quot;, i.e., an increase in the levelof all pensions to that of those currently awarded; an automaticlink between pensions and the cost of living; the establishment of anindependent review body; or the conduct of reviews by theGovernment at stated intervals were open to the objection that theydeprived the Government of the initiative as regards both the timing and, in the case of the more extreme of the proposals, the amountof the increases. Both parity and increases linked automatically tothe cost of living would represent an advance beyond the practiceof good employers and would be regarded as insulating one sectionof society, regardless of need, against the effects of inflation. Therewere, admittedly, particular problems relating to specific classes of pensioners, notably the pre-November 1958 officers&apos; widows. Butit had been found impossible to make concessions to meet hard caseswithout creating fresh anomalies in relation to other pensioners; andthere did not appear to be sufficient justification for attempting todeal with any class of public service pensioners in this way.The Minister of Defence said that he was under continuingpressure to improve the pensions of retired Servicemen and theirwidows; and he was not convinced that the right course was to leavematters as they were. Existing arrangements did not adequatelyprotect the interests of Service pensioners or ensure them a share in the benefits of an expanding economy. He was particularly concerned about two classes of pensioners: the officers who hadretired on the earlier pension codes and did not benefit from thePensions (Increase) Acts until they reached the age of 60,notwithstanding the substantial erosion of their pensions as a result of increases in the cost of living; and the officers&apos; widows who had beenbereaved before 4th November, 1958. It was difficult to maintain,in the face of intense criticism, a rule which had the result that a widow bereaved before 4th November, 1958, received a substancially lower pension than one bereaved after that date. The sum involvedin abolishing this distinction was only  200.000; and there wouldbe considerable advantage in announcing immediately a decision tothis effect. Further consideration could then be given to the questionof improving methods of reviewing pensions for the future.In the course of discussion the following main points were made:(a) Further consideration should be given to the issues raised in the Chief Secretary&apos;s memorandum, with particular reference tothe classes of pensioner about whom the Minister of Defence was concerned.(b) It would be disadvantageous to make a concession to aparticular class of pensioners in advance of the examination of theproblem as a whole; and it would be particularly undesirable to reopen the position of the pre-1958 officers&apos; widows without reopeningthat of the pre-1958 widows of other ranks, who received no pension at all. Moreover, to do so would be to provoke embarrassingrepercussions in relation to the Civil Service, since the widows ofCivil Servants who had been bereaved before 1949 also received no pensions.
(c) There was some evidence that good employers were increasingly adopting the practice of adjusting pensions to increases in the cost of living, although not to the extent of introducingparity. It would be desirable that the review of the Governmentsarrangements should include consideration of recent developments of this nature and should also have regard to the possible repercussions of any changes in the Governments practice on pensions in local government, the police, the nationalised industries and theNational Health Service.The First Secretary of State, summing up the discussion, saidthat there was general agreement that it would be desirable for the issues raised in the discussion to be studied further by the ministers concerned, taking into account the current practice of good employers.Priority might be given to consideration of the position of the pre-1958Service widows.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in consultation withthe other Ministers concerned, to examine, in the lightof the current practice of good employers, the issues involved in reviewing public service pensions, withparticular reference to the position of Service widowsbereaved before 4th November, 1958.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting,in the light of the results of the enquiry to be carried out under Conclusion (1) above.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (63) 134) about plans for increasingemployment in central Scotland and the North-East of England.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Economic PolicyCommittee had recommended that an announcement of theGovernment^ proposals for the planned development of central scotland and the North-East of England should be made by the endof October. The basis of such development in the two regions wouldbe the concept of &quot; growth places &quot;; but it would be wise to avoid any specific indication of the amount of employment which it was intended to create in this way or of the time it would take to achieveparticular objectives. It might be desirable to make an announcementbefore the Recess, promising detailed proposals by the end ofOctober; and in the meantime it would be right to announce, withoutdelay, any individual projects for central Scotland or North-east england which might be approved and to take every opportunityto avoid creating the impression that the Government were relaxingtheir efforts to improve the present situation.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The implementation of the measures now envisaged wouldinvolve a rather elastic interpretation of the powers available to theGovernment under the existing Local Employment Acts. This could probably be accepted for a time; but amending legislation would be needed in due course.(b) The announcement of special measures for central Scotlandand the North-East would be liable to stimulate demands for similar treatment for other parts of the country where unemployment wasabove the national average. The steps which the Government hadalready taken to stimulate the economy as a whole would representa partial answer to such demands; but it would also be necessaryto defend some degree of deliberate discrimination in favour of central Scotland and the North-East. It would be wise, however, topresent the Governments policy in terms of special measures to beadopted in relation to the areas concerned rather than of explicitdiscrimination in their favour and to emphasise that the period
&apos;C? O 9ai vii zSNorthernIreland(previous reference:C.C. (63) 14thConclusions,Minute 4)Belfast DryDockduring which such measures would be in operation would be limited,since the new policy was designed to enable the areas to rely on theirown resources as rapidly as possible.(c) The form of the announcement to be made before the Recesswould need careful consideration. Too general a statement mightexpose the Government to criticism on grounds of delay andindecision; on the other hand too specific a statement at this stagemight make it more difficult to secure support for the detailed proposals to be announced later in the year.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of C. (63) 134.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consult the PrimeMinister about the form of the statement which it wouldbe necessary to make before the Summer Recess aboutthe Governments plans for dealing with unemploymentin central Scotland and the North-East of England.3. The Home Secretary said that, in view of the persistence ofan abnormally high level of unemployment in Northern Ireland, itwas important that the Government should look with favour on a project to construct a new dry dock at Belfast. Messrs. Harland andWolff had now recognised that they must henceforward concentrate on ship repairing rather than ship construction; and, since the capacity of their only dry dock was limited to ships of 42,000 tons,they had suggested that the Belfast Harbour Commissioners shouldbe given financial assistance by the Government to provide a newdry dock capable of taking ships of up to 150.000 tons. TheCommissioners had already embarked upon harbour improvementsestimated to cost  5 million; and the proposed new dry dock wouldprobably entail additional expenditure of the same order. It had therefore been represented to the Government that they should contribute one-third of the total outlay of  10 million by way of grant, together with a loan of a further  2 million on favourable terms.The Economic Policy Committee had formed the opinion thata dry dock of 150 000 tons could not be justified at this stage, thata capacity of 60.000 tons should suffice for the time being but that itwould be desirable to plan the new dock in such a way that it wouldbe capable of enlargement in due course. The financing of the harbourimprovements and of the new dock should be in accordance withthe existing preferential terms of assistance for industry in NorthernIreland.In discussion there was general agreement with these proposals.The Cabinet Agreed that Government financial assistance should beprovided, on the lines indicated by the Home secretary and in accordance with the existing preferential terms for industry in Northern Ireland, towards the improvement ofthe harbour and the provision of a new dry dock of 60,000tons at Belfast.SouthAfrica(previous reference:C.C. (63) 46thConclusions,Minute 2)Export ofAircraft4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum (C. (63) 138)by the Chief Secretary, Treasury, as chairman of the Strategic ExportsCommittee, about the export of Buccaneer aircraft to South Africa.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the Government ofSouth Africa, who had ordered 16 Buccaneer aircraft from the hawker Siddeley Aircraft Company at a total cost of  24 million,were concerned that, if the Labour Opposition were returned to power in the United Kingdom and implemented their threat to prohibit the delivery of aircraft to South Africa, they would be unable,
under the terms of the existing contract, to recover any of thepayments which they had made. They had now indicated that, unless they received assurances that the aircraft would be delivered to them or that, if the export were frustrated, they would obtain compensationfor the advance payments which they had already made, they might feel compelled to cancel the order rather than to risk making thesecond advance payment, of  6 million, which would shortly be due.It was for consideration, therefore, whether we should seek to induce the manufacturers to amend the contract in such a way as to allow for a refund to the Government of South Africa if the delivery ofthe aircraft were frustrated. For this purpose we might formallyundertake that the United Kingdom Government would either takeover the aircraft if permission to export them were refused or paythe company full compensation for work done up to that stage. the manufacturers had indicated, however, that they would be unwilling to modify the contract even to this extent unless the South african government undertook to place a further order for Buccaneer aircraft.In these circumstances the Committee on Strategic Exports had failed to reach a unanimous view. Some members of the Committeehad feared that, in default of any action to amend the contract, theSouth African Government would cancel the order and the UnitedKingdom aircraft industry would suffer serious damage. The majorityof the Committee, however, saw considerable political disadvantage in adopting, in effect, the course of action which the labour opposition had announced that they intended to pursue if they were returned to power. Moreover, it was doubtful whether, in the last resort, the Government of South Africa would cancel the contract,since it was unlikely that they would be able to obtain a similaraircraft from any other source. Finally, there would be no advantage to the Government in taking over the aircraft from a cancelledSouth African order, since they would be surplus to the requirementsof the Royal Navy and would, in any event, require substantial modification before they could be taken into service on aircraft carriers.In discussion there was general agreement that it would be politically unwise for the Government to adopt any arrangements which would imply that they could be compelled to indemnifyforeign Governments against the possibility that the opposition might be returned to power or would make it easier for a labour government in that event to frustrate the contract. On the otherhand we should take such steps as were open to us to maintain good relations between the manufacturers and the South african government; and for this purpose we should encourage the company to negotiate with the South African Government a variation of the contract terms in respect of advance payments in return for the placing of a further order.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Government should take no further action with the Government of South Africa in relation to theexport of Buccaneer aircraft to South Africa by the hawker Siddeley Aircraft Company, otherwise than by making it clear that they had no intention of seeking to frustrate the delivery of the aircraft.(2) Invited the Minister of Aviation to suggest to the Companythat they should seek to negotiate with the South african government a variation of the contract terms in respectof advance payments, provided that the South african government placed a further order for aircraft.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,26th My, 1963.
