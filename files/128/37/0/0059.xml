Kenya 1.   The Colonial Secretary said that he was still seeking to(Previous        persuade the representatives of the Kenya African National UnionReference:       (KANU) at the Kenya Independence Conference now in progress inC.C. (63) 58th London to accept changes in the existing Constitution which, whileConclusions,    involving some strengthening of the central authority, would not soMinute 2)       weaken regional safeguards as to lead to accusations of bad faith onthe part of the United Kingdom Government. The prospect of furthercentralisation,  however,  might drive supporters  of the KenyaAfrican Democratic Union (KADU) to acts of violence; and, whilethe police forces were probably adequate to deal with a situation ofthis kind, its political effects would be damaging.  So far therepresentatives of KANU had shown no disposition to compromise on the issues involved; and there remained a real risk that, although they might be prepared nominally to subscribe to the maintenanceof a Constitution on the present lines, they would make it clear, in doing so, that they would repudiate it as soon as Kenya attainedindependence. Nevertheless, we must persist in the attempt to persuade them genuinely to endorse a reasonable settlement, even atsome risk of alienating KADU.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement by the colonial secretary.Report ofthe RobhinsCommitteeon HigherEducation2. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the first secretary of State (C. (63) 175) and the Chief Secretary, Treasury(C. (63) 173), on the recommendations of the Committee on higher education, under the chairmanship of Lord Robbins.The First Secretary of State said that the Education PolicyCommittee had agreed that it was important that the Governmentshould announce, early in the new Session of Parliament, their acceptance of the Committee&apos;s recommendations for the expansionof opportunities for higher education during the next five years, whendemand would be abnormally high as a result of the post-war increasein the birth rate, and during the next 10 years. It was encouraging tofind that plans already in train would achieve the greater part of this expansion. The Committee had also thought it possible to acceptforthwith the recommendation that Colleges of advanced technology (CATS) should be given the status of universities; but theproposal that teacher training colleges should be removed from localauthority control and the recommendation that responsibility for higher education, together with that for the Research Councils andthe museums and art galleries, should be entrusted to a new Ministerof Arts and Science, could not be considered until public opinion had had an opportunity to express itself. The points on which animmediate indication of the Governments intentions might be givenwere outlined in the Annex to C. (63) 175.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the report of theRobbins Committee recommended an increase in the number of places in the institutions of higher education from 216,000 in1962-63 to 328,000 in 1967-68 and 390,000 in 1973-74. Of these197,000 in the first period and 217,000 in the second would be inuniversities, including CATS and other institutions promoted touniversity status, compared with 129,000 at present. Expansion onthis scale was not substantially greater, however, than that alreadyimplicit in the plans which had been announced for the next 10 years.During the emergency period up to 1967-68 the age group involved would be much larger than in recent years. Nevertheless, existing
QQ1O 3 i.plans would ensure that higher education would be available to thesame proportion of the group as at present (although not to the stilllarger proportion which was likely to qualify owing to the trend towards later school leaving). It would be possible, however, to accelerate the provision of places in institutions of university statuson an emergency basis at a cost rising to some  20 million in 1967-68.It should be possible, by some adjustment of priorities, to confine theadditional cost to  15 million, which could be accommodated withinthe 5-9 per cent rate of growth approved recently by the Cabinet(C.C. (63) 52nd Conclusions, Minute 5). The 10-year programme,however, would involve an increase of more than 100 per cent in thecost of higher education by 1973-74; and its acceptance would involvegiving higher education a clear measure of priority over other activities.The number of places to be provided and the cost of theexpansion could be reduced if the number of oversea studentsadmitted to United Kingdom universities was held at the present level during the years up to 1967-68 and was not allowed to rise, asthe Robbins Committee contemplated, pan passu with the numberof home students. The co-operation of the institutions which normallyaccepted large numbers of oversea students should be sought for thispurpose. Acceptance of the Robbins Committee&apos;s recommendation that university fees should be increased would effect some economyby reducing the considerable hidden subsidy which oversea studentsreceived as a result of existing methods of financing university education. A review of the system of finance in the light of the report,and with particular reference to the distribution of cost between theState, the local authorities and the students, had been initiated. Itwould be desirable to leave open for the present the issue of publicaccountability which was raised by the Committee&apos;s proposal toextend the freedom from financial control at present enjoyed by the universities to a wider range of institutions.In discussion it was agreed that the scale of expansionrecommended by the R.obbins Committee should be accepted inprinciple, although the priority to be accorded to higher education inrelation to other educational expenditure might have to be limited,during the years up to 1967-68, to the  15 million proposed by theChief Secretary. On the remaining major recommendations,particularly those relating to responsibility for the teacher training colleges and the creation of a new Ministry of Arts and Science,informed public opinion might well differ. The Committee had madea strong case for the proposed new Ministry; but it would be unwise to under-estimate the possible strength of the support for a singleMinistry of Education with responsibility for higher education and research.The Government should seek the earliest opportunity after thepublication of the report to indicate that they welcomed theCommittee^ recommendations, accepted their programme for expansion and had, in plans already laid, gone far to achieve it.Consideration should also be given to the publication, as soon aspossible after the Robbins report, of the related report of theCommittee on the Organisation of Civil Science.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposals in C. (63) 175 andC. (63) 173.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with theLord President, the Chief Secretary, Treasury, theSecretary of State for Scotland, the Minister of education and the Minister without Portfolio, to consider, in thelight of their discussion, the arrangements for thepublication of the Reports of the Committees on higher education and the Organisation of Civil Science.
-  - a.q&apos;9t* &amp;C.C. 59 (63)New Trials in        3,   jne Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeCriminal Cases Secretary (C. (63) 168), proposing that power should be conferred onthe Court of Criminal Appeal to order a new trial in certain cases.The Home Secretary said that, as a result of the public interestaroused by a recent case in which the Court of Criminal Appeal hadquashed a conviction, the Government were likely to be under strong pressure to introduce legislation to enable the Court to order a newtrial where an appeal was based on fresh evidence.The Criminal Appeal Act, 1907, empowered the Court to allow an appeal if it considered that the verdict of the jury in the court off first instance was unreasonable or could not be supported on theevidence or that there had been a wrong decision on a point of lawor that there had been on any ground a miscarriage of justice. TheCourt had power to dismiss an appeal, notwithstanding someirregularity, if it considered that no substantial injustice had actuallyoccurred; but it would do so only if it were satisfied that, on thewhole of the facts and with a correct direction from the judge, theonly proper verdict would have been one of guilty. Otherwise, itwould allow the appeal, even though the appellants guilt was hardlyin doubt; and it had frequently expressed regret that it had no powerto order a retrial in such cases.In 1948 the House of Lords had accepted a Governmentamendment to the Criminal Justice Bill, empowering the Court to order a new trial; but the House of Commons had disagreed.Subsequently, a Departmental Committee under Lord Tucker had recommended unanimously that the Court should have power to order a new trial where the appeal was based on fresh admissibleevidence. A minority of the Committee would have preferred thepower not to be limited to this class of case; but the majorityconsidered that an unrestricted power to order a new trial was opento objection in principle, that it might be unfair and oppressive to theappellant and that there was no evidence that public opinion wasdisturbed about the rare case in which a guilty man had to be allowedto go free. The Committee&apos;s disagreement reflected a difference of legal opinion, which had persisted; and their recommendation hadnot been implemented because it had not been possible to findParliamentary time for a measure which was likely to be controversial.The Home Affairs Committee had now agreed that the court should be empowered to order a new trial where the appeal was basedon fresh evidence but had disagreed about the wisdom of introducing legislation in the forthcoming Session of Parliament. The subject was still controversial; and the Government might be criticised for takinghasty action as a result of the particular case which had recentlyattracted considerable notoriety. On the other hand the revival ofpublic interest in the subject might provide an opportunity forremedying an acknowledged defect in the law; and action to implement a report already nine years old could hardly beconsidered precipitate. The balance of advantage, therefore, appearedto lie in extending the powers of the Court, in the limited sense proposed, in the course of the next Session.In discussion it was pointed out that the majority of legalopinion would probably prefer the Court of Criminal Appeal to begiven an unrestricted power to order a new trial. A power confined to the relatively rare case where new evidence came to light after atrial would deal with only a part of the problem and would be liableto create further inequity in relation to a case where evidence hadbeen available at the trial but had been wrongly excluded.Nevertheless, an unrestricted power to order a new trial wouldinvolve a much greater departure from the principle that a man shouldnot be put in peril twice for the same offence and would prove highly
controversial, whereas the more limited extension of powers nowproposed might attract general support. Legislation need not extend to Scotland where, because of the special position of the lord advocate in relation to criminal proceedings, no similar problemarose. In view of the other demands on the legislative programme for the new Session, hov/ever, it would be unwise for theGovernment to be committed to legislation at this stage.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposal to empower the Court of criminal Appeal to order a new trial where an appeal ora reference to the Court by the Home Secretary was basedon fresh and admissible evidence.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the necessary legislation to be drafted.(3) Agreed to consider, at a subsequent meeting, whether a reference to legislation on this subject should be includedin The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament.Compensation 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the home for Victims of Secretary (C. (63) 179) on compensation for victims of crimes of crimes of       violence.Violence(Previous The Home Secretary said that there was continuing public reference:       pressure for compensation to be provided in cases of this kind. TheC.C. (62) 72nd choice lay between two types of scheme a &quot; court&quot; scheme and an conclusions,     ex gratia scheme. Under a &quot; court&quot; scheme the victim would haveMinute 2)       the right to make a claim against the Home Secretary and, if theclaim could not be settled out of court, could have both hisentitlement and the amount of his compensation decided by a court.The Home Secretary would effect recovery, if possible, from the aggressor. Under an ex gratia scheme both the entitlement and theamount of the payment would be settled by trustees, who would haveunfettered discretion of judgment, would not be obliged to givereasons for their decisions and would not be subject to any form ofappeal or of Ministerial or Parliamentary intervention.A &quot; court &quot; scheme would be preferable for three main reasons:(i) Disputes would be resolved by the judiciary; and the HomeSecretary could not be held answerable for their decisions.(ii) Parliament would not accept without question the findings of the trustees in an ex gratia scheme, particularly if noreasons were given. The Government would inevitably beexpected to defend in Parliament decisions over whichthey would have had no control.(iii) It would be impossible under an ex gratia scheme to recovercompensation from the aggressor.The Lord Chancel/or favoured an ex gratia scheme, partly onthe ground that trustees would be better placed than a court to rejectfraudulent claims in cases where a presumption of fraud was not supported by adequate evidence and partly on the ground that a&quot; court &quot; scheme, by putting the Home Secretary in the position ofdefendant, would seem to recognise that the victim had a prescriptiveright to compensation and that the State had a corresponding duty to protect citizens against crimes of violence. The implicit admissionof such a duty could have wide repercussions, particularly as regardsoffences against property.
q d IC.C. 59 (63)In discussion the following main points were made:(a) It would be important to preserve the principle that thepayment of compensation should be interpreted not as an acceptanceof liability but as an expression of compassion. This suggested thatpayments should be ex gratia and that awards should be discretionaryin character.(b) While there were arguments against placing the responsibilityfor a scheme of compensation on the Home Secretary, there wereperhaps stronger arguments against placing it on the Minister ofPensions and National Insurance. In the latter case it would bedifficult to avoid the impression that the scheme was in some wayanalogous to a social service; and it would be harder to maintain a distinction between individuals who were the victims of crimes of violence and others who sustained injury in a good cause, for examplewhile saving life.(c) An ex gratia scheme would not require legislation and couldbe introduced, if necessary, as an experimental measure, whichmight subsequently be replaced by a &quot; court&quot; scheme ifdevelopments so required. It would be more difficult to revert froma &quot; court&quot; scheme, once it had been established by statute, to ex gratia arrangements.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it was generally agreed in principle that compensation should be paid tothe victims of crimes of violence; and it could be made known thata statement of Government policy on this question would be madeearly in the new Session. The terms of this statement, however, would need further consideration.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Home Secretary to announce that theGovernment would make a statement, early in the new session, about compensation for victims of crimes of violence.(2) Agreed to give further consideration to the terms of such astatement at a subsequent meeting.Rates 5.   The Cabinet resumed their discussion of memoranda by the(Previous        Secretary of State for Scotland (C. (63) 172) and the Minister ofReference:       Housing and Local Government (C. (63) 167) about rates.C.C. (63) 58thConclusions, The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that minute 6) it would be possible to increase the general grant to local authorities(rather than the Police grant, as had been suggested) as a means ofeasing their difficulties in relation to the forthcoming rise in ratedemands, if this were judged an acceptable procedure. But, since itsbenefits would accrue indiscriminately to all local authorities, it wouldbe an expensive means of redressing inequities which were confined to certain areas of the country; and for this purpose the discretionaryarrangements proposed in C. (63) 167 were clearly preferable. Itshould be possible to meet the objection that they would represent a concession which the Government had refused two years earlier inthe case of Scotland by adopting, in relation to Scotland, a modifiedformula governing the application of the relief.In discussion some doubt was expressed about the advisability of proceeding on these lines. The proposed measures would appearto be directed to a limited number of areas which were of political importance to the Government; and this would not be to theGovernments credit. Moreover, the assessment of hardship, which
6. The Minister of Housing and Local Government said thatthe White Paper on Housing (Cmnd. 1713) published in May 1962had established a housing target of 350,000 houses a year. the increasing use of new building techniques made it clear that this rateC.C. (63) 32nd of construction would soon be achieved; and it would therefore be conclusions, opportune to announce a revised target of 400,000 houses a year.Minute 5)In discussion it was agreed that there would be advantage inthis course, provided that the Government were not committed to reaching the new target by a specified date. In view of the competingdemands of other sectors of the investment programme, particularlyeducation and transport, it would be preferable that the projectedincrease in the rate of construction should be presented as attributable to new methods and greater productivity in the building industryrather than to any deliberate diversion of resources to house building.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Housing to announce, in terms to be agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that theGovernment^ housing target would be increased to400,000 houses a year.housing programme(previous reference:Postal 7.   The Home Secretary said that the Government faced aVoting revival of the demand for unrestricted postal voting facilities at futureelections. At present such facilities were confined to certain classes,e.g., invalids, commercial travellers, etc., who had compelling personalor professional reasons for being unable to attend a polling station.The extension of the concession had always been resisted on the was an essential feature of the proposals in so far as they affectedindividual ratepayers, would rest with the various local authorities concerned; and the disparity of treatment which would inevitablyresult would accentuate the general impression of inequitablediscrimination which the scheme would create. Basically, it represented an attempt to provide relief from taxation; and bothprinciple and precedent endorsed the view that such relief should beimpartial in its effect.On the other hand the measures could reasonably be presented as an endeavour by the Government to provide assistance in those cases where the increase in rates would be unduly sharp; and, if theywere declared to be explicitly interim in their nature, pending thereport of Professor Allen&apos;s enquiry into the impact of rates onhouseholds and the Governments own review of the possibility of transferring certain expenditure from the ratepayer to the taxpayer,they could be justified as no more than a reasonable and temporarycontribution to the relief of immediate distress. On balance, these considerations probably outweighed the admitted disadvantages ofthe proposals.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposals in C. (63) 167, on theunderstanding that they would be publicly presented asan interim measure, pending a more radical review of the incidence of rates and the possibility of transferringexpenditure from the ratepayer to the taxpayer.(2) Authorised the Minister of Housing and Local Governmentto conduct informal and confidential consultations withselected local authorities about the detailed applicationof these proposals.
ChannelTunnel(previous reference:C.C. (63) 47thConclusions,Minute 11)8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Transport (C. (63) 166) about the Anglo-French Reporton the Channel Crossing.The Minister of Transport said that General de Gaulle hadalready stated publicly that the French Government would favour theconstruction of a rail tunnel under the Channel, as proposed in theReport. He had also let it be understood that he would regard theUnited Kingdom Governments decision on this issue as a furthertest of their attitude towards European co-operation. From thepolitical point of view, therefore, there would be advantage in deciding as soon as possible in favour of the construction of a tunnel;and this argument was reinforced by the impetus which would begiven by such a decision to the modernisation of our harbour andtransport facilities. On the other hand very large issues of economic policy were at stake; and it would be premature to seek to reach adecision on the project until they had been examined. He hoped tosubmit to the Cabinet, during November, a balanced appreciation of all the considerations involved.The Cabinet Took note of C. (63) 166 and of the statement by theMinister of Transport.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,8th October, 1963.grounds that it would be liable to alter the character of elections bydiminishing the element of personal responsibility which was implicit in attendance at a polling station, extending the time required tocomplete the electoral process and, possibly, infringing the secrecy ofthe ballot.In discussion it was suggested that an increase in postal votingfacilities might be more reasonably conceded in the light of the extentto which, in modern circumstances, the holiday season had beenenlarged. On balance, however, the considerations which hadprevailed against the proposal in the past were still valid.The Cabinet Agreed that any proposal to extend postal voting facilities should be resisted.
