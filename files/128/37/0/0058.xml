Foreign Affairs       l.   The Lord Privy Seal said that the situation in South-EastIndonesia        Asia remained unstable, although slightly less so. A further meeting(Previous        was projected between the Prime Minister of Malaysia, the PresidentReference:       Qf Indonesia and the President of the Philippines. It was doubtful,C.C. (63) 57th   however, whether the Prime Minister of Malaysia could agree to conclusions,    attend  such  a meeting unless  the other participants formallyMinute l)       recognised his Government. Meanwhile, the Indonesian government appeared to be placing no obstacle in the way of the evacuation ofUnited Kingdom nationals from Balikpapan; but they had not yettaken any action to restore to British firms in Indonesia the establishments which had been removed from their control.East-west relations(previous reference:C.C.(62)71stConclusions,Minute 1)The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Lord Privy Seal.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for an examination of the military and political implications of possible developments in South-East Asia.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Foreign Secretary, who wasattending a meeting of the United Nations in New York, had discussed with the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Rusk, andthe Soviet Foreign Secretary, Mr. Gromyko, the possibility of takingfurther steps to improve East-West relations. Mr. Gromyko had at first seemed willing to consider the establishment of observationposts in order to reduce the dangers of surprise attack from either side of the Iron Curtain; but more recently he had suggested thatthe Soviet Government would only be willing to contemplate suchan arrangement if it were coupled with an agreement on the non-dissemination of nuclear weapons, the establishment of nuclear-freezones in Europe and the abandonment of the proposed multilateralnuclear force.In discussion it was agreed that it would be right to seek tomaintain the momentum of the present discussions and that, althoughthe Soviet Government would no doubt put forward counterproposals of their own, they probably had domestic political reasonsfor wishing to achieve, if possible, some further relaxation ofinternational tension.The Cabinet (3) Took note of the statement by the Lord Privy Seal.United The Lord Privy Seal said that the Cabinet&apos;s earlier agreementNations: to offer a United Kingdom contribution of $1-1 million to theThe Congo      maintenance for a further period of the United Nations force in the(Previous        Congo had been based on the assumption that this force could be reference:       reduced to 3,000 troops from the beginning of 1964. The Secretary-C.C. (63) 51st    General of the United Nations, on the other hand, maintained that conclusions,     a force of not less than 6,000 troops would be required or,Minute 5)       alternatively, that the United Nations military presence in the Congoshould be completely withdrawn. He might be persuaded, however,to accept a force of 5,000 troops as sufficient; and, if so, the UnitedKingdom contribution would rise to $1-5 million. The chief secretary, Treasury, had agreed that our contribution might beincreased to this extent, provided that the revised plan was acceptedby all the countries concerned.The Cabinet (4) Took note, with approval, of the statement by the Lord privy seal.
The Queen&apos;speeches onthe prorogation and Openingof ParliamentProrogationSpeech3. The Cabinet had before them Notes by the First Secretaryof State (C. (63) 171 and 174) covering drafts of The QueensSpeeches on the Prorogation and on the Opening of Parliament.The Cabinet approved a number of amendments to the draftcirculated under cover of C. (63) 171. In particular, they agreed that,if the treaty banning nuclear tests in the atmosphere, in outer spaceand under water were ratified before the Prorogation of Parliament,an appropriate reference should be inserted in paragraph 3 of thedraft. Alternatively, it might be desirable to include a reference inthe Speech on the Opening of Parliament.The Cabinet (1) Invited the First Secretary of State to provide the PrimeMinister with a revised draft of the Prorogation Speech,taking account of the amendments approved in their discussion, for submission to The Queen.Kenya 2.   TAe Colonial Secretary said that there was at present little(Previous prospect that the Kenya Independence Conference now in progressReference: in London would produce an acceptable agreement on the revisionCC. (63) 4lst of the Kenya Constitution. The Kenya African National UnionConclusions) (KANU) had secured a substantial majority in the recent elections and had subsequently consolidated their position still further. Fromthe outset they had favoured a centralised Constitution, in oppositionto the Kenya African Democratic Union (KADU), who had insisted on safeguards for regional and, tribal interests. The Constitutionnow in force was a compromise between these conflicting points ofview. But KANU were now seeking to insist on an amendment ofits provisions which would increase the power of the centralGovernment; and they had indicated that, if their demands werenot satisfied at the present conference, they would publicly announce their intention of altering the Constitution unilaterally as soon asKenya attained full independence in December. All attempts to persuade the representatives of KANU to modify this attitude had so far been unsuccessful, although it had been made clear to themthat it would be impossible to obtain the approval of the UnitedKingdom Parliament to a Kenya Independence Bill which eithersubstantially modified the existing regional safeguards or was knownto have been repudiated in advance by those to whom its provisionswere intended to apply. We must continue to seek a compromise solution, with the assistance of certain concessions which we could offer, particularly in relation to the size of the majorities required to validate further changes in the Constitution. But these might well prove insufficient to satisfy KANU. We must also maintain our efforts to protect the interests of the European population in Kenya;and it would be helpful, for this purpose, if it could be agreed that,in the event of their wishing to leave Kenya at a later date, nodifficulties would be placed in the way of their resuming the british nationality which they would lose when Kenya became independent.The Cabinet (11 Took note of the statement by the Colonial Secretary.(2) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the colonial secretary, to give further consideration to the possibilityof ensuring to British citizens resident in Kenya, whowould lose their citizenship when Kenya becameindependent, the right to resume it.
AgriculturalPolicyHorticulture(previous reference:C.C. (63) 47thConclusions,Minute 3)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Agriculture (C. (63) 176) about future policy for horticulture.The Minister of Agriculture said that, in the light of the Cabinetsearlier discussion, he had explored with representatives of the horticultural industry the basis of a new policy for horticulture. Theyhad proved willing to welcome positive measures to improve theefficiency of the industry and, in return, to accept some reduction inthe protective tariffs. They had agreed that duties on the lesssensitive products should become negotiable immediately and thatthose on the more sensitive products should also become negotiableafter a period of not more than four years, provided that some formof safeguard against the import of foreign surpluses at unrealisticprices were retained. These proposals would improve the competitiveefficiency of the industry; and, by releasing the Government fromtheir unduly rigid pledge to give horticulture a measure of supportequivalent to that given to agriculture, they would provide the room for manoeuvre which we should need in forthcoming international legislation on tariffs. Subject to approval by the Cabinet and acceptance by the unions concerned, these proposals might be announced by a public statement on the lines of the draft annexed to C. (63) 176. It would be desirable, at the same time, to give the horticultural interests a formal assurance that &quot; the Governmentwould accept the same degree of obligation to maintain the well-being of the horticulture industry as they did for agriculture, and theGovernment would accept that this was a continuing obligation &quot;.In discussion it was suggested that, in order to obtain the fullbenefit of this favourable settlement, it would be desirable to place the main emphasis, in the public presentation of the proposals, onthe increase in efficiency which they should promote rather than onthe modification of the tariffs which they would involve. In subsequent negotiations with the unions we should seek to restrict the category of sensitive items as narrowly as possible; and it might also benecessary to have special regard to the interests of commonwealth and colonial producers, e.g., Malta, when the time came to reconsider the preferences on horticultural products with which they were particularly concerned.The Cabinet Approved, subject to the points made in their discussion,the proposals in C. (63) 176.Opening In discussion of the draft circulated under cover of C. (63) 174Speech various amendments were proposed and approved. It was agreedthat paragraph 12 should be strengthened by a reference to theexpansion of the economy, to which further consideration shouldbe given by the Ministers concerned. Paragraph 13 should refer inmore positive terms to the Governments initiative in putting forward proposals for improving the arrangements for international payments.References to severance pay and rates should be considered in due course in the light of policy decisions on those topics.The Cabinet (2) Invited the First Secretary of State to circulate, forconsideration at a subsequent meeting, a revised draftof the Opening Speech, taking account of the points raised in the discussion.
Severance 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordPayments President (C. (63) 169) on a proposal that the Government should(Previous introduce a scheme of severance payments for long-service employees.Reference:C.C. (63) 52nd The Minister of Labour said that informal contacts with leadingConclusions, representatives of industry had confirmed him in the view that the minute 4) Government should promote a scheme of this kind and that heshould now open formal discussions with both sides of industry forthis purpose. Moreover, he believed, in opposition to the majorityof the Economic Policy Committee, that, unless these discussions were based on an undertaking by the Government to introduce thenecessary legislation, it would be impossible to persuade theemployers and the trade unions that the Government were in earnestin intending to deal with the problem of redundancy. For the samereasons he also believed that the scheme to be put forward for detailed examination should cover all long-service employeesdischarged for reasons other than misconduct, not merely those whowere technically redundant. Provided it was realised, however, thatthe trade union representatives on the National Joint AdvisoryCouncil would certainly press for the wider interpretation, he wouldbe prepared to limit his proposals in the first instance to redundancyonly.In discussion the following points were made:(a) It would be unwise to commit the Government to legislation at the present stage. It would be difficult to draft an appropriate Bill,particularly if it had to comprise all employees discharged after a qualifying period of service. There would also be political objectionto imposing on small traders and shopkeepers the administrative andfinancial burdens which a comprehensive scheme for severancepayments would involve. On the other hand a scheme limited to technical redundancy would also be liable to provoke political criticism, if only because it would exclude employees who were obliged to retire voluntarily (for example because of ill-health),together with employees discharged after the age of 65. It might notbe easy to defend these apparently arbitrary distinctions.(b) There was little doubt that both the employers and the tradeunions attached greater importance to a scheme for graduatedunemployment benefits than to a scheme for severance payments.But the complexities of graduated benefit arrangements and the radical change which they would involve in the present basis ofnational insurance would preclude their introduction during thepresent Parliament. The result of promoting discussions limited toseverance payments might, therefore, be merely to stimulate a demandfor a graduated benefit scheme; and, when it became clear that theGovernment would be unable to meet this demand, the credit whichthey might otherwise have gained from a severance payments scheme might be largely lost.(c) It might suffice to demonstrate that the Government were inearnest as regards severance payments if a suitable reference, which need not contain a specific commitment to introduce a Bill, were included in The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament.After further discussion the Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Labour to discuss with bothsides of industry the desirability of dealing with theproblem of redundancy by a system of severancepayments for long-service employees.(2) Invited the Minister of Labour, in consultation with theChief Secretary, Treasury, the Minister of Pensions and national Insurance and the other Ministers concerned,to consider the terms in which the governments intentions in this respect should be announced in the queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament.
&quot;io ao o uRates(previous reference:C.C. (63) 17thConclusions,Minute 7)6. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Secretaryof State for Scotland (C. (63) 172) and the Minister of Housing andLocal Government (C. (63) 167) about rates.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that therate demands which would be issued in the following April would inevitably disclose an increase of the order of 5-7 per cent in theaverage householder^ liability. This would provoke renewedresentment in certain areas of the country and would involve hardship to individual householders. It would have been preferable, before deciding on remedial action, to await the report of the committeewhich had been appointed, under the chairmanship of ProfessorAllen, &quot; To assess the impact of rates on householders in differentincome groups in different parts of Great Britain, with special regardto any circumstances likely to give rise to hardship &quot;. But this report was not likely to be available until the summer of 1964; and theGovernment must therefore decide whether to take no action in anticipation of its findings or to adopt, by legislation which would need to be introduced before Christmas, temporary measures designed to remove the most serious inequities during the interval before the report was received. Such measures, however, should not attempt to hold next year&apos;s rates at their present level. This coursewould be prohibitively expensive; it would establish a dangerous precedent; and it would involve the provision of additional Exchequerassistance indiscriminately to lightly-rated areas as well as to areas where the burden was heavy. Interim action must therefore be on a selective basis; and it might take the form of:(i) modifying the general grant formula to provide that nolocal authority&apos;s share of the grant, when expressed interms of so much per head of population, should fall below a stated proportion (e.g., 85 per cent) of the national average;(ii) increasing the grant to those areas where the proportionof old people was high (e.g., on the basis of an additional 5 for every old person in excess of a ratio of 100 per1,000 of the population);(iii) empowering local authorities to remit rates in cases of individual hardship, where the rate demand for 1964-65was at least 25 per cent and  5 higher than that for1962-63, on the basis that the local authority would carry the cost of remission up to the yield of a penny rate and the Government would contribute thereafter on a scale rising to 66f per cent on expenditure above athreepenny rate.These measures might not be welcomed either by the localauthorities, on whom they would impose additional administrativeburdens, or by the individuals affected, who would have to be requiredto submit to some form of means test in order to establish hardship.Moreover, the total cost to the Exchequer, at some  13 million,would appear relatively trivial in comparison with the likely increaseof some  100 million in the total rate levy in the following year,about half of which would fall on householders. Nevertheless, theproposals in C. (63) 167 constituted the most effective interim schemeof relief which could be devised.In discussion it was suggested that these proposals were open to objection on the following grounds :(a) The revaluation which had taken effect in Scotland in1961-62 had produced cases of hardship similar to those now inquestion. But the Government had refused to intervene; and the agitation against the increases had gradually died away. If theGovernment now yielded to similar pressure in England and Wales,
a corresponding concession would have to be made in Scotland; butthe Government would then be open to challenge on the reason why they were now belatedly granting a relief which they had resolutelyrefused two years earlier. For these reasons it would be wiser tomake no concession at this point and to deal with complaints of hardship and inequity by reference to the enquiry being conducted by Professor Allen and to the Governments intention to investigate the possibility of transferring some part of the burden of expenditure from the ratepayer to the taxpayer.(b) The National Assistance Board, in assessing claims to national assistance, would automatically make allowance for anincrease in rate demands. It would be administratively confusing if local authorities were required to conduct simultaneously a new and separate test of hardship.(c) In so far as the proposed measures were directed to ensurethat no local authority&apos;s share of the general grant should fall belowa specified proportion of the national average, they would be seen to be devised for the particular benefit of a limited number of authorities including, e.g., Bournemouth, Eastbourne and Blackpool which, although adversely affected by the recent revaluation, were still low-rated areas by comparison with other parts of the country.On the other hand there were cogent political arguments forconceding some measure of relief on a selective and discriminatorybasis, provided that it was presented as an interim measure pendingthe report of the Allen Committee and the institution of theGovernment^ own enquiry into the possibility of transferringexpenditure, particularly in the case of education, from the rates tothe Exchequer. Alternatively, it might be possible to ease the positionof local authorities by increasing some other form of Exchequersubvention to local expenditure, e.g., the Police grant.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in consultation withthe Home Secretary, to give further consideration to thepossibility of increasing the Police grant as a means ofproviding a measure of assistance to local authorities inrelation to the forthcoming increase in rate demands.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,3rd October, 1963.
