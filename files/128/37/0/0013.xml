11 isC.C. 13 (63)Organisation The Cabinet had before them a Note by the Prime Ministerfor Defence     (C. (63) 27), covering a report by Lord Ismay and Sir Ian Jacob onthe higher direction of defence.The Prime Minister said that this report represented the lateststage in a progressive evolution of our defence organisation, extending over many years. In 1904 the Esher Committee had recognised that defence problems required to be dealt with comprehensively; andthe Committee of Imperial Defence had been established for thispurpose. In 1923. as a result of the Salisbury Committee, the Chiefsof Staff Committee had been created. In 1940 the Chiefs of staff had assumed a direct responsibility to the Prime Minister and theMinister of Defence. As a result of experience during the 1939-45war the Ministry of Defence had been set up in 1946; but, althoughthe need for unified Ministerial direction of defence policy and administration had been recognised, the machinery then establised for achieving it had proved to be inadequate. In 1958 the functionsof the Minister of Defence had been redefined; but the occasion had proved inopportune for any more radical reform.There was continuing evidence that the present system did not satisfy current requirements. Control over defence spending was not fully effective; the formulation of an integrated defence policy was still hampered by the natural tendency of the three Services to considerproblems of national defence from their separate and individual points of view; and the management of the defence research and development programme had proved to be an intractable problem.He had therefore invited the Minister of Defence, towards theend of 1962, to undertake a major review of defence organisation.In the course of this review the Minister had enlisted the help ofLord Ismay and Sir Ian Jacob, whose report the Cabinet now had before them. The fact that Lord Ismay and Sir Ian Jacob had beenasked to advise the Government was already known. It was important, however, not to let it be inferred that they had submitted a formal report; otherwise there would be pressure for its publication.On the substance of their report there were two main issues for decision. The first concerned the machinery for the formulation of higher defence policy, the main proposal being that various measures should be taken to make the Defence Committee a more effective instrument for policy discussion. It was clearly right inprinciple that fresh efforts should be made to improve the working ofthe Committee; and he would consider how far, and by what means,effect should be given to the recommendations in the report.The second, and more difficult, issue concerned the machineryfor the execution of decisions on higher defence policy. The reportdiscussed three alternatives an adjustment of the existing organis-ation, which would leave its basic structure unchanged; an extensionof the Ministry of Defence to include the three Service Ministries assubordinate departments; and a completely integrated andfunctionally organised Ministry of Defence. The authors of thereport had felt that a mere adjustment of the existing organisation would be insufficient; and experience confirmed their view that more radical changes were required. At the other extreme, however, itwould be unwise at this juncture publicly to endorse, even as along-term aim, the concept of complete integration of the three services under the control of a functionally organised Ministry, Sodrastic a change would be regarded by public opinion as liable to inflict grave damage on the corporate traditions and loyalties onwhich the morale and fighting spirit of the forces so largely depended.It would entail the further disadvantage that any intermediate course which the Government might adopt for the immediate future wouldbe criticised as falling short of the solution which they themselves would have admitted to be the most effective.SECRET2395-5 a 2
REGRETFor these reasons the second of the three possible coursesdiscussed in the report appeared to be the most appropriate. Underthis system the navy, the army and the air force would retain theirseparate identities; and the Chiefs of Staff would remain the professional Heads of their respective Services, retaining theirentitlement to advise the Minister of Defence and the Governmentboth individually and in their corporate capacity as members of theChiefs of Staff Committee. The three Service Departments, however,would be brought together in a unified Ministry of Defence; andtheir Ministers would be subordinated to the Minister of Defence.The position of the Ministry of Aviation in a new organisationof this kind would need further study. It was common ground thatthe present arrangements were unsatisfactory; but there was noagreed view on the alternative and Lord Ismay and Sir Ian Jacobhad made no recommendation on the point.The Minister of Defence endorsed the Prime Ministers remarksand said that the Service Ministers and the Chiefs of Staff also agreed in principle to the adoption of the organisation which the PrimeMinister had described. But, if this reform was to succeed in itsobjectives, it was essential that the Ministry of Defence should be accomodated in the same building as the central staffs of the subordinate Departments. It would also be important to ensure to the Ministers in charge of those Departments a status which wouldenable them to answer authoritatively to Parliament for theadministration of their respective Services. The principles of thenew organisation might conveniently be announced in the courseof the Defence Debates starting on 4th March.In discussion there was general agreement that the concept of a unified Ministry of Defence on the lines proposed by the PrimeMinister was sound and should be adopted. The following main points were made:(a) Although it would probably be right to refrain from any public reference to the possibility of complete integration of theServices even as a long-term aim, this possibility should be kept inmind. A growing body of opinion, both in the Services and amongthe informed public, tended to favour this solution; and it might ultimately prove both possible and desirable to adopt it.(b) Although the Service Departments would probably retain their individual Accounting Officers, the Service Ministers would nolonger have the same degree of ultimate responsibility for theexpenditure of their respective Departments as at present. It would nevertheless be important to invest them with sufficient authority toensure that, although subordinate to the Minister of Defence, theywould be able to relieve him of the responsibility for the day-to-day administration Of the Services.(c) Without prejudice to the future organisation of the Ministryof Aviation it would be desirable to arrange forthwith for the Ministryof Defence to play a greater part in the formulation of policy in thefield of scientific research and development for military purposes.(d) The public presentation of the new policy raised important political issues. Its detailed implications remained to be examined;and it was unlikely that a realistic plan of reorganisation could bepublished !for some months. If, in these circumstances, theGovernment announced only the principles of the reorganisation inthe forthcoming -Defence Debates, they might be driven on to the defensive&apos;by questions which they would be unable to answer. Onthe other hand, delay might be more damaging. Apart from the factthat the Opposition would probably take the opportunity providedby the debates to put forward comprehensive proposals of their own,&quot;the nature of the recommendations made by Lord Ismay and Sir IanUacdb would gradually -become &apos;known and the Government wouldthen be in a HWOfse.position than if they had taken the initiative in
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,27th February, 1963.announcing their intentions in terms of their own choosing. Thefact that the details of the new organisation had not yet been settledwas not necessarily a disadvantage; it could be suggested that in so important a matter the Government had thought it right to profitfrom discussion in Parliament and elsewhere before taking final decisions. It would be necessary, however, to indicate clearly fromthe outset the principles on which any final organisation would bebased, particularly the maintenance of three Services with theirseparate identities within a unified Ministry of Defence.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that the central organisation for defence should be reinforced by:(a) The adoption of measures, on the lines suggested inPart I of the report annexed to C. (63) 27, toimprove the arrangements for the formulation ofdefence policy.(b) The adoption of measures, on the lines indicated inSection B of Part II of the report annexed toC. (63) 27, to strengthen the control exercised bythe Minister of Defence over the execution of decisions in the field of defence policy and toextend the Ministry of Defence to include theService Ministries as subordinate departments, thethree Services retaining their separate identities.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would give furtherconsideration to the action required to give effect to conclusion (1) (a) above.(3) Invited the Minister of Defence to arrange for an examinationof the action required to give effect to Conclusion (1) (b)above, including the provision of integrated accom-modation for the relevant sections of the Ministry ofDefence, the Service Departments and, where appropriate,the Ministry of Aviation.(4) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for an enquiry into the future organisation of the Ministry of aviation in the light of the considerations indicated inthe Report annexed to C. (63) 27, without prejudice tothe immediate introduction of arrangements designed toenable the Minister of Defence to exercise more effective control over decisions in the field of research anddevelopment for military purposes.(5) Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the minister without Portfolio, the Chief Whip and other ministers concerned, to give further consideration, in the light oftheir discussion, to the public presentation of the new policy for the organisation of defence indicated inConclusion (1) above.
