tn71 U 6ParliamentChief AnthonyEnahoro2. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the HomeSecretary (C. (63) 36), and the Lord Chancellor (C. (63) 37 and 40)about the return of Chief Anthony Enahoro to Nigeria for trial.The Home Secretary said that Chief Anthony Enahoro, who wasaccused of treasonable felony and related offences in Nigeria, had been arrested in London on a provisional warrant issued at the request ofthe Nigerian Government and was now in prison, pending a decisionon the question whether he should be returned to Nigeria underSection 6 of the Fugitive Offenders Act, 1881. Whereas extraditioncould be refused in cases of political offences, no such limitationattached to the Act of 1881. But the Secretary of State&apos;s power toreturn a prisoner was conditional on his being satisfied that it was just to do so. This made it the more important to obtain assurances that, if Chief Enahoro were returned to Nigeria, no political obstacleswould be put in the way of his being defended by the counsel of hischoice. This point had been raised both in the Divisional Court andin the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords, whose protectionChief Enahoro had sought at an earlier stage. An undertaking hadbeen given to the Divisional Court on behalf of the Government of nigeria that, if the Chief Justice of Nigeria authorised a Britishcounsel to appear for the applicant, entry would not be denied to theindividual in question merely because he was to appear on the applicants behalf. This undertaking, however, was not unqualified;and the United Kingdom High Commissioner in Nigeria had been unable to obtain from the Prime Minister of Nigeria the furtherassurance that Chief Enahoro would in fact be freely allowed theservices of the counsel of his choice. In the absence of such an assurance it was difficult to avoid the conclusion that the trial mightbe unfairly weighted against the defendant; and in these circumstances it could not be held that the return of Chief Enahoro to Nigeria wouldbe &quot; just &quot; in the sense intended by the Act of 1881.The Lord Chancellor said that no person could be returned underthe Fugitive Offenders Act unless there were a strong and probablepresumption of his guilt. In Chief Enahoro&apos;s case this presumptionhad been accepted by the Courts before which he had appeared inthis country; and it was against that background that the presentissue should be judged. It had been implied that if, on his returnto Nigeria, he were denied the services of a British counsel. ChiefEnahoro would not receive a fair trial. But this assumption wasunjustified: there were many competent advocates in Nigeria andsome of the other defendants in the current treason trial had alreadybeen acquitted. Moreover, in some Commonwealth countries Britishcounsel were not allowed to plead at all; but this did not automaticallyimply that all requests from such countries for the return of offendersshould be refused.The Minister of State for Commonwealth Relations said that a refusal to return Chief Enahoro to stand his trial could have a veryserious effect on our relations with Nigeria. The nigerian government would regard such a step, especially after the DivisionalCourt and the Appeals Committee of the House of Lords had refusedto grant Chief Enahoro relief, as a political act which called in question the integrity of their judicial procedures and amounted to seriousinterference in their internal affairs. The Chief Justice of Nigeriamight well feel obliged to resign from the Judicial Committee of the privy Council; and it was unlikely that a British advocate would everbe allowed again to plead in a Nigerian court.C.C. 15 (63)I. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
3. The Minister of Agriculture said that, in the latest discussions in connection with the farm price review, the representatives of the farmers&apos; Unions had continued to seek a larger increase in milkprices than the Government could afford to concede. But the rejection of their demands would be unwelcome to them; and it would thereforebe desirable, in the interests of narrowing the area of disagreement, toconsider some further adjustment in other parts of the review, withthe objective of leaving the situation unchanged instead of seeking to secure the reduction of nearly  2 million which the Cabinet hadenvisaged in their previous discussion. It was relevant that importantagreements had been reached with the farmers, or were about to bereached, on pigs and eggs, outside the scope of the review. Theagreement on pigs would result in a saving of some  6 million notreflected in the review figures.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for theEconomic Policy Committee to consider how far it wouldbe reasonable to make further concessions on individual commodities included in the farm price review, with the objective of securing a final settlement which would involvethe minimum of change in the existing position.Farm price review,1963-64(previous reference:C.C. (63) 14thConclusions,Minute 3)In discussion the following points were made:(a) Since the Divisional Court and the Appeals Committee had accepted the undertaking given on behalf of the Government cfNigeria, it would be difficult for the Government now to argue thatthe undertaking was inadequate. Nor would it be right to let it besupposed that our real reason for refusing to return Chief Enahorowas a suspicion that the Nigerian Government would allow political considerations to influence the administration of justice. This wouldbe an unwarranted imputation.(b) It followed that it would be wrong to seek to insist on an unqualified assurance that Chief Enahoro would be allowed thecounsel of his choice. It would be reasonable, however, to informthe Nigerian Government that we intended, if necessary, to interprettheir undertaking that &quot; counsel would not be refused entry merely because he was to appear on the applicants behalf &quot; as meaning thatentry would not be refused to a counsel of Chief Enahoro&apos;s choiceexcept for reasons e.g., of public health which had no political implications. If the Nigerian Government agreed that we mightpublicly interpret their undertaking in these terms, there would beno objection to the return of Chief Enahoro to stand trial.(c) It would be desirable, however, to defer action on these linesfor a few days, since there was some possibility that the treason trialin Nigeria might collapse on the grounds that the defendants hadno case to answer.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the foreign secretary, the Lord Chancellor, the Minister of State for commonwealth Relations and the Attorney-General, toconsider the terms in which the United Kingdom HighCommissioner in Nigeria might be instructed to confirmwith the Prime Minister of Nigeria that the undertakingrecently given to the Divisional Court on behalf of the nigerian Government was to be understood as meaningthat, if Chief Anthony Enahoro was returned to Nigeria,he would not be denied, for political reasons, the servicesof counsel of his own choice, subject only to the consent cfthe Chief Justice of Nigeria.
MilkMarketingBoardManufacturingInterestsC.C. 15 (63)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (63) 34), reporting that the economic policy Committee had failed to reach agreement on a proposal thatthe Milk Marketing Board should purchase the creameries of UnigateLimited at a price of about  20 million.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, if this transactiontook place, the Board would produce more than half of the UnitedKingdom output of butter and almost half of the United Kingdomoutput of cheese. Nevertheless, the Government should seek, in theinterests of efficiency, to encourage the formation of larger units ofproduction and marketing; and there was no reason to suppose thatthe Board would not manage the expanded business efficiently.Moreover, the Government had no power to forbid the proposedpurchase. On balance, therefore, they should acquiesce in the transaction.In discussion, there was some support for this point of view.Even the increased output of butter and cheese would represent no more than a small proportion of total United Kingdom consumptionof these commodities; and there would therefore be no question ofthe Board&apos;s establishing a monopoly. Moreover, the Board had no intention of seeking to acquire the shares of Unigate Limited; theywere concerned only to acquire certain of the company&apos;s assets byagreement and it would therefore be possible to rebut any allegationthat the transaction represented a breach of the Governments policy on State trading by maintaining that it was no more than an extensionof the principle of co-operative trading in a field in which the board were already engaged. If the Board had proposed to devote 20 million of their resources to the construction of creameries, there could have been no objection; it was not easy to see why theGovernment need intervene if the Board proposed to achieve thesame end by the purchase of existing creameries.On the other hand, the transaction would undoubtedly attractpolitical criticism, especially since the board of Unigate Limited were apparently divided on the desirability of the sale of their assets. Ifthe Milk Marketing Board sought to resolve this difficulty by making an offer for the whole of Unigate&apos;s business, which was valued atsome  59 million, the political objections to the transaction wouldbecome more formidable. Moreover, the Board were financed bya statutory levy on milk producers; and it could be argued that theyshould not feel free to use the proceeds of this levy for a transactionof the kind in question without first consulting the producersthemselves. Relations between the producers and the Board were,on the whole, satisfactory. But this was less true in the case of othercomparable Boards; and it might be undesirable to establish a precedent by allowing a Board to proceed, in a matter of this magnitude, without reference to the interests on which it dependedfor its finance.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that itwould be clearly wrong to acquiesce in any arrangement whereby the milk Marketing Board acquired the whole of the Unigate enterprise.The arguments in relation to their acquiring only the creamerieswere more nicely balanced. The Government should thereforerefrain, so far as possible, from becoming involved in the finaldecision, provided that they made it clear to the management of theBoard that, in the Governments view, they should not proceed further in the matter without ascertaining that they had unanimous supportof the Board as a whole or, if the Board were divided, taking steps toascertain the views of the milk producers.
Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Minister of Agriculture, to consider the terms in whichthe Milk Marketing Board should be advised that theGovernment would see no objection in principle to theiracquiring the creameries of Unigate Limited, provided thatthey were satisfied that this transaction would be acceptable to milk producers in general.Valuationfor Rating(previous reference:C.C. (62) 21stConclusions,Minute 2)5. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Minister of housing and Local Government (C. (63) 35) and the Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster (C. (63) 39) about the rating system.The Minister of Housing said that the revaluation due to take effect in the following month and the heavier rate call which wouldhave to be made by some local authorities in order to meet increasingexpenditure had given rise to a renewed demand for a measure of de-rating for house property in certain areas and for an independent enquiry into the rating system. Since the impact of revaluation onhouseholders had proved to be less severe than had earlier beenfeared, it would be right to continue to refuse to consider the de-ratingof house property. But it might be desirable that he should indicate,in answer to Questions in the House of Commons that day, that theGovernment would institute a factual survey of the impact of ratingon different sections of the community, with special reference to the hardship which might be suffered by certain householders. It wouldbe unwise, however, to give any encouragement to the view that some new source of local revenue, more equitable in its incidence than rates,could be devised. It would be equally inappropriate to undertake to institute any form of independent enquiry into the wider question ofthe desirability of transferring to the taxpayer some part of the burdenat present borne by the ratepayer. This was a matter of policy, whichthe Government themselves must decide.In discussion, there was general agreement that proposals for local de-rating of house property should be rejected. But the issuesunderlying the demands for an enquiry into rating were of major importance. Rating could be argued to be a less fair means of raisingrevenue than taxation; and, although the proportion of local expenditure borne by the rates had not risen, in real terms, as steeplyas that expenditure itself, the total rate burden must now be consideredvery high. Much of the increased expenditure was attributable to services, such as education, in which local participation was ofparticular importance; and a case could be made out for theGovernment itself to undertake a thorough examination of the way in which the rating system was now developing. But, in so far as itmight be necessary to indicate that the Government might be preparedto contemplate an enquiry of this kind, it should be made clear thatthey could not usefully consider the question until they had studiedthe results of the projected factual survey of the impact of rating on various sections of the community. Meanwhile, further thought should be given to the desirability of eventually commissioning an enquiry into the rating system and the related question of the proportions in which revenue should be raised from the ratepayerand the taxpayer respectively.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government, inanswering Parliamentary Questions that day about rating,to be guided by the points made in their discussion.(2) Agreed to consider at a later meeting the form and scope ofa possible enquiry into the rating system.
Tribunals 7.   The Minister without Portfolio said that the rejection ofof inquiry       appeals by two journalists who had been convicted for refusing toDisclosure of    disclose their sources of information to the tribunal established undersources of       the Tribunals of Inquiry Act, 1921, in connexion with the Vassallinformation     case would be liable to stimulate public discussion of a number ofdelicate issues, including the relationship between representativesof the Government and the Press on confidential matters.  It mightbe helpful if an early indication could be given of the governments attitude towards these questions.In discussion, it was generally agreed that it would be unwise toencourage hopes of any early amendment of the law governing thepowers of the Courts to require the production of evidence. It would first be necessary to give very careful consideration to the nature and scope of any alteration of this kind. It would not be inappropriate,however, to indicate that the Government were fully aware of theimportance of the issues involved. -The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Minister without Portfolioand of the points made in their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,7th March, 1963.Bank Staff 6.   The Minister of Labour said that the National Union ofAssociations Bank Employees had recently complained to the InternationalLabour Organisation (I.L.O.) that, in breach of a Convention to whichthe United Kingdom was party, the staff associations at some bankswere not free trade unions. The appropriate I.L.O. Committee had considered this issue and the governing body was likely to ask him toset up an enquiry into the complaint. He proposed, subject to the cabinet&apos;s agreement, to do so. It had been ascertained that no substantial objection would be raised by the banks mainly concerned;and an enquiry might help to improve relations between the rivalstaff associations in the banking world and to secure nationalnegotiating machinery for the Clearing Banks.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Labour to establish an enquiry into the organisation and functioning of Bank staff associations.
