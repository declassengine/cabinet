LordDenning&apos;sReport(previous reference:C.C. (63) 54thConclusions,Minute 1)NATO :multilateral force(previous reference :C.C. (63) 55thConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the position of theGovernment in relation to the forthcoming discussions in washington and Paris on the technical and political aspects of the project toestablish a multilateral nuclear force within the North Atlantic treaty organisation (NATO).The Prime Minister said that the Foreign Secretary would shortlyhave to discuss with the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Rusk,whether the United Kingdom Government should participate in these discussions and, if so, on what basis. The instructions to the foreign secretary for this purpose might conveniently be in three parts. Thefirst part would consist of a minute from himself to the foreign secretary, dealing with certain political aspects of the project whichwould not appropriately be mentioned in a formal directive whichmight in due course have to be published. The most important ofthese would be the probable impact of the multilateral force, if itwere created, on the prospects of a further move towards an East-West detente, particularly in relation to such possibilities as the non-dissemination of nuclear weapons, measures for the prevention of surprise attack and a non-aggression pact. The Foreign secretary should ensure that full weight was given to these considerations inhis private discussions with the President of the United States andMr. Rusk.The second part of the instructions would consist of an informalstatement of the Governments position, emphasising the domesticpolitical difficulties with which they would be faced if they couldbe held, by participating in the forthcoming discussions, to have committed themselves to contribute to the multilateral force itself.These considerations should be impressed confidentially on the UnitedStates Government.* Previously recorded as a Confidential Annex.*1. The Prime Minister said that both the British broadcasting corporation and the Independent Television Authority werearranging for television programmes, dealing with the issues raisedby Lord Denning&apos;s Report, to be presented on the evening ofThursday, 26th September, the day of the reports publication. the leader of the Opposition, Mr. Harold Wilson, M.P., and Mr. Wigg,M.P., would probably take part in both programmes. It was forconsideration whether members of the Government should alsoparticipate. If they abstained, the Opposition spokesmen might been abled to present to public opinion a partial view of the implications of the report. On the other hand it might be thought undesirable that the Government should take part in public discussion of thereport before it had been debated in Parliament. The balance ofadvantage, however, probably inclined in favour of Ministers taking part in the programmes; and it would also be advisable that all ministers, and perhaps a few other individuals likely to be involvedin public discussion of the report, should be provided with guidance on the main questions to which its publication was likely to give rise.In discussion there was genera! agreement with these views.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Lord President and the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster should take part in the forthcomingtelevision programmes dealing with issues raised by LordDenning&apos;s Report.(2) Invited the Minister without Portfolio to prepare, for theinformation of Ministers and other individuals concerned,guidance on the main questions to which publication ofthe report was likely to give rise.
It then remained to decide whether the third part of theinstructions i.e., the formal directive, which could, if necessary, formthe basis of a published statement of the Governments attitudetowards the project should, or should not, commit us to take partin the discussions, in the light of the fact that their terms of referenceconfined participation to countries which were &quot; seriously interested &quot;in creating the force and were prepared &quot; to enter into detailed discussions with that end in view &quot;.In discussion there was general agreement that, in spite of thedanger that participation in the discussions might be held to implysome degree of commitment to contribute to the force if it werecreated, it would be preferable, on balance, that the United KingdomGovernment should be represented. A refusal on our part to take any part in the discussions might prevent the force from coming into being at all. But this was unlikely; and, if the force were created in a form in which its effective control would rest with the Governmentsof the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany, a dangerous situation would arise. If we had refused to take part inthe discussions now in question, we should have deprived ourselvesof the opportunity of averting this risk and of influencing thedevelopment of the force on more acceptable lines.On the other hand if we were to take part in the discussions,we should do so on a basis which would not only make it whollyclear that we remained uncommitted to participate in any multilateral force which might be created but would also allow us to bring forward for re-examination the broad strategic objections to the conceptwhich had hitherto been ignored by the United States government but might now be reinforced by a recent change in the attitude of theUnited otaics ^mcis ui oiau.In further discussion it was agreed that the formal directive tothe Foreign Secretary should be in the terms of the memorandum annexed to these minutes.The Cabinet (1) Approved a statement, in the form of the memorandum annexed to these minutes, as a directive to the foreign secretary for his forthcoming discussion with the UnitedStates Government about possible participation bythe United Kingdom Government in the proposed international discussions about a multilateral NATOnuclear force.(2) Invited the Minister without Portfolio, in consultation withthe Foreign Secretary and the Minister of Defence, toprepare guidance for the Press on this matter.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (63) 158) on future policy in relation to the export ofarms to South Africa.The Home Secretary said that on 7th August the Security Councilof the United Nations had adopted a resolution calling for the cessation of the sale and shipment to South Africa of arms andammunition of all types and military vehicles. This resolution, whichwas not mandatory, had been supported by all members exceptFrance and the United Kingdom. The United kingdom representative on the Security Council, however, had given anundertaking that the United Kingdom would allow no arms tobe exported to South Africa which would enable the policy ofapartheid to be enforced. In these circumstances the Committee onthe Export of Arms to South Africa had recommended that we shouldcontinue to supply ships, naval aircraft, naval ammunition and other equipment which was required for the protection of the Cape searoutes and could be defended as consistent with the spirit of the simonstown Agreement; that we should not accept any future orders
EnsembleBerliner 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theForeign Secretary (C. (63) 154) about the circumstances in which theUnited Kingdom Government had been unable to accept anapplication by two members of the Berliner Ensemble for permission to attend the Edinburgh Festival Drama Conference.The Foreign Secretary said that this decision had beenunavoidable in the light of the policy agreed in the North atlantic treaty Organisation (NATO) which required members of NATOto refuse to issue temporary travel documents to any East Germansexcept those who wished to travel for genuine purposes of trade or private affairs or were participating as &quot;all German &quot; representatives in international scientific or sports meetings. This policy had beenadopted by NATO as a means of exerting pressure on the east german regime and of protesting against the erection of the BerlinWall.In discussion it was suggested that there was no precedent for refusing on political grounds to admit bona fide visitors to the UnitedKingdom. Current NATO policy was the more objectionable in thisrespect in that it involved an indefensible distinction between businessmen, scientists and sportsmen on the one hand and artists on theother hand. Moreover, travel by Germans within the two Germanieswas not equated with foreign travel; and the Berliner Ensemble hadbeen permitted to perform in West Germany.In discussion it was agreed that any departure from agreed NATOpolicy would be liable to arouse criticism from the Federal GermanGovernment and our other allies. Nevertheless, there was littlejustification for continuing the present restrictions; and the UnitedKingdom Permanent Representative on the North Atlantic council should continue to press for their further relaxation, particularly asregards artists of established international reputation.The Cabinet (1) Took note of C. (63) 154 and of the points made in discussion.C.C. 56(63)for small arms, related ammunition and other types of equipment which could clearly be used for riot control; that decisions on suchitems as tanks, aircraft and artillery should be taken individually inthe light of circumstances at the time, on the understanding that,whereas we should hesitate to supply tanks and armoured fighting vehicles, we should look favourably on any reasonable request for both fighter and transport aircraft; and that we should put ourselves in a position to prevent, if necessary, transhipment in our ports ofarms and military equipment of types which we ourselves would refuse to export to South Africa.In discussion there was general agreement with these proposals.It was suggested that there would normally be considerable objectionto the supply of tanks and armoured fighting vehicles but that requests for aircraft should be considered on merits.The Cabinet (1) Took note with approval of C. (63) 158 and of the points made in discussion and invited the Home Secretary, as chairman of the Committee on the Export of Arms to south Africa, to arrange for the necessary action to betaken accordingly.(2) Agreed that any public statement of the Governments policy on the export of arms to South Africa should adhereclosely to the words used by the United kingdom representative on the Security Council in his explanation of vote on 7th August, 1963.
(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to instruct the United kingdom permanent Representative on the North Atlantic Councilto press for a progressive relaxation of the restrictions onthe issue of temporary travel documents to East Germans,particularly as regards artists of established internationalreputation.Hill Cow 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSubsidy Minister of Agriculture (C. (63) 157), reporting the results of a surveyinto the payment of the hill cow subsidy to farmers in England andWales.The Minister of Agriculture said that this subsidy was paid to farmers who kept breeding cows on land consisting predominantlyof mountains, hills or heath. The recent survey had shown that, ona strict application of the present rules of qualification, the subsidyought to be withdrawn from 1,700 of the farmers in England andWales who now received it. Although this conclusion was not disputedby the County Agricultural Executive Committees in the countiesconcerned and by the Hill Farming Advisory Committee, the subsidyrepresented a substantial part of the income of some of the small farmers who would be affected and its withdrawal would be a seriousblow to them. It should therefore be continued on the present basisduring 1964, in order to allow these farmers time in which to effect a change in the pattern of their production, which would in manycases involve conversion to dairy farming. But it would be difficult,consistently with the findings of the survey, not to withdraw thesubsidy in 1965.In discussion it was suggested that there were considerableobjections to this proposal. In the case of many farms it might welltake longer than 15 months to effect a change in production; andin any event it was undesirable to stimulate dairy farming at a timeof over-production of milk. It would be preferable, therefore, to seek to redefine the conditions under which the subsidy might be paidin such a way as to preserve the entitlement of a reasonable numberof farmers, while excluding those whose claims were clearlyunacceptable. Alternatively, it might be desirable to continue thesubsidy on the present basis for a rather longer period than was proposed, in order to allow more time for the farmers affected to adjust themselves to the new conditions.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Agriculture to give furtherconsideration to the possibility of either amending theconditions of entitlement to the hill cow subsidy on thelines indicated in their discussion or extending payment ofthe subsidy on the present basis for a longer period than was envisaged in C. (63) 157.6. The First Secretary of State said that he had discussed with the Prime Minister of Nyasaland, Dr. Banda, the timing of the attainment of independence by the Territory. Dr. Banda had agreedthat the date for this purpose should be 6th July, 1964; but he had asked that the United Kingdom Governments acceptance of this date should be announced before his own departure for the UnitedStates later in the present week.The Cabinet Authorised the First Secretary of State to announce that theGovernment had accepted 6th July, 1964, as the date onwhich Nyasaland would attain full independence.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,24th September, 1963.Rhodesia and nyasaland(previous reference :C.C. (63) 55thConclusions,Minute 1)
AnnexMULTILATERAL NATO NUCLEAR FORCE:  STATEMENT OFHER MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTS position at their meeting in Nassau last December the President of the United Statesand the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom agreed to use their best endeavours to develop a multilateral NATO nuclear force, to which both the United Statesand the United Kingdom Governments would contribute national forces. As aresult, the United Kingdom Government have assigned the V-bomber force to this project and are pledged to make their Polaris submarines, when completed, availablefor inclusion in it for the purposes of international defence of the Western Alliancein all circumstances, except where they may decide that supreme national interests are at stake. In so doing they have discharged the obligation which they assumedat Nassau.On the same occasion the President explained to the Prime Minister that he also intended to propose the formation of a NATO mixed-manned nuclear force to which non-nuclear Powers could contribute.The United Kingdom Government have, from the outset, recognised theimportance of this further proposal. They have agreed that the conception is onewhich deserves examination, together with other possible means of developing the concept of a multilateral NATO nuclear force; but they have never given any undertaking to participate in the mixed-manned component, although they haveagreed to consider providing it, if it is formed, with operational facilities. It wasin this spirit that, at their meeting at Birch Grove in July, the President of theUnited States and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom agreed that various possible ways of promoting a closer association of the members of the NATOAlliance with its nuclear deterrent should be further discussed with their allies,on the basis that such discussions should include proposals for a mixed-manned force without prejudice to the question of United Kingdom participation in it.The terms of reference for the discussions now proposed, although specificallyreserving national decisions on participation in the mixed-manned force to individualGovernments, imply that those taking part will be prepared &quot; to enter into detailed discussions with that end in view &quot;. In the light of the attitude which they have consistently adopted towards this project, as indicated above, the United KingdomGovernment do not feel that they could, honourably and in good faith, enter these discussions on terms of reference which imply this degree of commitment inprinciple to participation in a mixed-manned force of surface ships, especially since they have publicly expressed doubts about the strategic value of a force ofthis kind in relation to the expenditure of resources which it would entail and this issue is now under examination in the context of the NATO strategic review.Nevertheless, the United Kingdom Government would be prepared to givewhatever advice and assistance they could contribute to an objective examinationof the project in all its aspects; and on this basis they would be ready to join in theproposed discussions.
