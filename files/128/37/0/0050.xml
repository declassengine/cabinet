FutureDefencePolicyAircraft CarrierProgramme(previous reference:C.C. (63) 48thConclusions,Minute 3)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Defence (C. (63) 141) on the aircraft carrier programme.The Minister of Defence said that in the course of their last discussion on this subject the Cabinet had invited him to provide further information on certain practical questions affecting an aircraft carrier replacement on which doubts had been expressed. He hopedthat, in the light of the reassurances contained in C. (63) 141, theCabinet would now accept the need to build one new carrier. A fleet of three carriers was the minimum required to support our presentstrategy during the 1970s; but, if one new carrier were not built, thecarrier fleet in the 1970s would be reduced to two vessels and it wouldbecome impossible to maintain a realistic military presence east of suez.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he still doubted the wisdom of basing our plans on the assumption that we should find itnecessary and practicable to maintain our present strategic rolesunaltered throughout the 1970s. Nevertheless, he accepted that there could be no question of abandoning any major role at present andthat a definite decision not to build another carrier would be interpreted as implying that we were preparing to abandon our military position east of Suez. But while, on this basis, he would beprepared to agree that a decision to build another carrier should nowbe taken and announced, it would be necessary to make it clear thatthe new carrier would replace the second, not the first, of the twoolder existing carriers to be withdrawn from service. By 1971,H.M.S. Victorious would be 30 years old; H.M.S. Ark Royal, on theother hand, had been commissioned in 1955 and, by 1971, would be only 16 years old. It should therefore be possible to extend the effectivelife of H.M.S. Ark Royal well into the 1970s; and the building datesfor the new carrier could be correspondingly deferred.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) Although H.M.S. Victorious had been completed in 1941, she had undergone a major modernisation in the mid-1950s. It was only as a result of that modernisation that it had been possible to extendher life to 1971. It was not proposed, however, to moderniseH.M.S. Ark Royal, since the results would not justify the cost. Byabout 1972, therefore, H.M.S. Ark Royal would have completed aslengthy service as H.M.S. Victorious at the time of the latter&apos;smodernisation and would have reached the end of her effective life.(b) Although it would be desirable, at the appropriate stage, to test the applicability of nuclear propulsion to warships, it would be unwise to adopt this experimental technique for the first time inrelation to so vital a defence requirement as the new carrier.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the aircraft carrier fleet should be maintained ata level of three ships during the 1970s.(2) Agreed that a new aircraft carrier should be built to replaceH.M.S. Ark Royal.(3) Authorised the Minister of Defence to announce these decisions in a statement in Parliament that day.(4) Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to give further considerationto the dates at which it would be necessary to place orders to give effect to the decision recorded at Conclusion (2)above.
2. The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet would wish to convey to the Lord President of the Council their congratulations onthe successful outcome of the recent negotiations between theGovernments of the United Kingdom, the United States and theSoviet Union on the conclusion of a treaty to prohibit the testing of nuclear weapons and to express to him their warm appreciation ofthe valuable part which he himself had played in these negotiations.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ statement.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,30th July, 1963.nuclear tests(previous reference:C.C.
