SubjectFederation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland
Federation of rhodesia and nyasaland(previous reference:C.C. (63) 20thConclusions,Minute 2)The Cabinet had before them the text of a letter from the PrimeMinister of Southern Rhodesia, Mr. Winston Field, to the first secretary of State (circulated under cover of C. (63) 62), requesting that Southern Rhodesia should be given full independence as soonas either Northern Rhodesia or Nyasaland had been allowed tosecede from the Central African Federation or to obtain itsindependence.The First Secretary of State said that it had been clear for sometime that it would be impracticable to seek to maintain the federation in existence against the wishes of the constituent Territories. It hadbeen his chief object in the recent discussions with representativesof the Federal Government, of the Government of Southern rhodesia and of the Government Parties in Northern Rhodesia to obtain agreement to the proposal to convene a formal conference to discussthe future relationship between the Territories when the Federationhad come to an end. The Government Parties of Northern Rhodesiahad said that they would not attend such a conference unless their claim to secede from the Federation was conceded in advance. Inthe light of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on 28th March, 1963, this requesthad been met. Mr. Field had now demanded a similar recognitionof his country&apos;s right to independence, failing which he would refuseto attend the conference.Mr. Field&apos;s request was in fact based on a misunderstanding.There was no connection between secession and independence. a territory could secede while still leaving the Federation in being;independence, on the other hand, could not be attained until theFederation itself had been formally brought to an end. But, while itwould on these grounds be possible to leave the timing of the attainment of independence by Southern Rhodesia for later discussion,it would not be possible to avoid a decision in principle; the Colony&apos;claim to independence would have to be.either admitted or refusedwhen he replied to Mr. Field&apos;s letter.There were powerful arguments in favour of conceding the claim.Southern Rhodesia had enjoyed effective self-government for the past40 years and. but for the creation of the Federation, would have obtained its independence in 1955. If the claim were rejected,Mr. Field would refuse to attend the proposed conference on futurerelationships with Northern Rhodesia and might seek closer association with the Union of South Africa instead. Finally, so longas we retained some responsibility for the conduct of southern rhodesian affairs we should be expected to exercise an influence on her domestic policies which we did not in fact possess; in this lightthe grant of independence would merely recognise a situation which already existed.On the other hand, the grant of independence at this stage mightbe held to condone the racial policy of the present Government ofSouthern Rhodesia; it had been our past practice not to grant independence to any territory until fully representative forms ofgovernment had been established. Recognition of SouthernRhodesia&apos;s claim to independence under her present constitution would be liable to have serious repercussions on our relations withother Commonwealth countries, on our standing in the united nations and on public opinion in this country, where it would be widely considered that the Government had evaded a moralresponsibility to the African population in the Colony.On balance, it would probably be right to deal with the question in the context of a general statement, indicating that it had been our aim throughout the recent negotiations to hold a fair balance betweenthe Territories of the Federation and to bring them on this basisthrough the constitutional processes leading to eventual independence;that the question of independence for Southern Rhodesia would fallSECRET2830-1 a 2
to be considered when the Federation was finally brought to an end;but that its timing and its circumstances remained for discussion.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The first step would be to persuade Mr. Field that independence for Southern Rhodesia would have to be preceded bythe dissolution of the Federation and could not be linked withsecession by either of the other Territories. On this basis it would beto his interest to co-operate in the forthcoming conference, whichwould have an important part to play in bringing the Federation toan end. But it was unlikely that Mr. Field would agree simply to postpone the issue. Moreover, some initiative to reassure theEuropean population in Central Africa was now required; all the concessions which the Government had made hitherto had been infavour of the African Nationalist Parties.(b) To concede a claim to independence in terms which mightbe held to imply acceptance of the present Constitution in SouthernRhodesia would be liable to have a profoundly damaging effect on public opinion in this country and elsewhere. It would be necessaryto indicate that the Government would seek to introduceconstitutional changes at the appropriate moment. It was unlikelythat the Government of Southern Rhodesia would agree to changes of the radical kind which would be necessary to satisfy publicopinion in this country or elsewhere; and any attempt to introduce such changes would involve a risk that Southern Rhodesia wouldunilaterally declare her independence. In the last resort this riskmight have to be accepted; but it should not be too readily assumed that the Government of Southern Rhodesia could not be persuaded to accept some liberalisation of the present Constitution. From thispoint of view it would be important to gain time.(c) Under the normal constitutional process a territory couldnot proceed to independence without a formal independenceconference. If the normal procedure were followed in SouthernRhodesia&apos;s case, the independence conference would provide thenatural forum for discussion of changes in the Colony&apos;s Constitution.But, in view of the fact that Southern Rhodesia had enjoyed effectiveself-government for so long a period, this course would not necessarily be practicable.(d) If Southern Rhodesia&apos;s claim to independence were admittedin terms unacceptable to the leaders of the Government Parties inNorthern Rhodesia, the latter might again refuse to attend theconference about future relationships between the Territories whichit had been the main object of the present negotiations to convene.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theGovernment could not evade their residual responsibility for the welfare of the African population in Southern Rhodesia; it would therefore be wrong to admit Southern Rhodesia&apos;s claim to independence without at the same time indicating that we should need to discuss with the Government of the Colony at the appropriate time the introduction of more representative forms of government.But the views of the large and settled European population couldnot be set aside; and it was this factor which made the situation in southern Rhodesia one of peculiar difficulty. It should not, however,be assumed that the Europeans in Southern Rhodesia would lightlybreak away from the United Kingdom and declare their independenceunilaterally; the risks in such a.course would be evident to them.Nor would the concept of a closer association with South Africacommand general support in the Colony; on the contrary manyEuropeans in Southern :Rhodesia were in favour of the progressiveintroduction of more liberal racial policies. Given time and reasonable goodwill, the! Government of Southern Rhodesia mightwell agree to consider: further constitutional development as a conditionof final independence. It should not be impossible to concede theColony&apos;s claim to independence in terms which would induce her
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,2nd April, 1963.to attend the forthcoming conference on future relationships betweenthe Territories but to indicate at the same time that constitutional changes would be required before independence could be finallygranted. The Cabinet should resume their discussion of the subjectwhen a reply to Mr. Field&apos;s letter had been drafted on these linesfor their consideration.The Cabinet Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation withthe Lord Chancellor, to prepare a draft reply to the PrimeMinister of Southern Rhodesia on the lines indicated by thePrime Minister and to circulate it for consideration at a later meeting.
