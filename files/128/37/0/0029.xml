industrial 1.   The Minister of Transport informed the Cabinet that the disputes National Union of Railwaymen (N.U.R.) appeared anxious to avoidRailways implementing the strike action which they threatened to take in protest against the redundancy and resettlement implications of the railwaysmodernisation plan and, as the result of further discussion with theBritish Railways Board, were ready to accept that the Board couldnot reopen the agreement already reached on the question of increasedresettlement payments. On other issues, however, the Board had adopted a sympathetic attitude towards the N.U.R.&apos;s proposals; andthe only major question outstanding was the Union&apos;s request thatthe Board should ensure that railwaymen aged over 60, who weredeclared redundant under the modernisation plan and could not find work in their own localities, would continue to receive payment for a period of up to five years. The Board were prepared to contemplate some extension of the arrangements for continuedpayment beyond the 52 weeks envisaged under the Redundancy and transfer Agreement; and they contemplated an extension, subjectto negotiation, up to two years. It was now for consideration whetherthe Government should endorse negotiations on this basis.In discussion it was suggested that, in the interest of maintaining a favourable climate of opinion for the modernisation plan, theGovernment should not adopt a more restrictive attitude towardsthe N.U.R.&apos;s proposals than the Railways Board, especially sincethe cost of accepting those proposals was not likely to be great. Onthe other hand, public opinion would be liable to interpret a settlement on the basis suggested as indicating that the Government wereprepared to capitulate to the threat of a railway strike, which theN.U.R., alone of the three railway unions, were seeking to use as a means of enforcing their demands. It was unfortunate that the board had already allowed themselves to be maneouvred into a position inwhich it appeared that the only point on which they were now a tissue with the N.U.R. related to the treatment of men aged over 60,an issue on which they would be least likely to command public sympathy and support. It would be desirable, therefore, that theyshould now issue a statement, indicating that they fully appreciated the unfortunate consequences of a national railway strike, that they remained ready to discuss the implications of the modernisation planbut that such discussions should comprise all three railway unions and could not be initiated under the threat of a strike. The statement should make it clear that, as soon as this threat had been removed,the Board would be ready to enter into discussions, through thenormal machinery of negotiation, on all the matters outstandingbetween themselves and the N.U.R., apart from the question of increased resettlement payments.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Transport to arrange for the issueof a public statement by the British Railways Board on thelines indicated in their discussion.Parliament 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
Foreign AffairsUnited arab republic(previous reference:C.C. (63) 28thConclusions,Minute 2)Jordan(previous reference:C.C. (63) 28thConclusions,Minute 2)3. The Foreign Secretary said that the other member governments of the Central Treaty Organisation, with whom he had recently discussed the formation of the new Federal State comprisingEgypt, Iraq and Syria, were apprehensive that this union was theprelude to fresh Egyptian aggression. While this might be true, therewere already signs of tension, both in Iraq and in Syria, between theBa&apos;ath faction and those who were prepared to accept Egyptiandomination; and it would be premature to assume the stability ofthe new State. In these circumstances the Government of Iran had raised no objection to our proposal that we should meet the recentIraqi request for the supply of military equipment and training facilities; and action for this purpose should now be taken as rapidly as was reasonably possible, subject to reconsideration, if necessary,if the pro-Egyptian faction in Iraq gained the ascendancy.The Cabinet (1) Approved the supply of military equipment and training facilities to the Government of Iraq in response to their recent request.The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that, in the lightof the increasingly precarious situation of the Jordanian Government,we were examining, in consultation with the Government of theUnited States, certain measures of contingency planning. The scope for effective action was, however, more limited than on the lastoccasion when we had intervened in Jordan, in 1958. It was unlikelythat, if the Government of Israel sought to occupy the territory onthe West Bank of the River Jordan, we should be able to take any action to restrain them; nor could we seek to prevent the overthrowof the Government of Jordan as the result of an internal revolution.If they were threatened with external attack, however, we might beable to ensure a temporary stabilisation of the position, pendingaction by the United Nations; but, even in this eventuality, the maininitiative would have to rest with the United States.The Cabinet (2) Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Greece The Foreign Secretary said that, in the light of the demonstrationsagainst the Queen of Greece during her recent visit to this country,the Greek Government had requested that we should publiclyreaffirm the value which we attached to the friendly relationship between the United Kingdom and Greece.In discussion it was agreed that this request had probably beenprompted by internal political motives. In principle, we should beprepared to make a suitable response.The Cabinet (3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider how best toindicate publicly that the United Kingdom government attached importance to maintaining friendly relations withthe Government of Greece.British Guiana The Commonwealth Secretary informed the Cabinet that an(Previous attempt by the Government of British Guiana to enact a LabourReference: Relations Bill had provoked widespread industrial strikes and that,C.C. (62) 44th as a result, the situation in Georgetown had deteriorated to a pointConclusions, at which it might soon become necessary to declare a state ofemergency. The necessary forces had been alerted against this contingency.Minute 4)The Cabinet-(4) Took note of the Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s statement.
Federation of 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the FirstRhodesia and Secretary of State (C. (63) 78), seeking authority for the preparationNyasaland 0f a Bill empowering the Government to provide for the dissolution(Previous of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland and related questions.Reference *C.C. (63) 27th The First Secretary of State said that the Government were conclusions, already committed to the enactment of legislation providing for the minute 2) secession of Nyasaland from the Federation before the summer recess and that such legislation would necessarily have to comprise,in addition, provisions for consequential alterations in the relationship between Northern and Southern Rhodesia. But, now that theGovernment had accepted, in their statement of 29th March, 1963,the principle of secession for the other two Territories, it was clearthat the scope of the legislation must be even wider and that the bill would need to enable the Government to provide for the secessionof any Territory, for the dissolution of the Federation, for anytransitional and consequential arrangements that might be required and for the establishment, so far as possible, of any new form of relationship between the Territories which might be agreed. The bill would be essentially an enabling measure and should therefore be drafted in sufficiently broad terms to give the Government fullfreedom of action. The detail of such action would be provided forby Order in Council, to be made under the enabling Act. It would bedesirable to inform the Federal and Territorial Governments of our intentions and to allow them to comment on the contents of theBill before its enactment.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) So long as it remained uncertain whether the dissolution ofthe Federation could be achieved with the co-operation of the otherGovernments concerned or would need to be imposed by the UnitedCameroons(previous reference :C.C. (61) 36thConclusions,Minute 6)4. The Foreign Secretary said that the President of the cameroons, who was at present visiting the United Kingdom, had indicated his concern at our decision to terminate commonwealth preference on bananas exported from the Cameroons to the UnitedKingdom. He had asked that it should be extended for a further year after its expiry on 30th September.In discussion it was suggested that, since the Carneroons had themselves decided not to remain within the Commonwealth, theycould not reasonably expect to continue to receive preferential treatment. Moreover, a concession on this point would be opposed by the West Indies; and, even without the benefit of commonwealth preference, bananas from the Cameroons would enjoy an advantage in the United Kingdom market over supplies from other countries,e.g., South America, inasmuch as they would still enjoy free entry.On the other hand, it was for consideration whether, if wemaintained Commonwealth preference on bananas from the cameroons for a further period, we might secure reciprocal tradeadvantages in the Cameroons. Moreover, it was not clear how adecision to terminate preferences could be reconciled with our offer to provide additional development aid for the Cameroons.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theCommonwealth Secretary, the Chief Secretary. Treasury,and the Parliamentary Secretary, Board of Trade, to arrangefor the circulation of a memorandum discussing theeconomic policy which we should seek to adopt in relationto the Cameroons.
Government 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisterOffices of Public Building and Works (C. (63) 76) about the future of theThe Foreign    Foreign Office building.Office Building(Previous The Minister of Public Building and Works said that further reference:      examination of the scheme to modernise the services of the existingC.C. (60) 19th building, which had been announced in the autumn of 1962, had conclusions,    shown that it was open to greater practical objections than had been minute 3)      thought. It would provide less office space than the Foreign Officeneeded (and would therefore make it necessary to find an additional100,000 square feet elsewhere) and, in spite of expenditure whichmight rise well above the present estimate of  2 million, working conditions for the staff would still be unsatisfactory. He had thereforereached the conclusion that it would be wiser to demolish the presentbuilding and to replace it by a new building, capable of housing thewhole of the Foreign Office and Commonwealth Relations Office onthe present site with more efficient working conditions. The cost ofKingdom Government, it would not be easy to draft, even in general terms, a Bill conferring on the Government adequate powers to dealwith any situation which might arise.(b) An Order in Council on so contentious an issue would itselfneed to be the subject of specific Parliamentary approval, probably by means of the Affirmative Resolution procedure. This might seriously limit the Governments ability to proceed by Order inCouncil in relation to a situation which developed while parliament was in Recess.(c) The introduction of a Bill giving effect to the secession of nyasaland would bring to a head the question of the future status of Southern Rhodesia, since the Government of the Colony haddemanded independence as soon as either of the other Territoriesseceded from the Federation but still showed no disposition to acceptthe constitutional changes which we were inclined to regard as a pre- -condition of independence. It would be impracticable to introduce legislation dealing with Nyasaland alone, since this would provoke ademand from Northern Rhodesia for corresponding legislation in her own favour. If, on the other hand, we deferred the introductionof any legislation until we had reached agreement with theGovernment of Southern Rhodesia on the future status of the Colony,we might fail to honour our understanding with Nyasaland and might also find ourselves, possibly during the summer Recess, without thenecessary legal powers to deal with a critical situation. This dilemmawould need to be considered further when the Government ofSouthern Rhodesia had replied to the latest letter from the first secretary of State.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the First Secretary of State to instructParliamentary Counsel to prepare, for enactment beforethe Recess, a Bill enabling provision to be made by Orderin Council (subject to Affirmative Resolution) for thesecession of any Territory from the Federation of rhodesia and Nyasaland, for the dissolution of theFederation, for the making of any transitional andconsequential arrangements which might be required and for the introduction of provisions, so far as mightbe necessary and acceptable, for any new form of relationship between the Territories.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion when the Government ofSouthern Rhodesia had replied to the recent letter fromthe First Secretary of State about the future status ofthe Colony.
Disarmament 7.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Foreign(Previous        Secretary (C. (63) 79), seeking authority to put forward certain reference:      proposals to the Disarmament Conference at Geneva, subject to theC.C. (62) 38th agreement of the United States and the North Atlantic TreatyConclusions,    Organisation.Minute 1)The Foreign Secretary said that the conference was now close tobreakdown. It would probably be necessary in any case to adjourn the present round of discussions; but it was still undecided whetherthe adjournment should be indefinite, in which case it was doubtfulwhether the conference would ever reassemble, or whether it shouldbe for a defined period after which discussions would be resumed.If the conference were to break down completely, the issue of disarmament would be raised in the United Nations; and the major powers would be criticised for their failure to reach any measure ofagreement, however small.such a building would be at least  7 million. Work could not be started for five years, if only because the Home Office at present occupied part of the block to be demolished and the new building in Bridge Street, into which they were due to move, would not becompleted before 1968.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) If it were decided to commission a new building, there wouldbe advantage in throwing the design open to competition as widely aspossible, in order to encourage entries from young architects. Thefirst stage of the process would require the production of no morethan sketch designs; and it would be necessary to seek to persuade the Royal Institute of British Architects to agree that, despite thepractice normally prescribed by their restrictive regulations, thepurpose of the initial competition in this case would be merely toelicit promising designs without any prior commitment that any ofthose submitted would necessarily be carried forward to the stage of construction.(b) On the other hand, the experience of previous competitionshad not been encouraging, in that they had tended to yieldconventional and unimaginative designs. It might be better for theGovernment to decide the style in which the new building was to be constructed and thereafter either to select an architect who had shownoutstanding ability in that style or to limit the field of competition toa small number of architects with a similar qualification. 1 here mightbe considerable support for a building of fully contemporary design.(c) The timing of the announcement of any decision on the futureof the Foreign Office building would need careful consideration. Itwas already clear that the rent of the new building in Victoria Streetto house the Board of Trade would be even higher than had beenoriginally expected; and a proposal at this stage to embark on afurther programme of expensive building might.evoke considerableParliamentary and public criticism. It would be desirable to give further consideration to this aspect of the question in the light bothof the recommendations of the Committee under the chairmanship of Lord Plowden, which was examining the future organisation ofthe Foreign Office and the Commonwealth Relations Office, and ofthe report of the enquiry into the dispersal of GovernmentDepartments which was being conducted by Sir Gilbert Flemming.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion at a later meeting.
Local 8.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theGovernment     Secretary of State for Scotland (C. (63) 74), to which was annexed ain Scotland     draft White Paper on the Modernisation of Local Government inScotland.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that the draft white paper outlined proposals for the reorganisation of local authoritiesin Scotland on the basis of larger and more efficient units. The HomeAffairs Committee had commended the scheme in principle but were concerned at the possibility that some local authorities, especially theThe proposals in C. (63) 79 had therefore been prepared as apossible means of averting this risk. They fell into two categories, thefirst relating to the destruction of certain categories of armaments andthe second to measures designed to reduce the danger of surpriseattack. Although they were not in themselves far reaching, they mightsuffice to ensure the continuation or resumption of discussions atGeneva and might also lead on to consideration of wider measures of disarmament. Even if, as was probable, they were rejected by theSoviet Government, they would at least enable us to claim that wehad taken an independent initiative in endeavouring to reach some measure of agreement.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The proposal for the destruction of defined categories ofarmaments would, if accepted, be liable to expose us to considerablerisk. The Soviet and United States Governments had ample suppliesof surplus conventional armaments, which they could destroy withoutin any way affecting their operational capability. The United Kingdom,on the other hand, had comparatively few surplus armaments; and,if we undertook to participate in such measures on a proportionalbasis, we might be compelled to destroy armaments which we were currently producing in order to maintain our present military capability.(b) It was doubtful how far the destruction of surplusconventional armaments, at a time when the production of more modern equipment was proceeding unchecked, would be regarded asa serious contribution to disarmament. On the other hand, actualdestruction of armaments, on however small a scale, might have animportant psychological effect.(c) In view of the possible disadvantages to the United Kingdomof the adoption at this stage of agreed measures for the destruction ofarmaments, it might be advisable, in any public presentation of our proposals, to place more emphasis on the suggested measures toreduce the danger of surprise attack.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, inview of the importance of ensuring, if possible, the continuation of discussions at the Geneva Conference, the Minister of State forForeign Affairs should indicate to the conference the possibility thatwe might wish to put forward proposals of a kind which would justify the resumption of discussions after an agreed interval; but heshould avoid too definite a commitment at this stage and should refer only in the most general terms to the destruction of definedcategories of armaments.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to instruct the Minister ofState for Foreign Affairs to be guided, in the proceedingsof the Geneva Conference on Disarmament, by the considerations indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up.
9. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president of the Council and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster(C. (63) 77) about the further action to be taken on the Report of theJoint Select Committee on House of Lords Reform.The Lord President said that in the recent Parliamentary debatesit had been apparent that, subject to a few minor points, therecommendations of the Joint Select Committee were acceptable tothe majority of the supporters of the Government and of theOpposition in both Houses. Ministers had undertaken that, if parliament showed itself ready to accept the recommendations ofthe Committee, the Government would announce their intentionsbefore Whitsun and would introduce legislation during the present parliament. The Government should now announce, therefore, their intention to introduce a Bill to give effect to the recommendations ofthe Committee, subject only to three minor exceptions, namely, theunworkable recommendation that a peer who had surrendered shouldproduce a certificate of surrender to the returning officer; therecommendation that a candidate for election should be deemed, by accepting nomination, to have undertaken to surrender any peeragehe might inherit before the declaration of the poll; and therecommendation that a sitting Member should have only one month from his succession in which to surrender. It seemed right that, wherea candidate succeeded during an election, he should, if elected, beHouse ofLordsReform(previous reference:C.C. (63) 6thConclusions,Minute 6)C.C. 29 (63)smaller burghs, might oppose it. The majority of the authorities,however, would accept the proposals. The smaller burghs whichwould lose their identity accounted for only 8 per cent of thepopulation of Scotland; and it was generally recognised that theywere too small to function efficiently.He proposed to adopt the traditional Scottish method of appointing working parties, with the co-operation of the localauthority associations, to examine the details of the proposals. Hewould also consider representations from individual local authoritiesand public bodies. There was no demand in Scotland for a processcomparable with the English procedure of inquiry by local government commission; and the procedure he proposed would probably beaccepted as in keeping with the Scottish pattern of administration.In view of the time which must be allowed for these consultations,it would be unrealistic to think in terms of legislation during the lifetime of the present Parliament. But it might be desirable to publish the White Paper before the Recess both in order to remove the uncertainty created by the knowledge that he was studying there organisation of local government and in order that the government might be given the credit for undertaking a reform which was widely recognised to be overdue.In discussion it was suggested that, while any opposition from local authorities might not declare itself until the details of theproposals had been examined, it would be unwise for the Governmentto commit themselves to the proposals in the draft White Paper unless they were assured of the support of the Scottish Unionist members inthe House of Commons.The Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland:(a) to discuss the proposals in the draft White Paper annexed toC. (63) 74 with the Scottish Unionist Committee;(b) to report to the Cabinet, in due course, the result of had discussions under (a) above.
given the same time as a sitting Member in which to make his decision;that a sitting member should be given an extension of time in caseof illness; and that time should not run while Parliament wasprorogued or adjourned for more than a short period.Four points of substance had attracted some attention in the debates: the right of a peer who had surrendered, together with hisrelatives, to use a title; the position of Irish peers; the possibility of subsequent ennoblement after surrender; and the special case ofLord Longford. On all these points it appeared desirable, on balance,that the Bill should give effect to the recommendations of the joint select Committee; but it might be necessary to have regard to anystrongly expressed feeling which might manifest itself in the debatesthat surrender should not be a bar to subsequent ennoblement.In the course of discussion it was generally agreed that, whileit was a matter for regret that the sympathy attracted by individual cases should lead to a measure which might gradually reduce thevitality of the Second Chamber by discouraging able individuals fromaccepting succession, the public support for the recommendations ofthe Joint Select Committee was sufficiently clear and widespread tomake it desirable for the Government to implement them, with the minor exceptions now proposed.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposals outlined in C. (63) 77about the further action to be taken on the Report ofthe Joint Select Committee on House of Lords Reform.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to informthe Leader of the Opposition, in advance of a government statement, of the points on which it was proposed to depart from the recommendations of the Joint SelectCommittee.(3) Invited the Lord Chancellor to give authority for a Bill tobe drafted, with a view to its introduction as soon aspossible.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,9th May, 1963.
