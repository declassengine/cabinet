ForeignAffairsSomalia(previous reference:C.C. (63) 16thConclusions,Minute 2)Export ofLargeDiameterSteel Pipeto the soviet union(previous reference:C.C. (63) 11thConclusions,Minute 6)2. The Foreign Secretary said that, as one consequence of their decision to terminate diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom,the Government of Somalia had demanded that the relay stationoperated by the British Broadcasting Corporation (B.B.C.) at Berbera,on which at present all the Corporation^ services to the Middle Eastdepended, should be closed. They had agreed, however, that the equipment could be dismantled and removed; and this would clearly be preferable to its passing into the possession and control of theGovernment of Somalia.In addition, we had now lost the right to overfly Somalia. Thiswas not of critical importance, since alternative routes existed. Thegeneral situation, however, was likely to deteriorate further,particularly since the Ethiopian Government had already strengthenedtheir forces on the Somali border. We had decided to withdraw ourconsular representatives from Somalia, in the interests of their safety;and it was for consideration whether we should ask for the SomaliConsulates in Aden and Nairobi to be similarly withdrawn.In discussion, it was agreed that, while the provision of major economic aid to Somalia from the United Kingdom should nowcease, it would be right to allow Somali students at present in thiscountry to continue their studies and to maintain our support forcertain minor projects in Somalia, such as locust control.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the British Broadcasting Corporation relaystation at Berbera should be dismantled and removed.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation withthe Foreign Secretary and the other Ministers concerned,to examine possible alternative sites in the Middle Easton which the station could be re-erected.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for furtherconsideration to be given to the policy to be pursued bythe Government in relation to the Horn of Africa.The Foreign Secretary said that the Federal Government ofGermany had now taken steps to prevent the export of large diametersteel pipe to the Soviet Union in conformity with the recommendationof the North Atlantic Council. In these circumstances it was increasingly doubtful whether British firms should be permitted to export pipe of this kind to the Soviet Union.The President of the Board of Trade said that only two british firms were known to be in contact with the Soviet authorities aboutthe possible export of large diameter pipe. But both the degree ofinterest and the quantities involved might increase substantially asa result of the German decision. The Government had power, ifthey so decided, to prohibit the exports in question by imposingexport licensing on defined categories of steel pipe.The Cabinet Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, as chairman of the strategic Exports Committee, in consultation with theForeign Secretary and the President of the Board of Trade,to arrange for an immediate review of the desirability ofpermitting exports of large diameter steel pipe to the soviet union in present circumstances and to report theCommittee&apos;s conclusions to the Cabinet.C.C. 17 (63)Parliament ]    7ne Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.
Representa-tion of the vatican inthe UnitedKingdom(previous reference:C.C. (63) 14thConclusions,Minute 6)3. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that he had given further consideration to the proposal that the Government should accept an Internuncio as the representative of the Vatican in theUnited Kingdom. He was satisfied that action which might be interpreted, even if erroneously, as implying recognition of thetemporal authority of the Pope might be regarded as liable to prejudice the favourable development of the current movement towards closerspiritual relations between the Churches. It would be premature,therefore, to proceed further with the proposal at the present juncture,although it might be expedient to reconsider it at a later date.The Cabinet Agreed that no further action should be taken, for the timebeing, to give effect to the proposal that the Governmentshould accept an Internuncio as the representative of the vatican in the United Kingdom.Monsieur 4,   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeBidauit Secretary (C. (63) 49) on the action to be taken should M. Bidaultseek admission to this country or effect an illegal entry.The Home Secretary said that M. Bidault or one of his principalassociates might request asylum in this country, having either soughtpermission to land here or effected illegal entry. A refusal of asylumwould represent a departure from our traditional practice in thisrespect; and, although it would be preferable to arrange, if possible,for M. Bidault to be sent to some country other than France, it mightbe necessary in the last resort to admit him to the United Kingdom.In discussion there was general agreement that to grant M. Bidaultor any of his principal associates the right to remain in this country might have serious political repercussions. Experience had shownthat it would be impracticable to allow him to do so under conditions,since they could not easily be defined and would be difficult to enforce.On the other hand, if he were openly sent here from some other country, international practice in this manner would entitle us toreturn him to that country; and, since he was at present in western germany, it would be advisable to inform the Federal GermanGovernment accordingly. If he succeeded in effecting an illegalentry or was detected in the act of attempting to do so, he shouldbe detained, pending further consideration of the problem by theCabinet.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with the HomeSecretary and the Attorney-General, to arrange for theFederal Government of Germany to be informed that,if M. Bidault or one of his principal associates arrived inthis country from Western Germany, he would be refused admission and would be returned to Western Germany.(2) Took note that, if M. Bidault or one of his principal associatesentered the country illegally, the Home Secretary would arrange for him to be detained and for the Cabinet to be consulted again.Federation of 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum (C. (63) 52)Rhodesia and by the First Secretary of State about the future of the Central AfricanNyasaland Federation.(Previous p-rst Secretary of State said that he had now succeeded inccer(e63?i2th arranging to hold discussions with representatives of the FederalConclusions Government and of the Governments of Northern and SouthernMinute 3) &apos; Rhodesia in the hope of securing their agreement to the terms onwhich a formal conference on the future association of the Territories
might be convened at a later date. It would be very difficult, however,to devise a basis for such a conference which would be acceptable to all the parties concerned. The Government of Southern rhodesia would probably favour the maintenance of some form of economicconnection between the Colony and Northern Rhodesia. But theywould also be likely to try to insist that Southern Rhodesia should begranted independence in the near future. This would be embarrassingin terms of our relations with other members of the commonwealth and with foreign countries; and. coupled with the increasinglyrepressive policies which the Government of Southern Rhodesia were adopting towards the African population, it might seriously impedeour efforts to foster any link between the Colony and northern rhodesia. We should therefore seek to defer a decision on the issueof independence for as long as possible and to persuade theGovernment of Southern Rhodesia to concentrate on the more immediate question of the nature and extent of their future association with Northern Rhodesia.African opinion in Northern Rhodesia would be primarily concerned to secure from us some recognition of the Territory&apos;right to secede from the Federation. Here again, we should seek toprevent their making our recognition of this right a precondition oftheir willingness to attend the conference on future association.The Federal Government would similarly attempt to make theirattendance at the conference conditional on our undertaking to preserve some form of political link between Northern and SouthernRhodesia. Such a link, however, would be unacceptable to both the territories. The Federal Government might seek to retaliate byvirtually breaking off relations with the United Kingdom Governmentand attempting to organise support for the maintenance of their ownauthority in Central Africa. In that event the United KingdomGovernment would face a very difficult situation.In discussion, there was general agreement that, in theforthcoming discussions with the Governments concerned, it shouldbe our objective to attempt to secure their attendance at a subsequentconference v/here the conditions of their future association could be examined in greater detail and without prior reservations on their part. But, if the purpose of such a conference would be to ensure theultimate dissolution of the Federation in its present form, we shouldbe more likely to secure the acquiescence of the Federal Governmentin this course if some form of political link between Northern and southern Rhodesia could be maintained as the basis of their future economic association. The Territories were unlikely, however, to be willing to contemplate anything more than an economic link; andthere was little hope of achieving, at least initially, any jointorganisation to give effect to a common policy on defence or external relations.The Cabinet (1) Invited the First Secretary of State to be guided, during his forthcoming consultations with representatives of theFederal Government and of the Governments of northern and Southern Rhodesia, by the considerations which had emerged during their discussion.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State to keep the cabinet informed of the progress of those consultations.
6. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of theCabinet (C. (63) 51), covering a copy of the Railways Board&apos;s Reportentitled &quot; i he Reshaping of British Railways&quot;, together with amemorandum by the Minister of Transport (C. (63) 53) to which was annexed the draft of a statement to be made on the Governmentsbehalf on 27th March, when the report would be published.The Minister of Transport said that the draft statement at annex I to C. (63) 53 took into account the views which had been expressed by other Ministers; and the passage about staff redundancyhad the agreement of the Board&apos;s Chairman, Dr. Beeching. in presenting the proposals publicly, in accordance with the arrangements described in Annex II to C. (63) 53, he intended to make it clear thatin the light of the Report the Government would for the first time beable to formulate a general policy for the co-ordination of public transport services of all kinds. In particular, he would draw attentionto the establishment of the National Transport Advisory Council andto the arrangements which had now been made for co-co-ordination between the Railways Board and the London Transport Board. Hewas satisfied that there was no statutory hindrance to an acceleration of the work which would fall to the Transport Users&apos; ConsultativeCommittees in connection with proposals to curtail or withdrawindividual railway services; and he would consider further the precise form which acceleration might take. So far as possible, proposalsfor closures would be considered, and decisions would be announced,in relation to areas as a whole rather than in piecemeal fashion.In discussion the Cabinet agreed a number of detailedamendments to the draft statement. It was suggested, in particular,that it should acknowledge the Governments obligation to ensurethat adequate alternative means of transport were available beforerailway services were reduced and, in general, to take a positiveinitiative in reshaping the roads and the road transport services bymeans of a comprehensive plan which would complement theRailways Board&apos;s proposals.In further discussion the following points were raised:(a) In the examination of the proposals for the railways and the formulation of a general policy for public transport services it wouldbe necessary to distinguish between those areas where, for socialreasons, an uneconomic railway line had to be maintained and those areas where closure of a line could be approved provided thattravellers who had relied on the railway would not be deprived oftransport. In addition, some areas could claim an improvement inbus services, irrespective of any curtailment of rail facilities. Insponsoring a national transport plan which would purport to take account of all these different circumstances the Government would need to strike a reasonable balance between the social and economic considerations involved; and they should not encourage theassumption that the Exchequer would necessarily subsidise the relief of every inconvenience which might be alleged to result from the implementation of the Railway Board&apos;s proposals.(b) Further consideration should be given to the possibility of accelerating the work of Transport Users&apos; Consultative Committees,through the establishment of panels or otherwise.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Transport, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister without portfolio, to incorporate in the draft statement to be madeon 27th March on the Report of the Railways Board the amendments agreed in their discussion and to include a reference to the general policy which would be formulated by the Government, on the basis provided by the Report,for the effective co-ordination of public transport services.
Valuationfor Rating(previous reference:C.C. (63) 16thConclusions,Minute 8)7. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had not yetcompleted his examination, in consultation with the ministers concerned, of the appropriate composition and terms of reference ofan inquiry into the rating system. He hoped to be in a position toreport further at the Cabinets next meeting.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.Pay ofMembers ofParliament(previous reference:C.C. (57) 47thConclusions,Minute 1)8. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster (C. (63) 50) and the Lord President of theCouncil (C. (63) 54) on the pay of Ministers and Members ofParliament.The Chancellor of the Duchy said that, although there could be argued to be a strong case on merits for an increase in the pay ofMembers of Parliament, it was more difficult to decide the appropriatetiming of such an increase and the method by which it would best be arranged. Immediate action by the Government, althoughpossibly acceptable to a substantial section of Parliamentary opinion,would be liable to be unfavourably regarded by the general public.An alternative course would be to seek the agreement of all Partiesto an increase in Members&apos; pay after the next General Election.But this would attract an unacceptable degree of odium to theGovernment. On balance, therefore, the Governments wisest coursewould be to make it clear that they had no intention of bringingproposals to increase Members&apos; pay before the present Parliament.In discussion the following points were made:(a) Special consideration would need to be given, in any revised proposals, to the position of members of the House of Lords and ministers and junior Ministers in that House.(b) An analysis based on movements in the cost of living since1912 snowed that a salary of  400 in that year would be the equivalent of  1,890 to-day. Increases of the order now in contemplation would therefore involve a radical change in the whole basis of remuneration of Members of Parliament and might be regarded as implying acorresponding change in their obligations and in the scope of their parliamentary duties.(c) A significant increase in Members&apos; pay at the present time would be liable to endanger the maintenance of the governments incomes policy.(d) In default of an increase in remuneration there might be advantage in considering some improvement of the benefits in kind to which Members were entitled. There might, for example, besupport for a concession under which the wives of Members wouldbe entitled to free travel to their husbands&apos; constituencies.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their discussion at a later meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,21st March, 1963.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport, in consultation with theLord Chancellor, the Secretary of State for Scotland andthe Minister for Welsh Affairs, to give furtherconsideration to arrangements for accelerating the examination of proposals for the curtailment orwithdrawal of railway passenger services and for thepublication of decisions on such proposals.
