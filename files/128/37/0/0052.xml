2. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the proposal toincrease the charge for school meals from Is. to Is. 3d.The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Education, said thatin the course of their earlier discussion the Cabinet had accepted inprinciple the case for the increase proposed. This rested on the risein the actual cost of school meals since the date of the last increase,the fact that wages had increased substantially in the interval andthe need to secure savings in expenditure on education wherever theycould reasonably be found. It had always been intended that theintroduction of the increased charge would be accompanied by more generous scales of remission for needy families. The Cabinet had decided not to announce the increased charge in July because ofthe political difficulty of making such an announcement so late in the session. It would now be impossible, for practical reasons, tointroduce the increased charge in October; it would still be possible,however, to introduce it at the beginning of November or at thebeginning of the spring term, 1964.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The more generous scales of remission proposed for Englandand Wales could not apply to Scotland, where local authoritiesalready enjoyed wide discretion. It was an unfortunate feature of theproposed increase that the effect would be most acutely and, onprecedent, permanently felt in the rural parts of Scotland, where theneed was greatest, but would have little effect in the industrial areas,where it was to be expected that the present very generous scales ofremission would continue.(b) Although it was important to secure such savings in the totalbill for education as might be practicable, it could hardly be doubtedthat the political reaction would be unfavourable. Even though theneed for economy in view of the general increase in the cost ofeducation might be accepted, it would be urged that improvements in general educational standards should not be secured at the expenseof children&apos;s meals. It would also be undesirable to introduce anincrease of this kind so late in the lifetime of the present Parliament.The Cabinet Agreed that, for the time being, no increase should be madein the charge for school meals.1. The Prime Minister said that the difficulties which had ledto the postponement of the formation of Malaysia from 31st august to 16th September had not yet been resolved. Apart from pointsstill in dispute between the Prime Minister of Malaya, Tunku abdul rahman, and the Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, itappeared unlikely that the Government of Indonesia would abatetheir hostility to the formation of Malaysia as a result of the findings of the recent United Nations Mission to the North borneo territories. He had authorised the Commonwealth Secretary toremain in Malaya for the time being to continue efforts to find a negotiated solution to these problems. But the possibility ofintensified guerilla warfare by Indonesia against the North borneo territories could not be excluded. He would discuss with the Ministerof Defence the steps which it might be proper to take to meet sucha situation.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Prime Minister.a 2
^ A Q* Previously recorded as a Confidential Annex.Pay of the *3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ChiefHigher Secretary, Treasury (C. (63) 147), on the pay of the higher CivilCivil Service     Service.(previous reference: The Chief Secretary, Treasury, recalled that a Standing AdvisoryC.C. (59) 15th Committee on the remuneration of the higher Civil Service had been conclusions. appointed to advise the Government, either at the GovernmentsMinute l) request or on its own initiative, on what changes were desirable inthe remuneration of the higher Civil Service. The Committee had made its first general review in 1958, reporting in January 1959;and its recommendations had been brought into effect from 1st February, 1959. The Committee had now carried out a furthergeneral review and had recommended increases ranging from 15 percent to 18 per cent for ranks of the Administrative Class fromAssistant Secretary upwards, with corresponding increases in other classes, to take effect from 1st August, 1963. The average increase was about 16 per cent. The aggregate cost would be about  2 million a year. These figures were substantial; but, as it was 4\ years sincethe last general review, they represented no more than the equivalent of an increase of 3-  per cent per year over that period. While itcould be argued that such an increase was in line with currentincomes policy, it was necessary to consider its possible repercussions on other groups and, in particular, upon the pay of ministers and Members of Parliament, the lower judiciary, members of nationalised boards, university teachers and the armed forces. Itwould be difficult, however, having set up the Standing AdvisoryCommittee, to reject or amend their recommendations unless therewere some overriding reason of national interest. He did not thinkthat there was any such reason in the present case.In discussion there was general agreement that therecommendations of the Standing Advisory Committee should beaccepted. The following main points were also made:(a) Interest in the pay of Ministers and Members of parliament would be revived by announcement of the new rates of pay for thehigher Civil Service; and it might then be difficult to hold to thedecision that no change should be made in the pay of Ministers or members of Parliament in the lifetime of the present Parliament.On the other hand the approach of the end of the present parliament might inhibit discussion of this subject in Parliamentary circles.(b) The Lord Chancel/or said that, when the previous general review had been made by the Standing Advisory Committee,consequential alterations had been made in the pay of the lowerjudiciary shortly after acceptance of the recommendations of theCommittee had been announced; and he understood that on other occasions in the past the need for a close relationship to bemaintained between the pay of the two groups had been recognised.If the increases now recommended for the higher Civil Service were applied to the lower judiciary, the pay of some of its members wouldbe brought close to that of some members of the higher judiciary.(c) It was noted that important pay negotiations were in progressin the engineering industry; but, since it was unlikely that these would reach a critical stage in the immediate future, there wouldbe little to be gained by postponing an announcement of the increases for the Civil Service. On the contrary, there might, on balance, be advantage in making the announcement as soon aspossible.The Cabinet (1) Approved the recommendations of the Standing AdvisoryCommittee on Remuneration of the higher Civil Servicereported in C. (63) 147.(2) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to arrange for anearly announcement to be made of the governments acceptance of the recommendations.
Severance 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePayments        Minister of Labour (C. (63) 148) on statutory provision for severancepayments.The Minister of Labour said that it had already been decided tointroduce during the next Session an Industrial Training Bill, whichwould include provision for the retraining of redundant workers.Legislation on severance pay would be complementary to these provisions and could form part of the Bill. This would be a naturalsequel to the Contracts of Employment Act and would conform withthe policy outlined by the Prime Minister in his speech in the Houseof Commons on 26th July, 1962, on raising the status and securityof workers. It would also be in line with the policy of extending bygeneral legislation the practices of good employers once these had become well established. He was therefore proposing that legislation should be introduced early next Session, as part of the industrial training Bill, to lay down minimum standards for payments to bemade by employers to long-service employees if they dismissed them before the normal age of retirement for any reason other thanmisconduct. The amount of the payments would depend on the lengthof service and age of the employee.In the Economic Policy Committee it had been suggested thatseverance pay would do less to encourage mobility of labour thana scheme under which unemployment benefits would be related tothe wages previously earned. In his view, however, there was room for provision of both kinds. Representatives of the employers hadadmitted in discussion that there was a case for a general severancepayments scheme on grounds of social justice. He believed that thetrade unions, although they had not pressed for legislation onseverance pay, would welcome his proposed provisions.There remained the question whether the proposed scheme should be limited to workers dismissed on grounds of redundancyor should cover workers dismissed for any reason other thanmisconduct. Since the underlying object was to improve industrial relations, he preferred not to limit the scheme to redundancy, since this must give rise to disputes and comparisons between thoseentitled to benefit and those not so entitled; on social grounds alsoa general severance pay scheme was to be preferred. The difference in cost, which was estimated at between  8 and  14 million for ascheme limited to redundancy and  12 to  20 million for a straightseverance pay scheme, was not great compared with a total wage and salary bill of some  17,000 million.In discussion a distinction was drawn between action designedto increase the mobility of labour and action to enhance the status of the worker. In the former case the need was to mitigate a drop in income. A severance payment would not necessarily succeed in doing this and would be redundant when a dismissed worker moved into a better-paid job. The appropriate provision to compensate for loss of income would be wage-related unemployment benefits. Itwould be impossible, however, to introduce a scheme on these lines in the lifetime of the present Parliament. On the other hand actionto enhance the status of the worker involved considerations of socialequity. It could be argued that, since employers normally recognisedlong and loyal service by non-manual employees, they should do thesame for manual workers. But on this basis it was difficult to seewhy  provision  should  be  confined  to  workers  discharged  as c.C. 52 (63)(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Lord Chancellor and other Ministers concerned, toconsider what consequential action might need to be takento adjust the pay of other groups in the public sector.
redundant and should not be extended, for instance, to those whoseservice was terminated by sickness, or even by age. Against this,however, it could be argued that action should be confined toextending the existing practice of good employers in cases where the job ceased to be available to the man and that there was no reasonin principle to make special provision for cases where for any reason the man ceased to be available for the job. Moreover, extension ofthe provisions to a wider field than redundancy would make themoverlap with national insurance benefits, with the attendant risk thatthey would eventually result in heavy expenditure.In further discussion the following main points were made :(a) Even under a straight severance pay scheme a distinctionwould be made between a worker who was dismissed because of sickness and one who resigned voluntarily on that account. It was difficult to see how such a distinction could be justified.(b) Conditions varied widely in different industries. In some,such as the railways, employees normally expected long and continuous employment. In others, such as certain branches of theconstruction industries or shipbuilding, a man might be employedby different firms in quick succession. But pay in the latter kind ofemployment already took account of its precarious nature, so that asystem of severance payments or unemployment benefit related toprevious wages would compensate twice over for this factor.(c) The prospect of obtaining a severance payment on dischargemight to some extent deter workers from leaving a declining industry,so that the impact of redundancy might be aggravated. On the otherhand, employers who already operated redundancy schemes claimed that these had proved beneficial to labour relations.(d) The details of the proposals, which included, for instance,provision for employers to be exempted from the general scheme in certain circumstances, would need to be further considered. Itwas likely that the work of drafting the provisions, for whichinstructions had already been given to Parliamentary Counsel withoutprejudice to the final decision, would reveal further points requiringdiscussion between Ministers.(e) The proposals had already been discussed in broad outlinein the National Joint Advisory Council, which includedrepresentatives of the British Employers&apos; Confederation, the TradesUnion Council and the nationalised industries. Time was now shortfor the necessary consultations on details; and it was desirable thatthese should proceed at once both to clarify the implications of theproposals and to prevent any delay in introducing legislation.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that itwas clear that no decision could yet be taken whether to introduce legislation on severance payments in the next Session and, if so,whether this should be limited to redundancy or should extend to workers dismissed for any reason other than misconduct. major questions of principle remained to be decided; and these would turnlargely on the practical value of severance and redundancy schemesas compared with the practical difficulties which arose in operatingthem. On these matters Ministers needed more advice. The Ministerof Labour should hold further consultations, in confidence, with representative employers for this purpose; and the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer should then arrange for the Ministers concerned toconsider the matter further and to report to the Cabinet. In the meanwhile Parliamentary Counsel should continue with the drafting of the legislative provisions as already instructed.The Cabinet (1) Took note of C. (63) 148 and of the points made in discussion.(2) Invited the Minister of Labour to arrange for further consultations to be held, in confidence, with representative  employers  on   the  practical  value  of
public expenditure(previous reference:C.C. (63) 47thConclusions.Minute 8)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the chief secretary to the Treasury and Paymaster General (C. (63) 140) onthe long-term growth of public expenditure in relation to theproposal that limits should be established to the rates of growth ofcertain major blocks of expenditure.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the rates of growth nowproposed for the major elements of public expenditure were set outin the Annex to his memorandum. These rates involved no newdecisions on policy, since they had been derived from an analysis of the existing forward programmes of the spending departments.It was, however, implicit in the proposal which the Committee on public Expenditure under Lord Plowden had originally put forward and the Cabinet had subsequently accepted in principle that anyproposal for significant additional expenditure must either be absorbed by adjustments elsewhere in its own block or be submittedto the Cabinet for decision.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The permitted rates of growth should not be regarded asbinding on departments in any formal sense. Their purpose was partly to show the present weighting of various blocks of public expenditure and partly to provide a background against which theCabinet could better assess the effects of particular proposals forincreased expenditure in any given block.(b) It might be found that in practice it would be difficult tosecure increases in one block at the expense of decreases in another;no realistic standard of comparison could, for example, be established between fields so diverse as education and roads. The establishmentof permitted rates of growth on the lines set out would nevertheless be of value by making it possible to assess more clearly the general economic consequences of any specific change in policy.(c) Particular difficulty attached to the proposal that defence expenditure, instead of being defined in terms of a permitted rateof growth, should be defined in terms of 7 per cent of the gross national Product. The acceptance of such a criterion would involvea major recasting of the present defence programme and theabandonment of certain important elements of our present strategywhich Ministers, after prolonged discussion, had recently reaffirmed.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the permitted rates of growth in certain majorblocks of public expenditure set out in C. (63) 140.(2) Agreed that proposals involving significant additional expenditure in any of the blocks so defined, which couldnot be absorbed by decreases in expenditure in otherparts of the same block, should be submitted to theCabinet for decision.(3) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in consultation withthe Minister of Defence, to consider a revised formula for the expression of a permitted rate of growth in defence expenditure.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,12th September, 1963.severance payments and the problems involved in operating schemes for such payments.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange forfurther consideration to be given to the form of provisions which might be enacted in the coming Session,in the light of the consultations held in accordance with conclusion (2) above, and to bring this matter before theCabinet again for consideration at a later meeting.
