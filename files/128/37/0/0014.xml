Parliament ].   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inParliament in the following week.foreign affairs the Yemen(previous reference:C.C. (63) 11thConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that we had recently been compelled to evict a band of Yemeni tribesmen fromthe territory of the Aden Federation. The Yemeni authorities had made an isolated attempt at reprisal by air against a British medicalpost.In discussion it was generally agreed that, in view of the factthat the frontier between the Yemen and the Aden Federation had never been authoritatively demarcated, we must expect incidents ofthis kind, which had recurred at intervals over many years, tocontinue. But, having regard to the support which the republicanregime in the Yemen now enjoyed from the United Arab Republic,it might be necessary to watch developments with some care.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation with theForeign Secretary and the Commonwealth Secretary, wouldgive further consideration to the policy which theGovernment should adopt in south-west Arabia.Farm price review,1963-64(previous reference:C.C.(63)11thConclusions,Minute 7)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the chief secretary, Treasury (C. (63) 32), reporting the outcome of discussions with the Farmers&apos; Unions about the annual review of farm prices for1963-64.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the proposal which hadinitially been made to the Farmers&apos; Unions would reduce theExechequer cost of agricultural support by about  11-3 million.The unions had responded with proposals for substantial increases in farm incomes, partly at the expense of the Exchequer and partlyat the expense of consumers. The Farm Price Review Committeehad been unable to reach agreement on revised proposals, supportedby the Agriculture Ministers and summarised in Annex B ofC. (63) 32, which would reduce the saving on the review to about 1 -8 million. It had now to be decided, therefore, whether a saving of this order should be accepted; whether, in particular, theGovernment should acquiesce in an increase of \d. per gallon in the guaranteed price for milk, which would cost the Exchequer over 4 million; and whether the Government should indicate willingness to consider a proposal by the unions for a milk bonus scheme, whichwas intended, at a cost of  25 million to consumers, to provide ahigher income for producers without encouraging increased production.The Minister of Agriculture said that the unions would claim that, on the basis of the revised proposals and taking account of increased costs and other adjustments to be made outside the review,farmers would in effect be deprived of any net benefit from increased efficiency. Moreover, milk producers, whose numbers had beendeclining steadily, had been required in the past five years to absorb,by way of increased costs and reduced returns, the equivalent of about5d. per gallon of milk produced. There was strong feeling amongthe farmers that the remaining producers were now entitled to relief;and it would be possible to justify for this purpose an increase of Id.per gallon in the guaranteed price. But an increase limited to      as
now proposed, should suffice and could be defended as roughlycovering the proportion of increased costs which had been borne bymilk producers over the past year.The various adjustments proposed in Annex B to C. (63) 32 would fall far short of the unions&apos; own proposals; and there could be no assurance that, on this basis, an agreed settlement could be achieved.But agreement this year would be of particular importance in facilitating discussion of the radical changes in support policy whichwould have to be considered later in the year. He therefore sought authority to negotiate with the unions on the basis of the proposals in Annex B to C. (63) 32. The milk bonus scheme could not in anycase be accepted for 1963-64; but it might be expedient to informthe unions that it would be examined without commitment.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The Government faced a dilemma in securing a fair outcome of the review. On one hand, the farmers had a legitimate claimto a share in the benefits of increased efficiency in their own industryand to an improvement in their real incomes comparable with thatachieved by much of the rest of the community. On the other hand,a review which implied virtually no reduction in the scale of exchequer support and would involve the Exchequer in contributingno less than 90 per cent of farm incomes would be criticised bothby agricultural interests in the Commonwealth and by a large sectionof opinion in this country which would accuse the Government of failing to check the increasing cost of living and the rising level ofGovernment expenditure. In view of the special importance ofenlisting the co-operation of the farmers in amending the existing system of agricultural support, it would be desirable on balance toadopt for 1963-64 a basis for the review in which the Farmers&apos;Unions might find it possible to acquiesce.(b) The proposed increase of 4-d. a gallon in the guaranteed price of milk would imply that, instead of being sold at 8^d. a gallonfor seven months in the year, milk would remain at that price for nine months. Having regard to the circumstances of milk producers thiswould be a reasonable adjustment; and it should not excite an undueamount of public criticism.(c) It would be difficult to present the proposed milk bonusscheme as anything but a device for paying more to milk producers in order to encourage them to produce less. Even if it was necessaryfor the Government to undertake to examine the scheme withoutprejudice, the unions should be given no grounds for supposing thatit would prove acceptable.(d) If it seemed desirable in further negotiation with the unions to concede some marginal adjustment of the revised proposals inorder to secure agreement, the guaranteed price for barley mightoffer the most appropriate opportunity. An adjustment in this price, however, would probably convert the small saving on the review as a whole into a loss.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Agriculture and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland to seek to reach agreement with the farmers&apos; Unions on the basis of a saving of about 1 - 8 million in the Farm Price Review for 1963-64, asindicated in Annex B to C. (63) 32, and to inform theunions that, while the proposed milk bonus scheme wouldbe examined during the year, it was unlikely to be acceptable.(2) Took note that the Minister of Agriculture and the Secretaryof State for Scotland would report further to the cabinet if agreement could not be reached substantially on thebasis indicated in Conclusion (1).
A 34. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the chief secretary. Treasury, the Home Secretary and the Minister of Aviation(C. (63) 24, 28 and&quot; 30 respectively) about the future of Messrs. ShortBrothers and Harland.The Home Secretary said that, having regard to the high levelof unemployment in Northern Ireland, the dependence of the Ulstereconomy on Messrs. Shorts and the Governments public pledges toendeavour to maintain the firm as a balanced aircraft design and production unit he had been disturbed to learn that it had alreadybeen decided that the project study for the transport aircraft toreplace the Hastings and the Beverley should be negotiated with the hawker Siddeley group. The Government of Northern Ireland had hoped that further orders for Belfast aircraft would be placed with messrs. Shorts or, alternatively, that the firm would receive the contract for the new transport aircraft to replace the Hastings andthe Beverley. The disappointment of these expectations would be avery severe blow to the economy of Northern Ireland; and it could also have unfortunate political implications. It was therefore essential that further steps should be taken to honour theGovernments pledges to maintain Messrs. Shorts as a unit for the design and production of aircraft.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The Belfast aircraft was a strategic freighter; and the RoyalAir Force had no further requirement for an aircraft of this type.The replacement of the Hastings and the Beverley would be a tacticalfreighter; and the Hawker Siddeley design, on which considerable progress had already been made, was eminently suitable. It appearedto follow that there was unlikely to be any long-term future forMessrs. Shorts as an aircraft firm, although it should be possiblefor some years to maintain employment for staff, other than designstaff, by arranging for appropriate sub-contracts to be placed withthe firm.(b) For this reason it might be preferable to seek a more radicalsolution to the problem by developing the company&apos;s site as a tradingestate. The Exchequer assistance which would be required wouldbe substantial; but it might ultimately prove to be a more economicinvestment than any attempt to maintain Shorts indefinitely as an aircraft firm. Moreover, it would be consistent with the policy,which we should now adopt, of encouraging the Government ofNorthern Ireland not to rely wholly on established industries but to seek to diversify production on new and imaginative lines.(c) On the other hand, the conversion of the site to a tradingestate would be a lengthy process; and it would be politically unwise to make any formal proposal of this kind to the Government ofNorthern Ireland at the present juncture. Moreover, it should bepossible to ensure Messrs. Shorts sufficient work on sub-contracts to provide employment for the bulk of their labour force until about1970; and it would be premature to purport to decide at this point that there would be no future for Messrs. Shorts after that date as an aircraft firm.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the order for the aircraft to replace the Hastingsand the Beverley should not be placed with Messrs.Short Brothers and Harland Limited.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to concert with the Minister ofDefence and the Minister of Aviation the timing of theannouncement of the Governments decision under conclusion (1) and the form in which it should becommunicated to the Government of Northern Ireland.
loiNational 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theEconomic Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (63) 31) about discussions in theDevelopment National Economic Development Council (N.E.D.C.) on retrainingCouncil and redundancy.Retraining andRedundancy The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there was some danger that it would come to be assumed that the solution to allthe problems to which N.E.D.C. might draw attention lay solely inthe Governments hands. Economic growth, however, would dependnot only on the Government but on the employers and the tradeunions as well; and a genuinely co-operative effort would berequired. This itself would depend on the Governments showing that they fully accepted their own share of this corporateresponsibility. The first opportunity for this purpose had now presented itself, since discussions in N.E.D.C. had shown generalagreement on the importance of improving arrangements for industrial training and for dealing with redundancy. TheGovernment had already prepared certain plans for enlarging thescope of industrial training and retraining; and work was going ahead. Plans for redundancy were less advanced; but detailedstudies were in hand. He therefore sought the Cabinets authorityto promise the Governments full support for further action in bothfields, on the understanding that both sides of industry would make their appropriate contributions to any schemes which might ultimately be agreed.The Minister of Labour said that he hoped to promote early legislation on industrial training. In addition, the present arrangements for training allowances and for the use of government training Establishments would need further examination. Theproblem of redundancy would also require more detailed consideration; but in any event it would be undesirable to allowpossible measures to deal with redundancy to be discussed in the context of the Contracts of Employment Bill, which was now beforeParliament.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The Minister of Education and the Secretary of State forScotland would wish to be associated with discussions for expandingfacilities for industrial training. An increase in higher-gradeindustrial training would affect the demand for teachers and therefore the present programme for technical education as a whole.(b) It would be difficult to accommodate legislation within theprogramme for the present session of Parliament. It might in anycase be wiser on political grounds to introduce legislation to dealwith both industrial retraining and redundancy early in the next session.(3) Invited the Minister of Aviation, in consultation with theHome Secretary and the Minister of Defence, toendeavour to ensure that the company continued toreceive as much aircraft sub-contract work as possible.(4) Agreed that it would be desirable, after a few years, to give further consideration to the company&apos;s future in the lightof changes in the structure of the aircraft industry during that interval.(5) Invited the Home Secretary to discuss confidentially with theGovernment of Northern Ireland the possibility ofeventually developing the company&apos;s site as a tradingestate.
Representationof the Vaticanin the UnitedKingdom(previous reference:C.C. (60) 13thConclusions,Minute 4)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (63) 26), proposing that the Government should accept an Internuncio as the representative of the Vatican in the UnitedKingdom.The Foreign Secretary said that, although the Cabinet had hitherto thought it wise to defer a decision on this issue, presentcircumstances suggested that it would now be appropriate to acceptthe proposed change in Vatican representation in this country. Thiswould permit closer co-operation with the Roman Catholic Churchin our efforts to contain the expansion of Communist influence; andit might help us to enlist the support of the Vatican in our attempts to secure better treatment for Protestants in Spain and other countries where they suffered disabilities.In discussion there was some support for this view; and it wassuggested that, if the Government were to endorse the proposal,they should do so forthwith, while there was no public interest in thesubject of our relations with the Vatican and the possibility ofParliamentary discussion about changes in the Prayer Book was stillsome distance in the future. On the other hand, it could be argued that it would be wiser not to take any initiative in exciting public controversy on this subject at the present time, particularly havingregard to the recent attempt by one section of the popular Press torepresent our attempt to enter the European Economic community as a covert design to bring the United Kingdom under roman catholic influence. In any event it would be necessary, before theCabinet could reach a final decision, to consult the authorities ofthe national churches in the United Kingdom and to give furtherconsideration to the precise status to be accorded to the proposedrepresentative of the Vatican.C.C. 14 (63)(c) It might be difficult in practice to draw a clear distinctionbetween redundancy and unemployment in terms of special measures designed to deal only with the former. But at this stage theGovernment need only recognise in principle the need for actionto deal with the special problems resulting from the decline of someof our traditional industries; the nature of that action and the definition of its scope would be further discussed in N.E.D.C.(d) A co-operative effort in N.E.D.C. offered the best prospectof enlisting general support for the measures, including a realisticincomes policy, which were increasingly seen to be necessary to revive the economy. Major changes in traditional attitudes wouldbe required; and the problem of securing greater mobility of labour would have to be tackled on positive and constructive lines. Unlessthe Government gave a lead, the employers and the unions wouldnot easily accept the implications of a fundamentally new attitude to industrial organisation and growth.The Cabinet Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister of Labour to inform the National economic development Council that the Government accepted theneed for better arrangements to deal with industrial training and retraining and with the problem of redundancy and thatthey would co-operate in devising measures to these ends,provided that the employers and the trade unions would undertake to make their own appropriate contributions.
United Nations        7.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Foreign(Previous        Secretary (C. (63) 29) on the financing of United Nations peace-Reference:      keeping operations.C.C. (62) 61stConclusions, The Foreign Secretary said that on 4th March a Working GroupMinute 6)        of the United Nations would resume discussion of the financing of financing of     United Nations peace-keeping operations.   It would be necessaryPeace-keeping   to advise our Permanent Representative on the line to be taken. WeOperations      had argued successfully before the International Court that membersof the United Nations had an obligation to pay their assessed shareof the costs of United Nations operations; and the opinion of theCourt had since been endorsed by the General Assembly.   prima facie, therefore, it was incumbent upon us to continue in 1963 tomeet our share of the costs of current operations and to accept a continuing   obligation,   although   possibly  on  a  new  basis  of assessment, in respect of future operations.There were obvious political objections to accepting an obligation to contribute to the costs of operations of which we mightdisapprove; and the situation was further complicated by the factthat the Soviet Government and the French Government had hitherto refused to contribute to the costs of current operations andwere likely to maintain their refusal to do so. In spite of these difficulties, however, it would be right to maintain our contribution in 1963. If the Soviet and French Governments persisted in theirattitude, they would be liable to forfeit their right to vote in theOrganisation in 1964. It would be at that stage, rather than in 1963,that the opportunity for a major review of the future of theOrganisation and the liabilities of its members would arise. Inaddition, it would probably have become clear by 1964 that theUnited States Government were not prepared to increase the levelof their present contribution to United Nations expenses; and thiswould be an additional factor in bringing the issue to the point of decision.In the longer term there might be advantage in considering a combination of compulsory and voluntary contributions to thecost of peace-keeping operations. This would extricate us from the dilemma that a system relying solely on compulsory contributions would involve us in automatic support of operations of which we might disapprove while a system relying wholly on voluntary contributions would allow the Soviet and French Governments to claim that their present attitude had been justified by the event.In discussion it was pointed out that the arguments which we haddeployed before the International Court in support of our viewthat member countries had an obligation to contribute to the costs of such operations as the Security Council or the General Assemblymight have authorised had not been qualified by reference to thepossibility of voluntary contributions. We had suggested, however,that compulsory contributions should only be required in cases wherethe United Nations had acted at the request of the Government ofthe country in whose territory it was intended that the operation should take place. It might be held inconsistent with these arguments that we should now suggest the adoption of a system based partly on compulsory and partly on voluntary contributions.(1) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for furtherconsideration to be given to the implications of theproposal in C. (63) 26.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of C. (63) 26 at a subsequent meeting.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,28th February, 1963.(1) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with the LordChancellor, to give further consideration to the legaljustification under the Charter of the United Nations fora proposal that the costs of peace-keeping operations should be met partly by compulsory and partly by voluntary contributions.(2) Invited  the Foreign  Secretary to  instruct  the UnitedKingdom   Permanent   Representative   at   the united nations to adopt a non-committal attitude in thediscussions now proceeding on this question.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion at a later meeting.
