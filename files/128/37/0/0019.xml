SECRET 3C.C. 19 (63) 138Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenin the House of Commons in the following week.2. The First Secretary of State informed the Cabinet that had discussions with representatives of the Federal Government, of theGovernment of Southern Rhodesia and of the Government parties in Northern Rhodesia had not succeeded in establishing unanimityof purpose on the proposal to convene a formal conference to discussthe future relationship between the Territories. The representativesof Northern Rhodesia had declared that they would not attend sucha conference unless their claim to secede from the Federation was conceded in advance. The Federal Government would equally refuseto attend if this claim were conceded; and the same excuse might be advanced by the Government of Southern Rhodesia, whose mainconcern was to ensure that the odium of dissolving the federation should attach to us rather than to themselves. In these circumstances the least disadvantageous course might be to indicate publicly thatit remained the objective of our policy to evolve a relationship between the Territories which was acceptable to each of them andthat, while noting the divergent views of the Governments concerned,we proposed to convene a conference in order to consider, before any changes in the existing constitutional structure were made, the lines on which a new relationship might be established.In discussion, there was general agreement that a decision onthe fundamental issue of secession by Northern Rhodesia could nolonger be deferred. The Federation had ceased to be a practicalconcept; and it should be our purpose to replace it, as soon aspossible, by some more realistic form of association between northern and Southern Rhodesia. Despite the reactionary racialpolicy of the Government of Southern Rhodesia, it might be possibleto devise some economic link between the Colony and northern rhodesia, provided that the Protectorate were first granted the rightto secede from the Federation. Even if the price of recognising this right were a refusal on the part of the Federal Government to attend the proposed conference, we must be prepared to pay that price inorder to have any hope of promoting the new association betweenthe Territories which must henceforward be our aim. If so, we should act quickly before the present leaders of the Government parties inNorthern Rhodesia were replaced by Africans committed to more extreme policies.On the other hand, the Government should not appear toabandon their earlier stipulation that the parties concerned shouldbe willing to attend a conference without attempting to imposeconditions for doing so. Nor would it be wise to concede forthwith,and without qualification, that Northern Rhodesia had the right tosecede from the Federation. If we did so, we should leave ourselves with no grounds for convening a conference to discuss the possibilityof a new association between the Territories until we had firstlegislated to dissolve the Federation; and we should also weaken the incentive to Southern Rhodesia to attend the conference. While wecould not deny the right of Northern Rhodesia to secede, we should seek, in acknowledging this right, to emphasise that its exercise mustnecessarily depend on further discussions designed to ensuresatisfactory arrangements for the future. In this way we might hope,while making our ultimate intentions reasonably clear, to be able to convene a conference which both Northern and Southern Rhodesiamight be willing to attend. The Federal Government might refuseto be represented at such a conference and would no doubt try to mobilise the maximum of political support for their intransigentSECRET2539-2 a 2Federation of rhodesia and nyasaland(previous reference:C.C. (63) 17thConclusions,Minute 5)
Chief AnthonyEnahoro(previous reference:C.C. (63) 15thConclusions,Minute 2)3. The Prime Minister said that, in the course of the debate inParliament on 26th March about the application of the nigerian government under the Fugitive Offenders Act of 1881 for the return of Chief Anthony Enahoro to Nigeria to stand his trial on charges of treasonable felony, it had been suggested that a conviction on thesecond of these charges might carry the death penalty. TheGovernment had been assured by the Government of Nigeria thatChief Enahoro would not be required to stand trial for his life; and itwas on this understanding that earlier consideration of the case hadbeen based. He had therefore felt it right to give an undertaking toParliament that any renewed doubt on this point would be resolvedbefore the Government took their final decision in the case. Inpursuance of this undertaking the Government of Nigeria had beenasked to give assurances on three points; first, to reaffirm the earlierunderstanding that neither of the existing charges against ChiefEnahoro carried the death penalty; second, to agree that the secondcharge against Chief Enahoro should be withdrawn; and, third, togive an undertaking that no new charges carrying the death penaltywould be brought against Chief Enahoro, in respect of the period up to the present time, after his return to Nigeria. The nigerian government had replied that, while they could confirm that neither of the charges against Chief Enahoro carried the death penalty, theywere not prepared to give the second and third assurances which wehad requested.The Attorney-General said that, after further consideration ofthe legal issues involved, he was satisfied that the death penalty couldnot attach to the second charge against Chief Enahoro, as set out inthe affidavit submitted by the Nigerian Government for the purposeof proceedings under the Fugitive Offenders Act. But it would be preferable that his own judgment in this matter should be confirmed by the Attorney-General of Nigeria and, if possible, by the Membersof the Opposition in the House of Commons who had concernedthemselves with the legal issues involved.In discussion, the following points were made:(a) The Government of Nigeria were understandably reluctant to give an assurance that no new charges would be brought againstChief Enahoro after his return to Nigeria, since the request for suchan assurance might be held to impugn their good faith. Nevertheless,in view of the undertaking that had been given to Parliament, itwould not now be possible to return Chief Enahoro to Nigeria indefault of some assurance of this kind. But, since responsibility forthe conduct of his trial would be vested in the Attorney-General, asattitude. But it was unlikely that they would resort to armed force,except for the purpose of suppressing any civil disorder that mightbreak out in the Territories.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the right of Northern Rhodesia to secede fromthe Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland should nowbe conceded in principle, provided that our publicrecognition of this right was linked with an endeavour topromote further discussion of the basis on which a new relationship between Southern and Northern Rhodesiamight be established.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation with theFirst Secretary of State, the Lord Chancellor and theMinister without Portfolio, would give further considera-tion to the terms in which the Governments decisionon this point should be announced.
distinct from the Government, of Nigeria, an assurance that the attorney-General had no intention of preferring fresh charges afterChief Enahoro&apos;s return should suffice.(b) If the Attorney-Generals of both the United Kingdom and nigeria agreed that the second charge against Chief Enahoro couldnot entail the death penalty, it should no longer be necessary to insist, as a condition of his return, that the second charge against himshould be withdrawn. But, in view of the strength of Parliamentaryfeeling both about the legal aspects of the case and about the apparent delay in reaching a final decision, it would be preferable that the Opposition in the House of Commons should also agree thatthe earlier doubts on the legal position had now been resolved.(c) If we could not secure the required assurances from the attorney-General of Nigeria, it might become necessary to decide that Chief Enahoro should not be returned. Such a decision, however,would have a serious effect on our relations with Nigeria. If anapplication of a similar kind had been made by one of the olderCommonwealth countries, it would have been granted; and a refusal to concede parity of treatment to the Nigerian Government wouldbe interpreted as a discriminatory act, casting unwarranted doubt onthe integrity of the Nigerian courts.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion at a later meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,29th March, 1963.
