Foreign Affairs 2. The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, The Earl ofUnited Arab Dundee, said that it would be desirable to reach a decision on ourRepublic response to the recent request by the Government of Iraq for the(Previous supply of military equipment and training facilities as soon as the reference: Foreign Secretary had explained to the Government of Iran, duringC.C. (63) 26th his journey home from the meeting of the Central Treaty Organisation,Conclusions, the reasons for which we thought it expedient to meet this request.Minute 3)The Cabinet (1) Agreed that if, on his return, the Foreign Secretary agreed,in the light of his discussions with the Government of iran and with the Governments of the other member countries of the Central Treaty Organisation, that the provisionof military assistance to the Government of Iraq wouldnot involve undue political embarrassment, the necessary action to provide such assistance should proceedforthwith.Jordan The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, The Earl of Dundee,(Previous        informed the Cabinet that internal pressure was mounting againstReference:      King Hussein of Jordan. The army, however, appeared to be loyalC.C. (63) 26th to the King; and there seemed to be little risk of any immediateConclusions,     attempt to overthrow him. The Government of Israel had taken noMinute 3)       action, apart from certain precautionary measures; but they would undoubtedly seek to occupy the territory on the West Bank of theRiver Jordan in the event of a successful rebellion against king hussein; and the United States Government had already warned theGovernment of the United Arab Republic that they did not expect to be able to dissuade the Government of Israel from action on theselines.Yemen The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, The Earl of Dundee,(Previous        said that, although agreement in principle had been reached that reference:      Egyptian forces would be progressively withdrawn from the Yemen,C.C. (63) 16th that the Government of Saudi Arabia would cease to supply armsConclusions,    to the Royalist forces and that these arrangements should be minute 2)       supervised by the United Nations, we must be prepared for theEgyptian Government to fail to fulfil their part of this settlement,since they might judge that the Republican regime in the Yemenwould not survive without their support.Cuba The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, The Earl of Dundee,(Previous informed the Cabinet that the United States Government had urgedReference: us to take action to reduce the number of United Kingdom shipsC.C. (62) 66th now trading with Cuba. Although such ships were considerably fewerConclusions, than at the height of the crisis in the autumn of 1962, it would be minute 1)       desirable to give careful consideration to this request, having regardto the measures which the United States Government might otherwisefeel obliged to adopt.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Minister of Transport to circulate a memorandum,indicating the scale on which United Kingdom ships were now trading with Cuba and the extent to which it wouldbe possible for the Government to reduce their number.Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.
Public Order(previous reference:C.C. (62) 61stConclusions,Minute 8)3. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the HomeSecretary and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (C. (63) 70and 71 respectively) about Fascist activities and public order.The Home Secretary said that, in answering a parliamentary question on 8th November, 1962, he had announced the Government^intention to increase the penalties for offences under Section 5 ofthe Public Order Act, 1936, and under the Public Meetings Act, 1908,and had undertaken to consider, in the light of the decisions of thecourts in cases then pending, whether the law was adequate to dealwith Fascist activities. In both cases the convictions had now beenupheld; and it had therefore been conclusively demonstrated that section 5 of the Act of 1936 was sufficiently wide in scope to prohibitincitement to racial hatred. Moreover, all three Fascist organisationshad now been refused permission to hold meetings in Trafalgar Squarein May and June; and, if meetings were held elsewhere, the police would deal firmly with both incitement and disorder. It should therefore suffice if, in fulfilment of his undertaking to Parliament, he now stated publicly that, in view of the decisions of the courts, noamendment of the law was necessary (otherwise than to strengthen the penalties) but that the law would be strictly enforced.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that theestablishment of coloured communities in this country since thePublic Order Act was passed in 1936 had changed the situation; and,in the light of the strength of public feeling on the issues involved,a statement on the lines suggested by the Home Secretary might notbe accepted as adequate. There was a case for amending the substantive law as well as increasing the penalties; and suchamendment might well be based on the Bill introduced byMr. Iremonger, M.P., which sought to enlarge the scope of Section 5of the Public Order Act, 1936, by adding &quot; words inciting hatred ofany racial group of Her Majesty^ subjects &quot; to the existing provisions relating to &quot; threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour &quot;.In discussion it was suggested that it would be undesirable tointroduce a racial concept into Section 5 of the Act of 1936. The lawhad always been based on the principle that it applied indifferentlyin relation to all persons, regardless of their race or origin; and a specific reference to race might cast doubt on the degree of protectionwhich it afforded to persons who were subject to attack on religious or political grounds. Moreover, responsible members of the Jewishand coloured communities were opposed to an amendment of thelaw in this sense; and in Scotland it might give rise to difficulty inrelation to expressions of Nationalist opinion.On the other hand, it was possible to incite hatred without usingwords which were &quot;threatening, abusive or insulting&quot;; and thispoint might well be taken against the Government in debate on their proposed Bill to increase the penalties for offences under the Act of1936. It might therefore be desirable to explore the possibility ofcombining this Bill with the measure which Mr. Iremonger was seeking to introduce, provided that any extension of Section 5 of the 1936 Actwas limited to the addition of &quot; words inciting hatred &quot; and did notrefer specifically to racial hatred.(3) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs to circulate a memorandum on the scope and nature of the measureswhich the United States Government might adopt ifthey felt compelled to seek to enforce a restriction ofmaritime trade with Cuba.
4. The Prime Minister said that, as a result of the Cabinet&apos;searlier discussion, there was now general agreement that the broadobjectives of the Governments agricultural policy must be tocontinue to secure the advantages of imports of cheap food, tomaintain at the same time a healthy farming industry at home but to limit the cost to the Exchequer of so doing. It had also been accepted that it would not be possible to retain the confidence of the farmersunless measures to limit the cost to the Exchequer were accompaniedby measures to control imports. It was therefore necessary, first, to devise acceptable means of limiting Exchequer support to the domestic industry and, second, to control imports withoutunacceptable damage to our trading policies or breach of our international obligations.It was now generally accepted that the best method of limiting the cost to the Exchequer in relation to any individual commoditywould be to relate the subsidy to a defined and limited quantity inany one year. This could be described as the principle of the &quot; flexibleguarantee &quot;; if production exceeded the standard, the effective levelof the support price for farmers would fall and, if production fell short of the standard, it would rise.It was more difficult, however, to determine the best method of controlling imports. For cereals the imposition of effective minimum price arrangements appeared to be the most appropriate solution.On this basis the level of minimum prices under the international wheat Agreement might be raised by up to  2 a ton, with equivalentincreases for other cereals. For pig meat satisfactory arrangementsfor an equitable division of the market, based on a voluntarylimitation of imports, could probably be reached in direct negotiation with the main suppliers; and action was already proceeding to thisend. For other meat products, however, particularly beef and lamb,there seemed to be no easy solution. The complexity of the market would make it impracticable to control import prices unless all buyingwere centralised in the Governments hands. Experience of thevariable levy system applied in recent months by the member countries of the European Economic Community had revealed its shortcomingsand the damage which it would be likely to cause to our relationswith the main exporting countries. There would be serious politicaland economic objection to the imposition of country quotas, whichcould not in any case be applied to countries, such as New Zealand, towhom we had guaranteed free entry for their products. On balance,therefore, it appeared that the least disadvantageous course might lie in seeking to negotiate voluntary agreements under which the mainmeat exporting countries would undertake to limit their exports tous in any given period. This should lead to more orderly marketing arrangements than those which now prevailed; and it would alsoenable us to review from time to time the balance between imports and domestic production.Invited the Home Secretary (1) To consider, in the light of their discussion and inconsultation with the Attorney-General, the possibilityof promoting legislation which would both increase the penalties for offences under Section 5 of the Public OrderAct, 1936, and amend that Section to include the concept of inciting hatred without explicitly referring to racial hatred.(2) To report to the Cabinet in due course the result of his enquiries under Conclusion (1) above.
In discussion the following main points were made:(a) In the light of the experience of the last few years, it was nolonger realistic to assume that meat imports could be allowed tocontinue to enjoy unrestricted free entry. While the effect on our balance of payments of any arrangements leading to a restriction ofimports would need careful examination, it would be right to seek,in the course of the forthcoming international negotiations, to conclude voluntary arrangements with the main exporting countries for the limitation of our imports from them. The possibility that suchlimitations might, in the last resort, have to be imposed compulsorilyshould be borne in mind; it would be wiser, however, to avoidreference to this possibility at the outset of the negotiations, in viewof the damage which might be caused to our international relations and to our associated trading interests if the impression gained groundthat we had already decided to impose a system of country quotas.It might be expedient, however, to let it be known that, in default of agreement on voluntary arrangements, we might find it necessaryto consider the introduction of centralised buying arrangements.(b) Further consideration should be given to the introduction oflevy/subsidy arrangements for cereals, which would result in thetransfer of all or part of the cost of the subsidy from the exchequer to the consumer. The farming community would be likely to welcomearrangements of this kind; and the effect on the cost of living shouldbe marginal. But this question did not call for an immediate decision,since it fell outside the scope of the forthcoming negotiations.(c) It was important to provide scope for an increase in the levelof domestic meat production. At a time when the economy as a whole was expanding, the farming community could not be expected toaccept arrangements which limited their own production to a fixedquantity. They should at least be assured of a reasonable share inany increase in national consumption; and it might also be possibleto secure additional opportunities for an expansion of domestic production in the course of the periodical review of any voluntary arrangements for the regulation of imports.(d) There might be scope for further examination of the assumptions on which agricultural policy was at present based.In particular, it could be argued that we had adopted a morescrupulous attitude towards the discharge of our various international obligations than other Western countries, who had found it possibleto reconcile their commitments under the General Agreement on tariffs and Trade with a robust protection of their own agricultural interests. The extent to which a liberal policy towards imports, withthe consequent need to support domestic agriculture on a large scale,was in fact to our ultimate economic advantage might also warrantfresh study.(e) Further consideration would need to be given to the future policy for horticulture, which presented particular difficulties of itsown.(/) It would be appropriate that, in advance of the forthcominginternational negotiations and of the initiative which the national farmers&apos; Union might shortly be expected to take in pressing for control of imports, the Government should give some general indication of the direction in which their agricultural policy wouldbe likely to develop. Careful consideration, however, would need to be given to the terms of any such announcement, in view of itsprobable effect on exporting countries overseas as well as on publicopinion at home.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that future policy in relation to cereals should includethe introduction of a standard quantity for domestic production under flexible guarantee arrangements,together with the negotiation of effective minimum import prices.
1 Q 2t/ f-public ^ 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theExpenditure     Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Chief Secretary, Treasury(Previous        (C. (63) 72), about rates of growth of public expenditure.Reference :C.C. (62) 75th The Chief Secretary said that, at their meeting on 20th December,Conclusions, 1962, the Cabinet had agreed that in future major decisions on minute 3) expenditure should be taken by reference to the prospective courseof public expenditure as a whole in relation to the resources of the economy. In practice this would be achieved by approving, for eachlarge block of public expenditure, an annual rate of expansion whichwould take account not only of the growth of the economy but also of the needs and importance of that particular block of expenditure over the period in question.He was not yet ready to submit to the Cabinet detailed proposalsfor the actual rates of expansion to be applied. Nevertheless, theCabinet should be aware of the action which would shortly benecessary to give effect to their earlier decision and of the proposalto apply approved rates of expansion to the seven major blocks ofexpenditure described in the annex to C. (63) 72.The position gave rise for serious concern. It had been possibleto accept a 10 per cent increase in expenditure in the current year in the light of the margin of unused resources in the economy; but,if the reflationary measures which the Government had nowintroduced achieved their object, no comparable rate of increase could be contemplated for future years without a serious risk of inflation.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The proposed sector covering housing and environmental services was the only sector which excluded current expenditure; thiswould be liable to distort its approved rate of expansion as comparedwith the rates for other sectors.(b) The concept of a percentage rate of growth for any givensector of the economy should be interpreted in real terms; and itmight be held that its translation into money terms should be basedon an index of wages and prices which was valid for the economy as a whole. In practice, however, the movement of wages and pricesdiffered from one sector to another, particularly in the light of the incidence of individual wage awards. The comparison of rates of growth in different sectors should make allowance for this fact.C.C. 28 (63)(2) Invited the Minister of Agriculture, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to give further considerationto the extent to which the cost of supporting cerealsproduction might be transferred from the Exchequer tothe consumer by means of a levy/subsidy scheme.(3) Agreed that it should be our objective, in the forthcominginternational negotiations, to secure an effective limitation on imports of beef and lamb by means of voluntaryagreements with the main exporting countries.(4) Invited the Minister of Agriculture to consider, in the lightof their discussion and in consultation with the Chancellorof the Exchequer, the terms in which Ministers might,if necessary, give some general indication in public ofthe main lines of the Governments future agricultural policy.(5) Took note that further consideration would need to be givento the Governments future policy on horticulture.
(c) It would be important, particularly in relation to the estimates of future growth in various sectors of the economy on which theNational Economic Development Council had based their recentstudies, to avoid adopting rates of growth which could be represented as being too low by comparison with those endorsed by the Council.(d) The sector providing for police and prisons should be expanded to cover future requirements for courts of law. There mightbe advantage in an examination by the Departments concerned, inthe context of the future building programme, of the possibility ofcombining various types of court within a single building.(e) Particular attention would need to be given to the approvedrate of expansion for the road building programme, in the light ofthe steep rise in costs which had taken place by comparison withearlier estimates.The Cabinet Took note of C. (63) 72 and of the points made in their discussion.The Prime 6.   The Prime Minister introduced to the Cabinet Mr. LesterMinister of Pearson, who had recently taken office as Prime Minister of Canada,Canada ancj extended, on behalf of the Cabinet, a warm welcome toMr. Pearson on his first official visit in that capacity to the UnitedKingdom.Mr. Pearson thanked the Cabinet for their greetings and saidthat he and his colleagues looked forward to co-operating with theUnited Kingdom Government in dealing with the important tasksthat lay ahead.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,2nd May, 1963.
