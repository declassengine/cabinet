resignation of theSecretary ofState forWar(previous reference:C.C. (63) 39thConclusions,Minute 3)*The Prime Minister said that he had now discussed with the leader of the Opposition and his colleagues the form of an enquiry into the circumstances of the resignation of the former Secretary ofState for War, Mr. Profumo, and the rumours which, partly as aresult of this episode, were now in circulation. The Oppositionspokesmen had continued to press that any enquiry should be conducted by a Select Committee of the House of Commons and hadbeen unwilling to recognise the objections to this procedure whichhad been discussed by the Cabinet at their previous meeting. Theyhad also represented that the enquiry should embrace theParliamentary aspects of Mr. Profumo&apos;s resignation, in particular thecircumstances in which Mr. Profumo&apos;s personal statement on22nd March had been drafted and the part which had been played by the Law Officers on that occasion. The Cabinet had already agreed,however, that there could be no question of an enquiry by a SelectCommittee into the manner in which Ministers had discharged their responsibilities in this connection.Since it was now clear that there was no possibility of agreementwith the Opposition on the form of the proposed enquiry, it would be right that he should announce that day in the House of commons the Governments own decision in favour of a judicial enquiry, to be conducted by Lord Denning. It would be made clear, if necessary,that witnesses appearing before Lord Denning should be sufficientlyprotected by the doctrine of qualified privilege but that if, as a resultof doubt on this point or for any other reason, Lord Denning found himself unable to obtain all the information which he required, theGovernment would be prepared to invite Parliament to invest him,under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, with powers to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents.In discussion there was general agreement with the PrimeMinisters proposal. The following main points were made:(a) The Governments statement should indicate that, when LordDenning&apos;s report was available, the Prime Minister would be willingto discuss it with the Leader of the Opposition and that theGovernment would thereafter decide whether the report should bepublished in full or in part.(b) It should be made clear, either in the statement or by someother means, that the form of the enquiry and the conduct of its proceedings were necessarily determined to a considerable extent bothby the fact that security issues would be involved and by the criminal action against Mr. Stephen Ward which was at presentpending.(c) Individual Ministers whose reputations were called inquestion by allegations now in circulation would be entitled, andwould perhaps be well-advised, to consult their own legal advisersabout the desirability of initiating proceedings for slander or libel.It would be desirable, however, that the Ministers concerned should adopt a common policy in this respect.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would make a statement that day in Parliament on the lines of the draft annexed.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for all members of the Government to be informed that:(a) If they became aware of any rumour or allegationaffecting the personal conduct of a Minister or an individual prominent in public life, they shouldPreviously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
convey this information to the Home Secretary, for submission to Lord Denning.(b) If they became aware that they themselves were thesubject of any rumour or allegation of this kind,they should consult their own legal advisers but should not initiate legal proceedings without firstconsulting the Attorney-General.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,21st June, 1963.annex draft STATEMENTSince the debate on Mr. Profumo&apos;s resignation I have considered, as promised by my Right Hon. Friend the Leader of theHouse, the form of a further enquiry into the security implications of the events leading to that resignation. I think it is generally agreedthat, in the light of our experience in this case, it is necessary thatthere should be an investigation of the operation of the security service and their relationship with the police in connection with matters of national security. The Government intend to establish an enquiry for this purpose. But, before I describe it, there are certain other questions which I must now bring to the attention of the House.It will be within the knowledge of many Hon. Members that,arising largely out of the recent episode, rumours are circulating which affect the honour and integrity of public life in this country and, ifthey were true, might involve a security risk. Such a situation cannotbe tolerated. I have therefore decided that the public interest requiresus to establish an enquiry covering not only the security aspect ofthe recent case but also of other allegations of the type which I have mentioned.Lord Denning, the Master of the Rolls, has agreed to conductthis enquiry and to render his report to me as soon as possible. Histerms of reference will be as follows:&quot; To examine, in the light of the circumstances leading tothe resignation of the former Secretary of State for War,Mr. J. D. Profumo, the operation of the Security Service and the adequacy of their co-operation with the police in matters ofnational security; to investigate any information or material which may come to his attention in this connection and toconsider any evidence there may be for believing that national security has been, or may be, endangered; and to report thereon.&quot;I think it would be appropriate that, initially, Lord Denningshould proceed on his own authority. But, if he finds that he cannotobtain the information which he needs without the power to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents, theGovernment will not hesitate to invite Parliament to pass a Resolutioninvesting him with the necessary authority.In the course of discussion with the Leader of the Opposition Ihave explained to him the reasons for which the Government believethat, in the circumstances with which we are now confronted, this enquiry should be of a judicial character and should cover a wider field.
