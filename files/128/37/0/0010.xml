ForeignAffairsIndonesia(previous reference:C.C. (63) 9thConclusions,Minute 4)2. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that the indonesian Government had denied in a recent message that theyhad any intention of taking aggressive action against neighbouringterritories. It was perhaps doubtful how far we could rely on this statement; but it seemed unlikely that the threat to North Borneowould be renewed in the near future.economic policy(previous reference:C.C. (63) 9thConclusions,Minute 2)3. The Commonwealth Secretary suggested that there mightbe advantage in arranging for a meeting of the commonwealth economic Consultative Committee shortly before the commonwealth economic iMinisters assembled for the forthcoming discussions inconnexion with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Thiswould enable us to discuss with the other countries of theCommonwealth the trade policies which we proposed to pursue asa result of our failure to secure admission to the European economic community; and it should be acceptable to those sections of publicopinion in this country which were pressing the Government to take some initiative in mobilising Commonwealth support.In discussion it was generally agreed that a meeting of theCommittee would be appropriate, provided that it did not encourage the belief that the Government would henceforward make a deliberateattempt to redirect our trade towards the Commonwealth at theexpense of Europe.The Cabinet Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to arrange for theother members of the Commonwealth to be invited to send representatives to a meeting of the commonwealth economic Consultative Committee, to be held shortly before the forthcoming discussions in connexion with theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.Federation of rhodesia and nyasaland(previous reference:C.C. (63) 6thConclusions,Minute 5)4. The First Secretary of State informed the Cabinet of theresults of his recent discussions, in Central Africa, with the Federaland Territorial Governments of the Federation of Rhodesia and nyasaland. After initially refusing to make any constructiveapproach to the problem of the future of the Federation the federal government had subsequently indicated that they would be preparedto consider an arrangement whereby their functions would in future be limited to defence, taxation and European education and thatthey would be ready to discuss with the Territorial Governments a form of association based on this concept. In Northern Rhodesiapublic opinion would probably be prepared to accept the maintenanceof economic links with Southern Rhodesia, provided that the protectorate was first granted the right of secession. The new government in Southern Rhodesia would also be ready to contemplate a purely economic association with Northern Rhodesia.In these circumstances our wisest course would be to seek to promote a conference of the interested parties, which might initially have toParliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.
consist of a series of parallel discussions, conducted separatelywith each of them. If these discussions, which would be held inLondon, showed some prospect of agreement between theGovernments concerned, they might be resumed in due course in theFederation. This process, however, should be initiated as rapidly as possible. The Government of Southern Rhodesia were likely toadopt an increasingly repressive policy towards the Africaninhabitants of the Colony; and, apart from the renewedembarrassment in the United Nations which this policy might entailfor us, it implied that, the longer the first steps towards promoting the association with Northern Rhodesia were deferred, the moreproblematical such an association would become. We should nowconcentrate, therefore, on seeking to establish this association as rapidly as possible, leaving the position of the Federal Governmentto be gradually eroded by the development of the situation. Littleinterest appeared to have been aroused in the Federation by theFederal Governments attempt to represent our agreement to thesecession of Nyasaland as a breach of undertakings given by UnitedKingdom Ministers at the Conference which established theFederation in 1953; and there was little indication of renewed concernon this subject in the House of Commons. It might be wiser,therefore, to refrain from publishing the White Paper which we had prepared to rebut the Federal Governments allegation, on theground that all parties should now bend their energies towardsbuilding a new future rather than continue to indulge in recriminationsabout the past.In discussion there was general agreement that the Governmentshould approach the problem of the Federation on the lines advocated by the First Secretary of State. But pressure was being maintained in the House of Lords for some indication of the governments attitude towards the alleged breach of pledges given in 1953; and itwould be difficult to reply convincingly to this allegation unless theWhite Paper were published. Moreover, Lord Swinton, who hadbeen one of the United Kingdom Ministers concerned in the 1953Conference, had privately endorsed the interpretation which theWhite Paper placed upon his remarks during that Conference; and,if Lord Chandos, the other Minister concerned, concurred as regardshis own part in the Conference, the White Paper should carryconviction.In further discussion it was suggested that the Government couldnot defer for long some indication of the part which they consideredthe Federal Government might play in any future association betweenthe Territorial Governments. The external defence of the territories would need to be ensured; and, even if responsibility for the armed forces had to be divided between Northern and Southern Rhodesia,some arrangement would be required to ensure concerted actionagainst an external threat. Such an arrangement would imply come degree of centralised political authority and direction.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the policy which the First Secretary of state proposed to pursue in relation to the future of the Federaland Territorial Governments in the Federation ofRh* desia and Nyasaland.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation with theFirst Secretary of State and the Lord Chancellor, would consider, when the views of Lord Chandos had been ascertained, the desirability of publishing a White Paperrebutting the allegation by the Federal Government thatthe action of the United Kingdom Government inpermitting the secession of Nyasaland was in breach ofcertain pledges given by United Kingdom Ministers duringthe Conference which had established the Federation in1953.
2395-2Malta 5.   The Commonwealth Secretary said that Bailey (Malta) Ltd.Dockyard had been formed in 1959 to take over the Admiralty dockyard in malta and, under the terms of an agreement with the Government,had received substantial Exchequer loans for the conversion andequipment of the yard. In April 1962, following the resignation ofthe three independent directors, a chartered accountant had beenappointed by his predecessor to inspect the Company&apos;s accounts.The accountants report, which had been received in August 1962,showed that the Company had broken certain of the terms of their agreement. In November 1962 the Company had been required to remedy these defects. But they had taken no steps to do so and had now issued a writ, contesting the Governmenfs action. On 17thJanuary he had himself issued a writ against the Company, seekingrepayment of the Government loans, which now amounted to over 3 million. In the meantime Admiralty orders for work in the Maltadockyard had been suspended.It might be several months before the case between theGovernment and the Company could be heard. In the interval itwas imperative to maintain employment in the dockyard in Malta.For this purpose it would be necessary to arrange for the affairs ofthe Company to be taken out of the hands of the present directorsand to be managed independently. It would be possible for theGovernment of Malta to nationalise the Company; but this woulddiscourage foreign investment in Malta. Alternatively, they couldpass legislation appointing an administrator to take charge of theCompany&apos;s affairs. They had refused, however, to contemplate such legislation unless the United Kingdom Government agreed for their part to give long-term guarantees about the maintenance of the levelof employment in the dockyard. Since we could not afford to give such guarantees, we should now be compelled to appoint a councilof administration for the Company and to act, for this purpose, byOrder in Council. Although the Admiralty, on recent evidence,reckoned that they would be charged excessive prices for work donein the dockyard, it was desirable that Admiralty orders shouldcontinue to be placed there, on the understanding that the new councilof administration would establish more reasonable prices. It was particularly important that Malta should not be deprived of theimportant contract for the repair of H.M.S. Troubridge, which theyhad been led to expect.In discussion the following points were made:(a) None of the proposed members of the council ofadministration appeared to have any extensive experience of shiprepairing.(b) It would be difficult to justify the award of government contracts to the Malta dockyard at prices significantly higher thanthose prevailing in the United Kingdom, particularly since labour costs in Malta were lower and United Kingdom shipyards had considerable capacity out of use. If it was necessary on political grounds to continue to keep the Malta dockyard in work, furthercontracts should be placed in Malta on the basis that the prices wouldbe realistic and that any further subvention should be provided aspart of our financial aid to Malta.(c) There were potential legal objections to the proposal toassume control of the Company&apos;s affairs under an Order in Council.In the first place, the legal validity of the Order could be challengedin the courts; and, although the result might be in the Governmenfsfavour, there would be a considerable delay before the case couldbe heard and, since the Government would be precluded from acting under the Order while the case was still sub judice, the affairs ofthe Malta dockyard would go from bad to worse. The Order could also be challenged on grounds of propriety, since the Governmentwere in litigation with the Company and the issue was still undecided.
commercial policy(previous reference:C.C. (62) 65thConclusions,Minute 3)Imports ofRussian Oil6. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C. (63) 32) and the Lord President of the Council(C. (63) 14) on the question whether an import quota of fuel oil from the Soviet Union should be authorised in order to obtainsubstantial Soviet orders for ships to be built in this country. they also had before them a memorandum by the Foreign Secretary(C. (63) 13), describing the attitude of the United States Governmentto trading arrangements with countries of the Sino-Soviet bloc.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that opinions in theEconomic Policy Committee had been divided on a proposal thatthe President of the Board of Trade should be authorised to respond toa Soviet initiative by negotiating for a quota of fuel oil not exceeding2 million tons a year for the remaining 18 months of the presentfive-year trading agreement in exchange for substantial shipbuildingorders.  The Soviet authorities had, in fact, made no firm proposalsIt could therefore be held that, by taking powers of administration under the Order, the Government had sought to pre-judge the outcome of the legal dispute. For these reasons it would be preferableeither to proceed by way of legislation or to seek to persuade theCompany to agree voluntarily to the appointment of an independentauthority to administer their affairs pending the outcome of litigation.(d) In view of these difficulties there were strong arguments forsuggesting that the Government of Malta should again be pressed topass the necessary legislation themselves. We ourselves, however,could not evade responsibility for what had occurred. We had been responsible for running down the Admiralty work in the first place and for the subsequent selection of Messrs. Bailey to take over the dockyard on a civilian basis. The Government of Malta could resonably argue that they could not now be asked to accept responsibility for the difficulties to which those decisions had given rise. Nor would it be right to abandon our responsibility for Malta&apos;economic development; apart from the political and moral objectionsto such a course, it was strategically important to avoid a situationin which Malta might feel obliged to turn to the Soviet bloc for help.(e) Whether it were decided to proceed by way of an Order inCouncil or by agreement with the Company, complex legal issueswould be involved. It would be desirable, therefore, that all further negotiations with the Company should be conducted by the treasury solicitor on the advice of the Law Officers.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that it would be necessary to maintain a reasonablelevel of employment in the Malta dockyard and that, tothis end, the affairs of Messrs. Bailey (Malta) Ltd. shouldbe independently administered pending the outcome oflitigation between the Government and the Company.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation withthe Lord Chancellor and the Law Officers, to give furtherconsideration to the means of giving effect to this decision and, in particular, to the possibility of securing theCompany&apos;s agreement to the appointment of anindependent authority to administer the dockyard.(3) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation withthe Minister of Transport, to give further consideration tothe choice of individuals who might be appointed to administer the dockyard.(4) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in consultation withthe First Lord of the Admiralty, to consider the termson which further orders for Admiralty repair work mightbe placed with the dockyard, on the basis that theAdmiralty would be required to pay no more than a realistic price for the work done.
but, both publicly and in preliminary discussions with officials, ithad been suggested that their willingness to place shipbuilding orders in the United Kingdom might be conditional on their being grantedfacilities to sell oil in the United Kingdom. Such orders, whichmight be of the value of  .12 million or more, would provide earlyrelief to unemployment in the shipbuilding industry; and industrialconsumers of fuel oil should also benefit from the provision of cheapadditional supplies from Russia. On the other hand, it could be held that our long-term interest as sellers of oil required us to maintainthe established policy of excluding cheap imports, even in small quantities. Moreover, the direct and indirect effects on the coalindustry of importing oil might be serious; foreign investment inour oil refineries might be discouraged; and a reversal of the presentban on imports of oil from the Soviet Union would be likely to be criticised by the United States Government.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The United States Government would take exception to theproposed importation of oil on the general ground that any increasein East-West trade, so far from contributing to a general relaxation of tension, would be used by the Sino-Soviet bloc to create political embarrassment for the West. Relations with Middle Eastern andother oil-producing countries might also be strained; and, since wewere wholly dependent on supplies from the Western hemisphere ifMiddle Eastern supplies were interrupted, we should avoid, ifpossible, a dispute with the United States Government on oil policies.(b) On the other hand most of the other countries in the north atlantic Alliance already imported Soviet oil; and the loss of potentialorders for ships would be severely criticised by our shipbuilding industry, which was already resentful of the subsidies which theUnited States Government provided for their own shipbuilders.(c) The Minister of Power said that the ability of the national coal Board to maintain their financial position and to adhere totheir programme of pit closures might be seriously affected if theprospect of a fall in fuel oil prices led to a reduced demand for coal.Moreover, the oil companies might be disinclined to invest further in oil refineries in this country and might also withhold future ordersfor tankers. These considerations might in the long run outweigh the short-term advantages of securing early orders for Russian ships.(d) On the other hand, since consumption was rising rapidly, a quota of 1 million tons of fuel oil might be readily absorbed by the domestic market. The danger to the coal and oil industries might beexpected to arise only if the quota were substantially larger.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, inprinciple, the balance of advantage appeared to be in favour of admitting a limited quantity of Soviet oil in exchange for substantialshipbuilding orders. But, if we entered into negotiations without first securing a more specific undertaking on the part of the soviet authorities than had so far emerged, we should incur the risk ofantagonising many of our friends and possibly failing, in the end,to obtain the orders we sought. It should therefore be made clear,in answer to enquiries, that the Soviet Union had so far submittedno firm proposals but that, if they did, we would be prepared toconsider their offer, even though it might involve the importation ofa limited quota of fuel oil.The Cabinet-Agreed that, if firm proposals were made by the SovietGovernment for the placing of substantial shipbuildingorders in the United Kingdom in exchange for theimportation of a limited quota of Soviet fuel oil, theseproposals should be considered on their merits.
broadcasting policy(previous reference:C.C. (62) 72ndConclusions,Minute 3)Television Bill:Duties andLevies7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePostmaster-General (C. (63) 10), proposing that the Television Bill,now before Parliament, should be amended to provide that the levyto be imposed on programme contractors should be based on grossadvertising receipts and not on gross profits.The Postmaster-General said that the Television Bill, which was now awaiting Second Reading in the House of Commons, providedfor a levy calculated by reference to the profits of programme contractors before tax. These provisions, however, were open to criticism on the ground that any levy on profits could probably beevaded by the contractors without much difficulty. Moreover, the levy would be imposed in addition to the Television AdvertisementDuty, which was charged on gross advertising receipts and was regarded as operating with undue severity against the smallercompanies. With the concurrence of the Chancellor of the Exchequerhe now proposed that the levy should be based on advertising revenuerather than on profits and that the existing duty should be abolished.The Bill would include a percentage scale of charges, which wouldbe variable by regulations subject to affirmative resolution. Thescale suggested in the Annex to C. (63) 10 was unsatisfactory in some respects:he proposed to reconsider it in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer.In discussion it was suggested that the imposition of discriminatory taxation by regulation might constitute a dangerous precedent. On the other hand, the proposals represented animprovement on the existing provisions in the Bill; and the levyought in any case to be regarded not as a form of taxation but as a method of obtaining payment for a franchise which was of differentvalue to different contractors.The Cabinet Agreed that the Television Bill should be amended to provide that the levy to be imposed on independent television programme contractors should be based on gross advertisingreceipts.Education(previous reference:C.C. (62) 52ndConclusions,Minute 6)Teachers&apos;Salaries(previous reference:C.C. (62) 17thConclusions,Minute 3)8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (63) 11) about the pay of schoolteachers in England and Wales.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the provisional agreement which had been reached in the Burnham Committee but had not yet been ratified involved total increases of pay amountingto  20-7 million. This was a considerably higher sum than had been thought desirable in the context of the Governments incomes policy.The most objectionable feature of the agreement, however, was theproposed method of distribution, whereby the bulk of the money would be devoted to a flat-rate increase for all teachers instead of toselective increases in favour of older teachers and those who hadspecial qualifications or held posts of special responsibility. TheGovernment would be liable to be criticised if they rejected theagreement on the ground of the amount involved; but they could expect support from informed public opinion if they refused to endorse the basis of distribution. This should not necessarily imply that the sum of  20-7 million could be regarded as being availablefor distribution in some different way; a revised distribution mightwell yield a lower total.The Minister of Education said that the Burnham committee might refuse to reconsider the question of distribution. He agreed,however, that they should be invited to do so, even if, in the last resort,the Government were compelled to legislate in order to introduceacceptable scales.  In rejecting the agreement, however, he would in
any case have to make it clear, if challenged, that he was not doing so simply because it involved a total sum of  20-7 million; and itwould therefore be wiser to indicate at the outset that the government did not reject the proposed award in terms of amount but couldnot accept the principles on which it was constructed because theyconflicted both with incomes policy and with educational needs.In discussion the following points were made :(a) The present arrangement, under which the Minister couldeither accept or reject the recommendations of the burnham committee but had no power to vary them, was unsatisfactory.Consideration should be given to the possibility of modifying thissystem.(b) It would be desirable that the Minister of Education shouldnot intervene until after the conference of the National Union of teachers which was being convened to discuss the provisional agreement; but that thereafter he should do so before the agreement was formally ratified.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Education to announce at theappropriate point that the Government could not endorse the provisional agreement of the Burnham Committeeon teachers&apos; pay but would be prepared to reconsider a revised agreement based on more satisfactory principlesof distribution.(2) Invited the Minister of Education to formulate proposals fora revision of the machinery for determining teachers&apos; payin England and Wales.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,7th February, 1963.
