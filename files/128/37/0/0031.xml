Subject :India and PakistanMilitary Aid to India
The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the memorandum bythe Commonwealth Secretary (C. (63) 82) on military aid for India.They had before them a draft message from the Prime Minister tothe President of the United States, which indicated that any furthermilitary aid which the United Kingdom might be able to provide toIndia would have to be limited and emphasised the serious political objections to the proposal that United States and United Kingdomfighter squadrons should participate in the defence of Indian citiesagainst air attack.The Commonwealth Secretary said that, since the Cabinet&apos;discussion on the previous day, he had been informed that the UnitedStates Government, intended to discuss with the Indian Minister ofDefence Production, Mr. Krishnamachari, who was at present in washington and would shortly visit London, a programme of military aid comprising a number of successive instalments over several years.They would not seek to make the provision of such aid explicitlydependent on a resolution of the differences between the Governmentsof India and Pakistan about Kashmir; but they would emphasise theimportance of achieving a settlement of this dispute. The assistance which they contemplated appeared to take the form of supplies ofvarious types of equipment and the provision of training facilities for indian personnel; as regards the provision of combat aircraft, theywould merely offer to consider the possibility of participating intraining exercises in India.This indication of the scale on which the United States wouldbe prepared to provide military assistance to India wouid make itdifficult for us to adopt the negative attitude suggested in the draft message to President Kennedy; and, while there would be no harmin re-emphasising to the United States Government the political objections to any proposal that fighter aircraft should participate inthe active defence of Indian cities, we should now seek to match theUnited States^ offer of assistance in other respects as nearly as our resources would allow.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) In the light of the generous assistance which we were alreadyproviding to India in relation to her programmes of social andeconomic development, we could not afford to make more than avery modest contribution to her rearmament, at least so long as theIndian Government, by refusing to reach a settlement with theGovernment of Pakistan on the issue of Kashmir, made it impossibleto plan the defence of the sub-continent on a rational basis.(b) This consideration was the more important in that the UnitedStates Government were already recommending the Federal GermanGovernment, against our advice, to sell aircraft to Pakistan. this might precipitate further requests for military aid from India; andwe must avoid becoming involved in a process of competitiverearmament by India and Pakistan.(c) We should not neglect the opportunity afforded by any further assistance which we might give to the Indian Government to pressthem to remove their present discrimination against British shipping.(d) It was perhaps unlikely that the United States Governmentwould be persuaded finally to abandon the proposal that UnitedStates and United Kingdom aircraft squadrons should participate inthe air defence of Indian cities. They were the more likely to adhere to it in that it represented a form of assistance to India which theycould undertake to provide without seeking prior Congressionalapproval. Moreover, they would tend to discount the political risks involved, in the light of current indications that, the indian government themselves might eventually reject this offer on thegrounds that it would be inconsistent with their policy ofnon-alignment.
(e) Nevertheless, so long as this project remained underdiscussion, it would constitute a potentially dangerous moralcommitment on our part; and we should continue to emphasise ourobjections to it as forcibly as possible.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that weshould suggest to the United States Government that they should adopt a cautious attitude at this stage to the Indian request for military assistance and, in particular, should avoid any undertaking extending over a substantial period of time. In addition, we should continue to urge them to refrain from any commitment as regards active participation by United States and United Kingdom forces in the air defence of Indian cities, pending further examination of the implications of this course.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for theUnited States Government to be informed, on the lines indicated in their discussion, of the United Kingdom viewson the scale and nature of further military assistance to India.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1.16th May, 1963.
