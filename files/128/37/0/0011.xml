It was nevertheless unfortunateMinute 4)        that we shcm^ now be unable to make representations about the inevitable incidents on the frontier between the Yemen and theFederation or to seek to persuade the republican authorities in the yemen to agree to a formal demarcation of that frontier.In discussion it was the general view of the Cabinet that our refusal to recognise the republican regime could best be justifiedin public on the grounds that it was not in effective control of thewhole country of which it purported to be the Government and that even its existing degree of control was dependent on very substantialEgyptian support. It would be less easy to sustain the argument thata refusal to accord recognition could be justified by the fact that the republican authorities had refused to recognise publicly our positionin Aden.   There were several instances where accordedrecognition to Governments who had not for their part recognised the legitimacy of British interests in areas of concern to them; Iraqhad not recognised our position in Kuwait nor Iran our position inBahrain.Anglo-GermanrelationsThe Cabinet (1) Took note that British representation in the Yemen would now be withdrawn.(2) Agreed that the Governments refusal to recognise the republican regime in the Yemen should be justified by reference to the fact that that regime was not in effective control of the whole of the country which it purported to govern and was dependent on military support from egypt.The Foreign Secretary said that he hoped to take variousinitiatives in due course to improve Anglo-German relations andwould welcome the support of his colleagues in putting them intoeffect.The Cabinet (3) Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.Malta 3.   The Colonial Secretary said that he had been unable toDockyard       persuade the director of Messrs.

He would himself make a statement in Parlia e -texplaining the position.C.C. 11 (63)Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inParliament in the following week.

In discussion it was suggested that the powers now to be takenby the Government of Malta, which included taking over thecompany&apos;s bank account and its assets, were wider than the needs ofthe situation required and might therefore give rise to criticism. On theother hand the report of the accountant appointed to enquire into thecompany&apos;s management of its affairs would be published that day andwould reveal a very unsatisfactory state of affairs. It was unlikelythat blame would attach to the Government of Malta for having taken wide powers to deal with a situation which so vitally affectedtheir economy, particularly since the Council of Administration wouldbe empowered to retransfer to the directors of the company such powers&apos;as proved in the event to be unnecessary for the efficient management of the dockyard. It was more likely that, once the extentof the company&apos;s mismanagement became known, criticism wouldbe directed to the appointment of the company in the first placerather than to *he action which it was now proposed to take against them.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Colonial Secretary andof the points made in their discussion.Statement 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the minister on Defence, Gf Defence (C. (63) 17), to which was annexed a draft of the Statement1963 on Defence, 1963.The Minister of Defence said that the traditional Defence white paper, setting out the Governments views on the major strategicquestions of the day. had tended to prove increasingly unsatisfactory and should not be regarded as an annual obligation. He therefore proposed on this occasion to publish the memoranda accompanyingthe Estimates of the three Services in a single volume, prefaced bythe brief explanatory statement contained in the annex to his memorandum.In discussion there was general agreement with this proposal.It was considered, however, that it would be preferable to omit the paragraph referring to possible changes in defence organisation; theGovernments study of this question was still proceeding and sospecific a reference to it in the White Paper might give rise toexpectations which would not be matched by the event.A new paragraph, paying tribute to the work of the Forces,could with advantage be added. It would also conform more closely with the Minister^ intention if the document as a whole were entitled the Statement on Defence, 1963, and the draft annex to C. (63) 17, asamended, were presented as the preface to the Statement.Various other amendments were agreed in discussion.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Defence to arrange for thepublication of The Statement on Defence, 1963, subject tothe amendments agreed in their discussion and to anyfurther amendments of detail which might be found to benecessary.industrial disputes(previous reference :C.C. (63) 6thConclusions,Minute 3)Emergencies5. The Home Secretary recalled that at their meeting on24th January the Cabinet had asked him to consider with other ministers concerned the possibility of enacting in the Contracts ofEmployment Bill that in certain essential industries any contract ofemployment should be deemed to include a provision requiringemployees to obey orders in times of emergency.   Ministers had
Commercial 6.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the ForeignPolicy Secretary and the President of the Board of Trade (C. (63) 13 and(Previous        15 respectively) on East-West trade.Reference:CC. (63) 10th The Foreign Secretary said that in the period following the failureConclusions, Qf our attempt to join the European Economic Community we mustMinute6) expect pressure for an increase in East-West trade; and this wouldEast-West be liable to raise contentious issues, particularly in relation to the items listed in his memorandum. It would be necessary to givecareful consideration to each of these items in the light of the probablereaction of public opinion in the United States which, althoughaccepting that an increase in East-West trade might help to relaxtension in the long run, believed that in the shorter term it would merely enable the Sino-Soviet bloc to divert more resources to the embarrassment of the West. We should therefore seek an opportunityto discuss with the United States Administration the whole issue ofeconomic policy towards the Sino-Soviet bloc and should attempt to persuade them not to press us on those issues, such as oil and largediameter pipe, on which public opinion in the United Kingdom waseasily aroused.concluded that the Bill could not be used for this purpose. provisions relating to emergencies and applying to specified industries would beanomalous in a measure which was intended to deal generally with conditions of service in the whole field of employment.It was unsatisfactory that the powers available to Ministers underthe Emergency Powers Act, 1920, could be invoked only where personstook, or threatened, action calculated to deprive the community ofthe essentials of life. It would be desirable, therefore, to consider an amendment of the Act, designed to enable emergency powers to beused in cases where essential supplies were threatened, e.g., by severe weather. Consideration might also be given to measures of a more general character, which might apply either in certain essential industries or in employments of all kinds, to deal more effectively with industrial indiscipline.In discussion it was pointed out that amendment of theEmergency Powers Act on the lines suggested would be lesscontroversial than general proposals for the restraint of industrialindiscipline. Such proposals would be liable to raise very contentiouslegal and political issues. There might, therefore, be advantage in establishing a Royal Commission to consider the problem of strikes in essential industries as a preliminary step towards possible legislation.But, without prejudice to more detailed examination of this possibilityat a later stage, work should now be put in hand on the proposed amendment of the Emergency Powers Act, 1920.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Contracts of Employment Bill should notbe amended to include provisions requiring employees toobey orders in times of emergency.(2) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the other ministers concerned, to arrange for an examination ofthe legislation required to amend the Emergency powers act, 1920, in the light of their discussion.(3) Agreed to consider further, when the examination under conclusion (2) had been completed, the desirability of appointing a Royal Commission to consider measures to restrain industrial indiscipline.
The President of the Board of Trade said that, while he did not dissent from the views expressed by the Foreign Secretary, it should bepossible to expand our exports to the Sino-Soviet bloc from theexisting 3 per cent to about 5 per cent, provided that we were preparedto permit larger imports of oil and agricultural products from the bloccountries. Such a policy v/ould be to our advantage in that it wouldenable us to exploit the opportunities of the bloc as a market for thecapital goods on which we depended for our living.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) In the period which lay ahead our economic policy must berealistically directed to the promotion of our own interests. Weshould therefore consider each proposal for an expansion of East-West trade on its merits; and we should not pay undue attention to public opinion in the United States at the expense of public opinion in this country, which was increasingly concerned about unemploymentin the capital goods industries.(b) It could be argued that the United States Government were seeking, in effect, to enforce a virtual blockade of the Soviet bloc.For this purpose they were not content with the collective embargo on strategic exports to the bloc which was imposed by agreement inthe Co-ordinating Committee (COCOM) but were seeking to persuadeus, in addition, to limit trade in commodities which were onlymarginally relevant to the purpose of the COCOM machinery. Weshould not acquiesce in this situation but should explain to the UnitedStates Government that in present circumstances we must holdourselves free to seek an enlargement of trade with the Soviet blocin both directions, provided that we refrained from exporting goodson the list covered by the COCOM embargo and were prepared todiscuss on their merits the addition to that list of any individual items which might be suggested.(c) On the other hand we should look closely at the balance ofadvantage in individual cases. There was no reason to modify theCabinet&apos;s earlier view that, provided that the genuine intentions of theSoviet authorities could be clarified, we should be prepared to considerpermitting the importation of a limited quota of Soviet fuel oil inreturn for the placing of substantial shipbuilding orders in the UnitedKingdom. But several United Kingdom interests were alreadydisturbed by this proposal; and any further suggestion that Sovietfuel oil should be imported would need to be very carefully considered.(d) If the possibility of accepting further imports of Russianoil was limited, the increase in our imports from the Sino-Soviet bloc,which was a condition of increasing our exports to the bloc, wouldhave to consist largely of agricultural products. If we were able to adapt our own agricultural policy on lines now under consideration,we might hope to be able to contain domestic production within reasonable limits and so to leave room for some expansion of imports.But this did not imply that we could afford to take a decision ofprinciple in favour of increasing agricultural imports from the bloc;each case must be considered on its merits, having regard not only tothe availablity of alternative supplies but also to the effect of blocimports on the domestic price and, therefore, on the Exchequer.fThe Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for theEconomic Policy Committee to give further considerationto the question of East-West trade and to consider the terms in which the President of the Board of Trade might discuss with the United States authorities, during his forthcoming visit to Washington, the considerations which wouldhenceforward determine our policy in this regard.
Farm price review,1963-64(previous reference :C.C. (62) 19thConclusions,Minute 6)7. The Chief Secretary, Treasury, informed the Cabinet that,if the Annual Review of Farm Prices for 1963-64 resulted in nochanges in the subsidy arrangements, the cost to the Exchequer ofagricultural support would be  364 million, an increase of some  41million over 1962-63. There had, however, been an improvement inefficiency, the value of which was assessed at  25 million for reviewcommodities; but there had also been a slight decline in actual farmincomes. These incomes would be further reduced by changesapproved by Ministers in the arrangements relating to pig-meat and eggs. The maximum permissible reduction in the value of guaranteesunder the Agriculture Acts was  23 million; and agreement had beenreached among the Ministers concerned that in discussions with the farmers&apos; Unions the Government should initially propose changes which would result in a reduction of  13 million. Since there hadbeen an estimated increase of  12 million in costs, the Unions would regard the Governments proposal as depriving farmers of any share in the benefits from increased efficiency; and the proposal might therefore have to be modified in negotiations.The Minister of Agriculture said that the changes relating topig-meat and eggs represented the only advance towards a new policyof agricultural support which it was practicable to make in this year&apos;sReview. The Governments main objective at this stage should be tosecure the co-operation of the Unions in working out the major changes which would in due course be required; he hoped that a white Paper which would be published in the spring would containsome reference to the lines on which the new policy should be evolved.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,14th February, 1963.
