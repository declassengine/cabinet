* Previously recorded as a Confidential Annex.SECRET*T The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that, in the lightof their earlier discussion that day, he had now discussed with the leader of the Opposition, Mr. Harold Wilson, M.P., the procedure to be adopted for publication of Lord Denning&apos;s Report on matters arising from the resignation of the former Secretary of State for War,Mr. J. D. Profumo.In so far as amendment of the text might be required on security grounds, Mr. Wilson would be prepared publicly to endorse adecision by the Government to delete the references to the possibility that the Security Service might have procured, through Mr. Profumo&apos;sagency, the defection of the Soviet Naval Attache in London. Inaddition, the text contained quotations from two post-war reports on the organisation of the Security Service; and, if the government felt it necessary to refuse, in response to a challenge in Parliament,to publish the whole of those documents, Mr. Wilson had indicated that he would support their action.As regards the risk that publication of the report might prejudice the pending proceedings against Miss Christine Keeler oncharges of perjury and conspiracy to prevent the course of justice,Mr. Wilson shared the Governments view that this risk was negligible.Mr. Wilson had also made it clear that, while he was anxious that the report should be published as rapidly as possible, he wouldnot be willing to co-operate with the Government in anyextraordinary Parliamentary procedure, such as a recall of the Houseof Lords, for this purpose. Since it had now become clear, as a resultof a discussion between Lord Denning and the Lord Chancellor,that Lord Denning would be prepared, in the circumstances, to waivehis earlier proposal that general publication of his report should be protected by absolute privilege, the balance of advantage appearedto lie in publishing it as a Command Paper, which would attractqualified privilege in the normal way.The Solicitor-General said that, while the Law Officers adhered to their view that publication of the report would not be likely to prejudice the pending proceedings against Miss Keeler, there was some risk that its publication without absolute privilege would enable her to make an ex parte application to the Divisional Court on grounds of contempt. If the application were granted, the stationery office would in effect be debarred from distributing further copies ofthe report until the proceedings against Miss Keeler had been disposed of.In discussion it was agreed that the Government should acceptwhatever risk on this score there might be and that, in view of thepolitical advantage of publishing the report in its entirety, the passageswhich might be thought to be open to question on security groundsshould be allowed to stand.The Cabinet Agreed that Lord Denning&apos;s Report on matters arising fromthe resignation of the former Secretary of State for War,Mr. J. D. Profumo, should be published, as a command paper and without amendment, as soon as possible.
ForeignAffairsIndonesia(previous reference:C.C. (63) 53rdConclusions.Minute I)2. The Foreign Secretary said that, since the Cabinets earliermeeting that day, the Indonesian Ambassador had called on him toexpress his Governments regret at the destruction of Her Majesty&apos;s embassy at Djakarta and to undertake that his Government wouldnot condone further mob violence and would provide adequate protection for British lives and property. Meanwhile, however,renewed uncertainty had developed about the position of the british firms which had been taken over by the Indonesian labour unions and there was some reason to believe that, although the unions hadbeen made to relinquish the establishments involved, the Indonesian government had now taken control of them, ostensibly in order toensure their continued operation. It was too early to determine whether this was merely a temporary measure or whether it represented the first step in expropriation; and it would be necessaryto seek urgent clarification on this point.In these circumstances Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Djakarta,had recommended that he should be withdrawn from Indonesia, onthe ground that the Indonesian Government appeared unwilling to conduct business with him. It would be desirable that he should remain at his post at least for the next few days, in order to supervise the evacuation of British residents. The Ambassador^ positionthereafter would depend on the attitude of the Indonesian government, which he would endeavour to ascertain in discussionwith the Indonesian Foreign Minister at the forthcoming meeting ofthe United Nations in New York.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.NorthAtlanticTreatyOrganisationMultilateralForce(previous reference:C.C. (63) 46thConclusions,Minute 5)3. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs (C. (63) 151) and the Minister of Defence(C. (63) 153) on United Kingdom participation in a multilateralnuclear force within the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO).The Foreign Secretary said that it had been decided to establishtwo international groups to examine certain practical aspects of theproposed force. A group meeting in Washington would considertechnical and operational problems and a group in Paris would examine the political and legal issues. In addition to the Governmentsof the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany, theItalian, Belgian, Greek and Turkish Governments would probablywish to take part in these discussions. Neither the Scandinavian northe French Governments, however, would be represented.It was desirable in principle that we should participate in these enquiries, in the light of our earlier undertaking to the United StatesGovernment that we would support them in the development of proposals for the creation of such a force. Moreover, if we must assume that the force would come into being in any event, it wouldbe better that we should be associated with its formation and shouldbe able to influence its development. Our participation in thediscussions would be conditional on an explicit understanding that it did not commit us in any way to eventual participation in a multilateral force; and the objectives which we should seek to secure,particularly as regards the maintenance of United States and UnitedKingdom control over the use of the force, should be made clear inadvance to the Governments concerned.The Minister of Defence said that he did not believe that itwould be possible for the United Kingdom to take part inpreliminary discussions about a multilateral force without acceptingan implied commitment to contribute to it, if it were established.The terms of reference for the proposed examination of the political aspects of the force made it clear that, if a country was represented
at the discussions, it would be regarded as being &quot; seriously interestedin creating a multilateral force &quot; and &quot; prepared to enter into detailed discussion with that end in view&quot;. These words could not be reconciled with the concept that the United Kingdom mightparticipate without commitment. But a commitment to join the force,whether open or implied, would be open to serious objection. Inparticular, the estimate of its cost was rising steadily; and the contribution required of the United Kingdom might amount toupwards of  250 million over a period of ten years. So large a sumcould be found only at the expense of the social services or of other more vital defence commitments. Strategically, the force had nothing to commend it, since it would add little to the deterrent power of theWest and, so long as it remained subject to the United States veto,would be used only when the main United States deterrent forces,which were already of overwhelming strength, had been brought into play. Politically, the force would be strongly opposed by an importantsection of public opinion in this country, both as tending to increaseinternational tension and as bringing the German Government closer to a position in which they might obtain control of some nuclearforces. For these reasons the United Kingdom should refuse to take part in the proposed discussions.In discussion the following points were made:(a) It could not justly be argued that the United KingdomGovernment had given an undertaking to the United StatesGovernment to take part in discussions of the kind now proposed.No more had been agreed at Nassau than that the United kingdom would make available its own nuclear forces to NATO as an element in a larger NATO grouping, which might include a multilateral force.This undertaking had been carried out by the assignment of theUnited Kingdom V-bomber force to NATO. Subsequently.President Kennedy had been told that we should be willing to take part in discussions designed to secure the closer association ofmembers of NATO with its nuclear deterrent. But this had been inthe context of the consideration of various possible means of achieving this objective, of which the multilateral force had been onlyone; and the undertaking then given could not be held to apply to detailed discussion of the multilateral force in isolation, on the linesnow proposed.(b) The military and financial objections to the force were substantial. It would also arouse intense political opposition in theUnited Kingdom and, by increasing international tension, might prejudice the chances of negotiating with the Soviet Government a pact for the non-dissemination of nuclear weapons.(c) On the other hand the United States Government stillappeared to believe that the establishment of the force would serve to contain German aspirations in relation to nuclear power; and it seemed likely, therefore, that they would proceed to establish theforce irrespective of our own views. In these circumstances it couldbe held that, on political grounds, our interest would be best served by taking part at least in the preliminary discussions. We could not afford to stand aside from so important a development in european defence arrangements or to deny ourselves the opportunity of trying,in the course of the negotiations, to mitigate its obvious dangers.Although the proposals for the force would at a later stage have tobe brought before the North Atlantic Council for discussion and agreement, our position and influence in those more generaldiscussions would be less decisive than in the work of thepreliminary groups.(cl) We ought, therefore, to seek to take part in the preliminary discussions without committing ourselves to eventual participation in the force. The proposed terms of reference, however, would be widely regarded as morally implying agreement to join the force
when it was established. This danger might be avoided to some extentif we were to make it clear in advance that our agreement to take part in the discussions did not carry with it any commitment of thiskind. The terms of such a statement would need careful consideration.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, interms of the development of Western strategy, the multilateral force was misconceived. The broad parity of nuclear power between theNorth Atlantic Alliance and the Soviet Government respectively had greatly diminished the risk of war in Europe itself. The SovietGovernment recognised this fact. On the other hand they were beginning to appreciate the growing danger to their interests fromCommunist China; and the present Sino-Soviet conflict should be viewed in terms not of ideology but of a more basic conflict between two great Powers, which would be liable to intensify as China was forced by the pressure of her growing population to find room for expansion. On this basis it could be held that the Soviet government might gradually become willing to work towards a greater degree of understanding with the West and the maintenance of stability inEurope. The creation of the multilateral force at this stage might welljeopardise the prospects of such an understanding; and, by increasinginternational tension, it would be liable to disturb the balance of nuclear power at a time when the real interests of the West required a more constructive approach to the Soviet Government and thefurther development of measures to follow up the initiative of the test Ban Agreement.Unfortunately, however, these views were not shared by theGovernments of France and the Federal Republic of Germany, who,for different reasons, were anxious to avoid any understanding withthe Soviet Government which might either inhibit the developmentof their own forces or be held to imply an acceptance of the present political and territorial division of Europe. The United KingdomGovernment were thus in a dilemma. The arguments against any form of participation in the multilateral force had been fully developed in the course of the Cabinefs discussion; but it was alsoclear that failure to take part at least in the preliminary discussions about this force might damage our relations with the United StatesGovernment and the Federal German Government and might alsoleave us eventually without the means of influencing a new, andpotentially important, element in the North Atlantic Alliance. the precise terms in which a decision either to participate or not toparticipate in the proposed discussions was presented would thereforebe of great importance; and the Cabinet would wish to consider them with care.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theMinister of Defence, to suggest the terms in which the government&apos;s attitude towards the proposed international discussions on the multilateral force might be announced.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.
