3iIndustrialDisputes(previous reference:C.C. (62) 69thConclusions,Minute 2)ElectricityIndustry1, The Minister of Power said that on the previous day asettlement had been reached in the wages dispute between theElectricity Council and the five trade unions concerned. Its essentialelements were (i) an additional payment of 24-d. an hour with effect from 1st February, together with increases of the same amount ineach of the following two years; (ii) payment of a productivity bonusat a rate of Is. 6d. a week for each \ per cent by which the rise in productivity in a given year exceeded 34- per cent, (iii) provision fora review of the agreement if a rise in the retail price index by fivepoints or more persisted for at least three months.From the point of view of the unions these arrangementsrepresented little improvement over an offer made by the employers&apos;side in December. In effect, the agreement would raise wages in theindustry by rather less than 4 per cent per annum over three years,assuming a constant level of productivity; and, so regarded, it couldbe defended as consistent with the Governments incomes policy.In discussion the following points were made:(a) Union representatives were already suggesting thatGovernment influence had been exerted to protract the discussionsfrom the outset and to inhibit the employers&apos; freedom of negotiation.It would be necessary to consider how such allegations should berefuted. A public inquiry into the conduct of the negotiations would be unprecedented; but it would not necessarily be whollydisadvantageous.(b) Shortly before the conclusion of the agreement to which theywere a party, the Electrical Trades Union had called upon their members to ban overtime. This instruction would presumably nowbe withdrawn; but if it were maintained and if, lor this or any other reason, the output of the power stations were subject to interruptionduring the current period of severe weather, the Government wouldbe expected to take effective action. The proclamation of anemergency would make it possible to enforce a curtailment of demand; but public opinion would call for more positive steps.Immediate consideration should therefore be given to such measures as the employment of troops to maintain output; the possibility of promoting, under the existing law, a charge of criminal conspiracyagainst individuals responsible for inciting disaffection in the power stations: and the advisability of seeking to strengthen theGovernments statutory powers in this respect.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with theMinisters concerned, to circulate a memorandum discussing the courses of action open to the Government in the eventof further interruptions in electricity supplies.Parliament 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the two weeks following the reassemblyof Parliament on 22nd January.ForeignAffairsCongoRepublic(previous reference:C.C. (63) 3rdConclusions,Minute 2)3. The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that the PrimeMinister of Katanga, Mr. Tshombe, had now given an undertaking to end the de facto secession of Katanga from the Congo republic and had announced his willingness to return to Elizabethville fromKolwezi to discuss arrangements for this purpose. For the timebeing there would be no further advance by United Nations troopsin the direction of Kolwezi. Relations between the United KingdomGovernment and the Central Government of the Congo were stillstrained; but there was evidence that the Central Government were anxious to improve them.   In addition to offering a full and

The Prime Minister said that a statement made by PresidentCommon de Gaulle at his Press conference on 14th January, opposing UnitedMarket Kingdom entry into the European Economic Community, had createdNegotiations    a new situation.   The President might have hoped that, as a result,(Previous        we would ourselves take the initiative in breaking off the currentReference:       discussions in Brussels.   This, however, would have been an errorC.C. (63) 3rd    of judgment, particularly in the light of the strong reaction from theConclusions,    other member countries of the Community to President de Gaulle&apos;sMinute 6)       statement.   They rightly considered that the Presidents view that the traditions and international obligations of the United Kingdomdebarred us in principle from membership of the Community wasone which should have been expressed at the time of our originalapplication for membership rather than in the closing stages of thenegotiations; and we should seek to extract advantage from theirattitude.   There was some evidence that, in default of a decision onour part to break off negotiations, the French Foreign Minister,M. Couve de Murville, had now received instructions to urge therepresentatives of the other member countries to rally to the Frenchpoint of view under threat that failure to do so would put the Treatyof Rome itself in jeopardy.   It must remain our own objective,however, to seek to maintain the negotiations and to unite the otherimmediate apology for the recent attack on the British Embassy inLeopoldville by local students, they had suggested that they mightsend a senior Minister to London for discussions.The Prime Minister said that, in order to counteract currentmisrepresentations of our motives, it might be helpful to publish a white Paper demonstrating that the Governments policy towardsthe Congo since its independence had been consistently directed to the achievement of a fair and peaceful settlement of the Congo&apos;s internalproblems.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs to arrangefor consideration to be given to the publication of a white paper on the Governments policy towards the congo republic since its independence.The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs informed the Cabinetthat diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia had now been resumed and the resulting exchange of missions had been announced on16th January. No decision had yet been taken to recognise the republican regime in the Yemen; and the British Minister in Taiz hadbeen recalled to London for consultation.The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that Mr. Grunitzky,a former Prime Minister of Togo, had returned from Dahomey totake charge of the new Government of Togo which had beenestablished after the assassination of President OlympicIn discussion it was agreed that recognition of the new government of Togo should be withheld for the time being; eventhough present conditions in Togo were not comparable with thosein the Yemen, unduly prompt recognition of the new TogoGovernment might embarrass our relations with the republicanregime in the Yemen.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs to arrange for recognition of the new Government of Togo to be deferred for the time being.
Federa-tion ofRhodesiaandNyasaland(previous reference:C.C. (63) 3rdConclusions,Minute 3)Future of theFederation5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the first secretary of State (C. (63) 1) about his forthcoming consultations with the Federal and Territorial Governments of the Federation of rhodesia and Nyasaland.The First Secretary of State said that, as a result of the recentelections in Northern and Southern Rhodesia and the government&apos;s decision to allow Nyasaland to secede from the Federation, theposition of the Federal Government had been seriously weakened.They were nevertheless determined to maintain, if possible, a closepolitical and economic association between Northern and SouthernRhodesia; and we could not wholly dismiss the possibility that, inthe last resort, the Federal Prime Minister, Sir Roy Welensky, might seek to secure this objective by the use of armed force. In thesecircumstances it would be the main purpose of his forthcoming visit to Central Africa to ascertain the views of the Territorial governments on the nature and scope of the future association between them and to discover whether we might hope that, starting from the essential ties of economic self interest, we might eventually persuade them toconsider the maintenance of some type of political link as well.Sir Roy Welensky would undoubtedly react strongly against so limiteda concept of the future degree of association between the Territories.But he must be brought to realise that any solution of the problemmust depend on the free consent of all the parties concerned; andhe might be the more willing to do so if he realised that he couldnot necessarily rely henceforward on the political support of the new government of Southern Rhodesia. That Government might beprepared to support the Federal authority up to a point, in order toensure the maintenance of law and order in Southern Rhodesia; butthey would also be aware of the advantage of a close economic link between Southern Rhodesia and the wealth which Northern Rhodesiaderived from her copper mines and, if they could be convinced thatthe political ambitions of Sir Roy Welensky represented an obstacle to the establishment of such a link, they might judge it to be in their interests to endorse our own policy. This would still leave unsolved,however, the question whether, when both Northern Rhodesia and nyasaland had become independent, we could properly conferindependence on Southern Rhodesia against the wishes of the majorityof her population.C.C. 4 (63)members of the Community in our support. It was not certain thatthey would have the strength to resist the political pressure which theFrench Government would bring to bear upon them; but the attitudeof the Federal German Government would be of critical importance.In discussion the following points were made:(a) It would be unwise to try to encourage the United StatesGovernment to influence the Federal German Government to support us. Any such attempt might merely make the German Governmenteven more susceptible to the French insinuation that our own attitude was evidence of an Anglo-American attempt to dominate Europe.(b) In order to secure the continued support of member countries of the Community other than France it might be necessary for us toshow more readiness to meet their point of view on difficulties still outstanding in the negotiations.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the Prime Minister^ statement.(2) Agreed to seek to continue negotiations for the UnitedKingdom&apos;s entry into the European economic community.
In discussion there was general agreement with these views.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the lines on which the First Secretary of state proposed to conduct his forthcoming discussions with theCentral African Governments as indicated in C. (63) 1.Constitutional The Cabinet next considered a memorandum by the First.Conference. Secretary of State (C. (63) 4), to which was appended the draft of a&apos;953 White Paper refuting the allegation by Sir Roy Welensky that the government&apos;s agreement to the secession of Nyasaland was in breach of pledges given by United Kingdom Ministers at the constitutional conference in 1953 which had resulted in the establishment of theFederation.The First Secretary of State said that Sir Roy Welensky hadpurported to find support for his allegation in certain extracts fromthe confidential records of the Conference, which he had quoted inthe course of a recent speech in the Federal Assembly. Pressure had subsequently developed in this country for the publication of theserecords; and it would seem wise to demonstrate, by acceding to this pressure, that the charge of breach of faith was groundless.In discussion there was some support for this view. The text of the verbatim record of the relevant discussions in 1953 made itclear that they had been related solely to the probable effect on thefinancial credit of the Federation of the proposed insertion in thedraft Constitution of a clause providing for its review after a definedperiod; and the statements made by the United Kingdom ministers concerned had been directed simply to establishing that the Federationcould not be abrogated in the context of that review otherwise than bythe unanimous consent of all the four local Governments concerned.This was in no sense a pledge by the United Kingdom Governmentto maintain the Federation in perpetuity. Moreover, any such pledge,in so far as it purported to preclude the Parliament of the day fromannulling the acts of a previous Parliament, would have been contraryto normal constitutional practice. This principle might appear tohave been infringed to some extent in the past e.g., in the preamble to the Commonwealth of Australia Act, 1900, which recorded theagreement of the people of New South Wales &quot;... to unite in oneindissoluble Federal Commonwealth. . .&quot;; but in the case of theCentral African Federation no corresponding provision had been included in the statute and this was additional evidence that no suchintention had been in the minds of United Kingdom Ministers at thetime. On the contrary, the verbatim record of the discussions in1953 showed that they had made it clear that the United kingdom parliament must always reserve the right to repeal earlier legislation and that this point had been expressly accepted by the representativeof the Federal Government.On the other hand there was some risk that, if we now publishedour own interpretation of the confidential records of the 1953Conference, we should create a dangerous precedent in relation tothe release of such records in general. This risk would be aggravatedif publication provoked Sir Roy Welensky to retaliate with furtheraccusations of bad faith; and we might gradually be drawn into anundignified public altercation with the Federal Government.Moreover, although the verbatim record of the discussions, if carefullyconstrued, would sustain the interpretation which we should proposeto place upon it, individual extracts, considered in isolation and outof context, could be made to appear to endorse Sir Roy Welensky&apos;sinterpretation; and this impression would be reinforced by the extractfrom the formal minutes of the Thirteenth Session of the Conferenceon 19th January, 1953, in which it was stated that &quot;... any proposalto terminate the Constitution could only be put into effect with theconcurrence of the Federal Government and all three territorial governments and of Her Majesty?s Government in the United
Kingdom . . .&quot;. Uninformed pubiic opinion might well regard tinsstatement as indistinguishable from a pledge by the United Kingdomnot to take any unilateral action which would contribute to the dissolution of the Federation.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that weshould not seek to prove too much. In order to establish our good faith it should suffice to maintain that at the relevant point in the1953 deliberations the parties were primarily concerned to ensure the stability of the Federation at the time when its Constitution wouldbe reviewed and to anticipate the adverse effect on its credit-worthinessof any suggestion that that review might be the occasion of itsdissolution. In these circumstances it was right and natural that united Kingdom Ministers should emphasise their intention that theFederation should be a permanent entity. But there was no constitutional means of putting such a statement of purpose beyondthe reach of amendment by a subsequent Government in a laterParliament; and there was no discredit in our admitting that, in thelight of the change in the circumstances since 1953, we were nowcompelled to reconsider the future of the Federation as a whole the White Paper should be re-drafted on this basis; and the cabinet should consider further, after the First Secretary of State had returned from his forthcoming visit to Central Africa, the nice balance of argument in relation to the desirability of its publication.The Cabinet (2) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with theLord Chancellor and the Minister without Portfolio, to redraft the White Paper appended to C. (63) 4 on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister.(3) Agreed to resume, at a subsequent meeting, their discussionof the desirability of publishing the White Paper asre-drafted.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,17th January, 1963.
