11 /!o 1 (IMalta(previous reference:C.C. (63) 44thConclusions,Minute 5)2. The Commonwealth Secretary informed the Cabinet thatthe discussions which he was currently conducting with the leadersof the political parties in Malta had revealed that a substantial majority of Maltese opinion would favour the independence of the island. He proposed, therefore, to recommend in principle that Maltashould become independent in January 1964. An irreconcilabledifference of view had emerged, however, on certain important issuesaffecting the Constitution of the Island after it attained independence.All the political parties, except the Labour Party, favoured themaintenance of the monarchy, Maltese membership of theCommonwealth and the retention in the Island of the privileged position of the Roman Catholic Church. The Labour Party, however,advocated that Malta should become a republic, that there shouldbe no prior commitment as regards membership of the commonwealth and that most of the privileges of the Roman Catholic Church shouldbe abolished. In these circumstances the wisest course would be toarrange a referendum on the issues involved. It was virtually certainthat this would reveal a decisive majority in favour of the type of constitution sponsored by the majority of the parties. Any discussionof the financial implications of independence would be postponed until after the referendum. A defence agreement would be negotiatedimmediately after the Island attained independence.The Cabinet Took note, with approval,Commonwealth Secretary.of this statement  by  theFutureDefencePolicy(previous reference:C.C. (63) 11thConclusions,Minute 4)Aircraft CarrierProgramme3. The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda on future defence policy and the aircraft carrier programme:C. (63) 128 by the Minister of Defence.C. (63) 132 by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.C. (63) 133 by the Chief Secretary, Treasury.C. (63) 139 by the Secretary of State for Air.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that both social and defence expenditure were increasing more rapidly than the growth of our national resources. If this tendency were not checked, freshmeasures of restraint would have to be imposed on the private sector;and, since it would be unrealistic to suppose that wage rates couldbe prevented from rising at least as fast as the growth in national productivity, the only means of curtailing private consumption wouldbe increased taxation. This, in turn, would inhibit the growth of the economy, which alone would make it possible to sustain increases in public expenditure without recurrent inflationary crises. In theworld-wide struggle against Communism the health of our economy and the increasing prosperity of the West as a whole would have no less important a part to play than military forces.Our present strategy assumed that we needed to discharge three major roles, namely, to retain an independent nuclear deterrent, tocontribute forces to the defence of Europe, and to maintain a militarypresence east of Suez. If it must be taken for granted that inpresent circumstances we could not abandon either of the first tworoles, the future of our aircraft carriers must be examined in the context of the third role, i.e., in terms of our ability to deter limitedaggression on a world-wide scale. But in the light of the country&apos;economic prospects it was arguable whether we could afford to3781-2a 2C.C. 48 (63)Parliament 1,   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.
maintain this role throughout the 1970s, if no cheaper way of doing so could be found than a perpetuation of our aircraft carriers. TheNavy would in any case have two carriers in service until 1980;what was now at issue, therefore, was not the preservation of a carriercapability but its size, i.e., whether three carriers were the essentialminimum. Moreover, a new carrier would not need to be ordereduntil 1965; and the longer a decision could be delayed the more clearlywe should be able to assess our future strategy and our need to retaincarriers on the scale now proposed.If, however, it were now decided in principle that a new carriershould be ordered, the expenditure involved clearly could not be absorbed within the limits of existing approved programmes. Eithercompensating economies would have to be found in the defence programme itself or social expenditure would have to be reduced orthe balanced growth of the economy would have to be jeopardised.The Minister of Defence said that, although our present strategyadmittedly required us to sustain three roles, it might become possibleto reduce our commitments in Europe in due course. But, so long aswe sought to discharge the world-wide role and, therefore, to maintain a military presence east of Suez, the Navy could not survive as a fighting force without a carrier fleet. It could neither attack nor defenditself. The development of a missile capability, which the Navy didnot now possess, might provide a partial alternative to the continuedprovision of carrier support; but the development of new long-rangemissiles and of the ships to carry them would be no less, and mightbe more, expensive than the maintenance of a carrier capability. TheNavy had at present four carriers, of which two would continue in service until 1980. But the other two would reach the end of their effective life in 1970-71; and they could not be safely extended beyond that date. No more was at issue than the proposal to replace one ofthese two ships, with the result that the carrier fleet would in any event be reduced to three in the early 1970s. This reduction would itself involve some element of risk; but to allow the carrier fleet to contract to only two ships would make it almost impossible tomaintain a naval presence east of Suez. Moreover, it would be veryuneconomic, since the ships would have to spend much of their timein transit instead of on station. Finally, the prospective decline in thecarrier strength could not be concealed; and it would be assumed thatthe Government had decided to dispense with carriers altogether indue course. This would have serious political repercussions; and itwould be liable gravely to affect recruitment to the Fleet Air Arm.In military terms alone, therefore, a decision not to order anothercarrier might deprive us of the ability to maintain a military presenceeast of Suez at a comparatively early date.It now seemed probable that an aircraft could be developed forthe common use of the Navy and of the Air Force. This would notonly make possible a more rational and flexible deployment of airpower but would also lead to closer working relationships betweenthe two Services in conformity with the purpose of the new organisation for defence. Moreover, it should yield substantial economies, of the order of  150 million, by comparison with thedevelopment of two separate types of new aircraft. These, coupled with a saving of an equivalent amount as the result of a decision,which could be accepted, not to replace the second carrier to be withdrawn from service in 1970-72, would more than offset the costof one new carrier, together with its aircraft. In addition, it should bepossible to defer beyond the present decade more than  70 million ofdefence expenditure which had been included in earlier plans.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) From the political point of view there was no scope for earlyreduction in any of our major commitments overseas. But by 1970 itmight no longer be necessary to maintain forces in the Middle Eastfor the protection of Kuwait; and in the Far East Malaysia might have
reached a political understanding with Indonesia which would reducethe risk of war in that area. Moreover, no circumstances could nowbe foreseen in which we should be required to mount, unaided, a landing against opposition in any part of the world. Over the next10 years, therefore, the need for a carrier force east of Suez mightdisappear. But developments of this kind were essentially speculative;so long as it remained possible that we might need to deploy a military effort overseas during the 1970s, it would be unwise for theGovernment to deprive themselves at this stage of the only means bywhich such an effort could be sustained. It would be preferable to cancel, at a later point, a decision which had been renderedunnecessary than to incur so serious a risk now.(b) From the military point of view carriers offered advantages which no other weapons system could match. In the absence otmissiles, aircraft support was essential to any kind of naval operation;and in many parts of the world only carriers could provide such support. Moreover, they made possible a wide range of politicaloptions, in that they were mobile; they could bring the threat of force to bear openly or discreetly as the situation might require; andthey were not dependent on land bases, since they could stay at seafor periods of up to three months at a time and could be refuelledand restocked at sea from supply ships. The supply ships themselves would need access to ports; but a wide range of choice would be open for this purpose in the Far East, particularly perhaps in Australia. Ifprovided with appropriate escorts, they would be capable of defendingthemselves against any form of attack likely to be brought to bearagainst them in the foreseeable future, short of conditions of totalnuclear war. The possibility of fitting the new carrier with nuclear propulsion, which would enable it to remain at sea for longer periods,had also been studied. But, apart from the fact that this would delayits entry into service by at least three years and would add about40 per cent to its cost, it had not been thought right that theGovernment should seek to gain its first experience of the problemsof nuclear propulsion at sea in a ship of such strategic importance.(c) The Secretary of State for Air said that, if it could be assumed that the defence budget would continue to rise, many of the operationalarguments which had been advanced in support of a new carriermight be thought to be valid. But, if defence expenditure had to be stabilised or curtailed and more exacting priorities had therefore tobe enforced, a carrier could not be regarded as of such high priorityas to justify us in pre-empting on its behalf so large a proportion ofthe total resources available for defence. Its role, although important,would be limited; in particular, carriers found no essential place inany of the present contingency plans which had been prepared todeal with various military emergencies. Moreover, it would provide a relatively small capability in relation to its cost; and it would thereforeaggravate the tendency to disperse limited resources among too manyprojects, a tendency which would result in our forces being weak inall roles and effective in none. A decision on a new carrier should therefore be deferred until certain studies now in progress, particularlyinto questions of air defence, had been brought to a conclusion.(d) In favour of deferring a decision it was argued that the navy would in any case have two carriers in service until 1980; that thecase for a third carrier had not been conclusively established; that itmight be possible to keep at least one of the two older carriers in service longer than was at present envisaged; and that no order for anew carrier need be placed until 1965. As against these considerations,however, it was common knowledge that a decision had already been deferred for three years: it was improbable that the factors on which any decision would have to be based would be materially affected byany re-examination; and a further deferment would be bound to provoke considerable political criticism.
Local 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisterGovernment Gf Housing and Local Government (C. (63) 135) about certainReorganisation recommendations of the Local Government Commission.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that there organisation of local government was an essential part of the policyof modernisation; progress in a number of fields was impeded by theexistence of antiquated and inefficient units of local government.Broad decisions had already been taken in London and in the BlackCountry. Decisions had been, or shortly would be, taken to promoteSolihull and Luton to county borough status, to demote the countyborough of Burton-on-Trent and to make boundary changes atCoventry, Leicester, Northampton, Stoke-on-Trent and Tamworth.He proposed to announce these decisions shortly. Progress with ruralreorganisation, however, depended on the Governments decisions onthe Local Government Commission^ proposals in relation to thefour counties of Huntingdonshire, the Soke of Peterborough,Cambridgeshire and the Isle of Ely and on the projected amalgamation of Rutland with Leicestershire. The Commission haa originally proposed that Cambridge should become a county borough and thatthe four counties should be amalgamated to form one county. Thissuggestion had met with opposition from all the parties concernedexcept Cambridge; and the Commission had then proposed that theSoke of Peterborough should be amalgamated with Huntingdonshireand the Isle of Ely with Cambridgeshire. This arrangement was acceptable to three of the counties, although not to the Isle of Ely, orto the City of Cambridge; and it could be justified on its merits. TheGovernment could hardly endorse it. however, unless they were also prepared to agree that Rutland, whose population of 25,000 wassmaller than any of the four counties, should be amalgamated withLeicestershire.(e) The development of a common aircraft for the Navy and theAir Force would not be affected by the decision on the new carrier,except as regards the size of the order for such aircraft. A commonaircraft would be developed in any case as a replacement for theHunter and the Sea Vixen; and it would be capable of operating fromthe carriers now in service.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that whatwas now at issue was the structure and capability of the Navy notuvu me ncAL icw y^als uui m public uciauc tuici  iy/\j. Lit LMau jjvliuuthe relative importance of Europe in the world-wide confrontationbetween West and East might progressively diminish, particularly ifthe conclusion of an agreement with the Soviet Government on theprohibition of the testing of nuclear weapons led gradually to some more general relaxation of political and military tension. But nosimilar prospect had yet presented itself in the Far East; indeed, thesituation in that area of the world might develop in the opposite direction. If so, we should face a corresponding need to strengthen the defences of the free world east of Suez. It was in this context thatit would be right to consider the proposal to construct a new aircraft carrier. On the other hand, the discussion had shown that it waspossible to question the technical and professional assumptionsunderlying this proposal; and it had also emphasised the danger that,if we attempted to maintain a military role which we could not in theend afford, not only would our military influence be diminished butthe economy might suffer a degree of damage which would weaken our position in the cold war even more than the maintenance of a world-wide military presence might tend to strengthen it. The cabinet would wish to reflect further on these conflicting factors before reaching a final decision.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion at a later meeting.
It had been suggested in discussion in the Home AffairsCommittee that, in view of the impending county council elections of1964, it would be convenient to postpone decisions on these two schemes in order that any new arrangements should not come intoforce until shortly before the county council elections of 1967. Itwould be possible, however, for the amalgamation of Rutland andLeicestershire to take effect before the 1964 elections and for theamalgamations of the four counties to take effect in april 1965. ihe1964 county council elections in these areas could be cancelled. delay would be liable to be interpreted by public opinion as evidence ofinfirmity of political purpose on the part of the Government; and itwould prejudice not only the reorganisation of counties but the no less important work of reviewing county districts. A decision to giveeffect to the proposed amalgamations, on the other hand, would be clear evidence of the Governments intention to promote efficiency in the administration of the public services; and it would thereforebe appropriate that a decision to implement the Local government commission^ recommendations in respect of the four counties and ofRutland should be announced before the recess.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) Acceptance of the recommendations of the Local government commission in respect of the four counties and of Rutland would be widely criticised in, and beyond, the areas concerned; and, in viewof the action which had already been taken to reorganise localgovernment in London and other urban areas, it could hardly be saidto be necessary that the Government should endorse those recommendations in order to demonstrate their determination tocarry through their policy of reorganisation.(b) On the other hand it was important to the development of theGovernments policies in relation to housing, transport and the social services to abolish small units of local government, which wereincapable of providing the specialist and other services necessary tomaintain the standards achieved elsewhere. In general, the public had little sympathy with small and inefficient authorities; and it was significant that in the Isle of Ely (although not in Rutland) theopposition to the proposals was virtually confined to the localauthority itself.(c) Rutland, however, could be distinguished from the fourcounties on the ground that there was no compelling administrativenecessity for its amalgamation with Leicestershire; and there mightbe some political advantage in demonstrating that the Governmentwere prepared to take account of special historical and other reasonsfor leaving a small unit in being, provided that they made it clear,at the same time, that they intended to proceed firmly withamalgamations where no such circumstances existed.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Local Government Commission&apos;srecommendations for the amalgamation of the Soke ofPeterborough with Huntingdonshire and of the Isle ofEly with Cambridgeshire should be accepted; but thatthe recommendation that Rutland should be amalgamatedwith Leicestershire should be rejected.(2) Took note that the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment would announce these decisions, togetherwith the decision to demote Burton-on-Trent, in the Houseof Commons before the recess.(3) Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government to consult the First Secretary of State and the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster on the terms in which this statement should justify the exceptional treatment to be accorded to Rutland.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,25th July, 1963.
