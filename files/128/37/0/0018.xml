Export ofLargeDiameterSteel Pipe(previous reference:C.C. (63) 17thConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the chief secretary, Treasury (C. (63) 55), reporting the conclusions of the strategic Exports Committee on the desirability of permitting exportsof large diameter steel pipe to the Soviet Union.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the Committee had unanimously concluded that it would be wrong to intervene toprevent the fulfilment of any orders of this kind that British firmsmight secure. A decision in this sense would be ill-received by theGovernments of other countries in the North Atlantic treaty organisation (NATO); but it would be consistent with our declaredopposition to measures of economic warfare, save in the face of animminent threat of a specific character. Moreover, a number of otherNATO countries had until recently acquiesced in the supply of largediameter pipe to the Soviet bloc; and Italy might continue to fulfilorders already placed. In addition, Sweden and Japan were successfully resisting the pressure being exerted upon them by theUnited States Government for the establishment of an embargo.In discussion the following points were raised:(a) The oil pipelines for which the pipe was required might is.due course enable Soviet interests to penetrate Western oil marketsPay of 1.   The Cabinet resumed their consideration of memoranda byMembers of    the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (C. (63) 50) and the LordParliament      President of the Council (C. (63) 54) on the pay of Ministers and(Previous        Members of Parliament.Reference:C.C. (63) 17th In discussion there was general agreement that any increase in conclusions, the remuneration of Ministers and Members of Parliament would minute 8) need to be substantial if it was to satisfy current criticism; and that,since it would be difficult to reconcile any significant improvementwith the Government^ incomes policy, the balance of advantage layin indicating, as soon as was convenient, that the Government did not intend to bring forward proposals for this purpose during the lifetime of the present Parliament. Moreover, before such proposals could be formulated it would be necessary to give further consideration to thepossibility of relating the remuneration of Ministers and Members ofParliament to the remuneration of certain other classes of thecommunity, as determined by an independent authority such as theNational Incomes Commission or one of the related bodies; to thedesirability of proposing an improvement in the non-monetaryconditions of service of Members of Parliament as an alternative toan increase in pay; and to the feasibility of endorsing a significant increase in the remuneration of Members of Parliament withoutmaterially altering the public estimation of their status and responsibilities. This latter issue was itself linked with the wholequestion of the reform of Parliamentary procedure, which was atpresent the subject of considerable public debate.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Government should not bring forward proposals for an improvement in the remuneration ofMinisters and Members of Parliament during the lifetime of the present Parliament.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for furtherconsideration to be given to the form and scope of apossible increase in the remuneration of Ministers and members of Parliament at a later date and to theappropriate timing of the announcement of theGovernments intentions in this respect.
The North ^ 3. The Cabinet considered the further development of the atlantic Governments policy in relation to the North Atlantic TreatyAlliance        Organisation.The Foreign Secretary said that in his recent statement to theNorth Atlantic Council he had merely repeated, in effect, theannouncements already made in Parliament about the NassauAgreement and the further development of our strategic policyflowing from it. But important political issues remained unresolved.In particular, it would have to be decided whether or not anew generation of strategic nuclear weapons should be placed at the disposal of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)to replace the bomber aircraft which were becoming obsolescent;and, if so, what system of control and command would be consistent with our objective of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weaponswhile maintaining the credibility of the deterrent.SECRET* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.Delay in completion of the pipeline should therefore benefit theUnited Kingdom balance of payments to the extent that it enabledour own oil interests to maintain their present position in Europeanmarkets.(b) On the other hand, the Federal German Government had prevented the manufacturers of large diameter pipe in western germany from entertaining Soviet orders. If, by allowing our ownmanufacturers to tender for such orders, we now appeared to seek to profit from the apparently greater loyalty of the Federal GermanGovernment to NATO decisions, our relations with that Governmentwould deteriorate; and if, thereafter, we failed to secure the orders in question, we should incur the maximum of odium for the minimum of advantage.(c) But the German ban on the fulfilment of existing orders hadbeen imposed in the face of considerable opposition in the Bundestag;and Parliament would be equally unlikely to acquiesce readily in theestablishment of the licensing system which would be needed toprevent orders placed in this country from being fulfilled, particularly since both the firms which might be involved were located in theNorth-East.(d) The embarrassment of the Federal German Government ifwe refused to impose a ban on exports of pipe from this country might be eased if the subject were first discussed in the Co-co-ordinating committee (COCOM) or in the North Atlantic Council. This wouldenable us to justify our attitude and to emphasise the differencebetween preventing the export of specifically strategic materials andimposing a general economic embargo.(e) There were some grounds for believing that orders for steelpipe might be placed in this country by United States interests in exhange for an undertaking that we would not accept orders fromthe Soviet bloc. But this would not contribute to retardingconstruction of the Soviet pipeline; it would involve compromisingour policy on East-West trade; and it would be liable to lead torenewed pressure for extension of the embargo to other goods.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, since no orders for pipe had yet been placed with United kingdom manufacturers, a final decision could be deferred. It might be convenient, meanwhile, to discuss with Mr. George Ball, the UnitedStates Under-Secretary of State, who would shortly be visiting thiscountry, the difficulties created for us by the desire of the UnitedStates Government to secure a general prohibition on the export ofsteel pipe to the Soviet bloc.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.
Our own approach to this problem had been influenced our decision to maintain our own independent deterrent, a decision whichwas clearly right so long as the prospect of effective disarmamentremained uncertain. During, and after, the Nassau conference wehad therefore interpreted the concept of a shared NATO nuclear force (which we agreed to be essential if the proliferation of nationalnuclear forces was to be prevented) in terms of a &quot; multi-national &quot;force, i.e., a force to which individual nations with a nuclearcapability would contribute without surrendering their ultimatesovereignty over the weapons in question. This concept had been endorsed by the NATO Council, apart from the french representative; and we should seek to develop it further, togetherwith the questions of the command and administration of such a force, at the CounciFs forthcoming meeting at Ottawa in May.The United States Government, however, were convinced that a multi-national force of this nature would not suffice to restrain the pressure for independent national nuclear forces. They had thereforeevolved the concept of a multilateral NATO nuclear force whichwould be genuinely international in the sense that all participating countries would subscribe contributions, in manpower and resources,which could not be withdrawn even in extreme national emergency.This alternative interpretation of the basic purpose of the NassauAgreement had attracted a significant degree of support at the recent meeting of the NATO Council; and the Governments of western germany and Italy appeared to be prepared to accept responsibilityfor the substantial subscriptions for which they would become liableunder this scheme. On the other hand, the project was clearly opento considerable objection on technical and administrative grounds;and it was doubtful whether the Governments concerned wouldwillingly accept the inferior status to which their nationals in such a force would necessarily be relegated if the United States Governmentwere to retain their control over the nuclear weapons with which theforce would be armed.The United States Government were still discussing their projectwith individual NATO Governments and were not yet in a positionto put forward firm proposals. But they would expect us to support their policy and to contribute to the force, possibly by means ofwarheads, specialised manpower, or even port and harbour facilities.Our contribution, although provisionally assessed at only 5-10 percent of the cost of the force, would be a substantial sum. Nevertheless,it was for consideration whether we should accept this additionalliability if it represented the price of preventing the proliferation ofnational nuclear forces and of securing for ourselves a place in a force from which we could not afford, politically, to be excluded.The Minister of Defence said that the financial implications ofthe United States policy were serious. The cost of the internationally-manned force might average approximately  225 million a year overa period of 10 years. Even at the lowest estimate, the contribution which we should be expected to make to that force would amountto about  100 million spread over the same period. But the UnitedStates Government were also proposing major increases in the conventional forces of NATO, in pursuance of their concept thatNATO should be capable of holding a Soviet conventional attackfor a considerable period without having recourse to nuclear weapons.This might involve an increase of a further  300-400 million in nato expenditure over the next three years. Finally, they were trying to persuade NATO to buy American medium-range ballisticmissiles in replacement of obsolescent bomber aircraft; here again,very large expenditure would be involved. In these circumstances weshould seek to avoid incurring any fresh commitment and should rely on the fact that, in accordance with the Nassau Agreement, our own
contribution to the NATO nuclear force would consist of the BritishPolaris submarines, to be obtained under that agreement. But, inview of the importance which the United States attached to theinternationally-manned force, it would be advisable to leave open the question of a British contribution to that force until the NassauAgreement had actually been signed.In discussion the following points were made:(a) In terms of the balance of power between the Soviet bloc and the West, the deterrent forces already in the possession of theUnited States were amply sufficient. The problem henceforward wasnot so much to deter the Soviet Union as to prevent the spread ofnational nuclear forces in Europe. In so far as the United Statesproject had this primarily political aim, it should suffice if theinternationally-manned force consisted of surface ships rather thansubmarines. Both the military capacity and the relative invulnerabilityof such a force might be limited; but a Soviet attack on it, or its usein a first strike, would suffice to bring the main United Statesdeterrent into action.(b) It was doubtful, however, whether the internationally-manned force would have the political advantages for which theUnited States Government hoped. In the first place, the warheadswould remain under United States control and would therefore besubject to veto. It would thus be clear to the participating countries that the force could not be used independently in defence of the alliance. Second, it was unlikely that the United States congress would enact the amendment of the MacMahon Act which would berequired to make Polaris submarines available for NATO use, while a deterrent force mounted on surface ships would be less attractive to the European countries concerned. Third, it was arguable that german participation in an internationally-manned force would not reduce, but might actually increase, the desire of the GermanGovernment to create their own national nuclear forces.(c) If, in spite of the evident difficulties, an internationally-manned NATO nuclear force were created, the United StatesGovernment would tend to make it the central focus of their NATOplanning. This would entail the risk that British nuclear forces mightbe excluded from this planning and that the United States wouldattach correspondingly less importance to their maintenance.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it wasnecessary to define, as a matter of historical fact, the extent of the commitment which we had accepted as the result of the NassauAgreement. First, we had agreed to assign forces from bomber command to NATO as part of what had now come to be called themulti-national forces. This undertaking had been carried out.Second, we had undertaken to make available British submarines,armed with Polaris missiles, for inclusion in a NATO multilateralnuclear force, on the understanding that at least equal United states forces would be similarly subscribed. The original intention of this undertaking had been clear; it had looked forward to a time when aNATO nuclear force would be created and had envisaged that that,force would consist of United States nuclear forces, British polaris submarines and a NATO element, which might, or might not, consistof the internationally-manned force which the United StatesGovernment were now seeking to create. But the Nassau Agreementdid not in any sense oblige us to contribute to such an internationally-manned force; and it was unfortunate that, since the discussions atNassau, the United States Government had interpreted the word&quot; multilateral &quot; as applying exclusively to an internationally-manned force. This had confused the issue and had tended to create theimpression that we had committed ourselves to contribute to it.The basic objective of our policy must be to prevent theFederal Government of Germany and other NATO countries fromacquiring their own national nuclear forces. It was perhaps doubtful
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,25th March, 1963.whether either the multi-national concept which we ourselvesfavoured or the internationally-manned force as proposed by theUnited States would be ultimately effective in achieving this aim.The main hope for the future lay in an attempt to conclude anagreement with the Soviet Government for the abandonment of nuclear tests and in the wider international arrangements, inhibitingthe spread of nuclear weapons, which might be expected to flow from such an agreement. He was maintaining close touch with president Kennedy on these matters.In the meantime, it would be important, particularly since theNassau Agreement had not yet been signed, to avoid discouragingthe United States in their attempt to win support for the concept ofan internationally-manned force, while at the same time avoiding any obligation to contribute to it. Any discussion in Parliament shouldbe dealt with on this basis.The Cabinet Invited the Lord Privy Seal to be guided by the points madein their discussion in considering the terms of the statement to be made in Parliament on the following day about thedevelopment of British policy in the North Atlantic treaty organisation as a result of the Nassau Agreement.
