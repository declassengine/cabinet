SubjectFederation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland
C,C. 24 (63)The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the request by the PrimeMinister of Southern Rhodesia, Mr. Winston Field, that SouthernRhodesia should be granted its independence as soon as northern rhodesia or Nyasaland had been allowed to secede from theFederation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland or had attained its ownindependence. The Cabinet had before them a further draft of a reply to this request.The First Secretary of State said that, in preparing this freshdraft, he had been guided by the considerations which had emerged from the Cabinets last discussion of the subject. It therefore rejectedboth the unrealistic concept that Southern Rhodesia might become fully independent of the United Kingdom while remaining a memberof the Federation and the alternative suggestion, advanced byMr. Field during the recent discussions, that the Colony might achieve a more limited form of independence by means of legislation designedto give statutory effect to the recognised convention by which theUnited Kingdom Government refrained from intervening in theinternal affairs of Southern Rhodesia. But it conceded the principleof independence for the Colony, subject to the prior dissolution ofthe Federation and to discussion, before independence was granted,of the financial, defence and constitutional issues which always arose in this context.It must remain the Governments purpose to secure the participation of both Southern and Northern Rhodesia in aconference, to be convened later in the year, to discuss futurerelationships between the two Territories. It was unfortunate,therefore, that Mr. Field had recently indicated that he would notbe prepared to participate in such a conference unless it had beenpreceded by a conference on independence for Southern Rhodesia.Nevertheless, he might be persuaded to accept a reversal of the orderof the two conferences if our reply demonstrated the logic of this approach and held out a clear prospect that the Colony would achievefull independence in the foreseeable future. Equally, the incentive tothe Government of Northern Rhodesia to attend the proposed conference on the future relationship between the Territories shouldbe preserved if the reply also made it clear that we did not contemplategranting independence to Southern Rhodesia without some further amendment of the Colony&apos;s Constitution on more liberal lines. Thecurrent draft of the reply sought, therefore, to give appropriate weight to both these considerations. But there could be no certainty that,ever! in its present form, it would make it possible for Mr. Field toattend the conference on future relationships; and, if the Governmentof Southern Rhodesia continued to insist that a conference onindependence for the Colony must have priority, a difficult situation would arise.In discussion the following points were made:(a) It would be important that the general tone of the reply should be such as to leave the way open for further exchanges, sincereflection might convince the Government of Southern Rhodesia ofthe importance of securing a continuing economic relationship with northern Rhodesia and of the serious difficulties in which anyunilateral attempt to declare their independence would be liable to involve them. The reply should therefore indicate the possibilities offurther discussion, of which Mr. Field might be disposed to takeadvantage.(b) The draft stated that preliminary discussions of financial,defence and constitutional issues should take place before independence was granted. It would be better to refer specifically tothe fact that, in accordance with normal precedent, the UnitedKingdom Government would expect in any case to convene aconference to discuss these and other matters, which always had to
be settled before the grant of independence to self-governingdependencies.(c) It would be preferable to deal with the suggestion that southern Rhodesia might attain a limited form of independence whilethe Federation still remained in being by referring to the Introductionto the White Paper on the Southern Rhodesian Constitution(Cmnd. 1399), where it was stated that it had become an establishedconvention for Parliament at Westminster not to legislate for SouthernRhodesia on matters within the competence of the LegislativeAssembly of Southern Rhodesia except with the agreement of theSouthern Rhodesian Government. The reply to Mr. Field shouldreaffirm our recognition of this convention but add that we did not see what further advance could be made in this respect pending the achievement of full independence by the Colony.Other amendments to the draft were agreed by the Cabinet inthe course of further discussion.The Cabinet (1) Invited the First Secretary of State to reply to the letter of29th March, 1963, from the Prime Minister of SouthernRhodesia on the lines agreed in their discussion.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State to seek the agreement ofthe Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia to thepublication, on 11th April, 1963, of the texts of both theletter and the reply.(3) Invited the Minister without Portfolio, in consultation withthe First Secretary of State, to consider the guidance tobe given to the Press on the publication of these exchanges.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,9th April, 1963.
