EuropeCommonMarketNegotiations(previous reference:C.C. (63) 7thConclusions)The Cabinet had before them telegrams iNos. Codel 90, 91, 97and 98 from Brussels, in which the Lord Privy Seal described thesituation which had developed since discussions were resumed in brussels on the previous day. While the situation was changinghourly, it seemed likely that later that day M. Couve de Murville, theFrench Foreign Minister, would put an effective end to thenegotiations by refusing to take further part in the Conference.The Lord Privy Seal suggested that, in this event, he should seek toagree with the other five members of the Community the terms of ajoint, statement which would make it clear that final agreement could have been reached if the French Government had been prepared tocontinue the negotiations in good faith; and that he should alsoexplore with them the possibility of promoting some new Europeaninitiative, preferably of a political or military nature and linked withthe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), which mightstrengthen our own position in Europe and serve as a counterpoiseto the ambitions of the French Government.The Prime Minister said that, if the French Delegation withdrewfrom the Conference, it would be clear that the responsibility for itsfailure would rest with the French Government; and a public statement by ourselves and the other five member countries,emphasising this fact, would be to our advantage. But, although itwould be important to maintain close relations with those countries,we should not commit ourselves, without further consideration, todiscussing with  them the possibility of some alternative form of association which might not easily be reconciled with our existing policies. It should suffice to indicate that we would consult them on the most appropriate methods of maintaining the co-operaticnbetween us.In discussion there was general agreement with these views. Itwas suggested, however, that it might be wiser to avoid, at this stage,any reference to consultation between ourselves and the five member countries. It would be preferable that we should seek theirendorsement to a joint statement which, while noting that the situationresulting from the failure of the negotiations threatened not only theeconomic unity of Western Europe but also, in the longer term, its political and military cohesion, would merely declare that theGovernments concerned would now consider the best methods ofmaintaining the close co-operation which existed between them andof promoting the objectives which they had in common.In further discussion the following points were raised:(a) The presentation to the general public of the situation arisingfrom the end of the negotiations should emphasise that there was no single or simple alternative to membership of the Community butthat the basic objectives of the Governments policies would remain unchanged, even though different methods might have to be adoptedin order to realise them.(b) President de Gaulle&apos;s ambition to impose French dominationon Europe to the exclusion of Anglo-Saxon influence might developrapidly and in a manner which would impose new strains on NATO.It would be necessary to give very careful consideration, inconsultation with our allies, to the course which we should adopt insuch circumstances.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the reports made by the Lord Privy Seal aboutthe likelihood of an imminent breakdown in thenegotiations for the admission of the United kingdom to the European Economic Community.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,29th January, 1963.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in the light of their discussion,to convey to the Lord Privy Seal in Brussels the terms ofa statement which, if the failure of the negotiations provedunavoidable, we should seek to persuade the member countries other than France to endorse.
