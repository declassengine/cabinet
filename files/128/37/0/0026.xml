\   176SECRET 3C.C. 26 (63)Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Report of theRadcliffeTribunal(previous reference:C.C. (62) 68thConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Cabinet had before them a Note by the Prime Minister(C. (63) 67), to which was appended a proof copy of a White Paper,to be published that day, containing the Report of the Tribunal of inquiry into the Vassal Case and Related Matters.The Prime Minister said that the Report, as originally submitted,included certain passages which, for reasons of security, had beeneither omitted or amended in the version prepared for publication.These changes, however, were few in number and did not affecteither the substance or the conclusions of the Report.In discussion it was agreed that the Report would probablyprovoke a considerable amount -of public discussion but that theGovernment should refrain from indicating their attitude to the issues which it raised until the forthcoming Parliamentary debate on security. It might become necessary to consider how far thejournalists who had been imprisoned for refusing to disclose theirsources of information to the Tribunal should be granted any facilities for expressing their views on the TribunaPs Report.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of C. (63) 67.ForeignAffairsLaos(previous reference:C.C. (63) 25thConclusions,Minute 1)3. The Foreign Secretary said that, although we had some hopeof securing Soviet co-operation in establishing the international control Commission in the Plain of Jars, there seemed little prospect that the Soviet Government would agree that the Commission^authority should be extended over the whole of Laos. The Genevaagreement was now in jeopardy; and a partition of the country might become unavoidable. In that event the northern area would probablyfall under Sino-Soviet influence; and the United States might feel obliged to intervene in the south and to take additional measuresto support Thailand. It might become necessary to consider howfar we ourselves should support action of this kind.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Foreign Secretary.United arab republic(previous reference:C.C. (63) 25thConclusions,Minute 2)The Foreign Secretary said that the implications of the recentunion of Egypt, Syria and Iraq in a Federal State were not yet clear.The effect on Jordan might be serious, particularly if a newmovement developed to overthrow the existing regime and theGovernment of Israel felt obliged, as a result, to intervene.It would be necessary to keep the position of the Iraq petroleum company under close review and possibly to reconsider the projectedsale of arms to Iraq in response to the recent request by the iraqi government. A decision on the latter issue should in any event be deferred until we had ascertained the reactions of the Governmentof Iran, who would probably oppose any measures likely tostrengthen the new Federal State.In discussion it was suggested that we should not be undulyinfluenced by Iranian susceptibilities. Provided that we could obtainsatisfactory assurances from the Iraqi Government that they had no
Military Aid 4.   The Commonwealth Secretary said that the United states to India Government appeared to be divided on the desirability of providing additional military aid to the Government of India as an insurance against renewed aggression by Communist China. It would bedesirable to keep some prospect of additional aid before the indian government in order to encourage them to reach agreement withthe Government of Pakistan on Kashmir; but this should stop short of the proposal, which had some support in the United states administration, for the provision of combat squadrons of aircraft to defend Indian cities against air attack.In discussion it was generally agreed that a clear distinction should be maintained between the supply of military equipment and advice to the Indian Government and active participation by british forces in the defence of India. The latter could involve the UnitedKingdom in war with Communist China; and no commitment inthis respect should be undertaken, or discussed with the Governmentof India, without full consideration by the Cabinet. If the indian government wished to engage other countries in the defence ofIndia, they should be prepared to become members of theappropriate regional organisation for collective security and to acceptthe obligations which membership would entail.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, pending further consideration of the issues involved, United Kingdom military aid to India shouldnot extend to active participation by United kingdom forces in the defence of Indian cities against air attack.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary and the commonwealth secretary to represent to the United States Governmentthe objections to such participation.(3) Invited the Minister of Defence to reconsider, in the lightof Conclusion (1) above, a proposal that a squadron ofJavelin aircraft should take part in an air defence exercisein India.United King-dom fishery limits(previous reference:C.C. (63) 25thConclusions,Minute 4)5. The Lord Privy Seal informed the Cabinet that the newPrime Minister of Canada, Mr. Pearson, had asked us to defer actionto give effect to the Cabinet&apos;s recent decision to extend UnitedKingdom fishery limits until he had had an opportunity to discussthe issues involved during his visit to the United Kingdom in thefollowing week. If we acceded to this request, we should give thecountries concerned very little time in which to consider their position before 15th May, when our formal notice of termination ofthe Treaties involved must be given.In discussion it was suggested that, since Mr. Pearson was probably concerned to ensure that discussion of future fishery limitsshould be the subject of an international conference, he might be content with an assurance that the immediate effect of our proposedaggressive designs against Kuwait, it would be in our interest toadopt a reasonably helpful attitude towards their request, despite their endorsement of the Federal State.The Cabinet (2) Agreed to defer a decision on the recent request by theGovernment of Iraq for supplies of arms.(3) Agreed that, without prejudice to Conclusion (2) above, thenormal supply to Iraq of spare parts and maintenanceitems for military equipment should continue.
6. The Cabinet had before them two reports by officials(C. (63) 65 and 68) on future agricultural policy.The Minister of Agriculture said that the developed countries of the West were faced by increasing difficulties as a result ofagricultural over-production. In North America deliberate and costly action had been taken to reduce the areas under cultivation.In Europe surpluses of certain products were accumulating and prices were tending to fall. Countries such as Australia, whoseeconomies were largely dependent on agricultural exports, were becoming increasingly concerned by the effects of over-production on world prices for their products. In the case of the United Kingdomthe effects had shown themselves mainly in the large and continuingrise in the cost of Exchequer support for our own farmers. It had also been necessary to introduce ad hoc controls on imports in orderto avoid disruption of the market for certain commodities.In the light of these developments there was a growing body of support for the view that for major commodities particularlycereals and meat an attempt should be made to reach international agreements on the control of world markets. Such agreements wouldprovide producers in all countries with a firm, though limited, outlet for their produce at guaranteed prices; and they would make it possible to dispose of surplus production to good effect in under-developed countries. Hitherto, the United Kingdom had notfavoured arrangements of this kind; but the time had perhaps come when in our own interests it would be necessary to support them.The justification for such a change of policy would lie in thefact that it was becoming increasingly urgent to bring to an end thepresent arrangements under which no limit could be set to the costto the Exchequer of support for United Kingdom farmers. some means would have to be found to limit the volume of home production; and it would be necessary at the same time to introducecontrols over imports. Control over home production could besecured in a variety of ways, the details of which remained fordiscussion; but in principle the aim would be to limit support to a defined total quantity of the commodity in question. The supportprice would be fixed at a level which would encourage the efficientproducer; and production in excess of the defined figure would not qualify for subsidy. Cereal imports should preferably be controlled by the imposition of a minimum import price. This price would befixed at a level which would prevent dumping; and exporting countries offering wheat at prices below the minimum would berequired to pay a levy on the difference in order to bring their imports up to the minimum price. For meat it would be necessaryto impose quantitative restrictions and to allot a specified quota tothe main exporting countries. This might tend to freeze the pattern of trade; but it should be possible to mitigate this effect by maintaining a degree of flexibility in the arrangements.action would merely be to free our hands for further consultationwithout necessarily prejudicing the possibility of making new arrangements in the interval of twelve months before the notice of termination took effect.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that preparatory action to give effect to their earlier decision to extend United Kingdom fishery limits should proceed as originally proposed.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to reply to the message from thePrime Minister of Canada on the lines indicated in their discussion.
A system on these lines, involving control over both the level ofhome production and the level of imports, would be consistent with world commodity agreements of the type now envisaged. It might beto our advantage, therefore, to take the lead in the forthcoming discussions in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade at whichthis subject would be raised. Indeed, it was possible that, in returnfor an undertaking on our part to limit our domestic production an undertaking which would represent a radical departure fromearlier policy and would be welcome to exporting countries we might secure more advantageous terms for our industrial exports.It had been suggested that, as part of the arrangements to limit the cost of support to the Exchequer, a levy should be imposed, bothon imports and on home production, at a level sufficient to cover,in whole or in part, the Exchequer subsidy for the productsconcerned. This would result in some increase in price to theconsumer. But it would not be substantial. A levy of  2 a ton oncereals would produce a total of  40 million a year as a contributionto the cost of the subsidy; it would also raise the price of bread bya halfpenny. A variation of the same concept would be to introduce a variable levy, which would apply to imported cereals only.These proposals represented the most that could be done at thepresent stage to limit the cost to the Exchequer of agricultural support. They would be unpopular with the farming community,who had been encouraged to believe that increased production wasa desirable aim in its own right and would therefore react strongly against the suggestion that production should now be limited. Anyattempt to limit home production without at the same timecontrolling imports would therefore be unacceptable to the farmers.It would also be necessary to hold out some prospect of future growth in the agricultural industry. The incomes of individuallarge-scale farmers might be expected to grow as smaller farmers were gradually eliminated; but farming incomes as a whole would tend to fall. It would therefore be important in any international legislation to establish a claim for our own producers not only foran agreed share of the world market but also for the opportunityto participate in any arrangements which might be devised for thesupply of surplus agricultural produce to under-developed countries.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The level of agricultural support in the United kingdom was already higher than in any other Western country. Moreover,Government investment in agriculture exceeded Governmentinvestment in industry. The present system tended to encourageproduction regardless of efficiency; and farming showed anunacceptably low return on the capital invested. It would thereforebe necessary not only to limit the volume of home production butto introduce measures designed to concentrate production in thehands of the more efficient producers. More drastic steps might need to be taken to eliminate smaller holdings by the encouragement ofamalgamations and retirements.(b) While it might be undesirable in principle to regulateimports, since this would be liable both to increase costs and prices and possibly to impose additional strain on our balance of payments,some action of this kind was probably necessary for political reasons.Steps would have to be taken in any event to deal with extreme casesof dumping or excessive imports, which would be liable to disruptthe market. Nor would control of imports be entirely against theinterests of the Exchequer; to the extent that imports reduced market prices to artificially low levels, the cost of support to the home producer was unnecessarily increased.(c) The method by which imports might be controlled would need further examination. A quota system might be the mostobjectionable, since it would tend to increase prices and to distort
Reform of 7.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ChiefExchequer Secretary to the Treasury (C. (63) 66), to which was appended aAccounts        draft White Paper on the Reform of the Exchequer Accounts.The Chief Secretary said that the White Paper described theantiquated structure imposed by existing legislation on theExchequer accounts, including the artificial distinction betweenexpenditure above and below the line, and suggested that thereshould be one unified Budget Account, showing all the basicC.C. 26 (63)the multilateral pattern of trade. A system of tariffs might be moredefensible; but it would not be easily negotiated. A minimum pricesystem on the lines proposed would have certain advantages; but thecost to the domestic consumer and the effect on the balance ofpayments would need further study. To tax imports by means of avariable levy was an alternative possibility, which should also be examined in greater detail.(d) A levy subsidy arrangement for cereals, covering both home production and imports, would produce a welcome relief to theExchequer and would not necessarily have a serious effect on thecost of living. The cost of bread was of relatively small significancein the context of the retail price index; and the price increase whicha levy subsidy would involve was no greater than the increases whichwould occur in any case from time to time as a result of increased costs of production and distribution.(e) The presentation of any proposals of the kind underconsideration would require careful study. The farming community would find it hard to understand why the argument, so oftenadvanced in the past, that increased production relieved the balanceof payments had apparently lost its validity. Nor would they easily be brought to accept a policy under which agriculture would seem tobe deprived of the opportunity for further growth at a time whenthe economy as a whole was being encouraged to expand more rapidly. The argument that opportunities for growth would be opento the more efficient producers would be of small comfort to thosewho would be in danger of losing their livelihood. These difficultiesof presentation would be intensified to an unacceptable degree if anyattempt were to be made to limit the volume of home productionwithout at the same time controlling imports.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that the cabinet&apos;s discussion had revealed a wide measure of agreement onthe general objectives to be pursued, particularly the need to imposesome limit on the rising cost to the Exchequer of the present systemwithout at the same time exposing our farmers to unfair competition from subsidised imports. The discussion had also revealed thepolitical difficulty of persuading the farming community to accept soradical a departure from current policy as being not only essential for economic reasons but also in their own ultimate interest. It wouldbe necessary to reach early decisions on these matters in view offorthcoming international discussions, including those with other commonwealth countries.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for theMinisters concerned to give further consideration, in thelight of their discussion, to the changes in agricultural policy which it would now be desirable to introduce.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at an early meeting.
autonomous transactions of the Central Government. This wouldbe supplemented both by a Financing Account, showing how the deficit on the main Budget Account was financed by the NationalDebt and other monetary transactions, and by tables designed to reflect the impact of the Central Governments activities on the restof the economy. It was desirable that the White Paper should bepublished before the Second Reading of the Finance Bill.The Cabinet-Approved the publication of the White Paper on the reform of the Exchequer Accounts, appended to C. (63) 66.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,25th April, 1963.
