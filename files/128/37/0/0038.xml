SubjectResignation of the Secretary of State for War
resignation of theSecretaryof Statefor War(previous reference:C.C. (63) 37thConclusions,Minute 2)* The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the possibleimplications of the association between the former Secretaryof State for War, Mr. Profumo, Mr. Stephen Ward and miss Christine Keeler, on the basis of a Note by the Prime Minister(C. (63) 99), to which was appended a report by the Lord chancellor on this subject.The Prime Minister said that, in the light of the Cabinetsearlier discussion, it was now accepted that the Ministers who hadbeen particularly concerned with Mr. Profumo&apos;s personal statement on 22nd March had acted in good faith throughout and that, onthis issue, the integrity of the Government could be defended. If itwere suggested, however, that those Ministers had made an errorof judgment in accepting the veracity of Mr. Profumo&apos;s statement,it was necessary to ask whether, in the circumstances at the time,they had any real grounds for refusing to endorse a version of the events in question to which Mr. Profumo had consistently adhered.The fact that two members of the Cabinet, the Chief Whip and bothLaw Officers of the Crown had felt able to accept Mr. Profumo&apos;sstatement as a true and honest record of his relationship withMiss Keeler should suffice to convince any reasonable individualthat it was not lack of experienced judgment on the relevant day that had contributed to the unfortunate sequel.The Solicitor-General endorsed the Prime Minister&apos;s remarks.Together with the Attorney-General and Mr. Profumo&apos;s ownsolicitor, who was a member of a legal firm of the highest reputeand integrity, he had helped Mr. Profumo to draft the personalstatement and had then read it to the Leader of the House, theMinister without Portfolio, the Chief Whip and Mr. Profumohimself. Throughout the discussion Mr. Profumo had maintained that the association had amounted to no more than a socialfriendship; and his statement had carried complete conviction toajl those present. There could be no question that it had beenaccepted by all the Ministers concerned in complete good faith.The Prime Minister said that, even though it should now bepossible to convince the House of Commons that the Governmenthad throughout dealt honestly and straightforwardly with the moralaspects of the situation, the disclosure of Mr. Profumo&apos;s association with Miss Keeler, coupled with Mr. Ward&apos;s subsequent arrest andthe publication of articles by Miss Keeler in the Press, had prompteda fresh series of rumours about the conduct of individual ministers and Members of Parliament, some of which were related to thepresent case while others appeared to have originated elsewhere.Deplorable speculation about individuals prominent in public affairs was now rife; and, in so far as any allegation reflecting on theconduct of members of the Government or of the government&apos;s supporters in the House of Commons reached him, he would thinkit right to inform the individuals concerned and to give them theopportunity of rebutting the allegations. Distasteful though this procedure would be, it would be essential if the good name of theGovernment was to be preserved.Discussion then turned to the security aspects of the relationship between Mr. Profumo and Miss Keeler. It was agreed that furtherconsideration must be given to the implications of the statement,made on 30th January, 1963, by Miss Keeler, to the effect that onlya few weeks previously she had been asked by Mr. Ward to try toobtain secret information from Mr. Profumo. This implied not only that Mr. Profumo might have maintained his association with..* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET3575-2 a 2C.C. 38 (63)
Miss Keeler for a considerable time after August 1961, when hehad alleged that he had brought it to an end, but also that thesecurity risk implicit in that association might have been more substantial than had hitherto been supposed. This report, however,had come to the knowledge of the Government only during thecourse of the Lord Chancellors enquiry. Moreover, there were grounds for believing that, in an article to be published in the Presswithin the next few days, Miss Keeler would allege that she hadbeen asked by Mr. Ward as early as 1961 to try to obtain secret information from Mr. Profumo but had refused to do so. Whetheror not this allegation referred to the same occasion as Miss Keeler&apos;sstatement of 30th January, 1963, it might provide grounds forarguing that the Security Service should have realised the potentialsecurity risk in 1961 but that, so far from doing so then, they had notinformed the Prime Minister even when this risk was apparentlyconfirmed by Miss Keeler&apos;s statement on 30th January, 1963. Itmight also be alleged in the light of that statement that, beforeendorsing Mr. Profumo&apos;s personal statement of 22nd March, 1963,the Ministers concerned should have verified from the security service that there was no security risk in the association withMiss Keeler which Mr. Profumo had by then admitted.On the other hand the Security Service had not been aware in1961 of any relationship between Mr. Profumo and Miss Keeler,while, when they were consulted on behalf of the Prime Minister on1st February, 1963, about the rumours of this relationship whichwere then beginning to gain currency, they had not regarded them as involving any significant security risk and had confined themselvesto reporting to the Prime Minister on 4th February that Mr. Profumohad privately admitted to them an innocent friendship withMiss Keeler. At, or shortly after, that time, however, they shouldhave been aware of Miss Keeler&apos;s statement on 30th January, 1963;and they might have been expected to bring it to the Prime Ministersattention at once. But this statement had been obtained onlyincidentally by the police, in the course of enquiries which they were carrying out for other purposes; and, in any event, the security service might have dismissed it as of no importance on the groundthat the Soviet Assistant Naval Attache, Captain Ivanov, had left theUnited Kingdom on 29th January, 1963, and, with his departure,Mr. Ward might be deemed to have ceased to be a security risk.Nevertheless, although the Government themselves had acted withoutdelay in consulting the Security Service as soon as they becameaware of the first rumours linking Mr. Profumo&apos;s name with that of miss Keeler, it was not equally clear that the Security Service had shown the same promptitude in informing the Government of subsequent developments which might be thought to have somebearing on the security aspects of the case. It might be desirable toexamine in more detail the action which they had taken at successivestages of the episode.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that hehad been deeply concerned and distressed by the facts which hadbeen revealed by the Lord Chancellors enquiry. He felt that, as aresult of a lengthy discussion of the implications of the LordChancellor^ report, the Cabinet were now satisfied that neither theGovernments honesty nor their judgment could fairly be challenged.But it would be necessary to demonstrate, during the forthcoming debate in Parliament, that, whether or not the Government hadbeen at fault in trusting one of their number, they had beenprofoundly shocked by a course of conduct which departed somarkedly from the highest traditions of public life in this countryand were determined to re-establish those traditions as rapidly aspossible. He would now send a copy of the Lord Chancellor^ reportto the Leader of the Opposition and would thereafter offer, ifnecessary, to establish some formal enquiry into the securityimplications of the circumstances of Mr. Profumo&apos;s resignation, on

(63) 27th Conclusions,Minute 1), as a result of the Radcliffe Report on the Vassall case.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the report by the Lord Chancellor (C. (63) 99)on the circumstances in which the former Secretary ofState for War, Mr. Profumo, had resigned his office.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would:(i) communicate a copy of the report to the Leader ofthe Opposition;(ii) offer, at an appropriate moment, to discuss the report with a small number of selected Privy Councillorsand, if necessary, to establish a formal enquiry into the security implications of the circumstancesof Mr. Profumo&apos;s resignation.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation with theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the Chief Whipand other Ministers concerned, would give furtherconsideration to the arrangements to be made for theforthcoming debate on security in the House of commons and would provide, in particular, for the Governmenfsactions in relation to the personal statement byMr. Profumo on 22nd March, 1963, to be authoritativelydefended.(4) Took note that the Prime Minister would consider whether any further enquiry would be desirable in order toestablish whether the Security Service had takenreasonably prompt action in relation to the possiblesecurity implications of such information as they had acquired about the relationship between Mr. Profumoand Miss Keeler.
