(63) 34thConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that the factthat the Government of Iraq had found it necessary to imprison anumber of supporters of President Nasser and to execute certainadherents of the previous President of Iraq, General Kassem, tended to show that they had not yet established themselves firmly in power.Their position might be further weakened if a breakdown of thecurrent negotiations with the Kurdish minority were to lead to furtherhostilities. On the other hand, our recent agreement to supply Iraqwith military equipment had been warmly welcomed by theGovernment of Iraq and would increase our influence in Iraqi affairs.The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that, during theConference of African Heads of State which had taken place at addis ababa in the previous week, the President of Ghana, Dr. Nkrumah,and the Prime Minister of Uganda, Mr. Obote, had expressedmarkedly anti-Western views, particularly on the question of theindependence of Southern Rhodesia. On the other hand, the resolution on this subject which the Conference had finally adopted had been more moderate than had at first seemed likely; in effect, it was confined to urging the United Kingdom Government not to grant independence to the Colony under a Constitution which would leavethe government in the hands of a minority of the inhabitants.The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that the UnitedStates Government had now sent two envoys to Tokyo to discuss with the President of Indonesia, President Sukarno, the regulationrecently issued by the Indonesian Government expropriating UnitedStates and United Kingdom oil interests in Indonesia. They appearedto believe that President Sukarno could be persuaded to agree to arrangements which would allow the oil companies to continue their operations; and there was some risk that they might be disposed toaccept a settlement whereby 60 per cent of the realised prices of theoutput of oil would accrue to the Indonesian Government and only40 per cent to the oil companies. There was also reason to believethat the Indonesian Government would seek to conclude a separate agreement with the United States Government, which would leave them free thereafter to proceed with the expropriation of the UnitedKingdom interests. The United States Government had therefore beenasked to ensure that we should be represented at any discussions withthe Indonesian authorities.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements by the Minister of Statefor Foreign Affairs.Expenses ofMembers ofParliament(previous reference:C.C. (61) 5thConclusions,Minute 7)3. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that, ifdiscussions now in progress with the Opposition resulted in agreement,it was proposed to table a Resolution providing for the payment ofthe railway fares of wives of Members of the House of Commons ona limited number of journeys between a Member&apos;s home, his constituency, and London.In discussion it was suggested that, if the proposed concessionincluded journeys between a Member&apos;s home and London, it shouldParliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
also be extended to the wives of Peers, who were compelled by the increasing weight of business in the House of Lords to live away from home for considerable periods. On the other hand, free travel betweenhome and London was not part of the concession as originallyconceived; and the proposals might be less open to criticism if theywere confined to travel to and from a Member&apos;s constituency. If,however, it were desired to limit the concession in this way, it wouldbe necessary to consult the Opposition further.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for furtherconsideration to be given to the scope of any arrangementproviding for the payment of the railway fares of wives ofMembers of Parliament.Military aid to India(previous reference :C.C. (63) 31stConclusions)4. ihe Cabinet had before them memoranda by theCommonwealth Secretary (C. (63) 92 and 94) about the provisionof further military aid to India, together with copies of messages onthis subject which the Prime Minister had exchanged with thePresident of the United States, President Kennedy, and with theForeign Secretary and the Minister of Defence.The Commonwealth Secretary said that President Kennedy now appeared to appreciate more clearly the political dangers involvedin his earlier proposal that United Kingdom and United Statessquadrons of fighter aircraft should participate in the air defenceof Indian cities; and he had now suggested that these squadronsshould merely be deployed in India for training purposes. He had indicated, however, that, in default of United Kingdom support forthis revised concept, the United States Government might feel obligedto proceed independently with an arrangement on these lines. Itwould be undesirable to encourage the impression that the UnitedStates Government were more concerned to assist the Governmentof India than we were ourselves; and it would therefore be appropriate that we should acquiesce in their new plan, provided that its purpose was described as joint training and that it was clearly understood bythe Government of India to imply no commitment by the Governmentsof the United States and the United Kingdom to participate activelyin the defence of India in the event of further Chinese aggression.On this basis, acceptance by the Indian Government of joint trainingarrangements with United Kingdom and United States squadronswould represent as significant a departure from their previous policyof strict non-alignment as we could expect at this stage.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The current intentions of the United States Governmentwere not wholly clear. Their revised plan was still described as an&quot; air defence offer &quot;; and they continued to emphasise its importance as a deterrent to the Government of China. These indications suggestedthat they would still be disposed to entertain some greater degree ofcommitment to participate in the defence of India than we should regard as acceptable.(b) Moreover, it would not be easy to convince informed publicopinion that the purpose of the proposed visits to India by fighter squadrons from the United States and the United Kingdom was confined to joint training with the Indian Air Force, because the visiting squadrons would be night fighters whereas the Indian AirForce were equipped with day fighters only.
1 o3 0(c) On the other hand, the United States Government had alreadymoved some way from their original proposals in deference to ourobjections; and their present plan could be reasonably defended onthe ground that it would enlarge the experience of the Indian AirForce, regardless of the type of aircraft with which the visitingsquadrons were equipped.(d) The proposal would admittedly be a further disincentive tothe Government of India to seek to concert with the Government of pakistan plans for the defence of the Indian sub-continent as a whole.But the Government of Pakistan would undoubtedly prefer it to any arrangement which would put additional aircraft at the disposal ofthe Indian Air Force.(e) As regards other types of military aid to the Government ofIndia, it would be right in principle to offer further assistance in theform of equipment and training facilities, provided that the amount involved did not exceed about  10 million and that we were not regarded as obliged to match any additional contribution of this nature which the United States Government might make. India had so far provided our largest market for arms exports; and it would bedesirable that we should retain a due share of that market. But weshould stipulate that the Indian Government should not regard themselves as enabled, by the receipt of further military aid fromthe United States and the United Kingdom, to devote more of theiravailable resources to the purchase of equipment from other countries.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of advantage appeared to lie in endorsing the proposal ofthe United States Government that United Kingdom and UnitedStates squadrons of fighter aircraft should pay periodical visits toIndia for joint training exercises with the Indian Air Force. But weshould continue to make it clear that we should regard such anarrangement as not committing us in any way to participating in the active defence of India; and we should seek to persuade the UnitedStates Government that, in promoting this proposal, they shouldattach the same reservation to it. Subject to this essential proviso,there would be some advantage in refraining from describing thepurpose of the arrangements too explicitly; their real significancewould be sufficiently apparent to the Chinese Government.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, that the Prime Minister would arrange for the United States Government to be informed,on the lines indicated in their discussion, that the UnitedKingdom Government would be prepared to supportproposals for periodical visits by squadrons of UnitedKingdom and United States fighter aircraft to India for joint training exercises with the Indian Air Force.(2) Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultationwith the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to discuss with theIndian Government the provision of further military aid to India to an amount not exceeding  10 million.Federation oi 5.   The First Secretary of State informed the Cabinet that, duringRhodesia and the initial stages of his current discussions with the Prime Minister of nyasaland Southern Rhodesia, Mr. Field, about the terms on which Southern(Previous Rhodesia might achieve independence, he had made it clear that reference: some measure of constitutional advance in the Colony would beC.C. (63) 33rd essential if the grant of independence was to be acceptable not onlyConclusions) to the United Kingdom Parliament, whose authority would berequired for this step, but also to the other member countries of the
Commonwealth. Mr. Field had indicated that he would be preparedto advise his Cabinet to accept some widening of the A Roll franchiseand possibly to acquiesce in some declaration of intention as regardsthe future operation of the Constitutional Council and the progressiveliberalisation of the Land Apportionment Act. Although there couldbe no certainty that the Government of Southern Rhodesia would infact endorse action on these lines, it was clear that Mr. Field himselfwished to co-operate with us as far as possible in seeking to achieve the independence of Southern Rhodesia by agreement and that hewould not be disposed to try to assert it by a unilateral act. But he continued to maintain that he would not be prepared to attend the projected conference on the dissolution of the Federation of rhodesia and Nyasaland unless we had first declared unequivocally our willingness to grant independence to the Colony.In discussion it was agreed that it might soon become necessaryto define the terms on which the Government would be prepared tointroduce legislation for the independence of Southern Rhodesia.On the other hand, it would be unwise to disclose prematurely toMr. Field conditions which we might well need to persuade the othermembers of the Commonwealth to accept; and we should therefore continue to explore with him, without commitment, the various possibilities of constitutional reform in the hope that we might stillsucceed in persuading him to attend the conference on the dissolution of the Federation and that the development of the situation thereaftermight result in the emergence of a settlement about the independence of Southern Rhodesia in which all the parties concerned wouldacquiesce, however reluctantly.The Cabinet Invited the First Secretary of State to keep them informed of the progress of his further discussions with the PrimeMinister of Southern Rhodesia about the grant of independence to the Colony.Legislative 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theProgramme Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (C. (63) 89) about the legislative1963-64 programme for the 1963-64 Session of Parliament.(previous reference: The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that, in preparingC.C. (62) 52nd the main programme indicated in Category B of the Annex to conclusions, C. (63) 89, the Future Legislation Committee had sought to selectMinute 4)        Bills relevant to the theme of modernisation. These major Bills shouldbe ready early in the new Session; and their preparation should begiven priority.The programme did not include a Bill to implement such of therecommendations of the Committee on Higher Education as theGovernment might approve, since the Committee were unlikely toreport until later in the summer and it might prove impossible toprepare legislation in time for the next Session. But, if a Bill could beready in time, it would be a valuable addition to the programme.In discussion the following points were made:(a) It might become essential to introduce a measure on central africa in the current Session. A separate Bill for Southern Rhodesiawas likely to be required in the next Session.(b) A Bill on grants to local authorities might have to be addedto the main programme as a matter of urgency.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,28th May, 1963.(1) Approved in principle the legislative programme for 1963-64as indicated in C. (63) 89.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, inconsultation with the Ministers concerned, to keep theprogramme under regular review and to arrange for thepreparation of the Bills in question to be put in hand as rapidly as possible.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation with theLord President, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,the Chief Secretary, Treasury, the Secretary of State forScotland, and the Minister of Education, would give further consideration to the possibility of including inthe programme a Bill to implement such of therecommendations of the Committee on Higher Educationas the Government might approve.
