House ofLords ReformPeerage Bill(previous reference:C.C. (63) 29thConclusions,Minute 9)1. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster informed theCabinet that an amendment might be tabled by the Opposition duringthe Committee Stage of the Peerage Bill in order to ensure that theBill would take effect on receiving the Royal Assent rather than, as atpresent intended, on the dissolution of Parliament. It would be undesirable to allow the composition of a Parliament to be modifiedduring its lifetime. Moreover, the Government would be liable to be exposed to embarrassment in relation to the disputed constituency ofBristol South-East. On the other hand some of the Governments own supporters in the House of Commons might be disposed to sympathise with the spirit of the amendment; and the Government would need to handle the issue with circumspection.In discussion there was general agreement that it wasobjectionable in principle to amend the composition of a Parliamentuntil a dissolution enabled the electorate to exercise their right of choice among the candidates entitled to stand for election. Therewould also be liable to be objection by the House of Lords to the alteration in the character of the House during the lifetime of a parliament which would be implied by the admission of the ScottishPeers and of the Peeresses.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, inconsultation with the Chief Whip, to ascertain the probablereaction in both Houses of Parliament if the government accepted an amendment to the Peerage Bill, designed toensure that it should come into effect on receiving theRoyal Assent rather than on the dissolution of the present parliament.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.NorthAtlanticTreatyOrganisationNuclear Force:Mixed-MannedComponent(previous reference:C.C. (63) 36thConclusions,Minute 1)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister ofDefence (C. (63) 103) on the United States proposal to establish a mixed-manned fleet of surface vessels as part of the nuclear forces ofthe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO).The Minister of Defence said that the military aspects of theproposal could be summarised as follows:(1) It would not be impossible to create such a force, in the sense that, despite a number of legal difficulties about the flag under whichit would sail, the political authority to which it would be subordinatedand the code of discipline by which it would be administered, it shouldbe feasible to man and operate the ships involved. The United StatesGovernment themselves recognised that the effectiveness of a fleet of surface ships would be less than that of a fleet of submarines; butthe use of submarines was excluded both by the greater technical problems which mixed-manning would involve in their case and by thefact that the United States Congress would probably object to nationals of other countries being granted access to the mechanismof a Polaris submarine.(2) The probable reaction of the Soviet Government to a mixed-manned force of surface ships had perhaps been underratedby the United States Government. But, even on the assumption thatthey would seek to reduce the effectiveness of the force by all possible means, we could not dispute the assessment of the United states authorities that it would still retain some degree of second-strikecapability.3521-2a 2
270(3) In our view, however, there was no strategic requirement fora force of the kind proposed. The United States Government would presumably retain a veto over the use of the nuclear weapons at its disposal. They would therefore be unlikely to permit the use of thoseweapons except in circumstances in which they were prepared to use their own independent deterrent forces. But these were alreadyof overwhelming strength; and the weapons available to the mixed-manned force would represent only a negligible reinforcement.(4) No precise estimate of the cost of the force was yet available.But it could hardly be less than  400hE500 million. For the reasonsindicated above expenditure of this order would have no militaryjustification; but it would make it more difficult for the member countries of NATO to afford the increase in the size and effectiveness of NATO conventional forces, which were of greater military importance.In discussion of the military aspects of the proposed force thefollowing points were made:(a) At the recent meeting of senior military representatives of nato no support had been expressed for the concept, even by therepresentatives of the Federal German Government. It had also been clear that the military plans of the United States Government were still based on the concept of protracted hostilities, involving the useof nuclear weapons. The review of NATO strategy now being undertaken might, however, convert them to the more rational viewthat, once hostilities involving nuclear weapons had begun, the war would come to a very rapid end. On this assumption the size of the nuclear forces required to support NATO would be considerably lessthan was implied by the strategy now favoured by the United States:and the military case for the mixed-manned force would be correspondingly reduced.(b) A force of 25 ships would require about 10,000 officers andmen, of whom the United Kingdom might be expected to contributeabout 1,000. In view of the difficulty which the Royal Navy were already experiencing in recruiting the extra 2,500 men required fortheir own establishment and in the light of the high degree of skill and experience which would be required of those selected to serve in a mixed-manned force, the United Kingdom manpower for such a force could only be made available by laying off 15 frigates, a substantial proportion of the present frigate force.(c) It was proposed that the mixed-manned force should operatefrom two bases, one in the Mediterranean and one giving access to the atlantic and the North Sea. The latter could be provided by anextension of the facilities in Scotland now being prepared for theBritish Polaris fleet.(d) At any time of tension the mixed-manned force would haveto be provided with escorts. This would involve a heavy diversion of nato&apos;s naval resources from tasks of higher priority.(e) The mixed-manned force would not, in itself, be a NATOforce. It would be a force created and controlled by the countriessubscribing to it. These countries would offer the force to NATO in which the same way as individual countries now subscribed their national contingents. The use of the force, once it had been assigned to NATO, would be initially a matter for NATO decision throughthe appropriate machinery. But the United States Government would retain a technical veto on the physical discharge of the weapons atthe disposal of the force; and this fact, while reducing the danger thatthe force might come under effective German control, would alsoreduce its value to Europe. It could not be held that a force, socontrolled, would assuage European doubts that in an emergency theUnited States Government might be unwilling to permit nuclear weapons to be used.(/) If the mixed-man force were abandoned, we should probablyface renewed pressure for the equipment of NATO with medium-range
ballistic missiles in replacement of aircraft which were becomingobsolescent. There were obvious objections to any arrangement whichwould site weapons of this kind on German territory. On the otherhand it should not be assumed in advance of the current review of nato strategy that such replacements would be provided or thatthey would take any particular form.Discussion then turned to the political aspects of the proposedforce.The Minister of Defence said that the United States government appeared to recognise, although to a lesser extent than ourselves, themilitary shortcomings of the mixed-manned force. They acknowledgedthat its primary purpose was political, i.e., to contain within aninternational framework the growing German pressure for a greatershare in NATO&apos;s nuclear capability. It must be doubtful, however,whether the force would achieve this objective. It might serve merely to excite the latent ambitions of the German people by giving them the opportunity to acquire a familiarity with nuclear weapons systemswhich they could not otherwise obtain. The German military authoritiesand some German politicians made little secret of their intention towork to this end and were looking forward to the time when theUnited States Government might be prepared to renounce their vetoover the use of the weapons at the disposal of the force. For these reasons it might be politically dangerous to commit ourselves to participation in the force; and it would be wiser to seek to help theUnited States Government to withdraw from the project by suggesting that no further action should be taken until the current studies of nato strategy and NATO force goals had been completed. If thosestudies showed that there was no military requirement for the forceand that NATO could not in any case afford to finance it, the UnitedStates Government might have less difficulty in abandoning the concept.The Foreign Secretary said that, despite &quot;these considerations,we had to face the fact that the German Government now expectedeither that the restrictions on the manufacture of nuclear weapons which they had accepted under the 1954 Brussels Treaty would beremoved or that they would be given in some other way a greatershare in the control of the nuclear weapons at the disposal of NATO.Prominent German politicians had assured him that, if Germany were allowed to participate in a mixed-manned force, the aspirations of theGerman people could be kept under control. But, if the concept of this force were abandoned, they might well assume a more dangerousform; and the German Government might seek to co-operate withthe French Government in developing the latter&apos;s force de frappe ona shared basis. In this situation we could not afford merely to reject the mixed-manned project without putting forward any constructivealternative. No such alternative, however, had yet been devised.Moreover, the communique which the President of the United Statesand the Chancellor of the Federal Republic, Dr. Adenauer, had issued at the end of their recent discussions had restated their intention tocreate a mixed-manned nuclear force in consultation with other interested countries. In these circumstances, while it might be advisable to suggest that a final decision on the creation of the force shouldawait the outcome of the current NATO studies, we should at leastoffer to participate in continuing technical discussion about its establishment. We must recognise, however, that such participationwould make it more difficult for the Government to refrain fromcontributing to the force, if it were ultimately brought into being.In further discussion the following points were made:(g) It would be possible for the United States Government toestablish a mixed-manned force without our participation, since theywere already assured of support from Germany, Italy and Belgium
as well as from Turkey and Greece. If it could be established that theywould in fact do so, irrespective of our own decision, it might be wiserthat we should be associated with the project from the outset ratherthan that we should stand aside and subsequently find ourselvespermanently excluded. The cost of our participation could perhaps beregarded as expenditure in support of our general foreign policy ratherthan as expenditure on a specific military project. Moreover, if theUnited States Government, faced with a refusal on our part toparticipate, abandoned the project, international opinion wouldattribute to us the blame for the failure of this co-operative venture;and this would damage our relations not only with the United Statesbut also with Germany and with our other friends in Europe.(/?) On the other hand the creation of a mixed-manned force would seriously endanger the chance of negotiating a nuclear test banwith the Soviet Government, would be bound to increase international tension and would be liable to be interpreted as contributing to theproliferation of nuclear weapons at a time when all our efforts shouldbe directed to reducing it. The fact that we had no agreed alternative to present to a course of action which we believed to be unsound wasnot a sufficient reason for supporting that course. The United StatesGovernment had not fully appreciated the wider political implications of their proposal; and we should seek to dissuade them, in the lightof these implications, from proceeding with it. Even if no more couldbe agreed than a postponement of further consideration of the project until after the completion of the current NATO strategicstudies, much would have been gained; and the difficulties and dangersinherent in the mixed-manned force would come to be more widelyappreciated with the passage of time.(/) If, failing the creation of the mixed-manned force, the germans were to participate in the French force de frappe, a very serious situation would arise. The Franco-German Treaty would then become a political reality and we should be in danger of becoming increasinglyexcluded from a Europe dominated by France and Germany. On theother hand French public opinion would not lightly acquiesce in thearming of Germany with nuclear weapons.(j) A possible alternative to the mixed-manned force would bea genuinely European deterrent, i.e., a force independent of any UnitedStates contribution and consisting of European national elements. Itshould not necessarily be assumed that the French Government would refuse to participate in such a force, particularly since it should help to reduce the danger that the German people would continue to aspireto possess a nuclear capability of their own and should also resolve the doubts about the extent to which Europe could rely for protectionon nuclear forces subject to a United States veto.(k) But German ambitions as regards nuclear weapons shouldnot be exaggerated. Apart from the fact that the German Governmenthad voluntarily assumed, under the 1954 Treaty, an obligation notto manufacture nuclear weapons, there was little evidence that internalpressure in Germany for an effective share in some nuclear capabilityhad yet reached a point at which the need to contain it could be used as a reason, which public opinion in this country would findconvincing, for our consenting to the creation of a mixed-manned force.(I) The problem was complicated, however, by the ambiguity ofour own position. The fact that we had insisted on maintaining ourown independent nuclear deterrent and had reserved the power touse it on our own initiative in a national emergency made it the moredifficult for us now to argue that other NATO countries should notbe allowed io share the control and management of a correspondingdeterrent which they could regard as in some sense their own.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that the implications of the mixed-manned force gave cause for serious anxiety,particularly in terms of its probable effect on the chances of securing an agreement to ban nuclear tests and to prevent the proliferation of
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,25th June, 1963.nuclear weapons, which must remain our overriding objective. But wecould not ignore the importance which the United States government appeared to attach to the mixed-manned force or the effect on ourposition in Europe of a refusal either to participate in further discussions about the force or to offer any constructive alternative to it. It would be desirable to give further consideration to the concept of a European deterrent, based on national contingents and so ensuringGerman participation in its management even if not in the controlof its weapons. Meanwhile, we must seek to persuade the United StatesGovernment to defer a final decision on the mixed-manned force untilthe current NATO studies were concluded; and, if further technical discussions in the interim could not be avoided, we should try to associate ourselves with them in a way which would not create an obligation on our part to participate in any force which it might bedecided to establish as a result.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.
