SatIPCentralOrganisationfor Defence(previous reference:C.C. (63) 13thConclusions)1.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Defence (C. (63) 114), to which was attached the draftof a White Paper setting out proposals for the establishment of a unified Ministry of Defence.The Prime Minister said that, since the Cabinet had considered,on 27th February, 1963, a report by Lord Ismay and Sir Ian Jacobon the higher direction of defence, much study had been given tothe questions involved. The Service Ministers and the Chiefs ofStaff had throughout contributed to the discussions; and theCabinet would be glad to know that the arrangements indicatedin C. (63) 114 carried their agreement. It was proposed that theWhite Paper should be published on 16th July; that parliament should be invited to pass the necessary legislation in the autumn;and that the new Ministry of Defence should come into existenceon 1st April, 1964.The Minister of Defence said that the proposed new organisation had been designed to produce a single, unified Ministryof Defence, which would nevertheless permit the maximumdevolution of administrative responsibility on flexible andimaginative lines and v/ould ensure the preservation of separateService identities. For the present the Ministry of Aviation would remain a separate Department; but arrangements would be madeto secure closer co-ordination of its work with that of the Ministryof Defence and to maintain, within the unified Ministry itself, a proper balance between the military, administrative and scientificinterests involved in the formulation of defence policy. The diagramattached to the draft White Paper showed how these principleswould be applied. The Defence Staff, the Defence Secretariat andthe Defence Scientific Staff would each be integrated under theChief of the Defence Staff and the Chiefs of Staff, the permanent under-Secretary of State and the Chief Scientific Adviserrespectively; while at the Ministerial level the Secretary of state would be supported by three Ministers of State for Defence, towhom he would delegate such responsibilities as he saw fit, includingspecific responsibility for the administration of the Royal Navy,the Army and the Royal Air Force. The proposed Defence Counciland the three Service Boards, to which the Council would, whenever possible, delegate responsibility for the management of the three separate Services, would also preserve the principles of unificationand decentralisation. Historic titles and offices would inevitablydisappear as a result of the reorganisation; but one of the mostancient would be preserved by the fact that The Queen hadgraciously consented to become Lord High Admiral of the UnitedKingdom.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) Paragraphs 15-17 of the draft White Paper described thearrangements to be made, in the context of the Cabinet and itssystem of Ministerial Committees, for ensuring the co-ordination ofmilitary policy with broader considerations of foreign andeconomic policy. But thev did not sufficiently stress the importanceof continuous co-ordination at all levels between the Ministry ofDefence and the political and economic Departments. The textshould be amended to make this clear; and paragraph 16 should include a reference to the official Committee which would supportthe new Ministerial Committee on Defence and Oversea Policy.(b) Paragraph 41 should be amended to indicate that the new arrangements for co-ordinating defence intelligence would notadversely affect the existing responsibility of the Joint Intelligence
Committee, under Foreign Office chairmanship, for co-ordinatingintelligence generally.(f\   tl-io   cfptnc   r\f   1-Vio   tUroa   iv/f in ietoi-e   hpcirrna t(^h   iri   tj-je   \x/hitea xxv.   jiuvuj    Wx    liiv    txxxvv    niimuwiu    uWi^mi,wvi    xxx    vilv     .. *xxwPaper as Ministers of State for Defence might give rise to difficulty.On the one hand, they must be seen to be subordinate to theSecretary of State for Defence. On the other hand Ministers ofState might be thought to carry insufficient authority to deal effectively on his behalf with Members of Parliament and otheroutside interests. Moreover, a reduction in the number of senior ministers might make it more difficult to ensure the efficientdespatch of Government business in the House of Lords. A solution might be sought in the appointment of Deputy Secretaries of state or Deputy Ministers; but this would give rise to certainconstitutional difficulties. There was no need, however, for animmediate decision on this point; and the Government should makeit clear in presenting the White Paper that they had not yet formed a final view on the title, status and salary of these three Ministers.(d) The new organisation would involve some increase in staff,at least in the senior grades. It would be possible to rebut criticism on this score by explaining that the primary objective of theGovernments proposals was to improve efficiency rather than tosecure economies for their own sake. Paragraphs 91 and 92 of thedraft White Paper, however, were unnecessarily defensive andshould be omitted.(e) Paragraph 88 of the draft White Paper, dealing with security, would be liable to attract attention. It should be amended to make it clear that new arrangements for co-ordination of securityquestions were necessary in order to enable the Secretary of Statefor Defence to discharge the responsibility for security in the three services which was at present carried by the Service Ministers andthat they were not being introduced in order to remedy faults inthe existing security organisation of the Service Departments.(/) There might be criticism of the decision not to incorporate the Ministry of Aviation in the new Ministry of Defence. But therewere strong arguments for keeping responsibility for sponsoringthe production of civil and military aircraft in the same department and for making that Department responsible also for supervisingthe operations of the Airways Corporations; and criticism would undoubtedly be equally strong if the opposite decision were taken.The main reason, however, for not integrating the Ministry of aviation in the Ministry of Defence, at least at this stage, was thatthe new Secretary of State would find it very difficult to assume this responsibility in addition to his other new burdens.The three Chiefs of Staff, speaking as the professional Headsof the Royal Navy, the Army and the Royal Air Force, endorsed the reorganisation described in the White Paper and said that itwould be generally welcomed by serving officers of the three services.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that the government&apos;s proposals would no doubt incur two conflictingcriticisms. They would be criticised by some for destroying traditionalinstitutions, which had served the country well, and for undermining the independence of the three Services. They would be criticised by others for stopping short of the total integration of the three services and the incorporation of the Ministry of Aviation in theMinistry of Defence. In the light of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion, however,the Government should be able to rebut both criticisms. They haddevised a scheme of reorganisation which would prove to be of historic significance; it should now be put into effect with confidence and resolution.
2. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of a memorandumby the Minister of Public Building and Works (C. (63) 76) on thefuture of the Foreign Office building.The Minister of Public Building and Works said that twodevelopments had taken place since his memorandum had been circulated. First, the new building for the Home Office in BridgeStreet would not now be completed until 1969; and the beginningof work on a new Foreign Office building would therefore be deferred by at least a year. Second, it had now been agreed, in the context of the new central organisation for defence, that the WarOffice building should be used to accommodate the Ministry of aviation and that the Admiralty should continue to be used for defence purposes until it was required as temporary accommodation for some of the staffs of the Foreign Office and the commonwealth relations Office if their own building was reconstructed.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The original proposals for the modernisation of the existingForeign Office building had proved to be inadequate anduneconomic. They should now be abandoned; and planning shouldbe based on the assumption that at some stage the present buildingwould be reconstructed.(b) Further consideration would need to be given to the styleof the new building. Since this would be liable to become a matter ofpublic controversy, it might be best to arrange for the design to bethe subject of competition. For practical reasons the number ofparticipants might have to be limited; but younger architects ofpromise should be given the opportunity to compete.(c) On present plans it appeared that a substantial proportionof the headquarters staffs of the Foreign Office would have to movetwice in a period of three years. This would be detrimental to efficiency and morale. The possibility of reducing this degree ofdisturbance should be further examined.(d) It would be inadvisable to make any announcement at thepresent stage of the decision to reconstruct the present ForeignOffice building or to seek to link that decision with the governments plans for promoting the dispersal of Departmental staffs.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that in due course the existing Foreign office building should be reconstructed.(2) Invited the Minister of Public Building and Works, inconsultation with the other Ministers concerned, to give further consideration to the suggestion that the design of the new building should be the subject of competition and to circulate proposals for this purpose at theappropriate time.GovernmentOfficesThe ForeignOffice Building(previous reference:C.C. (63) 29thConclusions,Minute 6)C.C. 45 (63)The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposals in C. (63) 114.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence, after talcing account ofthe amendments agreed in their discussion and of anyfurther changes which individual Ministers might suggest, to publish the White Paper on the central organisation of Defence on 16th July and to be guided,in the subsequent debate in Parliament, by the points made in their discussion.
(3) Invited the Minister of Public Building and Works, inconsultation with the Foreign Secretary, to give furtherconsideration to the accommodation of Foreign Officestaffs in the interval before the reconstruction of theForeign Office building.(4) Agreed that at this stage no announcement of theGovernments intentions should be made in any form.Parliamentary 3,   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business the House of Commons in the following week.House of 4.   The Lord Chancellor said that the Opposition in the HouseLords Reform  Qf Lords had tabled an amendment to the Peerage Bill, designedPeerage Bill     to bring the Bill into operation when it received the Royal Assent(Previous        rather than on the dissolution of Parliament. This amendmentReference:       might well attract sufficient support to be carried.  A furtherC.C. (63) 43rd amendment in the name of Lord Swinton, which would be debatedConclusions,     before the Opposition amendment, was designed to mitigate the minute 2)       effect of the latter by allowing a peer who succeeded before theAct came into force twelve months, instead of six months, inwhich to exercise his right to disclaim his peerage. The Governmenfswisest course would be to adhere to the argument which they had hitherto advanced in favour of bringing the Bill into force on the dissolution of Parliament but, if the Opposition amendment were carried, to accept at a later stage the amendment proposed by LordSwinton.In the course of discussion it was generally agreed that theGovernment must continue to oppose, even at the risk of defeat, an amendment affecting the composition of the House of Commonswhich that House had already rejected. If the amendment werenevertheless carried, the Cabinet would need to reconsider thesituation in the light of opinion in the House of Commons and ofthe risk that conflict between the two Houses at a late stage inthe Session might jeopardise the passage of the Bill. The valueof Lord Swinton&apos;s amendment could not be judged until it was known whether the Opposition amendment had been carried. Itmight become desirable to seek to persuade him to withdraw it and,if necessary, to reintroduce it at the Report stage.The Cabinet Agreed that, in the debate in the House of Lords on the amendments to the Peerage Bill affecting the date on whichthe Bill would take effect and the period allowed fordisclaiming a peerage, Government spokesmen should be guided by the points made in their discussion.Satellite 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordCommunications priVy Seal (C. (63) 117) about the policy which the Government(Previous should seek to promote at the forthcoming conference in LondonReference :      on satellite communications.Condusbns2&quot; The Lord Privy Seal said that, since this memorandum had minute 6) &apos; been circulated, doubts had been expressed about the technicalaspects of certain of its recommendations. These should be examined further before any decision was taken.
C.C. 45 (63)Engineering 6.   The   Cabinet   had   before   them   memoranda   by   the design Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (63) 118), the Minister withoutThe Feilden Portfolio (C. (63) 120) and the Lord President of the council report (C. (63) 124) on the Feilden Report on Engineering Design.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that a Committee onEngineering Design under the chairmanship of Mr. G. B. R. Feildenhad been appointed by the Council for Scientific and industrial research in May 1962. The report of the Committee had now beensubmitted to the Lord President by the chairman of the council under cover of a letter recommending its publication.Various passages in it were highly critical of certain aspectsof British engineering. Publication of the report as it stood wouldnot only be resented by the engineering industry but would alsobe liable to damage our engineering exports, particularly if the passages in question were quoted out of context by our competitors. On the other hand the existence of the report andthe nature of its findings were now widely known. It had alreadybeen printed for publication and one copy had inadvertently been sold. Any suspicion that the Government had sought to preventpublication of the report would therefore be even more damagingthan publication itself.In discussion the following points were made:(a) On balance, it would be right to publish the report. But,since certain of its findings, together with the quoted evidence ofsome of the individuals who had given evidence to the Committee,would undoubtedly give rise to criticism of the Government andof the engineering industry, the Departments concerned should, sofar as possible, deal with these criticisms on the basis suggestedby the Minister without Portfolio in C. (63) 120.(b) Credit should be taken for those aspects of the report,particularly in relation to advanced technical education, which showed the Government^ policy in a favourable light.(c) Although the publication of the report might do some damage to our interests in the short-term, the result in the longer-term would be likely to be beneficial. Its criticisms of present industrial practice were largely justified; and experience in other sectors of industry had shown that public criticism wasthe most effective means of exerting pressure on managements toimprove their standards.(d) The timing of publication would need careful consideration.In view of the fact that the Committee had taken a year to preparetheir report it would be unjustifiable to publish it without havinggiven the industries which it had criticised a reasonable opportunityto consider those criticisms and their own reply to them. It would therefore be right to defer publication until the 19th or 20th July,in spite of the&quot; risk that the contents of the report might becomepublic knowledge in the meantime.Invited the Lord Privy Seal, in consultation with theMinister of Aviation, to give further consideration to theproposals in C. (63) 117 and to submit to the Prime Ministeran agreed recommendation on the policy to be sponsored by the Government at the forthcoming conference onsatellite communications.
7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (63) 116) on the disposal of Chalgrove airfield.The Lord Chancellor said that the objections to the sale of thisairfield to the Martin Baker Aircraft Company might be overcomeif a particular form of covenant were attached to the sale. If further examination showed that this course was practicable, the dilemmawith which the Government would otherwise be faced could be avoided.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the disposal ofChalgrove airfield to be considered further by the HomeAffairs Committee at their meeting on the following day,in the light of the suggestion made by the Lord Chancellor.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,11th July, 1963.(1) Agreed that the Feilden Report on Engineering Designshould be published on the 19th or 20th July.(2) Invited the Departments concerned to be guided by the considerations set out in C. (63) 120 in dealing with the enquiries to which publication might give rise.(3) Invited the Minister without Portfolio, in consultation withthe President of the Board of Trade, to arrange for theReport to be made available to the engineering industries concerned as soon as possible.
