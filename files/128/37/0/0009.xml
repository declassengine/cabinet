economic policy(previous reference:C.C. (63) 8thConclusions)2. The Prime Minister said that, now that the negotiations forour accession to the European Economic Community (E.E.C.) had come to an end, it would be necessary for the Government tore-examine their economic policy and to respond constructively tothe many proposals which would henceforward be pressed on themfor action to offset the effects of our failure to join the Community.Our main objectives should be to strengthen relations with theCommonwealth, the European Free Trade Association and the member countries of the E.E.C., other than France, and to work for greater freedom in international trade.In discussion the following points were made:(a) There would be strong pressure for new Commonwealthtrading arrangements, based on the mistaken belief that theCommonwealth could be treated as a single economic entity. Itwould be unwise to appear merely to reject such initiatives. But,while our attitude towards the rest of the Commonwealth should remain sympathetic and co-operative, we should recognise that no useful results could be expected from a Commonwealth conferenceand that the possibility of enlarging Commonwealth trade would best be explored by bilateral negotiation with individual member countries. The Governments of Australia and New Zealand mightbe prepared to accept this view publicly, particularly in relation tothe discussions which would shortly have to be undertaken for the renewal of our trade agreement with Australia. To commit ourselves in those discussions to importing large quantities of Australian wheat for a further period while accepting the continuance of Australiandiscrimination against some of our more important industries wouldbe inconsistent with the realistic approach to economic problems which we must advocate if we were to succeed in promoting greater freedom in international trade.(b) The same considerations would be relevant in dealing withthe pressure which would now develop for a greater degree ofprotection against certain classes of import from Europe. It couldbe argued that protection should be reduced, rather than increased,if the economy was to be made more keenly competitive. Our policyin this regard would have to be settled in the context of theforthcoming negotiations under the General Agreement on tariffs and Trade.(c) There was still some expectation that negotiations for our entry into the E.E.C. might be resumed in a few months&apos; time. Solong as this uncertainty persisted industrialists would continue tohesitate to take major decisions on manufacturing and investmentpolicy. In view of the political desirability of avoiding any actionwhich could be interpreted as a final break with Europe it might beimpossible to remove this uncertainty altogether; but the Govern-ment should give industry as clear a lead as possible.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation with theMinisters chiefly concerned, would give further considera-tion to the Governments economic policy in the light of the breakdown of the negotiations for the accession of theUnited Kingdom to the European Economic Community.C.C. 9 (63)Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
Conclusions,Minute 8)Meeting ofEuropeanMinisters ofTransportIn discussion, there was general agreement that, while we should refrain from any action which might appear to be directed againstthe French Government in a spirit of vindictiveness, this considera-tion should not require us to forgo opportunities of profitablecollaboration with other countries having the same interests as ourselves.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Transport to inform his colleagues in the other European countries concerned that, if amajority of them wished to hold the third Conference todiscuss United States shipping legislation in London, hewould raise no objection.Foreign 4.   The Foreign Secretary said that in the light of reports ofAffairs Indonesian military activity some units in this country had beenIndonesia       placed on 72-hour notice for movement to Malaya.  He proposed to(Previous        discuss with the Minister of Defence, by reference to more recentReference:      reports,  whether this notice need be maintained.    There was,C.C. (63) 6th   however, a continuing danger of aggression against the BorneoConclusions,    territories by Indonesian forces.   Moreover, the Government of the minute 2)       Philippines intended to pursue their claim to sovereignty over north borneo  and might make common cause with the Indonesian government.   They appeared to believe that the danger to the philippines of an Indonesian foothold so close to their own country was less than that from the Chinese influence which, they feared,would develop in the Borneo Territories if they were incorporated in Greater Malaysia but the Government of Malaysia subsequentlyproved incapable of resisting the subversive activities of the Chineseelement in the population.  In these circumstances our efforts mustbe directed to restraining the Indonesian Government by all possible means.In discussion the following points were made:(a) There was at present no ban on strategic exports from theUnited Kingdom to Indonesia. Continuance of such exports, whichwere valuable to this country, might not greatly affect the situationin the Borneo Territories, where the main danger arose from guerillaactivity. But the policy should be kept under careful review, withparticular regard to the attitude of the United States Government tothe export of American arms to Indonesia.(b) The Philippine Government might seek to bring the situationin Borneo before the United Nations. Any such development wouldbe unwelcome, since it would tend to delay the establishment of greater Malaysia.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Shipping 3.   The Minister of Transport informed the Cabinet that two(Previous meetings of European Ministers of Transport, from ScandinavianReference: countries as well as from the member countries of the EuropeanC.C. (62) 52nd Economic Community, had already been held under his chairman-ship in London to discuss United States shipping legislation. It hadearlier been agreed to hold the third conference in Paris; but all thecountries concerned, other than France, had now indicated that theywould prefer that it should again be held in London under his chairmanship. It had also been suggested that, in default of our agreement to this proposal, they would reject a meeting in Paris andthe conference would not be held.
Minute 6)Cabinet Office, S.W.1,31st January, 1963.(2) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to arrange for anearly review of the Governments policy in relation tostrategic exports from the United Kingdom to Indonesia.The Yemen The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that the Govern-(Previous ment of Saudi Arabia appeared to have concluded that their reference: interests would be better served by acquiescing in the RepublicanC.C. (62) 75th regime in the Yemen than by maintaining active support for theConclusions, Royalists. The principal aim of Saudi Arabian policy was tosecure the withdrawal of Egyptian forces from the Yemen; and,since this aim was believed to be shared by Marshal Sallal, thePresident of the Republican Government, there was some prospect that United Nations efforts to mediate would bring about the cessation of Saudi Arabian activity and a phased withdrawal of egyptian forces. In these conditions a reconciliation between the republicans and the Royalists in the Yemen was not impossible;and further consideration would have to be given to the best meansof protecting British interests in Southern Arabia.The Cabinet (3) Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.
