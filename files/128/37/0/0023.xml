ChiefAnthonyEnahoro(previous reference:C.C. (63) 20thConclusions,Minute 3)1. The Home Secretary said that he was required by theprovisions of the Fugitive Offenders Act, 1881, to return ChiefAnthony Enahoro to Nigeria for trial on charges of treasonable felonyif he was satisfied that it was just to do so. He would clearly be boundto refuse to return Chief Enahoro if there were any question that hewould be required to stand trial for his life. Two legal arguments hadbeen advanced purporting to show that the second charge against himmight carry the death penalty. He was satisfied, however, that therewas no substance in either argument. There remained the possibility that fresh charges carrying the death penalty might be preferredagainst Chief Enahoro after his return. But the whole weight of theavailable evidence was against such an eventuality, quite apart fromthe fact that it would involve a serious breach of faith on the part ofthe Government of Nigeria. He had decided, therefore, that there were no grounds which would justify him in altering his earlier view that itwould be just to return Chief Enahoro to Nigeria.The A attorney-General said that it had now been accepted by themembers of the Opposition in the House of Commons who hadconcerned themselves with the legal issues involved that the firstargument which had been advanced to suggest that the second charge against Chief Enahoro might involve the death penalty was withoutsubstance. As regards the second argument to this effect, it had been advanced in the Nigerian courts during the trial of Chief Awolowoand had been decisively rejected. He was satisfied, therefore, that therewere no legal grounds for suggesting that the second charge againstChief Enahoro could involve the death penalty.In discussion the following points were made:(a) In the course of the adjourned debate in the House ofCommons the Prime Minister had undertaken that Chief Enahorowould not be returned to Nigeria unless the original argument that thesecond charge against him might carry the death penalty was shown tobe groundless or, if it was substantiated, the Government of Nigeriagave an assurance that no charge carrying the death penalty would be preferred against him. If it was now established that the second chargecould not carry the death penalty, it could be argued that there was no need for us to seek to insist on its being withdrawn. But so long as no assurance had been given by the Government of Nigeria about thepreferment of fresh charges it might be held that the Governmentwere in breach of an undertaking to Parliament if they now returnedChief Enahoro to Nigeria. It was understandable that the nigerian government should have refused to give such an assurance on theground that the suggestion derogated from their standing as a sovereign State. But it would be equally understandable if it thenbecame impossible for the United Kingdom Government to returnChief Enahoro for trial.(b) On the other hand, the suggestion that the second charge against Chief Enahoro should be withdrawn had been made at a timewhen it was thought that that charge might involve the death penalty.Now that it had been established that this was not the case theGovernment had discharged their undertaking to the House ofCommons.(c) The possibility that fresh charges might be brought againstChief Enahoro after his return was no new development; it had beeninherent in the case from the outset and applied equally to any othercase involving proceedings under the Fugitive Offenders Act. Adecision on the question whether, in any given case, it would be justto return a man to stand trial having regard to the possibility that freshcharges might be brought against him on his return must depend onthe degree of confidence to be placed in the good faith of theGovernment concerned. In the present case it would be unjustifiableto entertain the suspicion that the Government of Nigeria might bring2830-3
Federationof rhodesia and Nyasaland(previous reference:C.C. (63) 21stConclusions)2. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the request by thePrime Minister of Southern Rhodesia, Mr. Winston Field, that southern Rhodesia should be granted its independence as soon asNorthern Rhodesia or Nyasaland had been allowed to secede fromthe Central African Federation or had obtained its own independence.They had before them the draft of a reply to this request, together witha Note by the First Secretary of State (C. (63) 58) describing the main features of the present constitution of Southern Rhodesia.The First Secretary of State said that the reply to Mr. Fie&apos;d&apos;request could not avoid recognising that, as a result of our decision that none of the constituent Territories of the Federation could bekept in the Federation against its will, Southern Rhodesia, like theother Territories, would henceforward advance by the normalprocesses to independence. It should also indicate, however, thatcertain steps must be taken before independence could be granted tothe Colony. In particular, the Federation itself must first be dissolved,since Southern Rhodesia could not become a wholly independentcountry while remaining a member of a Federation which was not itself independent. In addition, before any further changes were made it would be necessary to examine the transitional arrangements whichwould be required to give effect to the declared desire of the other two territories to secede from the Federation; and before independencecould thereafter be granted to Southern Rhodesia itself we should need to discuss with the Government of the Colony a number of questions which would arise in that connection.A reply on these lines would serve to emphasise the order inwhich the successive stages of the advance of Southern Rhodesia to final independence should ideally take place: It would have theadditional advantage that, if it was acceptable to the Government ofSouthern Rhodesia, it should ensure their attendance at the proposed conference to discuss the future economic links between the colony and Northern Rhodesia which we should still seek to establish beforethe Federation was dissolved; and it would also enable us, if we wished, to stipulate at the final stage of the process that independencecould be granted to Southern Rhodesia only if, as one of the questionswhich would then arise for consideration, the Government of theColony were prepared to amend the existing Constitution on more liberal lines. It was doubtful, however, whether the Government of fresh charges against Chief Enahoro in the light of the acknowledgedprobity and repute of the Nigerian courts, of their conduct of the trialsof other defendants on the same charges and of all the circumstancessurrounding Chief Enahoro&apos;s particular case.(d) The delay which had necessarily occurred in reaching a finaldecision had aroused sympathy for Chief Enahoro and might bepleaded as an additional argument for suggesting that he should nowbe released. But this consideration should not be allowed to outweigh the arguments in favour of his return. Delays had occurred in other similar cases in the past; and it would be undesirable that delay shouldbe recognised as in itself a relevant factor in the decision on cases ofthis nature.The Cabinet (1) Confirmed their support for the Home Secretary in his decision of principle to return Chief Anthony Enahoro toNigeria.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, inconsultation with the Home Secretary, to consider themost appropriate means of concluding the adjourneddebate in the House of Commons on Chief Enahoro&apos;scase.
Southern Rhodesia would in fact accept the proposed reply as anadequate acknowledgement of their claim. They might be unwilling to contemplate discussions about economic links with northern rhodesia as a precondition of their achieving independence, since they would feel that the Union of South Africa vould provide themwith an alternative source of moral and materia. ^-pport; and theywould be likely to resist any implied suggestion that they could not expect to attain independence unless they were prepared to accept amore representative form of government. This reaction would not be wholly unreasonable since, as was clear from the details appended toC. (63) 58, the present Constitution had been accepted by the Houseof Commons as representing a significant advance in terms of electoralopportunity for the African population of the Colony and would infact have enabled the Africans, if they had taken full advantage of therights which it accorded them, to achieve at the last election a positionof considerable influence in the Legislature.In discussion there was considerable support in principle for a reply to the Government of Southern Rhodesia on the lines indicated by the First Secretary of State. There were some grounds for believing that that Government, which was relatively new to office, had not sufficiently distinguished between the concept of secession and the concept of independence or appreciated the action which would haveto be taken, if the dissolution of the Federation was to be effected inan orderly manner, before they could achieve independence. Therewould be considerable advantage, therefore, in making clear to them the successive steps to be taken during this transitional period in thehope that, if they were convinced that they would finally achieve their objective of complete independence, they would be prepared toco-operate in the necessary action in the interim and to refrain fromasserting their independence by a unilateral act. On this hypothesis itwas not impossible that the African leaders in Northern rhodesia would be prepared to discuss the possibility of maintaining economic:links with Southern Rhodesia without necessarily making their agreement explicitly conditional on an immediate improvement in thepolitical status of Africans in the Colony. Moreover, the Governmentof Tanganyika had privately indicated their support for an approach to the problem on the gradual and progressive lines which the first secretary had indicated.On the other hand, a considerable section of public opinion inthe United Kingdom would be likely to resist any suggestion that independence should be granted to Southern Rhodesia without somespecific reference to the need for further liberalisation of theConstitution. Moreover, the United Nations Organisation wasdisplaying increasing concern about the situation in the southern partof Africa; and it would be a negation of our past policy in colonial affairs if, by appearing &apos;io grant independence to Southern Rhodesiaunconditionally, we condemned the Colony to virtual ostracism bythe rest of the Commonwealth and by international opinion as awhole.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, on balance, the wisest course would be to defer for as long as possible thefinal decision on the terms on which we would eventually be preparedto grant independence to Southern Rhodesia and, while making our intentions in this respect reasonably clear, to seek to restrain theGovernment of the Colony from unilaterally asserting their independence forthwith. The reply to Mr. Field&apos;s request might therefore concede our agreement in principle that Southern Rhodesiashould proceed in due course to ultimate independence; but it shouldalso make it clear that, in accordance with our normal practice in sucha situation, we should expect, before that stage was reached, to discuss with the Government of the Colony a variety or natters financial,
constitutional, military. &amp;c. which always arose in relation to theconferment of independence on a colony and would in any event need to be dealt with in the legislation which would have to be passed bythe United Kingdom Parliament for that purpose.The Cabinet Invited the First Secretary of State to be guided, in hisfurther negotiations with the Government of SouthernRhodesia, by the considerations which had emerged during their discussion.Parliament 3.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken bythe House of Commons in the following week.Satellite Com-munications(previous reference:C.C. (63) 20thConclusions.Minute 1)4. The Lord Privy Seal said that, in accordance with the indications of the Governments policy on satellite communications which had been given during the recent Parliamentary debate on thissubject, we had intended to secure the initiative by shortly inviting theGovernments concerned to a conference, to be held in London in July.But, before the invitations could be issued, the French Governmenthad suggested that we should join them in promoting a conference inParis in May. This suggestion, however, might well be motivated, atleast in part, by a desire to engage us in a joint Anglo-French initiative and so to detach us politically from our associates in the european economic Community and the European Free Trade Association.Moreover, it would be wiser on practical grounds to defer a conferenceuntil after the further meeting of the European Conference of postal and Telegraph Administrations had taken place in June and until the interim report on our own design study for a communications satellitewas available. On this basis a conference could not usefully be held before July. He proposed, therefore, to inform the French Governmentthat, while we agreed in principle that there would be advantage in arranging an inter-Governmental conference about satellite communications, we thought it best to proceed on the lines indicatedin the Parliamentary debate; that the conference could, in our view,most conveniently take place in London in July; and that we wouldmeanwhile welcome the technical mission which the FrenchGovernment had suggested they might send to this country.In discussion the following points were made:(a) Our ability to promote the development of satellite communications would depend to a significant extent on establishing a working understanding with the French, whose approach to the basic problems appeared to be similar to our own. This might be more readily secured at the technical than at the diplomatic level.(b) While we should avoid creating the impression that we were seeking to involve our European associates in the establishment of asystem of satellite communications which would be completelyindependent of any system sponsored by the United States, it wouldbe premature at this stage wholly to dismiss the possibility of developing a system which would be distinct from, althoughcomplementary to, a system to be provided initially by the UnitedStates. There was some danger that the United States interests concerned might seek to frustrate the emergence of any systembut their own; and we should be prepared to extract the maximum of advantage from the contribution which the European countries could make, in various ways, to the development of this new methodof communication.
ForeignAffairsLaos(previous reference:C.C. (62) 50thConclusions,Minute 5)Iraq(previous reference:C.C. (62) 28thConclusions,Minute 7)5. The Lord Privy Seal informed the Cabinet that a confusedsituation had developed in Laos as a result of the recent assassinationof Quinim Pholsena, the Foreign Minister. We could most usefullycontribute to the restoration of stability by co-operation with theSoviet Union, with whom we shared the chairmanship of theInternational Control Commission; and an approach to the SovietGovernment for this purpose was under consideration.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Lord Privy Seal.The Lord Privy Seal informed the Cabinet that the iraqi government had asked whether we would undertake to train anumber of Iraqi officers in this country and to supply substantial quantities of arms and equipment, including Saracen armouredpersonnel carriers, Hunter aircraft and ammunition. If these enquiries reflected a disposition on the part of the new Governmentof Iraq to reduce their dependence on the Soviet Union, we should seek to take advantage of it. The risk that Western equipment mightbe used in Iraqi aggression against Kuwait would be reduced if wecould reach an understanding with the Government of Iraq about thestatus of Kuwait; and this possibility would be explored. Meanwhile,we should consider urgently how far we might meet the request of the iraqi Government for military assistance.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal, in consultation with the Ministerof Defence and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to arrange,as a matter of urgency, for an examination of the praticability and the implications of meeting the request for military training facilities and equipment which hadbeen made by the Government of Iraq.Export ofLargeDiameterSteel Pipe(previous reference:C.C. (63) 18thConclusions,Minute 2)The Lord Privy Seal said that, as a result of publicity which hadbeen given to the precise terms of the North Atlantic treaty organisation^ recommendation to member countries to refrain fromexporting large diameter steel pipe to the Soviet bloc, there was now a better understanding in the Federal German Republic of the positionadopted by the United Kingdom Government. It seemed unlikely,however, that orders which German steel firms were not permitted to fulfil would be secured by United Kingdom firms; nor was it probable that oil companies in the United States would decide toplace significant orders for steel pipe in the United Kingdom. Ourprices were said to be substantially higher than prices for comparablesupplies elsewhere.The Cabinet (3) Invited the Lord Privy Seal, in consultation with the chief secretary, Treasury, and the Minister of Power, toascertain whether prices for large diameter steel pipe madein this country were substantially higher than priceselsewhere.C.C. 23 (63)The Cabinet Approved the lines on which the Lord Privy Seal proposedto reply to the French Governments suggestion that aconference should be convened on satellite communications.
South Africa 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord and the privy Seal (C. (63) 59), suggesting that pressure on South Africa inUnited the United Nations would be intensified during the coming year inNations relation both to apartheid and to the status of South-West Africa. Asregards apartheid, there could presumably be no question of ouragreeing to the imposition of economic sanctions, as had been recommended at the last General Assembly. To do so would be to damage the economic interests both of ourselves and of the high commission Territories and possibly to jeopardise our defence facilities in South Africa. In the last resort, therefore, we must beprepared to use our veto in the Security Council in order to preventthe application of economic sanctions. As regards South-West Africa,however, the International Court had not yet delivered judgment in acase in which South Africa was accused of breach of the Mandateoriginally granted by the League of Nations. If this judgment declaredSouth Africa to be in default, we should be pressed to endorse actionto enforce it. The South African Government had been warned that,if they defied an adverse decision by the Court, they could not rely upon us to support them.The Cabinet Took note of C. (63) 59.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,4th April, 1963.
