Foreign 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that our relations with the affairs Icelandic Government might be subjected to renewed strain as the Iceland result of a recent incident involving a United Kingdom trawler, a(Previous        vessel of the Icelandic coastguard service and one of Her Majesty&apos;reference:      ships.

(62) 56thConclusions,Minute 4)3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it seemed unlikelythat any substantial progress would be made in the near future in developing the proposals, which he had put forward in the previous year at the meeting of the International Monetary Fund, for securing a more liberal and flexible supply of international credit, although theUnited States Government were now showing increased interest inthis general problem. In the meantime it would be to our advantage to enter into an arrangement with the United States government under which either Government would, at the request of the other,undertake to hold sterling or dollars respectively to an amountequivalent to $500 million. The United States had already enteredinto arrangements of this kind with other Governments, althoughfor smaller amounts. A suitable announcement would be made whenthe detailed negotiations had been concluded.lhe Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement by the Chancellorof the Exchequer.Federation of rhodesia and nyasaland(previous reference :C.C. (63) 29thConclusions,Minute 5)4. The First Secretary of State informed the Cabinet that, asa result of further discussions between the United Kingdom HighCommissioner in Salisbury and the Prime Minister of SouthernRhodesia, Mr. Field, it was now proposed that the grant of independence to Southern Rhodesia should coincide with the dissolution of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, thatseparate discussions should be arranged between the Governmentsof the United Kingdom and Southern Rhodesia about the terms onwhich the Colony should attain independence and that suchconstitutional changes as might be agreed as a result of these discussions should be put into effect by legislation in the Parliamentof Southern Rhodesia rather than by legislation in the parliament at Westminster. It would be appropriate that we should now formallyconfirm to Mr. Field that we were prepared to proceed on this basis,subject to eventual agreement about the terms on which SouthernRhodesia should attain independence. Early discussion of these terms would be desirable; and. in the interests of reaching finality as soonas possible, it would be necessary to issue simultaneously the invitations to all the Governments concerned to attend the projected2833-2k 2Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
conference on the dissolution of the Federation. If the discussions onthe terms of independence for Southern Rhodesia had not beencompleted at the point when this conference assembled, they wouldhave to be resumed subsequently.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement by the first secretary of State.housing policy(previous references :C.C. (62) 71stConclusions,Minute 4 andC.C. (62) 59thConclusions,Minute 2)5. The Cabinet had before them memoranda about housing policy by the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of housing and Local Government (C. (63) 80) and by the Minister ofHealth (C. (63) 84).The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that thepolicy outlined in the draft White Paper annexed to C. (63) 80 shouldbe considered against a background of increasing population and rising standards. At the present rate of building, output was barelykeeping pace with the growth of population and the decay of existing houses. In order to overcome shortages and to rebuild the slums aconstruction rate of 450,000 houses a year would be required. Thiswas impracticable; but the Government should aim at increasingoutput to at least 350,000 houses a year and should announce this target in the White Paper.This programme should comprise an increase in the number ofhouses built, otherwise than by local authorities, for letting. TheBuilding Societies Association were prepared to support the formationof housing societies for this purpose; and building societies would be willing to contribute two-thirds of the cost of such building, if theGovernment would provide the remaining third. It was therefore proposed to establish a Housing Corporation in order to develophousing societies. This Corporation would be empowered to borrowfrom the Exchequer, at the Governments current rate of interest, andto lend to approved housing societies the balance of the finance whichthey would require.In addition, further steps must be taken to secure the improvementof existing houses. It was therefore proposed that both landlords andowner-occupiers should be compelled to improve their property, atthe request of the tenant or on a change of occupancy, by installing the basic amenities.Finally, the maintenance of the existing stock of houses required a realistic policy on rents, which were at present below the level atwhich landlords could be expected to keep their property in repair.The White Paper should therefore indicate that, while the government did not envisage any further block decontrol of rents, it wouldprobably be necessary to allow rents to rise sufficiently to enablelandlords to undertake necessary maintenance. In addition, futureassessments of housing subsidies should assume that local authorities would be prepared to charge rents which bore a proper relation both to the cost of the housing and to the ability of the tenants to pay.The Minister of Health said that he doubted the wisdom of measures which might be held to run counter to the normal operationof the machinery of supply and demand. The case for the proposedHousing Corporation rested on an assumption that philanthropywould provide the enterprise which elsewhere required to be rewardedwith profit. This was a questionable assumption, which did not justifythe creation of a new agency, guaranteed by the Government.Moreover, the proposal that the improvement of existing houses should, if necessary, be effected by compulsory powers, was alien tothe Governments political principles. Finally, it would be dangerous to announce a target figure for the new housing programme, since themajority of houses were built by private firms or individuals overwhom the Government had no effective control.
In discussion the following main points were made:(a) While there might be some risk in announcing a target figure for new house construction, it would be difficult to avoid indicating the Governmenfs intentions in this respect; and the balance ofadvantage lay in stating them in the White Paper. The figure of 350,000houses was not unrealistic in relation to the rising output of thebuilding industry.(b) But, since the construction of 350,000 houses a year wouldnot meet the full requirement, it was essential that the productivity ofthe building industry should be improved. There was relatively little prospect of securing an increase in the numbers employed by theindustry; but active consideration was already being given to measures designed to improve its efficiency.(c) There was some evidence that the building industry itself would welcome the formation of new housing associations. The largenumber of applications received by existing associations suggestedthat there was an ample demand for houses to let at economic rents,which private enterprise would not be likely to satisfy so long ashouses could readily be sold.(d) The proposal to require owners of houses, particularly owner-occupiers, to improve their property was more arguable. The publicinterest admittedly required the nation&apos;s stock of houses to be properlymaintained; and it was difficult to insist that a landlord must improvehis property if a neighbouring owner-occupier was not subject to similar compulsion. On the other hand, changes in occupation of owner-occupied houses were relatively infrequent; and the numberof such properties which would become available for compulsoryimprovement would be out of proportion to the amount of criticismlikely to be attracted by a proposal to compel owner-occupiers toinstal amenities which they might be content to forgo.(e) In Scotland the multiple ownership of tenement blocks created a special problem, since an intransigent owner of one part of a block could frustrate the improvement of the rest. Here, however,compulsion was likely to be accepted by all but a small minority of owner-occupiers, provided that the proposed financial assistance wasmade available.(/) The White Paper rightly stressed the importance of a realisticapproach to the question of the cost of housing. But it would be advisable to omit the paragraphs discussing the possibility of a further relaxation of rent control, since the dilemma implicit in this issuecould not be usefully examined until the results of the current survey of London housing were available.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, since it seemed unlikely that houses would henceforward be built for lettingby private enterprise on any substantial scale, the encouragement of housing associations might prove to be the most effective step that could be taken to implement the Governmenfs housing programme.The balance of advantage probably lay in retaining a clear target figure for that programme as a whole. But it would be preferable notto extend to the owner-occupier the measures of compulsion to securethe improvement of existing houses; and it might be wiser to refrain,at this stage, from any reference to the possibility of further decontrolof rents. Subject to amendment on these points, the White Paper,which was an important statement of policy, should be published assoon as possible.The Cabinet-(1) Approved, subject to the amendments agreed in their&apos; discussion, the proposals in the draft White Paperappended to C. (63) 80.
(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Ministerof Housing and Local Government to give furtherconsideration, in consultation with the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster and the Minister without Portfolio,to the arrangements for publishing the White Paper andfor ensuring appropriate publicity for it.(3) Took note that the Minister of Public Building and Workswould continue, in consultation with the other ministers concerned, to explore means of improving the efficiency of the construction industry.SatelliteCommuni-cations(previous reference:C.C. (63) 23rdConclusions,Minute 4)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord privy Seal (C. (63) 83) about satellite communications.The Lord Privy Seal said that it had now been agreed betweenthe French Government and ourselves that two conferences onsatellite communications should be arranged, the first in Paris on20th May and the second in London in mid-July. preliminary discussion of the agenda for the initial conference, however, had revealed a fundamental difference of view between the FrenchGovernment and ourselves about the part to be played by Europe inthe establishment of satellite communications. It would be our intention, in accordance with the Cabinet&apos;s earlier decision, to seek to promote the concept of a global satellite communications system,organised on as comprehensive an international a basis as possible,on the understanding that the United Kingdom would be given anopportunity to make an appropriate contribution to its development,provision and operation; and, although it would be premature to declare, before we had explored the subject further with the UnitedStates, that we should in no circumstances seek to promote a systemindependently of them, we should in fact envisage from the outseta system which would be created in full co-operation with UnitedStates interests. The French Government, however, appeared to contemplate collaboration with the United States for only a limited period, after which they would seek to establish a separate Europeansystem under their own leadership. This proposal was unlikely to be practicable in the longer term; nor would it secure the maximum ofbargaining advantage for Europe in the initial stages of thedevelopment of satellite communications. We should therefore ensurethat this fundamental difference of approach between ourselves andthe French Government would be brought out into the open at the outset of the forthcoming conference. Thereafter, we should maintain our own attitude, which would probably enlist the support of other european countries; and we should resist French pressure in favourof the establishment of a formal European organisation in this context.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) It might be premature to seek to reach, at this early stage, a definitive decision in favour of a single, global system of satellite communications. Such a system might comprise several separatesub-systems, provided that they were technically compatible.(b) The more practical objective would be to seek to secure for europe a reasonable share in the first system to be brought intooperation, which would inevitably be largely provided and controlled by the United States. But United States interests would be unlikely to recognise the claims of Europe in this respect unless the european countries were united on the points on which they would seeksatisfaction. The French concept of a separate European system,largely controlled by themselves, might well prove economicallyunrealistic, particularly in the light of the technological advantage which the United States already possessed and would retain. Butthis fact might be left to become apparent in due course; for the
Agricultural 7.   The Minister of Agriculture invited the Cabinet to approvePo,icy the draft of a public statement indicating, in accordance with their(Previous earlier decisions, that future agricultural policy would be based on reference : the introduction of standard quantities for domestic production underC.C. (63) 28th flexible guarantee arrangements, together with the negotiation of an conclusions, effective system of control of imports. This statement would be minute 4)       ^e necessary prelude to the international negotiations which would now have to be undertaken before legislation could be introduced togive effect to the new policy.In discussion certain amendments to the draft were agreed.The Cabinet-(1) Approved, subject to the amendments made in their discussion, the statement in which the Minister ofAgriculture proposed to announce the main lines of theGovernments future agricultural policy.C.C. 32 (63)hnmediate purpose of negotiation with the United States about the initial system, Europe could not afford disunity between the Frenchand ourselves.(c) On the other hand, if we were to establish the right tocontribute to, and therefore partly to own and to control, the initialsystem, we should concentrate on realising this objective in agreementwith the United States from the outset. We should not be diverted from this purpose by an alternative concept of a separate Europeansystem, which would lack both the resources and the technologicalexpertise to compete with a purely United States system, organisedfrom the outset on a global basis and effectively dominating the world market.(d) It would be equally unwise to acquiesce in the creation of a formal European organisation, which would be committed topromoting a specifically European policy, would be liable to be largelydominated by the French Government and could not be expectedto have regard to the Commonwealth interests which we should be concerned to safeguard. Some form of intergovernmental consultativemachinery should suffice at this stage.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that our main purpose in the forthcoming conferences should be to try tosecure for ourselves the most realistic and advantageous basis of subsequent negotiation with the United States. The means by whichwe should best do so were not yet clear. In principle, we should endorse the concept of a single global system; and we should not commit ourselves at this stage to the alternative concept of a separateEuropean system. But the global system itself might well prove to consist of a number of sub-systems, one of which might be providedby Europe; and we could not, in any event, ignore the fact that itmight prove impossible to secure the agreement of the United Statesinterests to arrangements which would ensure a reasonable degreeof effective European participation in a global system. It would benecessary to give further consideration to these conflicting factorsafter the forthcoming conferences.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord Privy Seal to arrange for the representativesof the United Kingdom Government at the forthcoming conference on satellite communications to be guided by the considerations indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up of their discussion.
(2) Invited the Minister of Agriculture, in consultation with theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the minister without Portfolio, to consider the most appropriateoccasion for the issue of this statement, whether inParliament or otherwise, and to concert arrangements for ensuring that it should receive suitable publicity.Shipbuilding:Proposals forGovernmentAssistance8. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it had become necessary to provide some support for the shipbuilding industry,which was suffering from a serious recession of demand. Orders forthe first three months of 1963 had amounted to only 88,000 tons,by comparison with a normal rate of ordering of about 1 million tonsa year.There were substantial objections to a direct subsidy, apart fromthe fact that it would not be welcome to the shipbuilders themselves,who realised the need to rationalise the industry and to reduce its size. Nor would a policy of &quot; scrap and build &quot; be appropriate to theneeds of the situation; it would place fresh financial obligations uponthe shipowners and would do nothing to increase the competitivestrength of the industry. He had therefore reached the conclusionthat it would be right to make temporary arrangements under whichthe Government would provide credit, at the Government lendingrate, to the Shipbuilding Mortgage Corporation, which would in turn undertake to finance, at the same rate of interest, shipbuildingorders placed within a given period of time. This would rectify theexisting anomaly that, under arrangements provided by the export credits Guarantee Department, foreign shipowners could obtaincredit for orders placed with British yards on more favourable termsthan those available to British shipping companies. Legislation wouldbe required to give effect to a scheme on these lines.The Minister of Transport said that he endorsed this proposal which, although unlikely to stimulate any substantial volume of new orders, might accelerate orders which would otherwise be liable to be deferred. It would be desirable to announce a decision before the whitsun Recess, in view of the current Parliamentary criticism of the lack of any action by the Government to help the industry.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to make arrangements under which the Government would providecredit, at the Government lending rate, to the ShipbuildingMortgage Corporation, to be used to finance shipbuildingorders placed within a given period of time.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, to consider themost appropriate means of securing legislative authorityfor these arrangements, whether by means of the finance bill or otherwise.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,16th May, 1963.
