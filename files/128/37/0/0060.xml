The Foreign Secretary said the Steering Group which hadbeen established in Paris to consider the political and legal aspectsof the proposed multilateral nuclear force had now held its firstmeeting. The discussion had been moderate in tone; several pertinentquestions about the validity of the force had already been raised bythe representatives of other countries attending the meeting; andthere had been no indication that any very early outcome of thediscussions need be expected.It would be necessary to decide before long whether we shouldtake part, even on a strictly limited basis, in the experimentalmixed-manning of one or two United States warships with crewsdrawn from a number of countries which were members of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation.4006-3a 21. The Foreign Secretary said that the Soviet refusal to allow a United States military convoy to pass through one of the checkpoints on the Berlin Autobahn a few days before appeared to be theresult of precipitate action by the local military command ratherthan of any deliberate decision by the Soviet political authorities.Nevertheless, the situation had developed with disconcerting speed;and there had been some risk that force might be employed.Although the incident had now been resolved, it suggested that steps should be taken to review the procedures for dealing withemergencies of this nature, in order to ensure that they would bebrought under firm political control from the outset.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement by the foreign secretary.The Foreign Secretary said that the situation in Indonesiaremained unsatisfactory. The Indonesian Government had taken no effective steps to enable British firms to resume normal working;and they had so far failed to confirm in writing their undertaking tore build Her Majesty&apos;s Embassy in Djakarta. Moreover, they maintained their hostility to Malaysia; and it would be inappropriatethat we should press the Prime Minister of Malaysia to attend the projected discussions with the President of Indonesia and thePresident of the Philippines unless they were first prepared torecognise his country. We must also seek to restrain the UnitedStates Government from bringing undue pressure to bear on him inthis context. In view of the possibility of a further deterioration ofthe military situation in the North Borneo territories, confidential discussions would shortly take place in Washington between representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, Australiaand New Zealand.In discussion it was suggested that, on balance, there would belittle advantage in present circumstances in seeking to bring thedispute between Indonesia and Malaysia before the United Nations.While this possibility would be kept under review, an early debatemight produce a significant minority vote in Indonesia^ favour; andthis would tend to be to Malaysia&apos;s disadvantage. Difficulties wouldalso attach to any proposal to station United Nations observers onthe borders between the North Borneo territories and Indonesia. Inview of the nature of the country, such observers would be liable to prove ineffective and also to embarrass any preventive operations which the Malaysian forces might need to promote.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Foreign Secretary.
The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Foreign Secretary.Kenya(previous reference:C.C. (63) 59thConclusions,Minute 1)3. The Colonial Secretary informed the Cabinet of the latest developments in the Kenya Constitutional Conference. The main points at issue between the spokesmen of the Kenya African NationalUnion (KANU) and the Kenya African Democratic Union (KADU)concerned:(a) The control of the police.(b) The control of the public service.(c) The provision to be made for amendment of the Constitutionafter the Colony had attained independence.On the first two of these three issues experience had shown that the safeguards for regional interests, which had been provided by the1962 Constitution, had unduly complicated efficient and economicadministration; and some changes in the direction of the morecentralised control favoured by KANU were probably justified. ButKANU&apos;s own demands in these respects were excessive; and wecould not easily concede them without appearing, in the eyes ofKADU and their supporters in this country, to retract the undertakings, enshrined in the 1962 Constitution, that regionalinterests would be protected. As regards the provision for future constitutional amendment the existing Constitution required amajority of 75 per cent in the Lower House and 90 per cent in theUpper House before any amendment could be made. KANU wouldprobably agree that these percentages should remain in relation tocertain basic provisions of the Constitution, e.g., tribal rights to land,citizenship and the regional structure. They claimed, however, thatlower percentages should suffice to authorise an amendment of theConstitution as regards the powers of the regional authorities. here again, however, KADU would be liable to oppose any reduction inthe entrenched safeguards for existing regional powers.In these circumstances four courses of action were possible:(i) We could accept the demands of KANU virtually in their entirety. In that event the KADU tribes would probably revolt; and,in the light of the disorder which would ensue, Parliament would be unlikely to agree to enact the Kenya Independence Bill.(ii) We could adopt the other extreme course and refuse tomake any substantial change in the existing Constitution. In that case the representatives of KANU at the conference might accept this decision but would declare at the same time that, as soon asKenya attained independence, they would revoke the Constitution.The KADU tribes would probably react to such a declaration by attempting to secede from Kenya: and in these circumstancesParliament would be no less reluctant to enact the independence ofthe Colony.(iii) We could postpone the date of independence, which was at present fixed for 12th December. KANU would then be liable tomake a unilateral declaration of the Colony&apos;s independence; and itwas not to be contemplated that, in that case, we should seek tohold the country by force.(iv) We could endeavour to negotiate some degree of amendment to the existing Constitution, particularly on the issues of the police,the public service and the provisions for future constitutionalamendment, in the hope that both KANU and KADU would be persuaded, reluctantly, to accept a solution on these lines. It wouldbe very difficult, however, to strike the right balance between, onthe one hand, making sufficient concessions to KANU&apos;s demands to command their acquiescence and, on the other hand, maintaininggood faith with KADU; and we must therefore face the prospect
4. The Colonial Secretary said that the IndependenceConference for British Guiana, which we had been compelled to suspend in 1962, would shortly reconvene. In the light of the seriousoutbreaks of inter-racial violence earlier in the present year it wouldnot be easy to devise a solution which would safeguard the rightsand satisfy the aspirations of both the Indian and the Africancommunities; and we must be prepared, if necessary, to deal with aposition of deadlock between the parties.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Colonial Secretary.5. The Cabinet had before them a Note by the First Secretaryof State (C. (63) 181), to which was appended a revised draft ofThe Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament.It was agreed that the speech should include a reference to theGovernments intention to introduce legislation to empower theCourt of Criminal Appeal to order a new trial of a convicted person on the grounds of fresh evidence and that measures to relievehardship among householders as a result of rating revaluation should that KANU would withdraw from the conference before any settlement was reached, that KADU would then seek to implement their demand for a partition of the Colony and that tribal warfarewould break out.In discussion it was agreed that the Government now faced acritical situation in Kenya. On any reasonable estimate of future prospects KANU should be prepared to reach a compromise on the issues in dispute, since they were steadily winning political support in the Colony and could confidently hope that they would sooncommand a sufficient majority in the Legislature to effect the changes which they desired by legal and constitutional means. But the tension between KANU and KADU had now reached a point at which itcould not be assumed that reasonable counsels would prevail. Inthese circumstances the Government must be prepared to go to thefurthest limit that good faith would allow in seeking to satisfy theaspirations of KANU. But preparations should also be made to dealwith the situation which might arise if it proved impossible to attainan agreed settlement. These plans should have particular regard tothe need to protect the Europeans in Kenya; and it would also benecessary to envisage the possibility that the Somalis of the northern frontier District might seize the opportunity to secede from theColony.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the action taken by the Colonial Secretary topromote a constitutional settlement in Kenya and invited him to be guided, in the course of his further negotiationswith the political parties in the Colony, by the points which had emerged during their discussion.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with theColonial Secretary, to examine, as a matter of urgency,the steps which should be taken if tribal warfare broke out in Kenya, with particular regard to the need to afford the maximum degree of protection to the europeans in the Colony.
also be mentioned. The references to legislation on hire purchase and on the Conventions on the High Seas and the Continental Shelfshould be omitted. It would be more appropriate to announce on alater occasion the proposed legislation to enable citizens of commonwealth countries who had been obliged to renounce theircitizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies to resume itsubsequently.A number of other amendments to the draft speech were considered and approved.The Cabinet-(1) Approved, subject to the amendments agreed in their discussion, the terms of the revised draft of The Queen&apos;sSpeech on the Opening of Parliament.(2) Took note that the First Secretary of State would arrangefor the submission of the revised draft, as amended, forThe Queen&apos;s approval.Compensationfor Victims of crimes of violence(previous reference:C.C. (63) 59thConclusions,Minute 4)6. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of a memorandum bythe Home Secretary (C. (63) 179) on the payment of compensation tothe victims of crimes of violence.The Home Secretary said that, in accordance with the Cabinetsearlier decision, he had now stated publicly that the Governmentwould shortly introduce measures to compensate the victims of crimes of violence. The reaction to this statement suggested that many of the Governments supporters would endorse thisarrangement only if it were accompanied by some means of obtainingrestitution from the offender. It seemed impossible, however, tointroduce restitution into the proposed scheme for the payment ofcompensation ex gratia by trustees, since only a court could order the offender to make any payment.In discussion it was suggested that, even if a court made anorder for restitution by an offender, there would often be no means by which recovery could be enforced, at least so long as prisonearnings remained below the level of normal wages. It should not therefore be objected to an ex gratia scheme that it would makerestitution more difficult than a &quot; court &quot; scheme -nor was there any reason why provision should not be made for restitution, ifpossible, independently of the arrangements for the payment ofcompensation.It would therefore be preferable that the payment ofcompensation should initially be arranged under an ex gratia scheme,which would leave open the possibility of introducing a &quot; court&quot;scheme later, if this should prove desirable. The details of such ascheme should now be examined, in order that a full statement ofthe Governments intentions might be made early in the new Sessionof Parliament.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that arrangements for the payment of compensation to the victims of crimes of violence should be introducedinitially in the form of an ex gratia scheme, administered by trustees.(2) Approved the inclusion of a reference to the scheme inThe Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,15th October, 1961C.C. 60 (63)(3) Invited  the Home Secretary, in consultation  with theMinisters concerned:(i) to verify that a scheme on these lines could beintroduced without legislation;(ii) to arrange for the preparation of a White Paperdescribing the principles of the scheme and thearrangements for its administration.
