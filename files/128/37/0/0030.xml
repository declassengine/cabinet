SubjectIndia and Pakistan
C.C. 30 (63)India and The   Cabinet  had   before  them  a   memorandum   by  the pakistan Commonwealth Secretary (C. (63) 82) on military aid for India.The Commonwealth Secretary said that, in the interval since theChinese attack on India in the previous autumn, we had examined,in consultation with the United States Government, the scope forfurther military aid to India in anticipation of a renewal of Chineseaggression. Any fresh Chinese invasion would probably be directed against India&apos;s eastern frontier and would therefore be likely to threaten East Pakistan at an early stage. Ideally, therefore, thedefence of India should be planned in terms of the defence of thesub-continent as a whole; and the requirements for this purpose should be assessed on the assumption that a large part of India&apos;defence resources would no longer be immobilised in defending Indiaagainst Pakistan. This logically implied that a settlement of thedispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir should be aprecondition of any further military assistance to India.Nevertheless, it would be unrealistic to expect any ease or rapidsolution of the problem of Kashmir; and, although we should maintain our pressure on both India and Pakistan to acceptmediation in the dispute, we should meanwhile consider the questionof further military aid to India on its merits and with due regard tothe goodwill which we had already acquired in India as the result ofour prompt response to the Indian request for assistance during the critical days of the Chinese invasion in the previous autumn.The Indian Government had estimated that the cost of the rearmament required to counter the Chinese threat would be of theorder of  2,400 million over three years; and they hoped that theUnited States and United Kingdom Governments would finance theforeign exchange component of this total, amounting to about 600 million. In a recent visit to Delhi the Chief of the DefenceStaff had persuaded the Indian Government to accept a reassessmentof their requirements on a more modest and realistic basis. Even so,it remained a heavier commitment than the United States and theUnited Kingdom could be expected to accept. Moreover, so long asthe dispute over Kashmir persisted, our contributions mustnecessarily be modest, for political reasons. But the United StatesGovernment appeared likely to undertake to provide military equipment to the value of some  10-20 million; and we should do our best to make a corresponding gesture, even if on a more limited scale.In addition, however, the United States Government had suggested that we should join them in undertaking to send severalsquadrons of fighter aircraft to India, ostensibly on a trainingmission but in reality in order to defend the principal cities of india from air attack. This course might have several advantages from our point of view. It would free Indian squadrons for the defenceof forward positions and would therefore reinforce the deterrent toChinese attack; it would give less offence to Pakistan than the supply ofmilitary equipment to India; and, in so far as it would openly signifythat India had turned to the West for protection, it would constitute a first, and probably irreversible, step by the Government of Indiaaway from the policy of strict non-alignment.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) Our fighter squadron strength was due to be reduced thisyear; and it would not be easy to spare a squadron for the defenceof Indian cities. On the other hand, the cost of such an arrangement would be relatively small by comparison with the cost of sendingsupplies of military equipment to India on any significant scale.(b) If China launched a major attack on India, it would beimpossible for the United States and the United Kingdom to refrain
from assisting the Indian Government to defend their country. Toallow United Kingdom and United States aircraft to participate inthe air defence of Indian cities would do no more than recognisethis fundamental fact.(c) On the other hand, the proposal could involve us in great political and military dangers. If individual British and Chineseaircraft came into conflict, we should be virtually at war with China;and we should have to expect Chinese retaliation against HongKong. Moreover, even if our aircraft were not involved in operations,the fact that we had been prepared to undertake this limited degreeof participation in the defence of India would be regarded as morallycommitting us to extend that participation if China launched a majorattack on India. We should be wise to avoid this implied commitment to defend India in circumstances of total war, at least until Indiaand Pakistan had resolved their differences and were prepared toco-operate with the West in arrangements for the defence of thesub-continent as a whole.(d) It was doubtful whether three squadrons of fighter aircraft would in fact provide an effective defence of the main cities of Indiaor suffice to deter Chinese aggression. Nevertheless, in so far as theIndian Government believed that they would be of value for these purposes, they would be less, rather than more, disposed to reach agreement with Pakistan on the Kashmir dispute or on jointarrangements for the defence of the sub-continent as a whole. Butwe should give them no encouragement to remain intransigent onthese issues; and we should take this opportunity to make it clear to them that they must now abandon their policy of neutrality andalign themselves more positively with the West.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it was perhaps arguable whether the interests of the West were best served by an attempt to change the Indian policy of non-alignment andby an offer to provide India, for this reason, with further military aid on any significant scale. Assistance with her programmes of social and industrial development could be held to be more relevant to her real needs than assistance designed to help her to rearm on a scale which might ultimately ruin her economically. Moreover, ifChina decided, as a deliberate act of policy, to seek to overrun thewhole of India and South-East Asia, there was little doubt that theUnited States would intervene on a massive scale. This fact was thereal deterrent to Chinese aggression; and it was doubtful whether there would be any advantage in attempting to organise a more limited form of deterrent in the manner now proposed, which mightmerely provoke China to renew the attack on India before herdefence could be properly organised and would, in any event,constitute a dangerous moral commitment for the West. On theother hand, the United States Government clearly attached importance to our endorsing the proposal that United States and united Kingdom fighter squadrons should participate in the defenceof Indian cities; and this factor must be weighed against the serious political risks which such participation would entail.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,15th May, 1963.
