Secretaryof theCabinet(previous reference :C.C. (62) 61stConclusions,Minute 1)1. The Prime Minister said that on the occasion of Sir NormanBrook&apos;s retirement from the public service the Cabinet would wishto express to him their pleasure at his recovery from his recentillness and their warm appreciation of the many services which hehad rendered to successive Administrations, both as an officialadviser to Ministers and as a personal friend. The Cabinet hopedthat his distinguished career would be crowned by a long and happyretirement.In reply, Sir Norman Brook thanked the Cabinet for their good wishes. He expressed his gratitude for the courtesy and consideration which had been extended to him by all the Ministers whom he had served and said that he would always retain the happiest memoriesof his period of office as Secretary of the Cabinet.Pensions andNationalInsurance(previous reference :C.C. (62) 68thConclusions.Minute 5)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (62) 209) reporting the conclusionsof a Committee of Ministers under his chairmanship which had considered the provisions of the legislation to be introduced duringthe current session to increase national insurance and related ratesof benefit.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the main issue for decision, on which the Committee were not agreed, was the questionwhether the Bill should provide for a flat-rate increase of 7s. 6d. aweek in the single rate of benefit under the national insurance scheme(together with corresponding fiat-rate increases in the other national insurance rates and in those under the industrial injuries and warpensions schemes) or whether the Bill should embody the principleof differentiation by providing an increase of 6s. a week in the singlenational insurance benefit for all persons who were unemployed, sickor pensioners aged less than 70 years and 12s. 6d. a week for thoseaged 70 years or more (with related increases, which would require futher examination, under the industrial injuries and war pensions schemes). On the former hypothesis the National Assistance Boardcould be expected to recommend an increase in the national assistance scale rates of about 4s. (for the single householder). Onthe latter hypothesis it might be desirable for the Bill to providefor the introduction of a differential in the scales of national assistance.Whichever of the two alternatives was adopted, the Committeehad agreed that provision should also be included for the followingpoints:(a) The increases in unemployment, sickness and maternitybenefits ;nder the national insurance scheme, in injury benefit andunemployability supplement and additional treatment allowance should all be paid from the earliest practicable dates, in the first half of March, even though it would not be possible to bring intopayment the increases in other benefits, including retirement pensionsand national assistance, until a few months later.(b) Contributions should not be increased until most of thebenefits had been increased.(c) The abolition of the widowed mothers&apos; earning rule,proposed in a Private Member&apos;s Bill recently introduced byMr. Lipton, M.P., should be resisted. Instead, widowed mothers&apos;earnings up to  6 a week (instead of  5 as at present) should be disregarded in computing their allowances; the allowances in respectof children of widowed mothers should be increased by more thanthe corresponding provision for children of parents receiving umemployment or sickness benefit; and the earnings rule applied in
computing widowed mothers&apos; allowances should be modified in orderthat, in addition to her children&apos;s allowances, the widow should always enjoy some 25s. a week of her own allowance free of the earnings rule.The Minister of Pensions and National Insurance said that,although there were strong arguments in favour of differential ratesof increase in national insurance benefit, such a scheme was opento considerable objection. It would be criticised as discriminatingunfairly against the unemployed and the sick under 70 years of age;it would be more expensive to the Exchequer than a flat-rate increase;the necessary increase in the contribution would be greater; and thedate of effect would be later. There might also be difficulty in introducing a differential in the scales of national assistance. Forthese reasons it would be wiser to adopt a flat-rate increase and to defer a decision on the issue of differential benefit until it had beenthe subject of comprehensive enquiry.In discussion some support was expressed for the view that theincrease in national insurance benefit should be differentiated stage 70. A considerable body of opinion among the Government^supporters in Parliament endorsed the principle of greater selectivityin national insurance and would not regard a further flat-rateincrease as consistent with the fresh and original approach towardsthe national insurance scheme which the Government had indicatedthey would adopt. Moreover, a differentiation at age 70 could bejustified on grounds of social policy. Persons over this age were at a disadvantage in many respects; and the public conscience would recognise that some special steps should be taken to alleviate theirdisabilities.On the other hand the 6s. increase which would be payable tothose aged less than 70 under a differential scheme would be less favourable to the unemployed than the 7s. 6d. a week which theywould receive under the flat-rate scheme. At a time whenunemployment was high it would be difficult to justify thisdiscrimination against the unemployed; -and, while public opinion might accept that those aged over 70 should receive special treatment,it would be widely felt that such treatment should be extended alsoto those who, though less than 70 years of age, were in genuine need of assistance for other reasons. There might well be room for greaterselectivity in the operation of the national insurance scheme; butthe principles on which such selectivity should be based requiredmore careful consideration and it would be unfortunate if, bycommitting themselves prematurely in the forthcoming Bill, theGovernment thereby made it more difficult to introduce at a later date a more considered and appropriate scheme of differentiation.This consideration was the more relevant in that the european economic Community were devoting considerable attention to these issues; and it would be desirable to defer a decision on our ownsystem of differentiation until we knew whether it would need to beharmonised with proposals endorsed by the Community.In further discussion it was suggested that, if the arguments against introducing a differential scheme were accepted as decisive,it might be preferable to adopt a flat-rate increase of 10s. rather than7s. 6d. This would be more costly to the Exchequer; but it mightbe no more expensive than the rates of differential benefit which hadbeen proposed. The increase in the contribution, however, wouldbe greater than under the differential scheme; and it was forconsideration whether the political disadvantage of a substantial increase in the contribution would outweigh the additional increasein the amount of benefit.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of opinion in the Cabinet appeared to favour a flat-rateincrease in the rate of benefit rather than the adoption of a differentialscheme at this juncture. But the decision between an increase of7s. 6d. and an increase of 10s. must depend on an accurate estimate
South Africa(previous reference :C.C. (61) 47thConclusions,Minute 2)ArmsTechnicians(C.C. (61) 36thConclusions.Minute 5)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the chief secretary, Treasury (C. (62) 210), seeking confirmation of the viewunanimously taken in the Strategic Exports Committee that the birmingham Small Arms Company (B.S.A.) should be authorisedto lend the services of certain experienced technicians to the SouthAfrican Government to help in setting up the production of L1A1rifles for the South African Armed Forces.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that it had been decided inNovember 1961 to raise no objection to the sale to South Africaof plant for manufacturing the L1A1 rifle. The South african government and B.S.A. had now enquired whether experiencedtool-setters might be sent to South Africa to assist in startingproduction. In view of the previous decision to allow the manufacturing plant to be exported to South Africa, the strategic exports Committee had concluded that there were no sufficientgrounds for objecting to the loan of the services of B.S.A. employees.To deny the South African Government this measure of assistance would not in practice prevent the production of rifles in South Africa.Nevertheless, in view of the possibility that rifles might be used by the armed forces in repressive racial measures, he had thought it right,after consulting the First Secretary of State, to seek the endorsement of the Cabinet for this view.In discussion it was agreed that no legal powers existed toprevent employees of B.S.A. from going to South Africa if theychose. Nevertheless, it would be desirable to avoid, as far as possible,any explicit expression of approval to the despatch of the technicians;and it should suffice to indicate that the Government saw no reasonto intervene in this case.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that no objection should be raised to the loan of skilled employees of B.S.A. to the South african government for the purpose of assisting in setting upproduction of the L1A1 rifle.(2) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in consultation withthe Secretary of State for War, to approve the terms inwhich the firm should be so informed.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,3rd January, 1963.of the cost involved and of the consequential increase in the contribution in each case.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the forthcoming Bill to increase national insurance rates of benefit should be based on the principleof a flat-rate of increase.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Pensionsand National Insurance, would give further considerationto the question whether the amount of the increase in the single rate of benefit should be 7s. 6d. a week or 10s. aweek.(3) Tnvited the Committee of Ministers, under the chairmanship of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to give furtherconsideration to the method by which the increase shouldbe financed.
