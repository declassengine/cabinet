Security in thePublic ServiceReport of theRadcliffeTribunal(previous reference:C.C. (63) 26thConclusions,Minute 2)I. The Prime Minister said that, in the light of the Report of theTribunal of Inquiry into the Vassall Case and Related Matters, hehad considered whether some alternative form of procedure shouldbe instituted to deal with any similar cases in future. Lord Radcliffe,whose advice he had sought, had suggested the appointment of anindependent Commissioner of Security, authorised to investigate any breach of security on his own initiative and invested with full legalpower to require the production of evidence. The commissioner would report to a Security Committee of the Privy Council, whowould recommend to the Government the action to be taken. Suchan arrangement, however, would require legislation: and there wouldbe liable to be strong objection to a proposal to arm a single individualwith the extensive powers of a tribunal under the Tribunals of Inquiry(Evidence) Act, 1921. It might be preferable, therefore, to consideran alternative arrangement, which would comprise a standingCommittee of Privy Councillors of both Houses together with apermanent Security Commission, consisting of a judicial chairman and two retired public servants from the Civil Service and the armed forces with practical experience of security problems. In the eventof any breach of security, the Government of the day, after any necessary consultation with the Committee of Privy Councillors,would invite the Security Commission to carry out the appropriateinquiry; and. if the Commission proved unable to complete their task without the power to require the production of evidence, theGovernment would need to invite Parliament to pass the necessaryResolutions to invest them, for the purposes of the inquiry in question,with the powers of the 1921 Act. The Committee of Privy Councillorswould be consulted again before the Government reached any decisionon the Commission^ report.In discussion there was general agreement on the advantages ofan arrangement of this kind, which could be instituted without legislation. But further consideration should be given to the possibilityof including an independent representative in the proposed SecurityCommission, possibly in substitution for one of the public servants;and it would in any event be desirable to present the scheme toParliament, after the necessary private consultation with the leader of the Opposition, as a proposal by the Government, the details ofwhich could be the subject of further discussion.The Cabinet (1) Approved, in principle, the introduction of new arrangementsfor the investigation of future breaches of security on thelines indicated by the Prime Minister.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would take an early opportunity to present these arrangements to parliament as a basis for further discussion on this subject.Federation of rhodesia and nyasaland(previous reference:C.C. (63) 25thConclusions,Minute 5)2.   The Cabinet had before them :(i)a letter of 20th April from the Prime Minister of SouthernRhodesia in reply to the letter of 9th April from the first secretary of State (C. (63) 73);(ii) a draft reply to the letter of 20th April (C. (63) 75).The First Secretary of State said that the draft reply, while accepting that there was no necessary connection between the attainment of independence by Southern Rhodesia and the creationof fresh links between the Colony and Northern Rhodesia,re-emphasised that both in fact and in law Southern Rhodesia couldnot become fully independent until the problems involved in the dissolution of the Federation had been satisfactorily resolved. A
conference for this purpose was therefore an indispensable first step towards Southern Rhodesia&apos;s independence; and it was the moreimportant to convince the Government of Southern Rhodesia on thispoint in that the Federal Government themselves had recentlyexpressed concern that, as a result of the increasingly intransigentattitude of Northern Rhodesia, the Federation of Rhodesia and nyasaland would break up in disorder. In order to avert this disaster,the Federal Prime Minister, Sir Roy Welensky, had suggested thatthe United Kingdom Government should give an undertaking that southern Rhodesia would be granted independence simultaneously with the final date agreed for the secession of Northern Rhodesia and nyasaland from the Federation and that the date should be advancedas much as possible. In return for such an undertaking he would himself give public support to a conference of all the Governmentsconcerned to discuss arrangements for bringing the Federation to anend. We should seek to take advantage of this initiative if we wereto avoid the odium which a collapse of the Federation would attractto the United Kingdom Government, although we should avoidconfirming the implied assumption of the Federal Government thatwe might be prepared to consider granting independence to SouthernRhodesia on the secession of the two Protectorates without attachingany conditions as regards amendment of the Colony&apos;s Constitutionon more liberal lines.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The draft might be thought to indicate some weakening ofthe position adopted in the First Secretary of State&apos;s previous letterof 9th April in that it no longer referred to constitutional change as aprecondition of the attainment of independence by Southern Rhodesiabut merely indicated that we should wish to discuss the possibilityof such change &quot; before independence was granted &quot;.(b) On the other hand, the draft also recognised that, in the lightof the accepted convention on this issue, it would not be right for theUnited Kingdom Government to enact changes in the 1961Constitution of the Colony, which conferred wide powers of amendment on the Government and Parliament of Southern Rhodesia.Since we had no effective power to impose constitutional change, itwould be unwise to base the reply on any other assumption.(c) Moreover, our immediate and overriding objective must beto persuade the Government of Southern Rhodesia, if possible, toattend a conference to provide for the orderly dissolution of theFederation. Whether or not it thereafter proved possible to induce them to consider the possibility of constitutional change in connectionwith their attainment of independence, we should at least have avoideda collapse of the Federation and should be able to consider theproblem of Southern Rhodesia in relative isolation. It would bedesirable, therefore, that, in referring to our desire to discuss thepossibility of constitutional change, we should avoid too specific a reference to the connection between such discussions and the grantof independence to the Colony.The Cabinet (1) Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange for the despatchof a further letter to the Prime Minister of SouthernRhodesia on the basis of the draft attached to C. (63) 75,as amended in their discussion.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State to inform the PrimeMinister of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasalandof the terms of this letter and to provide him, subject tothe agreement of the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia,with a copy of the text.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,30th April, 1963.
