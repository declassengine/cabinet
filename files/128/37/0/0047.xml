2. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that thenegotiations in Moscow between representatives of the Governmentsof the United States, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Unionabout nuclear tests appeared to be developing favourably; and the drafting of a Treaty, prohibiting tests in the atmosphere, in outerspace and under water, was now in hand. The Soviet representatives had refused to entertain any suggestion that this prohibition should extend to nuclear tests conducted underground; and they appeareddisposed to seek to link it in some way with a non-aggressionagreement between the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the member States of the Warsaw Pact. In so far as any agreement ofthis kind might be regarded as implying Western recognition of theEast German Republic, it could be embarrassing. Nevertheless, itwas satisfactory that there were now prospects of an understanding,even if only on a limited scale, between the West and the Soviet blocon the issue of nuclear tests; and this might prove to be the first stage in a gradual relaxation of tension, with far-reaching implicationswhich the Cabinet might need to consider in due course.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Agriculture (C. (63) 127) about future policy for horticulture.The Minister of Agriculture said that at present the horticultureindustry depended on tariff protection. In the case of about half the products of the industry the tariffs were fairly low; but in the caseof the &quot; sensitive &quot; items, involving mainly produce grown underglass, the tariffs could rise to very high levels during the seasonalpeaks. This rigid system of protection was inconsistent with our general policy for the liberalisation of international trade and presented particular difficulties in the context of the forthcoming negotiations in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT),in which we should be seeking, by a process of bargaining, to securereductions in industrial tariffs. He therefore proposed that we should offer to make reductions in the tariffs on non-sensitive horticulturalitems in the immediate future, if it appeared to be in the national interest to do so; that we should put ourselves in a position to bindthe tariffs on sensitive items at their present levels, on theunderstanding that, after a specified period, we should also offer toreduce them; that, in the interim, measures should be taken,particularly by an extension of the Horticulture ImprovementScheme and by the provision of various forms of financial assistanceto the industry, to enable it to face foreign competition; and that theindustry should be assured that it would be provided with some new type of safeguard against the increasing competition of surplusesa 21. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that the united nations Organisation had now initiated an investigation into the allegations that the Republican forces in the Yemen were usingpoison gas or some similar agent of chemical warfare. Theseallegations had evoked considerable criticism in this country; butthe Government should refrain from any public comment until theUnited Nations investigation was complete.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.
from other countries which it would face as the protection of thetariff was progressively reduced. On this basis there was a reasonableexpectation that the Government could secure the co-operation ofthe industry; and it would be possible to announce a new policy for horticulture later in the year.In discussion the following points were made:(a) Action on the lines proposed would be likely to provoke a sharp reaction from individual growers, particularly those concernedwith sensitive items. On the other hand economic issues of greater importance would be at stake in the GATT negotiations; and the chances of a successful outcome to those negotiations should not be prejudiced by the sectional interest of one relatively small industry,particularly since the tariffs on sensitive items would not be reduceduntil the measures to strengthen the industry had had time to take effect.(b) In view of the international repercussions of any changes inhorticultural tariffs, it would be necessary to arrange for our proposals to be discussed at the appropriate stage with the othermembers of the Commonwealth concerned and for special consideration to be given to the position of Guernsey, whose economy was largely dependent on horticultural produce.(c) Legislation would be required to give effect to the proposals.It would be convenient to introduce this, if possible, as part of the wider measure dealing with agricultural policy which would beintroduced at the beginning of the next session of Parliament.(d) Particular attention should be given to the machinery required to provide future protection against the undermining ofthe domestic market by surpluses from foreign countries. Theindustry would certainly expect to be given specific assurances onthis point; and there would be likely to be considerable difficulty indrawing up a satisfactory scheme for this purpose.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Agriculture to continue discussions with representatives of the horticulturalindustry on the lines indicated in C. (63) 127.(2) Authorised the Minister of Agriculture to arrange forthwithfor the preparation of a draft Bill giving effect to theproposals in C. (63) 127.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.4. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.5. The First Secretary of State informed the Cabinet that the ruler of Barotseland was seeking our agreement to the establishmentof the Territory as a separate State. We were bound to oppose aseparatist development of this kind; but, in view of the Territory&apos;slong tradition of loyalty to the Crown, we should seek, in negotiatingthe new Constitution for Northern Rhodesia, to ensure that it wouldhenceforward enjoy some kind of semi-autonomous status withinthe Protectorate.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement by the first secretary of State.
House ofLordsReformPeerage Bill(previous reference:C.C. (63) 45thConclusions,Minute 4)Expenses ofMembers of(previous reference:C.C. (63) 35thConclusions.Minute 3)7. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that, at their meeting on 28th May (C.C. (63) 35th Conclusions, Minute 3), theCabinet had endorsed, subject to agreement with the Opposition, aproposal that the railway fares of wives of Members of the Houseof Commons should be paid on a limited number of journeysbetween a Member&apos;s home, his constituency and London and had suggested that a corresponding concession should be made to thewives of peers in relation to journeys between home and London.3781-1a 36. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (C. (63) 131), examining thesituation created by an amendment to the Peerage Bill in the Houseof Lords, which would bring the Bill into operation when it receivedthe Royal Assent rather than on the dissolution of Parliament.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that, althoughthe Government had throughout intended that the Bill should comeinto force only on the dissolution of Parliament, they had been defeated on this issue in the House of Lords and opinion among their supporters in the House of Commons now appeared to be moving towards accepting the amendment in order to avoid the risk of a conflict between the two Houses. The effect might be somewhatmitigated if the Government accepted, in the House of Lords, afurther amendment, proposed by Lord Swinton, which would extend to 12 months the period during which a peer who succeeded beforethe Bill came into effect could disclaim his peerage.In discussion there was general agreement with this view. A thirdamendment, however, had now been tabled in the House of Lords,which would concede to a peer who succeeded while a minor a periodof four years from the attainment of his majority in which to disclaimthe peerage, instead of only one year as at present proposed, on theground that an individual of only 21 might not be able to decide whether he wished to pursue a political career in the House ofCommons. This amendment might be carried; and it might bedesirable to avoid a further defeat by accepting it. On the other hand the proposal had been originally rejected by the Select Committee onthe Reform of the House of Lords; and it might be inexpedient to contemplate more than the minimum degree of departure from therecommendations of that Committee, especially since they had been endorsed without amendment by the House of Commons. The LordChancellor should therefore be free to exercise his discretion in deciding whether or not to accept the amendment, in the light of thesupport which it received.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Government should not advise the Houseof Commons to reject the amendment to the Peerage Billby the House of Lords, which would bring the Bill intooperation when it received the Royal Assent.(2) Agreed that the Government should accept an amendment to the Bill in the House of Lords which would extend to12 months the period during which a peer who succeededbefore the Bill came into effect could disclaim his peerage.(3) Invited the Lord Chancellor to decide, in the light of theviews expressed during the debate, whether theGovernment should accept a further amendment in theHouse of Lords, which would concede to a peer whosucceeded while a minor a period of four years from the attainment of his majority in which to disclaim thepeerage.
GovernmentExpenditureEstimatesfor 1964-65(previous reference:C.C. (62) 4thConclusions,Minute 2)8. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the chief secretary, Treasury, and the Minister without Portfolio (C. (63) 125and 129 respectively) about the forecast Estimates for 1964-65.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that, on the basis of present policies, the Estimates for 1964-65 appeared likely to amount to approximately  6,725 million, an increase of about  585 million, or -\ per cent, over the Estimates presented for 1963-64. The latter had themselves represented the largest annual increase in public expenditure since the Korean war; and the further increase implied by the forward Estimates for 1964-65 would equal, if not exceed, thisexceptionally fast rate of growth. In the current year it had beenpossible for the Government to justify an increase of more than9 per cent by reference to the need to stimulate the economy in the exceptional circumstances which had existed at the beginning of 1963.It was now virtually certain, however, that a further stimulus of this magnitude would not be required in 1964 and that, if public expenditure were allowed to continue to rise as rapidly as hitherto,the economy would be in danger of entering a new phase ofinflationary pressure unless the 1964 Budget introduced freshmeasures of restriction. Substantial increases in expenditure in1964-65 were now inevitable in any event; but it was essential tomaintain control over the rate at which they accrued and, for thispurpose, action would be required:(i) to establish clear decisions on priorities both betweendefence and the social services and between the individualsocial services themselves;(ii) to achieve specific economies wherever possible;(iii) to restrain Departments from undertaking new commit-ments unless they were prepared to reduce others in orderto accommodate them.The Minister without Portfolio suggested that it might be politically difficult for the Government to endorse these measureswithout reservation. If, however, they were not to appear to be the victims of circumstances beyond their control, they should take stepsto justify the present trend of public expenditure on positive lines. Aforthcoming series of publications on the requirements of an expanding economy could be used to emphasise that a controlledincrease in the rate of Government expenditure was an inescapableconsequence of a policy of economic growth.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) Progressive increases in Departmental expenditures,particularly in relation to higher education and the redevelopmentof school buildings, were probably inevitable; and the effect would it had now been established, however, that the advantages ofsuch a concession in the case of the wives of peers would be largelynullified by the tax liability which it would entail. On the other hand to exclude journeys from home to London in the case of wives ofMembers of the House of Commons would detract considerably from the merit of the original proposal. Moreover, this modificationwould involve reopening the discussions with the Opposition. on balance, therefore, it would be expedient to take no further action inthis matter.The Cabinet Agreed that no further action should be taken as regardsthe proposal to provide for the payment of the railwayfares of wives of Members of the House of Commons on alimited number of journeys between a Member&apos;s home, his constituency and London.
ChalgroveAirfield(previous reference:C.C. (63) 45thConclusions,Minute 7)9. The Cabinet had before them two memoranda by the HomeSecretary, as Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee (C. (63) 116and 130), on the disposal of Chalgrove airfield.The Home Secretary said that the Committee had been unableto agree whether the sale of Chalgrove airfield to the Martin BakerAircraft Company, which had been suspended owing to opposition from local residents, should be allowed to proceed or whether anattempt should be made to negotiate a lease. The airfield had been built on land acquired during the 1939-45 war and had been usedsince 1946 by the Martin Baker Company for testing aircraft ejectorseats, of which they were the sole manufacturers in this country. In1959 it had been decided to sell the land to the company.Consultation with former owners had indicated that only one wasC.C. 47 (63)be aggravated if, as appeared probable, some transfer of expenditure from the rates to the Exchequer proved to be desirable.(b) Nevertheless, it would be difficult to establish firm prioritiesas between blocks of expenditure which were incommensurable,particularly since their impact on the Budget did not necessarilycorrespond to the demands which they made on real resources. this issue would require further consideration in relation to the Cabinet&apos;forthcoming examination of rates of growth of public expenditurein the longer term.(c) Moreover, it was politically unrealistic to suggest that theGovernment should refrain henceforward from announcing further developments in their social policies or to seek to stipulate that no new commitments should be undertaken unless correspondingsavings could be effected in existing expenditures. departments should be enjoined to do their utmost to provide compensatingeconomies; but in certain cases it might be essential to sanction new projects, even if their cost could not be wholly offset by savings in existing policies. This would be liable to be particularly true of items which already figured in Departmental forward programmes andwould progressively become due for implementation.(d) On the other hand many of the Governments supporterswere becoming increasingly critical of the sharp rise in public expenditure; and the Government v/ould be unwise to commit themselves to any statement which implied that such expenditure would continue to absorb an increasingly large proportion of thenational income.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Chief Secretary, Treasury, would shortlycirculate a memorandum on rates of growth of public expenditure in the longer term.(2) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in preparing thismemorandum, to give further consideration both to themeans by which the Government should seek to establishpriorities between various blocks of expenditure and tothe extent to which it would be realistic to requireDepartments to undertake no new commitments unlesscompensating savings could be secured in existingexpenditures.(3) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in consultation withthe Minister without Portfolio, to examine the means bywhich the prospective increase in public expenditure would be most convincingly presented to public opinion.(4) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.
anxious to repurchase her land, the others either being disinterestedor being content with assurances that the agricultural occupancieswould continue. Local residents, however, had been opposed to asale to the company and had urged that the land should either bereturned to agricultural use or be leased to the company on a shortlease. Ministerial undertakings had then been given that the company would offer the land back to the former owners when they ceased touse it for testing ejector seats. Unfortunately, however, these assurances went beyond the written undertaking obtained from thecompany, which had been merely to offer the land back to theformer owners when the company decided to dispose of it. the discovery of the indefinite character of this undertaking, as a resultof the publication of the exchange of letters annexed to C. (63) 116,had intensified the local opposition to a sale of the land to thecompany. Negotiations had therefore been suspended in the spring of 1963. Since then, however, the Air Ministry had obtained fromMr. Martin, who controlled the company, an undertaking in theterms of the assurances originally given by Ministers, namely thatthe land would be offered back to the former owners when thecompany ceased to use it for testing ejector seats.The Home Affairs Committee had found difficulty in deciding whether, in order to ensure that this undertaking would be honoured,the Government should retain control of the land. Since his originalmemorandum (C. (63) 116) had been circulated, however, theCommittee had been informed that, if the land were sold to thecompany, it would be possible to require the company, as a conditionof the sale, to enter into a covenant not to use the land for industrial purposes or otherwise than for the testing of ejector equipment andto offer it to the former owners when the company ceased to use it for this purpose. Such a covenant could be enforced in relation tothe use of the land; and, although there might be some difficulty in enforcing it in relation to the disposal of the land, it would be legally binding on the company and would demonstrate that the Governmenthad taken all reasonable steps to safeguard the interests of the former owners. The covenant would not, however, be binding on any othercompany which might acquire the Martin Baker Company.A majority of the Home Affairs Committee considered that, ifthe company would enter into such a covenant, the sale should proceed, on the grounds that the Government were committed tosell the land, that the company&apos;s work was in the national interestand that, if the Government retracted their original undertaking tosell the land to the company, the criticism which this action wouldevoke from industry would be liable to be no less damaging than the criticism which would otherwise be voiced by the local residents. a minority of the Committee, however, considered that a lease wouldbe a preferable solution; but they agreed that, if this were rejected bythe company, the land should be sold, subject to the company&apos;acceptance of the covenant.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The protection given by the proposed covenant would belimited, since it could not be enforced by the local residents andwould bind only the existing company. If the company were acquired by other interests on Mr. Martin&apos;s death, the purchasers could avoid the obligations by transferring the assets to a different company.The trade name and good will of the Martin Baker Company,however, were themselves a considerable asset, which a newproprietor would be unlikely to sacrifice merely in order to evadethe covenant.(b) On the other hand it was not clear why, if Mr. Martinintended to implement his undertakings, he attached such importanceto owning the freehold of the land. It might be possible to persuade him to accept a long lease, which would afford him virtuallyequivalent security of tenure but would also enable the Government,if necessary, to enforce the relevant undertakings.
WelfareServicesSchool Meals(previous reference:C.C. (63) 44thConclusions,Minute 7)10. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the proposal toincrease the charge for school meals from Is. to Is. 3d. with effect from 30th September. They had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Education and the Secretary of State for Scotland(C. (63) 126) on the arrangements for remitting the charge to needyfamilies.The Minister of Education said that at present local educationauthorities in England and Wales were required to exercise their power to remit or to reduce charges according to a scale which he approved. One hundred of these local scales provided, in addition,for remission at the discretion of the authority in cases of hardshipnot otherwise covered by the scale. In order to remove the disparitiesbetween local scales he proposed to introduce in the autumn a uniform model scale of remission, binding on local authorities, whichwould concede free school meals automatically to the children of families on National Assistance and would help large families with low incomes by raising the level of income which qualified them forremission proportionately with the number of children in the family.Since it was likely that most of the additional families entitled to free meals under the new scale would already be protected by theapplication of the existing local discretion, there would be littleincrease in cost. The local education authorities had no objection tothe proposed model scale, which should effectively disarm any criticism of the proposed increase in the charge for school meals.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that in Scotland a modelscheme, based on the National Assistance (Determination of Need)Regulations, was already in force. Local authorities were requirednot only to remit charges in case of hardship but also to reduce themfor families with more than one child at school and for families onlymarginally above hardship level. About half the authorities used the model scheme; four, including Glasgow, operated more generousarrangements. The Scottish schemes afforded adequate protection toneedy and large families; and any attempt to revise them would be resisted, particularly by Glasgow. There was therefore no means of(c) On this assumption, however, it would be essential thatMr. Martin should not suppose that the Government would beprepared to contemplate a sale as an alternative to a lease. But if hethen implemented his threat to reject a lease and to ceasemanufacturing ejector seats, both our defence and our exportinterests would be damaged; and the Government would be exposed to severe criticism from industry.The First Secretary of State, summing up the discussion, saidthat the balance of advantage seemed to lie in offering Mr. Martin along lease, subject to appropriate conditions about the use of theland and its ultimate disposal. Initially, we should offer a 99-yearlease; but it might become necessary to contemplate a considerablylonger period. The terms of a draft lease should be carefully considered by the Treasury Solicitor before any approach was madeto Mr. Martin.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Air, to discuss with Mr. Martin an offer to lease Chalgrove airfield to the Martin BakerAircraft Company for 99 years, subject to conditionsrestricting the use of the land to the testing of ejectorequipment and ensuring that the former owners would begiven the option to purchase it when its use for this purposeceased.
offsetting in Scotland the impact of the proposed increase in thecharge for school meals; and, in the light of the high level of Scottishunemployment, it would be unwise to impose the increase at thepresent time.In discussion it was suggested that, in view of the continuingincrease in public expenditure, it was essential that justifiableeconomies should be made wherever possible. The proposed nationalremission scale in England and Wales and the existing arrangements in Scotland appeared to be adequate to protect the families of theunemployed and others with low incomes; and there was reason tobelieve that public opinion would accept an increase in the chargedesigned to cover the increase in costs which had occurred since thearrangement was last reviewed in 1957. On the other hand theestimated net saving was small in relation to the total expenditureon education; and the political criticism which an increase in thecharge might attract would be out of proportion to the advantage tobe gained.The First Secretary of State, summing up the discussion, saidthat the issues involved would best be considered further in the context of the discussion of future public expenditure which theCabinet would shortly resume.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of C. (63) 126 at a subsequent meeting.11. The Minister of Transport said that a joint Anglo-Frenchreport by officials on the merits of a Channel tunnel and a Channelbridge had now been submitted to the Governments of the UnitedKingdom and France. There would be advantage in promotinginformed public discussion of the issues involved; and this would be stimulated by early publication of the report, provided that theGovernment indicated that they had reached no decision on itsfindings.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Transport to seek to secure theagreement of the French Government to the early publication of the Anglo-French report on a Channeltunnel and a Channel bridge.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,18th July, 1963.ChannelTunnel(previous reference:C.C.
