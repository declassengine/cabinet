But although he had initially indicated that he wouldbe prepared to make a fresh attempt to reach agreement with theCentral Government, he had subsequently renewed his threat to resort, if necessary, to a policy of guerilla warfare. The local representatives of the United Nations had retaliated by putting him under house arrest: but he had now escaped and his intentions wereuncertain. If he fulfilled his threats to destroy the mining installations in Katanga, he would inflict very severe damage on the economy ofthe Congo as a whole.In discussion it was generally agreed that we should continueto refrain from intervening in the increasingly confused situation inthe Congo. Mr. Tshombe enjoyed some support in this country,particularly among a section of the Governmenfs supporters in theHouse of Commons who were apt to regard him as a symbol ofpatriotic resistance to an untimely attempt by the United Nations toimpose a solution by force. Nevertheless, he had behaved with increasing duplicity; and it did not lie with us to seek to find asolution for a situation which was the result of ill-judged action by both Mr. Tshombe and the United Nations. We had done our best to promote a reconciliation between them; it was their faultthat we had failed; and we now had no alternative but to await the outcome of events.The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that it now appeared likely that we should resume diplomatic relations with theGovernment of Saudi Arabia during the following week. TheGovernment of Saudi Arabia had attached no conditions to their agreement, either as regards the Buraimi oasis or in any otherrespect.The Foreign Secretary said that there were indications that the indonesian Government were considering some form of intervention in the Portuguese colony of Timor. They might also be contemplatingaction on the Borneo border, over which they were earring out aerialreconnaissance. It would be necessary to keep developments under close review and to consider what policy we should adopt if the threat in either area became more substantial.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements by the Foreign Secretary andof the points made in discussion.Federation of rhodesia and nyasaland(previous reference:C.C. (62) 75thConclusions,Minute 5)3. The First Secretary of State informed the Cabinet that hewould shortly circulate for their consideration the draft of a white paper, rebutting the allegations by the Federal Prime Minister,Sir Roy Welensky, that the Governmenfs policy towards theFederation constituted a breach of certain pledges given to theFederal Government when it was first constituted in 1953.   He1. The First Secretary of State tendered to the Prime minister the Cabinet&apos;s warm congratulations on the sixth anniversary of hisaccession to office and assured him of the Cabinet&apos;s continuedsupport.The Prime Minister expressed his gratitude for the Cabinefsgood wishes and his appreciation of the help and encouragementwhich he derived from their collective counsel.
would welcome the Cabinefs endorsement of this White paper before he paid his forthcoming visit to the Central African territories;but there would be advantage in resisting Parliamentary pressure for its publication until he returned from that visit and there hadbeen an opportunity to reconsider the text in the light of his consultations with the other -Governments concerned.The Cabinet Took note with approval of this statement by the first secretary of State.Pensions andNationalInsurance(previous reference:C.C. (63) 1stConclusions,Minute 2)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Pensions and National Insurance (C. (63) 2) comparing the cost and the effect on contributions of raising the single rate ofnational insurance benefit by 7s. 6d. and by 10s. respectively.The Minister of Pensions said that an increase in the single rateof benefit by 10s. would not only make a greater impact on publicopinion than an increase of 7s. 6d. but would restore the relationship between rates of benefit and average earnings to that which obtained in 1946 and should also avoid the need for any further increase in rates of benefit during the present Parliament. The additionalweekly payment by employees contributing to the flat-rate scheme would be Is. Id., i.e.. 4d. more than would be required for a 7s. 6d.increase; but in the case of almost all contributors to the flat-ratescheme this would be less than the proportionate increase in their earnings in the relevant period. On a strictly proportionate basis a self-employed man would be called upon to contribute an additional2s. 2d. a week; but this increase could be limited in practice to 2s.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the ministerial committee on Pensions and National Insurance under his chairman-ship favoured an increase of 10s. in the single rate of benefit.This would, however, be generous in relation to the movement of earnings (which, on a strict computation, would not require anincrease of much more than 5s.); and this feature of the proposals should be emphasised when they were announced. He also agreedthat the self-employed contribution should be raised by no morethan 2s.; but the question whether the increase in the national assistance scale rate should be 5s. or, as had been suggested, 6s.needed further examination. The latter figure would cost theExchequer an additional  6 million a year; and account must betaken of complex considerations about the proper relationship between insurance benefits and assistance rates and about the extentto which an increase in the scale rate would involve additional indirectburdens on the Exchequer.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The Ministerial Committee had recommended that theupper limit of earnings for the graduated pensions scheme shouldbe extended from  15 to  18 per week. This extension of the rangewould complicate the administration of the graduated scheme inthe case of certain classes of individuals who had contracted out ofit; and it would entail an increase in contribution of up to 3s. 8d. aweek, which would be liable to be regarded as an unreasonablyheavy additional burden. On balance, however, the increase couldbe defended as enabling larger benefits to be paid under the graduated scheme and as maintaining the present degree ofsubvention from graduated scheme contributions to benefits underthe flat-rate scheme. Moreover, an increase of 3s. 8d. would be lessdisadvantageous than the alternative course of requiring, flat-ratecontributors to pay a further 7d. in addition to the Is. Id. already-envisaged.
Population and 5.   The Prime Minister informed the  Cabinet that,  afterEmployment careful consideration, he had decided that, in the light of the level(C.C. (62) 73rd of unemployment in North-East England, it would be appropriateConclusions, that the interests of the area should be represented in the cabinet minute 8) by a Minister charged to make a comprehensive review of the localNorth-East situation and to prepare plans for the re-development of the areaEngland as a whole.   He had invited the Lord President of the Council toaccept this assignment.In discussion the Cabinet endorsed the action taken by thePrime Minister and extended to the Lord President of the Counciltheir good wishes and the assurance of their support in his difficult and important task.In further discussion the Cabinet were informed that, partly as a result of the severe weather, the number of personsunemployed (which would be published in the near future) mightshow an unusually sharp increase. If so, the peak of unemployment would probably occur in January rather than in February; but itmight still remain below the critical figure of 3 per cent.Europe 6.   The Lord Privy Seal said that Ministerial discussions onCommon the terms of the United Kingdom&apos;s entry into the european market Economic Community would be resumed in Brussels on Monday,Negotiations 14th January.   There had recently been a marked change in the(Previous atmosphere of the negotiations; and the member countries of the reference: Community, with the exception of France, were again earnestlyC.C. (62) 73rd seeking to reach a settlement on terms acceptable to the united conclusions, Kingdom.  It would therefore be to our advantage to try to maintainMinute 9) the momentum of the discussions and to enlist the support of the member countries other than France.   In order to achieve this itC.C. 3 (63)(b) It would be desirable to synchronise (at 27th May) paymentof increased retirement pensions, war pensions and national assistance. The national assistance increase, however, would not be announced until after the Bill to deal with national insurance hadbeen introduced; and it was therefore unnecessary to decideimmediately whether scale rates should be increased by 5s. or 6s.(c) Further consideration should be given to the suggestion thatthe Government should publicly undertake to review the national insurance scheme as a whole. Such a review might do more harm than good.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Bill to increase national insurance and related benefit rates should be based on an increase of10s. in the single rate of benefit.(2) Agreed that the increase in contributions from a man whowas self-employed should be limited to 2s.(3) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would arrange for the Ministerial Committee on Pensions and national Insurance:(i) to consider whether the related increase in the national assistance scale rate should be 5s. or 6s.;(ii) to consider whether it would be expedient to promote a comprehensive review of the existing national insurance scheme.
would be necessary to demonstrate to them our own determination to reach agreement, if possible; to preserve flexibility in negotiation;and to avoid a situation in which major decisions were allowed to emerge piecemeal. Concessions would have to be made by both parties; and the final settlement should be presented, and judged,as a whole.The following were the more important points on which final decisions had still to be taken:(i) Tariffs. This issue was now of major interest only to theCommonwealth. We should not allow the reasonable nature of thesolutions now in sight to be obscured by the publicity which would undoubtedly be given to the differences between the final terms andthose which we had originally put forward.(ii) Commonwealth temperate foodstuffs. The special positionof New Zealand had been recognised, subject to reservations on thepart of the French Government; and, although no practical proposalsfor this purpose had yet been put forward, there were grounds forhoping that a reasonable settlement could be reached.(iii) Domestic agriculture. The special committee under thechairmanship of the Vice-President of the European Commission,Dr. Mansholt, had prepared the way for a possible solution byidentifying five major outstanding problems the extent and timing of changes in agricultural price levels in the United Kingdom as aresult of our accession to the Community; the upper and lower limits of the prices to be fixed by the Community for wheat; the length ofthe transitional period; the effectiveness of the arrangements forintervention in the event of the disruption of a particular commoditymarket; and the arrangements for horticulture.Other matters which would also need to be settled and mightbe the subject of hard negotiation included the voting arrangements in the enlarged Community; agreements to cover the position of hong Kong and Central Africa; and the provisions of the FinancialRegulation. The difficulty of safeguarding the position of the neutral countries who were members of the European Free Trade Areamight be overcome if they accepted a suggestion that they shouldrely on those of their present partners who intended to accede to theCommunity to safeguard neutral interests after accession.The Minister of Agriculture said that the committee underDr. Mansholt, by compelling the French Government to deploytheir views in detail, had demonstrated the formidable difficulties with which we should be confronted if we were required to adaptto the practice of the Community, at short notice, our ownfundamentally different system of agricultural price support. the implications of such a change in terms of wheat would be to increasethe United Kingdom market price by  11- 12 a ton and the price to producers by about  5 a ton. Changes of the same order of magnitude would be involved for other commodities. It wastherefore essential that the transition from our present system to eventual harmonisation with the policies of the Community shouldbe carried out gradually and that the transitional period should be suffiently long to enable us to effect the necessary adjustment inthe balance of our agricultural industry with the minimum ofdislocation. In addition, the method of transition should be consistent with the maintenance of the provisions of the 1957Agriculture Act; firm long-term assurances should be obtained for livestock producers; and satisfactory arrangements should be madefor horticulture.If concessions on our part were required, we might considerreducing the transitional period, provided that we were satisfied thatthe arrangements to be made during that period were adequate forour purposes. In any event, however, it would be important inrelation to Parliamentary and public opinion in this country to
Cabinet Office, S.W. I,10th January, 1963.avoid premature disclosure of agreement on individual agriculturalitems, in order that the agricultural provisions of the final settlement should eventually be seen in relation to the rest of that settlement as a whole.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The First Secretary of State emphasised the importance of reaching a satisfactory agreement on the upper and lower price limits for wheat. Current United Kingdom prices were well below eventhe lowest price now ruling in the Community; and the effect on public opinion if our accession to the Community resulted in a large and immediate increase in the price of wheat in this country and inconsequent over-production would be liable to be very serious. Weshould also seek to avoid any arrangements under which it could beheld that increased prices in the United Kingdom were being usedto subsidise agricultural imports into this country from theCommunity or from third countries. Such a situation would be politically embarrassing.The Lord Privy Seal said that, for internal political reasons, itwould be difficult for the Federal German Government to accept afurther reduction in the lowest Community price for wheat on theUnited Kingdom&apos;s entry into the Community; but a solution mightbe found by recognising informally an extension of the present pricerange on the understanding that during the transitional period theUnited Kingdom would gradually raise its prices to the rulingCommunity levels. In any event this important issue should notbe considered in isolation; and its eventual solution would be liableto be affected by other factors, including the operation of commodity agreements, the effect of which would not become evident for someyears.(b) The Commonwealth Secretary said that it would be difficultto reconcile existing price levels in the Community with the assurances which we had been given by the Community in the summer of 1962 and had ourselves elaborated to commonwealth governments. The essence of those assurances had been that theCommunity would pursue a price policy which would offerreasonable opportunities in its markets for exports of temperateagricultural products. It could not be maintained that at presentprice levels those opportunities would exist; and in default of some change in the Community&apos;s policy it might be necessary to re-opendiscussion on questions of major principle which were now regardedas having been settled.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of these statements and of the points made intheir discussion.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange for theexposition of the United Kingdom case during theforthcoming discussions in Brussels to be considered in greater detail by the Common Market NegotiationsCommittee.
