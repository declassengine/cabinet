ForeignAffairsIndonesia(previous reference:C.C. (63) 54thConclusions,Minute 2)1. The Foreign Secretary said that there were some indications that the Government of Indonesia might now be prepared to begin the process of re-establishing better relations with us. In particular,it seemed probable that they would conclude a reasonable agreementwith the oil companies operating in Indonesia. On the other hand the position of local United Kingdom firms was still unsure; and it remained to be seen how far the supervisors installed by the indonesian Government, ostensibly in order to secure continuity ofproduction, would in fact attempt to take over the functions of management. We must continue for a time to wait upon developments;and in the interim Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador should remain at hispost.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.NorthAtlanticTreatyOrganisationThe multilateral force(previous reference:C.C. (63) 56thConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Minister of Defence referred to the offer by the FrenchGovernment on the previous day to co-operate with the UnitedKingdom Government in the creation of a European nuclear force.The terms of this proposal were obscure; but we should be preparedto examine it carefully.In discussion it was suggested that the purpose of the offer mightbe to attempt to delay and confuse discussion of the United states proposal for the establishment of a multilateral nuclear force and perhaps to manoeuvre the United Kingdom into a position in whichwe could once again be represented as faced, in effect, with a choice between Europe and the United States. In examining the project weshould bear in mind this possible implication.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Minister of Defence.RhodesiaandNyasaland(previous reference:C.C. (63) 55thConclusions,Minute 1)3. The First Secretary of State said that he had consulted theColonial Secretary on the proposal by the Prime Minister of nyasaland, Dr. Banda, that the Territory should maintain aMonarchical form of government for a period after attainingindependence in July 1964. The Colonial Secretary had agreed that,without prejudice to the decision on the same issue in the case of kenya, such an arrangement might be appropriate in Nyasaland.The Governor of Northern Rhodesia had also advocated a period ofMonarchical rule in that Territory when it attained independence indue course, on the ground that this would exert a stabilising influence in public affairs and would help to sustain confidence. For these reasons it might be appropriate to concede Dr. Banda&apos;s request.In the discussions on the composition of the Legislature ofNorthern Rhodesia under the Territory&apos;s new Constitution the african representatives had been unwilling to agree that the number of seatsreserved for Europeans should be higher than 10 out of a total of 75,a figure which the Europeans considered inadequate. He proposed to try to secure 12 to 15 seats for the Europeans; but it might be necessaryto compromise on 10 seats in order to reach agreement.In discussion there was general agreement with these views.
Commercial 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisterPolicy of state, Board of Trade (C. (63) 162), about the export of buses to export of Cuba, together with a memorandum by the President of the BoardBuses to Cuba   0f Trade (C. (63) 164) summarising the outstanding liabilities of theExport Credits Guarantee Department (E.C.G.D.) in relation to various oversea markets.The President of the Board of Trade said that Messrs. LeylandsLimited had applied to E.C.G.D. for cover for the supply of 450 busesto Cuba on five-year credit terms. The value of the order was  3-million. The United States Government would be liable, for political reasons, to oppose this transaction; but it was evident from C. (63) 164that there was no economic reason why we should treat Cuba lessfavourably in terms of credit guarantee than various other countries.Her balance of payments prospects were no worse than those of countries in respect of which we allowed a degree of cover; and her annual earnings of convertible currency, estimated at about 65 million, were substantial in relation both to the instalments whichwould be due under the contract now in question and to her tradingdebts on which repayments were being made. Moreover, there waskeen foreign competition for the present order; and, if we insisted oncash terms, Leylands would be liable to lose the contract.The Foreign Secretary said there were now indications that someof the foreign Governments concerned would not be prepared to givecover for the credit involved; and to this extent the competition was likely to be less severe. Moreover, the United States Governmentwould probably be strongly opposed to our extending credit to Cuba;and, although they had been prepared to acquiesce in the maintenanceof a reasonable degree of trade between Cuba and the UnitedKingdom, the present proposal might provoke them to adopt a lessco-operative attitude at a time when we were particularly dependentupon their support and assistance for the protection of our interestsin Indonesia. For these reasons it would be preferable that the contractnow at issue should be financed on cash terms.In discussion it was emphasised that the facilities provided byE.C.G.D. were based on commercial criteria and should not beregarded as equivalent to a Government subsidy. On this basis we did not discriminate against Communist countries; and we providednormal credit cover for trade with most countries of the Sino-soviet bloc. It would be inconsistent to import a different principle into our trade with Cuba. Nevertheless, if the United States Governmentwould be disposed to regard the provision of E.C.G.D. cover in thepresent case as tantamount to a subsidy by the United KingdomGovernment to trade with Cuba, it might be possible to meet their objections to some extent by presenting the transaction as based noton credit but on a series of periodical cash payments, the arrangementbeing guaranteed by E.C.G.D.(1) Agreed that the Monarchical form of government should beretained in Nyasaland for a period after the Territoryattained independence in July 1964.(2) Took note that, in further discussions on the composition ofthe Legislature of Northern Rhodesia, the First Secretaryof State would attempt to secure the reservation of 12 to15 seats for the European community but would beprepared to reach agreement, if necessary, on the basisof 10 seats of this kind.
0 iInternationalMonetary Fund(previous reference:C.C. (63) 32ndConclusions,Minute 3)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (63) 161) about the forthcomingmeetings in Washington of the International Monetary Fund and theInternational Bank.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that at the 1962 meetingof the Fund he had put forward certain proposals for the creation ofa Mutual Currency Account as an additional source of internationalliquidity in order to sustain the growth of world trade. These proposals had not been well received at that juncture. Recently, however,opinion both in the United States and in Europe appeared to have changed, mainly as a result of an increasing realisation not only thatan increase in currency reserves would be required to finance an expansion of international trade but also that, if the United StatesGovernment succeeded in reducing or eliminating the current deficit on their balance of payments, the cash reserves available to the restof the world would be proportionately reduced. At the forthcoming discussions, therefore, he intended to support the proposal that thereshould be a full review of the whole problem of international liquidityand its possible solutions. Our own suggestion for a Mutual CurrencyAccount would remain as one of the solutions to be examined; butthe other members of the Fund would also wish to consider the adaptation or enlargement of existing multilateral arrangementsthrough the Fund, in particular an increase in the Fund quotas.Whatever course was preferred, it would be important to maintainthe momentum of the review; and he would therefore propose thatits findings should be available in time for consideration at the meetingof the Fund which was due to take place in Tokyo in 1964.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the views which the Chanceltorof the Exchequer proposed to put forward at theforthcoming meetings of the International Monetary fund and the International Bank, as set out in C. (63) 161.PublicServicePensions(previous reference:C.C. (63) 51stConclusions,Minute 1)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum on publicservice pensions by the Chief Secretary, Treasury (C. (63) 160).The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that, in consultation with theother Ministers concerned, he had considered the two issues whichthe Cabinet had remitted to him for further examination first, theprocedure under which pensions of former members of the publicservice were adjusted; second, the particular position of the&quot; pre-Grigg &quot; widows, i.e., the widows of members of the armed forces who had been bereaved before 4th November, 1958.C.C. 57 (63)The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Export Credits Guarantee Department might provide cover to Messrs. Leylands Ltd. for the supply of450 buses to Cuba on five-year credit terms.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in the light oftheir discussion, to advise the Foreign Secretary how he might best justify this transaction to the United StatesGovernment, during his forthcoming visit to Washington,in the context of our total trade with Cuba and in relationto the normal practice of the Export Credits guarantee department.
On the first issue the Government faced considerable pressure for the introduction of some automatic system of review in place ofthe periodical Pensions Increase measures, five of which had been enacted at intervals since the end of the 1939-45 war. The real purposeof the agitation on this point was the establishment of &quot; parity &quot;, i.e.,the assurance to any pensioner, at whatever date he had retired, ofa pension no less than that of an official who retired currently. Therewere serious objections of principle, however, to the use of taxationto insulate one section of society from the consequences of inflation.Moreover, the principle of &quot; parity &quot; was not adopted in the private sector of the economy; nor was it implemented in other european countries, if allowance was made for the fact that they did not providesocial security payments in addition to public service pensions. Forthese reasons there could be no question of conceding &quot; parity &quot;.Various other modifications of the present system were possible; butthey were all open to the objection that they would deprive theGovernment of their present discretion in deciding the timing of increases in public service pensions and would vest this responsibility in some other body, which would be even more exposed than theGovernment to pressure for &quot; parity &quot;. In these circumstances theGovernment should make no change in the present system; but, ifpublic opinion continued to press for some modification, it might be expedient to undertake to hold regular reviews of public service pensions at, say, three-yearly intervals.The second issue arose from the fact that, as a result of theGrigg Report, widows of officers who died after 4th November, 1958,received a higher pension than the widows of officers who died before that date. The proposal that this distinction should now be abolishedcommanded obvious sympathy. But it was an accepted principle inrespect of public service pensions that, while their amounts werefrequently increased by Pensions Increase Acts and related measures,the basis on which any individual pension was calculated was notaltered in the light of changes made subsequently. It followed that, ifthe Government accepted that it was indefensible to pay a differentpension according to whether a retirement or bereavement took place before or after a particular date, they would have taken a long stepon the road towards &quot; parity&quot; and would undoubtedly provokeserious repercussions among other pensioners. The classes who wouldbe most obviously and immediately affected would probably be, first,the widows of other ranks in the Armed Forces, who received apension (subject to the husband&apos;s length of service) if bereaved after4th November, 1958, but in many cases were entitled to no pension at all if bereaved before that date; second, the widows of civilservants who received a pension if bereaved after 14th July, 1949,but, similarly, had no entitlement if bereaved before that date. It was difficult to estimate the full cost to the Exchequer of these and relatedrepercussions; but those which could be most easily identified mightwell entail additional expenditure of the order of  100 million perannum. For these reasons the proposed concession should be resisted:and the Government should continue to rely on the principle, whichhad been introduced for the first time in the Pensions Increase Act.1962, that increases in public service pensions should deliberately beso calculated as to give proportionately greater help to the olderpensioner, a category which would naturally include the majority ofthe &quot; pre-Grigg &quot; widows.The Minister of Pensions endorsed this view and emphasised therisk that any concession to the &quot; pre-Grigg &quot; widows might havedangerous repercussions among the individuals who had been excluded by age from the National Insurance scheme, together withthe &quot; 10s. widows &quot;.The Minister of Defence said that, in view of the extent to whichthe real value of public service pensions had been reduced by inflation,the Government would be virtually compelled to concede some
Rural bus services(previous reference:C.C. (59) 30thConclusions,Minute 5)7. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Transport (C. (63) 152) and the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment (C. (63) 163) on the provision of rural bus services.The Minister of Transport said that a committee, under thechairmanship of Professor J. T. Jack, had reported in 1961 that the lack of rural bus services was causing hardship and inconvenience and that the only remedy was financial assistance, which the majorityof the committee had recommended should take the form of a directsubsidy, administered by county councils and falling partly on central and partly on local funds. Subsequent surveys in selected rural areashad confirmed the committee&apos;s assessment of the extent of the hardship; and action to relieve it would be justified on social grounds.In areas where a railway passenger service was discontinued theRailways Board could be required to maintain an adequate busservice, the cost of which fell on the Exchequer; but, where no railwayservice had existed and a bus service was being withdrawn, there wasno such relief. The need was essentially a local one, which the countyC.C. 57 (63)improvement in these pensions in due course. The &quot; pre-Grigg&quot;widows were the most deserving category of public service pensioners;and it was unreasonable that they should be denied equality oftreatment with &quot; post-Grigg&quot; widows on the ground that such a concession would be liable to provoke a demand for pensions fromindividuals who had hitherto received no pension at all, since, if this argument were valid, it would prevent any increase of pension to individuals already in receipt of a pension.In discussion there was considerable support for the view thatit would be impossible to revise the basis of pension in one casewithout provoking pressure for corresponding adjustment in many other cases. On the other hand it did not necessarily follow that animprovement in existing pensions must be accompanied by the grantof a pension where none had hitherto been paid; and, if it were possible, on these grounds, to isolate the &quot; pre-Grigg &quot; widows, theycould be afforded equality of treatment with &quot; post-Grigg &quot; widowsat a cost of little more than  300,000 a year. Since this would also include a corresponding improvement in the pensions of those widows of other ranks who were already entitled to a pension, it would bepossible to remove a substantial grievance, and to satisfy increasingpolitical pressure, at a relatively small cost.The Prime Minister summing up the discussion, said that, in assessing the risk of repercussions as a result of the proposed concession to the &quot; pre-Grigg &quot; widows, the Cabinet would need togive further consideration to two separate, but interrelated, issues first, whether it would be feasible to make a distinction within the armed Forces between the widows of officers and the widows of those other ranks who were not entitled to any pension at all; second,whether it would be feasible to make a distinction between the armed forces as a whole and the remainder of the public service. Meanwhile,no public statement should be made either on this issue or on themore general question of the procedure for review of public service pensions.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.
councils were well-placed to assess. He accordingly proposed thatcounty councils should be empowered to give financial assistance,where necessary, to maintain a bus service and that their expenditure should rank for rate deficiency grant. In addition, consideration should be given to allowing small undertakings greater freedom to run minor bus services and to encouraging local self-helparrangements in the form of car-lift pooling schemes, to be run ona voluntary basis by welfare organisations. These, however, would notsuffice to solve the problem by themselves.The Minister of Housing and Local Government doubted whethera subsidy was the appropriate remedy for the hardship which certainlyexisted. It would prove impossible to confine a subsidy to the most seriously affected areas; and county councils were unlikely to agreethat they were the appropriate agents for its payment or that any partof the cost should fall on local funds. Moreover, there was a risk thatthe proposed measures might accelerate the withdrawal of existingbus services; and in some areas it might be found that the provisionof greater scope for small operators and the promotion of self-helparrangements could in fact solve the problem. In order to resolve the uncertainty on these issues, an experiment should be conducted in a selected area, e.g., mid-Wales, based on an Exchequer-subsidised ruralbus service under the joint auspices of the Ministry of Transport, the welsh Office of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government andthe county authorities concerned.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The surveys already conducted had demonstrated no morethan the self-evident fact that those with private transport made morejourneys than those without. The evidence of actual hardship to thosedependent on public transport was not sufficient to justify a whollynew subsidy.(b) Where hardship existed the difficulty arose mainly becausethe large buses provided by the existing operators were uneconomicand were consequently being withdrawn, while the restrictions whichhad been introduced in order to protect these undertakings from thecompetition of the small operator had prevented the development ofalternatives such as the operation of mini-bus or taxi services and theprovision of lifts in private cars in return for payment. It would beillogical to subsidise an uneconomic service while continuing to prohibit a potentially economic alternative. On the other hand theprinciple of subsidy had already been accepted where it was the priceof the discontinuance of an uneconomic railway service.(c) In some areas the introduction of a subsidy or the removal ofthe restrictions on the small operator might aggravate the problem by causing the existing undertakings to withdraw uneconomic services which they had hitherto been willing to subsidise from profitableservices elsewhere. Experience in Scotland tended to confirm this risk.Some pressure, however, could be put on the operators by the traffic commissioners, by virtue of their ability to withdraw an operatorslicence; and the risk of withdrawal of services did not arise in areas where no adequate service was being provided at present.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therisk that the remedy might aggravate the disease might be reducedby introducing different measures for different types of area i.e., a subsidy for bus services in some areas, particularly those where no railservice had existed, and a greater measure of freedom for smalloperators in other areas. These possibilities should be explored further with the county authorities concerned, in the light of the Cabinet&apos;discussion; and it might be desirable, in due course, to announce thatthese consultations were in progress as evidence of the Governmenfsconcern to promote an efficient system of rural transport.
*Ti r-i Q5 ( 0PopulationandEmployment(previous reference:C.C. (63) 49thConclusions,Minute 2)Rolls-RoyceFactory at East Kilbride8. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary ofthe Cabinet (C. (63) 165), to which was appended a copy of amemorandum circulated by the Secretary of State for Scotland tothe Economic Policy Committee on the possible closure of the rolls-Royce factory at East Kilbride.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, under pressure fromthe Government, Messrs. Rolls-Royce Ltd. had been reorganisingtheir activities in order to reduce excessive overheads and make themselves more competitive. As part of this reorganisation they proposed to close their factory at East Kilbride and to transfer its operations partly to Hillington and partly to Derby. The economic arguments in favour of this course were incontestable; but in other respects the proposal was highly unwelcome. The new town of EastKilbride, which was to be a growth point in the development of theScottish economy, was still in process of creation; and about half the male employment in the town depended on the Rolls-Royce factory.The factory also provided an outstanding illustration of a modernindustry which had been introduced into Scotland and had become a centre of technology, supported by the National EngineeringLaboratory which was also at East Kilbride. A decision to close thefactory and to transfer work to Derby, announced at a time whenthe Government were about to publish their White Paper on theDevelopment of Central Scotland, would have a serious effect on theprospects for continued economic growth in the area; and, in so faras it involved moving work from an area of high unemployment toan area of virtually full employment, it would also cast doubt on theconsistency and the success of the Governments policies.Rolls-Royce would be prepared to confine the proposedreorganisation to Scotland and to refrain from transferring operations to Derby, provided that the Government would compensate them,at a cost of about  250,000 a year, for the reduced savings on theiroverheads. There would be serious objection to providing this degreeof support by means of an open subsidy. It would be preferable to seek other means of providing the company with financial relief; and various ways in which this might be done were now under examination. In particular, the Government might refrain fromimposing an increase in the rent of the factory which was now due.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) It was agreed that all possible means for keeping the EastKilbride factory in operation should be explored, since the social and economic consequences of its closure would be very serious.(b) Rolls-Royce might be given contracts for the further development of the Spey and Medway engines. But these werecomplex and expensive projects; and the prospects of subsequentorders for the engines were doubtful. If, in the meantime, development work were continued, some extra cost would fall on the defence budget.(c) Another firm might be interested in taking over the factory at East Kilbride; but this possibility also&apos; was uncertain.C.C. 57 (63)The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Transport, in consultation with theMinister of Housing and Local Government, to arrange for consultations with county councils in England and Waleson the provision of rural transport facilities, in the light ofthe Cabinets discussion and on the basis indicated by thePrime Minister in his summing-up.
Cabinet Office, S.W. I,25th September, 1963.(1) Agreed that the factory at East Kilbride, at present leasedto Messrs. Rolls-Royce Ltd., should, if possible, be kept in operation.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with theMinister of Aviation, to explore the possibility that theGovernment should underwrite the further developmentof the Spey and Medway engines in order to provide more work for the firm.(3) Invited the Minister of Aviation to give further considerationto the possibility of transferring the factory, if necessary,to another company.
