SECRET 3C.C. 51 (63)1. The Prime Minister said that at their meeting on 25th july the Cabinet had invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to arrange fora review of public service pensions, with particular reference to theposition of Service widows bereaved before 4th November, 1958. Inthe interval he had received a deputation on the subject and had been impressed by the force of the arguments in favour of taking actionto improve the position of these widows in advance of the results ofthe general review. The case for such action was all the stronger inthat only 7,000 widows were concerned and the additional expenditure involved would not exceed some  200,000 a year.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The 4th November, 1958, was the date from which a numberof proposals for improving conditions of service in the Armed Forcescame into effect as a result of the recommendations of the AdvisoryCommittee on Recruiting under the chairmanship of Sir James Grigg.It might be difficult to extend to Service widows bereaved before thatdate the pension entitlement of those bereaved after it withoutstimulating demands for similar retrospection in other cases. Inparticular, the widows of other ranks had become entitled to pensionas from the same date. If bereaved before that date, however, theyhad received no pension at all; and this disparity would become evenmore difficult to defend if the distinction between the pensions ofofficers&apos; widows bereaved before and after the 4th November, 1958,were abolished. Equally, there were significant differences in the ratesof retired pay payable to officers and other ranks before and afterthe operative date; and, here again, any exception to the general rule would increase the difficulty of maintaining the present arrangements.Similar considerations applied in the case of the widows of CivilServants, who had been bereaved before and after 1949; and the repercussions here could be particularly damaging.(b) On the other hand the case of the Service widows hadattracted considerable public attention; and the demand for some improvement in their pensions, over and above the substantial increases granted in April 1963, might well make it necessary toaccept, in the near future, proposals on the lines suggested. If so, itwould be wiser to make some improvement forthwith than to appearto be compelled to concede it later.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, on balance, it appeared that no change should be made until a more detailed study of the possible reactions among other pensioners hadbeen carried out. This, however, should be done urgently.The Cabinet-Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to bring before them,for discussion at an early meeting, the results of his reviewof public service pensions, with particular reference to theposition of Service widows bereaved before 4th November.1958.FuturePensionsIncreases(previous reference :C.C.

Some employers would preferIndustry to face this situation rather than to accept an inflationary settlement.But it was unlikely that all major employers would adopt this attitude.
Foreign 3.   The Foreign Secretary said that the representatives of the affairs United States, the United Kingdom and France had abstained from united voting on the Resolution in the Security Council of the United NationsNations calling on the Government of Portugal to grant self-determination(Previous to the territories of Portuguese Africa and inviting other memberReference: States to refuse to supply the Portuguese Government with arms force.C. (62) 40th use in those territories. But the course of events which had precededConclusions, the vote on this Resolution had illustrated the difficulties with which minute 4) we were increasingly likely to be confronted in dealing with issues of colonial policy in the Security Council. In a typical situation of thiskind the Afro-Asian bloc initially tabled a Resolution, calling for theadoption of extreme measures against the Colonial Power in question;the United States Government, in their anxiety not to adopt a whollynegative attitude towards such a Resolution, were then liable to propose its amendment on less stringent lines; thereafter, in orderto anticipate the risk that the amended version might fail to enlistadequate support, a move often developed to launch a separate, andmore moderate, Resolution; and, finally, attempts were usually madeto stiffen the moderate Resolution itself, in case it should fail to satisfy the more extreme elements of opinion in the Council. As a result we found ourselves constantly under pressure to accept, often at very short notice, a Resolution which was unsatisfactory in order to avoid a Resolution which was wholly unacceptable. In the present instance,if it had not been possible to persuade the United States Governmentthat their representative, together with our own, should abstain from voting on the Resolution relating to Portugal, we should have, had to choose whether we should ourselves veto a Resolution endorsed bythe United States or whether we should accept a Resolution whichwould have established a dangerous precedent for the adoption of asimilar procedure in relation to Southern Rhodesia and british guiana. There was no simple remedy for a situation of this kind,which was the result, to a considerable extent, of the ambivalentattitude of the United States Government towards the discussionof colonial issues in the United Nations. But the development ofevents in relation to the Resolution on the Portuguese territories of africa provided a clear warning of the dangers which would arise when the Security Council turned its attention in the next few days to the position of South Africa.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.commonwealth and colonial affairs(previous reference :C.C. (63) 48thConclusions,Minute 2)4. The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations andthe Colonies informed the Cabinet of the latest developments inrelation to the following territories:Malta. The Constitutional Conference had reached a deadlockand would probably have to be suspended without agreement. In thesecircumstances it would be right to postpone the date for the attainment of independence by the Island until May 1964. This would allowmore time for a further attempt to resolve the outstanding differences,possibly by means of a referendum.Wage increases in the building industry tended to establish the patternfor other sectors of the economy; and too generous a settlement atthe present stage would endanger the Governments incomes policy.He would keep in close touch with the Chancellor of the exchequer as the situation developed.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour.
(previous reference :C.C. (62) 26thConclusions,Minute 5)Zanzibar. It was proposed to convene an IndependenceConference for Zanzibar in September, in order that the Protectoratemight become independent before the end of the year and might therefore be able to accede to the East African Federation at the outset of its existence.(previous reference :Conclusions,Minute 4)British Guiana. Although racial tension was graduallysubsiding, it seemed unlikely that the Prime Minister, Dr. Jagan, andr^HMciiLt tne Leader of the main Opposition Party, Mr. Burnham, would reach agreement in the near future on the form of future constitutional advance in the Colony. It was therefore proposed to convene a further constitutional Conference in London in the autumn, at the conclusionof which it might be necessary for the United Kingdom Governmentto impose their own solution.The Caribbean. It was possible, although not certain that asufficient measure of agreement might be reached between themembers of the group of islands known as &quot; the little Seven&quot;(Barbados, Antigua, St. Kitts, Montserrat, Dominica, St. Lucia and at . Vincent) to make it possible to grant them independence, as a federation, in 1965. It was proposed to convene a conference for thispurpose in due course, possibly by the end of the year, if developments in the interval appeared to justify this.(previous reference :C.C. (63) 39thConclusions,Minute 2)(previous reference :C.C. (62) 66thConclusions,Minute 1)Malaysia. The Prime Minister of Malaya, Tunku abdul rahman, had apparently been persuaded by the Prime Minister ofthe Philippines, Mr. Macapagal, and the President of Indonesia,Dr. Sukarno, to ask the Secretary-General of the United Nationshow long it would take him to ascertain the attitude of the inhabitants of the North Borneo territories towards Malaysia. He had also indicated that, if some enquiry for this purpose could be conductedunder United Nations auspices in the immediate future, he might beprepared to postpone for a short period the establishment of Malaysia,at present fixed for 31st August.In discussion it was agreed that any postponement of the creationof Malaysia at this stage would be more likely to lead to an indefinitepostponement of the project than to promote an early resolution ofthe current differences between Malaya and Indonesia. Moreover, a survey under United Nations auspices would not only be liable totake a considerable time but would also merely confirm that theinhabitants of North Borneo endorsed the concept of Malaysia. Weshould therefore impress on the Prime Minister of Malaya theimportance of adhering to 31st August as the date for the formationof Malaysia and warn him of the dangers implicit in any further delay.India. Recent intelligence suggested that the CommunistChinese Government were now in a position to resume militaryoperations against India. There was as yet no firm evidence that such operations were likely to take place; but, if they did, Pakistan mightbe tempted to associate herself with China, at least to the extent of seeking to recover Kashmir by force. The United States government might take steps to remind the Government of Pakistan of the guarantees which they had given at an earlier stage to protect Indiaagainst Pakistani aggression and Pakistan against Indian aggression;but the applicability of these guarantees to a situation of the kind which might now develop must be open to question.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements by the Secretary of State for commonwealth Relations and the Colonies.
5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (63) 145) about the maintenance of a United Nationspresence in the Congo.The Foreign Secretary said that the condition of the Congoleseeconomy remained precarious; and the risk of a breakdown of lawand order, with a renewal of civil war, persisted. In these circumstances it was desirable to ensure that the United Nations civilian staffs whowere at present supervising the development of the economy shouldnot be withdrawn; and we should be prepared to contribute a further$500,000 towards the cost of retaining them in the Congo until theend of 1963. In addition it would be necessary to maintain at least3,000 United Nations troops in the Congo until the middle of 1964,when the Congolese National Army might be able to take over their responsibilities. The United Kingdom would be contributing$2-9 million towards a total expenditure of $33 million in respectof the maintenance of United Nations forces in the Congo duringthe last six months of 1963. The cost of maintaining 3,000 troops for the first six months of 1964 would amount to a total of $12 million,of which the United Kingdom&apos;s share would amount to about$1 - 1 million.The Cabinet Authorised the Foreign Secretary to offer to the united nations authorities the sum of $500,000 as a contributionto the cost of maintaining United Nations civilian staffs inthe Congo during the remainder of 1963, together with thesum of $1-1 million as a contribution to the cost ofmaintaining United Nations troops in the Congo during thefirst half of 1964.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary on United Kingdom policy towards SouthAfrica (C. (63) 146).The Foreign Secretary said that we had recently agreed inprinciple with the United States Government that both countries would veto any Resolutions which might be introduced in the security council of the United Nations to expel South Africa from the united nations or to enforce economic sanctions against her. The Afro-Asianbloc in the United Nations, however, anticipating defeat on these issues, were now seeking support for a Resolution restrainingmember countries from exporting all types of military supplies to south Africa. There was some hope that, with the co-operation ofthe Governments of the United States and Norway, we might secure an amendment of this Resolution which would exempt from thescope of the embargo &quot; military supplies appropriate only for defence against external aggression&quot;. A resolution on this basis wouldprobably enable us to maintain our existing policy as regards thesupply of arms to South Africa, provided that we stipulated that wemust remain free to complete existing contracts and to continue tosupply spare parts, ammunition, etc., for arms which we had alreadyexported. On the other hand the word &quot; only &quot;, if strictly interpreted,might cast some doubt on our freedom to continue to export arms,such as tanks and helicopters, which, although primarily for usein defence against external aggression, could in certain circumstances be employed to repress internal disaffection.Moreover, we must envisage the possibility that a resolution of this kind might fail to command sufficient support in the security council and that we might thereafter be unable to secure the defeat of the extreme Resolution sponsored by the Afro-Asian bloc.
CC. 51 (63)particularly if the United States Government abstained from voting on, or even voted in favour of, such a Resolution. If we then felt thatwe must continue to oppose it, we should stand alone, apart from france; and we should have to decide whether we should abstain from voting on it or should go to the lengths of imposing our veto.In discussion there was general agreement that we should initiallyconcentrate on seeking to secure the amendment of the Afro-AsianResolution on the lines indicated by the Foreign Secretary. If possible,the limiting word &quot; only &quot; should be eliminated; but we should acceptits retention, if necessary, and should vote in favour of the amendedResolution subject to the incorporation of appropriate safeguards inrelation to existing contracts and the continued supply of spare partsfor arms already exported to South Africa. If, however, this attemptfailed and we had then to decide whether to veto or to acquiesce in aResolution prohibiting the export of all arms to South Africa, weshould face a very difficult situation. In return for the military facilities which the Government of South Africa had placed at our disposalunder the Simonstown Agreement, facilities which made a significant contribution to our ability to maintain our military presence and tosupport our allies in the Far East, we had undertaken to do our best to supply arms to South Africa; and this undertaking, although amoral rather than a legal commitment, could not be lightlydisregarded. We were also under an obligation to discharge our responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations; and sincethe Resolution would be mandatory in form, we must be preparedeither to accept it and to co-operate in putting it into effect or todissociate ourselves from it by imposing our veto. Our position mightbe thought to be indefensible if we sought to find some intermediatecourse which neither accepted nor rejected the Resolution; and weshould be as liable to alienate the African members of theCommonwealth by abstaining from voting on the Resolution butmaintaining supplies of arms to South Africa as by imposing ourveto on the Resolution at the outset.To veto the Resolution, however, would be to invite our enemiesto misrepresent the United Kingdom as being opposed to the advancement of the coloured peoples of Africa; and, although itmight simplify our relations with Southern Rhodesia, it would attract the hostility of the other members of the Commonwealth in africa, with whom, in the aggregate, we had a more valuableconnection, in terms of trade and investment, than with South Africa.If they chose to adopt retaliatory measures against a United Kingdomveto on a total arms embargo to South Africa, they could do gravedamage to our interests throughout the African continent. This riskshould be weighed the more carefully in that the export of arms to south Africa, although on a considerable scale and likely to increasestill further in the immediate future, could not be expected to continue indefinitely. From this point of view it might be wiser to acquiesce in a total arms embargo, subject to the completion of existing contracts, and to accept that, as a result, the Government of SouthAfrica would probably divert future orders to other countries.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, suggested that,initially, we should seek to mobilise support for an amendedResolution which would exempt from the embargo arms for defence against external agression. It was for consideration whether, for thispurpose, we should promote a Resolution of our own, which wouldmake it clear that we were concerned to secure exemption only forsuch armaments as aircraft and warships, on the ground that these were indisputably related to defence against external aggression andthat their export by the United Kingdom would therefore constituteno more than a proper discharge of our undertaking to South africa to give her as much assistance as possible in this respect. If we failedto secure support for a Resolution of this kind, however, it would be
necessary to give further consideration to the very serious position which would then arise. Our wisest course thereafter might be to letit be known in the United Nations that we should abstain from voting on any extreme Resolution proposing a total arms embargo; to explain that, although we should propose not to veto such a Resolution, weshould regard our abstention as entitling us to maintain our present policy as regards the supply of arms to South Africa; and to indicatethat, if the Security Council were unable to accept our attitude inthis respect, we might be compelled in the last resort to veto theResolution. This procedure, which would need further consideration before it was put into effect, might offer the best hope that we couldavoid having to adopt a definite position in relation to an extremeResolution proposing a total embargo.The Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary, in instructing the UnitedKingdom Representative on the Security Council of theUnited Nations on the attitude which he should adopt towards any Resolution to prohibit the export of arms to south Africa, to be guided by the points which had emergedin their discussion.7. The President of the Board of Trade said that it had become necessary to increase imports of butter in 1963 by 40,000 tons in orderto compensate for the shortfall in domestic and European productioncaused by the severe winter. Offers of 25,000 tons had been obtained,including 10,000 tons from foreign suppliers; but the New zealand government, having originally stated that they could not supply anyfurther quantities, were now seeking to insist that, in the interests ofmaintaining the price of New Zealand butter in the United kingdom market, the additional amount to be imported should be limited to25,000 tons, of which they should supply 8,000 tons in substitution for the bulk of the supplies offered from foreign countries. TheSecretary of State for Commonwealth Relations had represented thatwe were under an obligation to New Zealand to restrict the totalimport to 25,000; but we had not in fact accepted any obligation ofthis kind and we should therefore feel free to accept the New Zealandoffer of 8,000 tons on the understanding that it would be additional to the 25,000 tons already secured.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for commonwealth relations said that our obligation to New Zealand arose from the factthat, in our original approach to the New Zealand Government, wehad mentioned a figure of 25,000 tons as the amount of the additionalimport which we had in view. Even if it were now judged necessaryto accept foreign supplies to the full amount of 10,000 tons, we shouldtake this opportunity to reaffirm the agreement of May 1963, aboutthe New Zealand share of the United Kingdom market.In discussion it was suggested that the attitude adopted by theGovernment of New Zealand was unreasonable. New Zealandexporters had been benefiting, at the expense of the United Kingdomhousewife, from prices well above the level contemplated when theagreement was concluded; and they were not entitled to seek tomaintain high prices on the United Kingdom market by artificiallylimiting the import of butter required at a time of shortage.The Cabinet Authorised the President of the Board of Trade to arrangefor the import of 33,000 tons of butter, including 10,000 tons from foreign countries.
Commercial 8.   The Minister of Agriculture said that French suppliers werePolicy offering barley on the United Kingdom market at a price of  17 a ton,Barley compared with a price of  32 a ton paid to French farmers. He hopedImports to persuade the French interests concerned to agree to a price of 20 a ton for imports into this country; but, if they refused toco-operate in this respect, it would become necessary to applymeasures to prevent the import of barley at excessively low prices.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Minister of Agriculture would continueto seek agreement to a minimum price of  20 a ton for french barley offered on the United Kingdom market.(2) Invited the Minister of Agriculture, in consultation with thePresident of the Board of Trade, to take any steps whichmight be necessary to prevent the import of French barleyat unduly low prices.CommercialPolicyJuteImports* 9. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (C. (63) 143) and the Secretary of State forScotland (C. (63) 144) on the policy to be adopted on the importationof jute goods.The President of the Board of Trade said that, under the present arrangements for the protection of the Dundee jute industry, somegoods originating in India and Pakistan were totally excluded fromthe United Kingdom and others were imported by the Jute Controland sold either at the same price as similar goods made in Dundee(&quot; equated goods &quot;) or with a 20 per cent mark-up (&quot; depressedgoods&quot;). The case against continuing these arrangements restedon three grounds: the desirability of taking, before the kennedy round, some initiative to restore the rights of Indian and Pakistaniexporters in the United Kingdom market; the disadvantage at whichprotected prices placed industrial users of jute goods; and thecondemnation by the Restrictive Practices Court of the price-fixingsystem within the industry, on which the arrangements rested.Measures for these purposes, which had been proposed to the industry on 9th July, had met with strenuous resistance, on the ground thatthey would cause a substantial rise in unemployment in Dundee.Modified proposals, summarised in the Annex to C. (63) 143, hadbeen discussed on 18th July with the employers, the unions and thecivic authorities of Dundee; and, although the industry had maintained their opposition in principle, their original fears seemedto have been allayed. The new proposals would give the industry a50 per cent mark-up of all &quot; equated &quot; goods and excluded goods, tobe reduced by 5 per cent per annum over three years. The bulk of theindustry&apos;s protection would therefore be virtually unchanged in thefirst year. The industry had pressed for an inquiry; and this mightbe conceded, provided that the new arrangements were introduced inthe meantime.It was very desirable that these measures should now beintroduced. In connection with the negotiations for the entry of theUnited Kingdom into the European Economic Community theindustry had been almost persuaded to accept the need for some adjustment of the present system of protection; and it would bedifficult, to convince them afresh at a later stage if the Governmentretreated now. Moreover, it would be advantageous to make some immediate concession to Indian interests.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that the course proposedby the President of the Board of Trade would be liable to create majordifficulties for the Government in Scotland. There was certainly a
need for some degree of change in the present system of protection and for some concentration of the industry; but the immediateenforcement of the proposed new system would involve so sharp a break with existing arrangements as to prejudice the prospects of achieving a healthy and economic industry in the future. The industry were particularly concerned about the probable effect of theintroduction of a fixed mark-up for &quot; equated &quot; goods before an inquiry had identified the lines of production on which the industry should concentrate. It would be preferable, therefore, that the existing system of protection should continue for one year; that, during thisinterval, an inquiry into the future of the industry should be conducted by a working party, representing the Board of Trade and both sides of the industry; and that, if this inquiry produced no satisfactory alternative proposals by the end of 12 months, a 45 per cent mark-up should be introduced at that point for both &quot; equated &quot; and excludedgoods.In discussion it was generally agreed that, pending the proposed inquiry, there might be advantage in maintaining the present systemof variable mark-up for a strictly limited period, provided that up-to-date information on which to base a mark-up could be obtainedfrom the industry without condoning practices condemned by the restrictive Practices Court. It might be possible in this transitional period for the necessary information to be given to the Board of Tradeotherwise than by means of the condemned information arrangements.Otherwise, the matter might need to be re-examined.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for Scotland:(a) to examine further the possibility of continuing asystem of variable mark-up for the present equatedgoods in the jute industry for an interim period ofone year, pending an inquiry into the future of theindustry;(b) to consider the constitution and terms of reference ofthe inquiry.(2) Authorised the President of the Board of Trade to proceed on the lines indicated in C. (63) 143 in the case of goodsother than those currently equated or excluded; to begin to admit excluded goods from India and Pakistan; andto subject goods currently equated or excluded to a45 per cent mark-up if the inquiry to be instituted under conclusion (1) produced no satisfactory alternative proposals after a year.WelfareServicesSchool Meals(previous reference :C.C. (63) 47thConclusions,Minute 10)10. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the proposal toincrease the charge for school meals from Is. to Is. 3d. with effect from 30th September.The Minister of Education said that the increase in expenditureon education was now of the order of 6 per cent a year. Moreover,he had recently announced an increase in the schools building programme and in expenditure on technical colleges and the youth service. Against this background it did not seem unreasonable toincrease the price of school meals for the first time in six years,particularly having regard to the national scale of remission whichhe proposed to introduce in order to obviate hardship to families with low incomes.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that, in the light of thesystem of remissions already in operation in Scotland, it was not opento him to provide additional safeguards against hardship, of the kind
proposed by the Minister of Education. It would therefore be unwise to introduce in Scotland an increased charge which, notwithstanding the remissions already available, would fall on a large number of families and would be thought to bear with particular severity on those in areas of high unemployment and in rural areas where childrenhad to travel long distances to school.In discussion it was suggested that the  6-7 million which couldbe saved on school meals might be more usefully applied to the relief of hardship elsewhere and that, while the increase in the charge mightevoke a temporary protest in some quarters, other sections of publicopinion would support a measure to restrict the rising level ofGovernment expenditure. On the other hand there would be someparents, particularly in Scotland and in rural areas of England andWales, on whom the increased charge might impose a substantialburden; and there might be a permanent reduction in the proportionof children taking school meals. On balance, it might be right inprinciple to increase the charge; and, if so, the change should be madeat the beginning of- the school year. On the other hand, it wouldpreferably be announced in Parliament; and there was now insufficienttime before the Recess to allow this to be done. It might be possible,however, to make an announcement otherwise than in Parliamenttowards the end of September, with a view to the introduction of theincreased charges in October.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for theproposed increase in the charge for school meals to beconsidered further in the light of their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,1st August, 1963.
