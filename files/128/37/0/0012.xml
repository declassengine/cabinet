Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inParliament in the following week.ForeignAffairsLaw of the Sea:FaroeseFishingLimits(previous reference:C.C. (61) 12thConclusions,Minute 3)2. The Foreign Secretary said that the Danish Governmenthad now declared their intention of establishing a 12 mile exclusive fishing zone round the Faroes with effect from April 1964. We hadprotested against this summary procedure; but the danish government were unlikely, for domestic political reasons, to modify their decision.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that the UnitedKingdom fishing industry had not asked to be provided withprotection against Danish intervention if they continued to fish inthe neighbourhood of the Faroes. They believed that the danish government could not afford to lose the United Kingdom market forthe Faroes catch and that, if they were convinced that this risk wasimplicit in their decision, they would seek to reach some accommoda-tion with us during the 12 months before that decision took effect.In the absence of any such accommodation the industry might be seriously affected. On balance, however, the wisest course for thetime being would be to refrain from any action which might imply that we accepted the Danish Governments decision and to awaitdevelopments.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Foreign Secretary andthe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.3. The First Secretary of State informed the Cabinet that theGovernment of Southern Rhodesia had now publicly endorsed the concept of some degree of economic union with Northern Rhodesia.The Federal Government, however, could be expected to press thatsuch a union should have a political as well as an economic content;and they would probably be prepared to attend a conference todiscuss the future of the Federation only on the understanding thatthis point was not prejudged. The Governments of Northern and southern Rhodesia, on the other hand, had made it clear that theirown attendance at such a conference would be dependent on an assurance that the Federation was to be dissolved. In thesecircumstances the least disadvantageous course would probably beto convene a conference in the early summer and to seek to induce the parties to reach some form of agreement.In discussion there was general agreement with this suggestion.The following main points were made:(a) The economic connexion between Northern and SouthernRhodesia would require some form of central direction and control.But this should preferably take the form of an inter-Governmentalarrangement, of a purely administrative character. We should not attempt to recreate any central political authority in place of thepresent Federal Government.(b) The Federal Government themselves were the main obstaclein the way of progress towards establishing a satisfactory relation-ship between Northern and Southern Rhodesia. It was unlikely thatthey would surrender their authority without a considerable show of resistance. On the other hand they could no longer count on thesupport of the Government of Southern Rhodesia; and to this extent they were in a weaker position than on previous occasions whenthey had challenged the United Kingdom Government.SECRET2395-4 a 2Federationof RhodesiaandNyasaland(previous reference:C.C.

Satellite 4.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the ForeignCommanica- Secretary (C. (63) 18), the Lord President of the Council (C. (63) 19),tions the Minister without Portfolio (C. (63) 25), the Minister of aviation and the Postmaster-General (C. (63) 16) and the Secretary of Statefor Air (C. (63) 23) on United Kingdom participation in a satellite communications system.The Prime Minister said that two main issues were involved first, the nature of the international system which it should be our policy to promote; and, second, the technical contribution which weshould seek to make to such a system. Under the first head it wouldbe necessary to consider co-operation with Europe and theCommonwealth either as the means of achieving a self-containedcommunications system, independent of the United States, or as oneelement in a single global system, including the United States and,perhaps, the Soviet Union. Under the second head we had to decide whether to embark on the design and development of Britishsatellites and launchers or whether to assume that our interests wouldbe better served by making a technical contribution to aninternational enterprise of this kind in the context of the EuropeanLauncher Development Organisation (ELDO) and the european space Research Organisation (ESRO).In discussion the following points were made:(a) The economic profitability of any international communica-tions system was largely dependent on the trans-Atlantic traffic.From a strictly commercial point of view, therefore, our wisestcourse might be to seek to collaborate with the United StatesGovernment in a joint undertaking rather than to embark on thedevelopment of an independent system. In the longer term,however, this might be to our disadvantage, particularly since therewere grounds for supposing that the United States might attempt tosecure for themselves a monopoly of development in this field. Itwould be unacceptable, both politically and economically, that weshould be precluded from sharing the technological benefits to be derived from a new communications system of the kind in question.(b) For this reason we should seek to concert action with other european countries and with the rest of the Commonwealth beforeundertaking any definitive discussions with the United States. Inso doing, we should endeavour to profit from our investment in(c) For this reason it was arguable that we should now seek to expedite a final settlement and to dissolve the Federation by legisla-tion in the life of the present Parliament. On the other handover-hasty action might provoke the Federal Government to extremeaction; and it would be liable to create political embarrassment forthe Government in this country.(d) In seeking to establish a reasonable relationship between northern and Southern Rhodesia it would be necessary to haveregard to our remaining obligations in respect of the conduct ofSouthern Rhodesia&apos;s external relations. World opinion would stillregard us as ultimately answerable for her policies until she achievedindependence; while at the point when she became eligible for full membership of the Commonwealth we might face additionalembarrassment in the form of opposition from those of the other member countries which condemned the attitude of the whiteminority in Southern Rhodesia towards the African inhabitants.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the First Secretary of Stateand of the points made in discussion.
5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePostmaster General (C. (63) 21) on the means of financing the british broadcasting Corporation (B.B.C.).The Postmaster General said that the Government had publiclyaccepted a responsibility to ensure to the B.B.C. sufficient income to finance adequate services. The Corporation^ expenditure had been rising rapidly; and, even if they made full use of the borrowing powers which they would obtain under the current Television Bill,their needs would be only partially met. But a more limited use of borrowing powers would enable them to maintain adequate servicesuntil 1965, provided that they received an additional  1 per licencewith effect from April 1963. The additional  1 could be providedeither by remission of the present Excise Duty in favour of theB.B.C. or by an increase in the licence fee itself from  3 to  4. any increase of the payment made by viewers would be unpopular; andit had been the general view of the Ministerial Committee on broadcasting and Television that an alteration in the licence feebefore 1965 should be avoided, if possible. An early increase might also attract criticism from some Government supporters who mightprefer that the proceeds of the proposed levy on programme contractors should be used to meet the B.B.C.&apos;s requirements. Onthe other hand remission of the Excise Duty would cost theExchequer some  13 million per annum and would represent a subsidy from the tax-payer to the viewer. In the interests of preserving their independence the B.B.C., who had been supportedby the Pilkington Committee on Broadcasting, were averse from any form of Government subsidy.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would be reluctant to abandon the Excise Duty, which provided an appropriate andeasily administered source of revenue.   Equivalent revenue wouldELDO and ESRO; and we should try to turn to our own advantagethe fact that any system of communications satellites would requireground stations at many points round the world.(c) It would be unwise, however, to contemplate co-operationwith other Western European countries unless technical development in this country had been carried to the point at whichwe could put forward specific proposals for adoption. Otherwise,we should be liable to find ourselves merely contributing to the costof development in other countries. The French Government were already developing a satellite and associated launcher of their own;and both Italian and Swiss interests were engaged in this field. Nocomparable work was at present in progress in the United Kingdom.If we were to seek to promote a European initiative, therefore, our first step should be to commission a design study for a communica-tions satellite of our own.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Aviation, in consultation withthe Chief Secretary and other Ministers concerned, to commission a design study for a British communicationssatellite and to arrange for the implications of its development to be examined.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to arrange, in the light of their discussion, for further consideration to be given to thedesirability of convening a conference of European and commonwealth countries to consider the development ofinternational satellite communications systems either inconjunction with the United States or independently.
have to be obtained in other ways; and services which might beconsidered of greater social and economic importance than theB.B.C.&apos;s television service might suffer. In principle the costs of that service should be borne by those who benefited from it.In discussion there was considerable support for the view thatthe Corporation^ television service had little claim to benefit fromany taxation relief which might be found practicable. An earlyincrease in the licence fee might, admittedly, be ill-received,particularly by elderly people and by those viewers who would forsome years receive no benefit from additional facilities. Butremission of the Excise Duty might also be criticised as a device for postponing an increase in the licence fee. It might be possible,however, to mitigate the effect of an increase in the fee by arranging for payment by instalments.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Postmaster General to circulate a memorandumon the history of the Excise Duty on television licences.(2) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would give further consideration to the means of financing theBritish Broadcasting Corporation in relation to futuretaxation policy.London 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theEmployment, Minister of Housing and Local Government (C. (63) 22), to whichHousing and was annexed a draft White Paper on Employment, Housing and land Land in London.The Minister of Housing said that the White Paper, which he proposed to present simultaneously with the introduction of theTown and Country Planning Bill during the following week,was designed to explain the Governments policy on London&apos;housing and land needs and to justify the changes in policy aboutoffices which would be proposed in the Bill. It indicated that itwould be difficult even to maintain the present output of houses for Londoners unless more land could be allocated for building.Over the next 10 years half a million houses, publicly and privatelyprovided, would be required; and it was clear both that the fullest use would have to be made of the land available in London and within reasonable travelling distance and that homes would have tobe provided in new and expanded towns for Londoners who could find employment there. The White Paper was therefore likely to be criticised as much by those who would consider that it did not givepromise of finally solving the problem of London&apos;s homeless as by those who would object to the slight encroachment on the GreenBelt which was implicit in its proposals. Nevertheless, the policywhich it advocated was realistic and defensible.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The White Paper might be held to reflect disproportionateconcern with the problems of London; it would be desirable toinclude a reference to the Governments determination to arrest thesouthwards movement of population from Scotland and the north.(b) While it could be argued that the Green Belt policy wasmistaken in principle and should be radically amended, abandon-ment of any part of the area already designated would be liable tobe sharply criticised, not least by the interests which were alreadydisposed to be critical of the Governments proposals for the reform of local government in London. The proposals in the White Paperalso involved some risk of speculation in Green Belt land; but thiswould be less damaging than might be feared, since options were already held on much of the potential building land.    Some
The North-East(previous reference:C.C. (63) 3rdConclusions,Minute 5)7. The Cabinet had before them a report by the Lord Presidentof the Council (C. (63) 20) on his visit to the North-East of Englandfrom 4th to 8th February.The Lord President said that he was not yet ready to putforward for the Cabinets consideration the long-term plans for the rehabilitation of the North-East which were now under study. for political and practical reasons, however, it would be desirable toauthorise and announce in the meantime as many as possible of the specific short-term measures proposed in his memorandum. none of these measures, however, would be likely to have any lasting effectunless they could be supported by positive and selective financialincentives to encourage the establishment of new industry in theNorth-East, in Scotland and in other depressed areas.The Prime Minister said that short-term measures were clearlyrequired but should not prejudice work on longer term and more general policies to improve the situation in particular parts of thecountry or in individual industries. The proposals in C. (63) 20included both categories of measure and should therefore be examined by the Economic Policy Committee and the Committee onPopulation and Employment, as appropriate. The impact of such decisions as it might be possible to take in the near future shouldnot be diminished by piecemeal announcement. They should be presented, so far as possible, as a comprehensive set of proposals,which would contribute to the development of the Governmentsfinancial and economic policies.The Cabinet Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theHome Secretary would arrange for detailed considerationof the proposals in C. (63) 20 to be undertaken by theEconomic Policy Committee and the Committee onPopulation and Employment, as appropriate, with a viewto an early and comprehensive announcement of decisions in as many cases as possible.C.C. 12 (63)encroachment on the Green Belt was clearly unavoidable; butrearrangement of paragraph 65 of the draft might indicate more clearly the very limited extent to which this would be necessary.(c) Paragraph 67 of the draft, which dealt specifically with theLea Valley area, should be deleted. Development in that area wouldbe justifiable on many grounds; but the argument would be more effectively developed in debates in Parliament than in the white paper.(d) It could be made clear in debate that the proposed committee to survey the use of existing housing would have no powers to require information to be provided but would be expectedto obtain their material through the co-operation of public authorities and private individuals. The conmittee were not likelyto be able to report before the end of the fo&apos;.owing year.A number of further amendments in the draft White Paper were agreed.The Cabinet Approved the draft White Paper annexed to C. (63) 22,subject to the amendments agreed in their discussion, and invited the Minister of Housing, in consultation with theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, to arrange for its presentation to Parliament at an appropriate moment inrelation to the introduction of the Town and country planning Bill.
CommercialPolicyImports ofRussian Oil(previous reference:C.C. (63) 10thConclusions,Minute 6)8. The President of the Board of Trade said that the Head ofthe Russian Trade Mission in London had recently declared thatBritish ship-builders had made no real effort to secure Soviet orders;that their tender prices had been high; that, if Soviet orders for ships were to be placed in the United Kingdom, it would benecessary for the United Kingdom to import specified quantities of soviet oil in return; and that the Soviet Government had made no allowance for possible exports to the United Kingdom in theirassessment of probable exports of oil products in 1963, but wouldbe willing to re-examine the position if requested by the UnitedKingdom Government to do so. We had made it clear in reply thatthere could be no question of our importing Soviet oil unlesssubstantial orders for ships were placed with United Kingdom ship-yards and that our present offer to supply ships to the SovietGovernment could not remain open indefinitely; our ship-buildingcapacity was limited, we had other customers and unemploymentcould be expected to fall.The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Transport said that inthe case of one order to the value of about  15 million matters were now well advanced. The firm had been informed by the soviet representatives in the United Kingdom that their tender was highlycompetitive and were now in direct touch with the Soviet authoritiesin Moscow.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,21st February, 1963.
