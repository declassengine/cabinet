WaddellContentsEuropeCommon Market NegotiationsTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT
Europe The Lord Privy Seal informed the Cabinet that the negotiationsCommon in Brussels were due to be resumed on 28th January. There was littleMarket indication of any change in the attitude of the French Government;Negotiations and it was uncertain whether I heir representatives would accept the(Previous latest proposal that the European Economic Commission should nowReference: produce a report, summarising the present state of the negotiationsC.C.

EvenConclusions) if this project were formally endorsed in Brussels, it would not be inour interests to accept it unless we had some assurance that theproduction of the report would be accepted by the French government as contributing to the genuine continuance of the negotiations andthat they would be prepared to make a fresh attempt to reach agreement on the basis of its proposals. In the absence of french -operation the other member countries might be anxious tocontinue direct negotiation with ourselves. If we entertainedproposals to this effect, we might run the risk of becoming involvedafresh in difficult and protracted discussions with no assurance of a successful outcome. Nevertheless, it was to our advantage tomaintain good relations with the other member countries, providedthat we were satisfied that, by renewing discussions with them, weshould not sacrifice the moral advantage which we derived from thefact that, if the negotiations broke down now, the responsibility fortheir failure would be seen to lie clearly with the French Government.We must also be prepared for the other member countries to renew,on the prompting of the French Government, the proposal that theUnited Kingdom, while not becoming a member of the european economic Community, should enter into some form of association with it. It was clear that the conditions on which such an arrangement would be acceptable to the French Government, particularly the exclusion of the other members of the European Free trade association (EFTA), would be unacceptable to us; nor would it bein our interest to develop a relationship with the Community on abasis which would give us no effective control over its policies. Atsome stage it might well be desirable to disclose publicly the inadequacy of the French concept of association.In discussion, the following points were made:(a) Even if the French Government were now prepared to give assurances that they would resume negotiations in good faith, there could be no certainty that at some later stage they would not find freshobjections, whether political or technical, to our entry into theCommunity. The decisive factor was the long-term policy of president de Gaulle; and there was no evidence that this had changed since he had publicly declared his opposition to United kingdom membership of the Community. Nor was it likely that he would yield to German pressure in this respect. Such pressure wouldprobably be ineffective unless the Federal German Parliament werepersuaded to refuse to ratify the Franco-German Treaty which hadbeen concluded within the last few days; but public opinion in western Germany, which had welcomed this Treaty, would be reluctant to put it in jeopardy and, in any event, its ratification wouldnot be debated until May.(h) For these reasons it might be to our advantage that thenegotiations in Brussels should be broken off forthwith, while it could still be demonstrated that the responsibility for their failure restedsquarely with the French Government. At least we might refrain from being represented when the negotiations were resumed on28th January; and, before committing ourselves to renewedparticipation, we should allow an interval to elapse in which toestimate the degree of pressure which the other member countries were prepared to bring to bear against the French Government. Itwould be inconsistent with the dignity of this country, and would belikely to be unacceptable to Parliament and to public opinion, that
we should renew negotiations with the Community unless the FrenchGovernment were prepared to withdraw their opposition to our membership.(c) On the other hand, it was essential to the maintenance ofour future relations with the other member countries that we shouldnot appear to abandon them at this point and that we should lose no opportunity to seek to strengthen their opposition to the unilateralattitude of the French Government. For this purpose it might bepossible to suggest that a report should now be produced, either bythe Commission or by the member countries collectively, on the basis that all the parties to the negotiations would then be invited to acceptor to refuse the proposals embodied in it and that the FrenchGovernment would be required to declare their intentions first. Ifthey endorsed the proposals, we should have achieved our objective,provided that the proposals were themselves satisfactory; if theyrejected them, the responsibility for the collapse of the negotiations would remain clearly with President de Gaulle.(d) There were, however, other difficulties in renewing discussions on the basis of a report produced by the Commission rather than byway of direct negotiations. Unless we could be certain beforehandthat the proposals to be embodied in this report would satisfactorilyresolve the considerable issues still outstanding, we might find ourselves invited to subscribe to solutions which would be even lessdefensible than those which we might have secured by direct negotiation, while no longer being able to demonstrate that theresponsibility for the ultimate failure rested solely with the FrenchGovernment. Moreover, the detailed negotiation of these solutionswould be liable to be protracted and to involve us in an increasinglyambiguous position.(e) It might be preferable, therefore, that we should seek toobtain from the French Government, as a prior condition of our willingness to renew negotiations, some assurance that any further discussions would be brought to a speedy conclusion and would be conducted in good faith. But if we were not to appear by this means to take on ourselves the responsibility of bringing the negotiations to an end, it would be desirable that this suggestion should be madeto the French Government by the other member Governments ratherthan by ourselves. Their own concern to protect themselves againstFrench domination, to safeguard the Community from dissolutionand to maintain good relations with the United Kingdom shouldmake them the more prepared to seek from the French Governmentthe assurances which might enable us to continue to take part in thenegotiations.(/) On this assumption, the Commission might now be invitedto review the current state of the negotiations and to suggest possiblesolutions for the outstanding problems; and the other member countries might require the French Government to confirm that theyendorsed this procedure and would accept the Commission^ report as a genuine basis for further negotiations. It would be essential,however, that the scope of these negotiations should be agreed, inadvance, by all concerned as being limited to the technical issues which remained in dispute and that the French Government should agree to judge the proposed solutions on their merits, withoutimporting any political prejudice.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that ourdilemma lay in the fact that, on the one hand, we could not contemplate the risk of becoming involved in fresh and possiblyprotracted negotiations after President de gaulle&apos;s uncompromisingstatement of his opposition to our entry to the Community but that,on the other hand, it would be to our disadvantage to allow thepresent negotiations to come to an end in any way which failed to
make it clear beyond dispute that the responsibility for their collapserested with the French Government. Our wisest course, therefore,would be to use the good offices of the other member countries to seek to convince the French Government that we were prepared tomaintain our efforts to reach agreement with the Community but thatany further negotiations must be confined to the technical issuesoutstanding, must be directed to a speedy and complete solution ofthose issues and must be conducted in good faith by all the parties concerned. It might be preferable that we should take this initiativewith the member countries direct rather than through the agency ofthe Commission; but this was a question which could be decided onlyin the light of the situation in Brussels when discussions were resumed.The Cabinet Invited the Lord Privy Seal to be guided, in the resumeddiscussions in Brussels on 28th January, by the points madein the Prime Minister^ summing up.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,25th January, 1963.
