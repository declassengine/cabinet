(63) 4thConclusions,Minute 4)C.C. 5 (63)The Lord Privy Seal reviewed the course of events during the resumed Ministerial discussions which had started in Brussels on14th January. On Friday, 11th January, the French Foreign Minister,M. Couve de Murville, had emphasised to him that, provided thatthe remaining practical issues were satisfactorily settled, president de Gaulle had neither the power nor the intention to veto UnitedKingdom membership of the European Economic Community. Thenegotiations on 14th January had opened in that context and some progress had initially been made. In particular, the committee under the chairmanship of the Vice-President of the Commission,Dr. Mansholt, had produced, in spite of substantial Frenchamendments, a report which offered the prospect of a settlement inrelation to domestic agriculture. At this point,, however, thediscussions were interrupted by M. Couve de Murville, whohad maintained that the public statement by President de Gaulle on14th January, opposing the United Kingdom&apos;s entry into theCommunity in principle, made it impossible to continue thenegotiations. In subsequent private discussions with the other member countries he had advanced various reasons in justification of this attitude. He had first maintained that no progress had beenmade on the economic issues; but this argument had been rebutted,with the support of Dr. Halistein, the President of the european commission, by appeal to the facts. He had then alleged that wehad contracted certain secret agreements with the United StatesGovernment, designed in effect to transform the european community into an Anglo-Saxon free trade area. The effect of these arguments, however, had been to strengthen the determination of theother five member countries to continue negotiations; and on Friday,18th January, they had declared that, unless discussions on theUnited Kingdom&apos;s entry were maintained, they would refuse to ratify the revised proposals for the association of the African territorieswith the Community, would no longer be willing to consider special arrangements for Algeria and would refuse to hold any meeting ofthe Community. As a result, M. Couve de Murville had retreatedsufficiently far to agree that the Brussels negotiations should bemaintained and should be resumed on 28th January.We had now to consider the various ways in which the situation might develop thereafter. It was possible that Dr. Adenauer, in thelight of the internal and diplomatic pressures to which he would now be subjected, might persuade President de Gaulle to alter his present attitude and to agree that the negotiations should proceedwith French participation. On balance, however, this appearedunlikely, even though a continuation of President de gaulle&apos;s present policy might lead to a refusal on the part of the Federal GermanGovernment to ratify the Franco-German agreement, at present under discussion in Paris, to which both President de Gaulle and dr. Adenauer attached great importance. Alternatively, the FrenchGovernment might refuse to take any effective part in the further negotiations. If so, it would be important to seek to prevent theother five member countries from subscribing to any formal statement which could be held to imply that a decision to suspendnegotiations had been a decision of the Community as a whole ratherthan of the French Government alone. As a third possibility theother five member countries might suggest that the negotiations should be continued without French participation. But, apart fromthe fact that this course would merely prolong the present uncertainty, it would be difficult to impart an air of reality todiscussions conducted under the shadow of an ultimate French veto;and there appeared to be little prospect of advantage in this course,unless the five member countries were genuinely prepared, in the last resort, to annul the Treaty of Rome and to enter into discussions with us with the object of establishing a European Community which
would exclude France but include the United Kingdom. Finally,we must expect that the French Government might seek to revive the concept of a limited economic association between the UnitedKingdom and the Community. It was unlikely, however, that anysuch suggestion would be found to be worth consideration on merits;and it would also revive earlier suspicions that we had no interest in promoting greater political unity in Europe but were seeking onlyour own commercial advantage. Moreover, economic association would not enable us to take any part in the shaping of theCommunity&apos;s policies; and we should be wary of being enticed intoso weak a position.In the light of these considerations we must be prepared to resume discussions in the following week and to seek to maintain our links with the other five member countries as far as possible. Butit was doubtful whether, in the last resort, their determination wouldprevail against the uncompromising opposition of President de gaulle; and it would then become necessary to consider urgently theaction which we should take if negotiations finally broke down.The Minister of Agriculture said that at the time of President de gaulle&apos;s intervention negotiations on agricultural issues had been making good progress. The member countries of the community had at last realised that it had not been our object to obtain specialbenefits for our own agriculture in the long term but merely to deviseacceptable transitional arrangements, supported by arrangements for particular commodities which would have been of benefit to thewhole Community and not to the United Kingdom alone. Therewas little doubt that a satisfactory agricultural agreement would havebeen possible. In present circumstances, however, there would be considerable danger in seeking to continue discussions withoutFrench participation. Any agreement so negotiated would be liableto be rejected by the French Government; and this risk would deprive the proceedings of reality and conviction.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) It had become clear that General de Gaulle&apos;s aim was toestablish a French political hegemony in Europe. In pursuing this objective France would be liable to become increasingly isolated;and the pending agreement between France and Western germany might prove to be only a temporary reconciliation. But it would bea mistake to assume that the attitude of the French President wouldbe greatly affected by any pressure which might be brought upon him either by the Federal German Government or by the other member countries of the Community.(b) It was very doubtful, therefore, whether there would be any real advantage in pursuing discussions with the other five member countries. They had been seriously disturbed by the dictatorialattitude of General de Gaulle; and they might see some advantage in continuing negotiations, if only for the purpose of emphasising theintransigence of the French Government. But their own interests would dissuade them from dissolving the Community and negotiating with ourselves a new Common Market which would exclude France.If so, any agreement which we might reach with them within the context of the Treaty of Rome would be seen to be ultimatelydependent on acceptance by the French Government; and publicopinion in this country, which would have accepted some sacrifice of sectional interests as the price of a comprehensive settlement,would be liable to regard that price as too high in relation toa limited and conditional agreement.(c) Nevertheless, we should not abandon our ultimate objectiveor embark on new policies which would appear to cast doubt on thegenuine nature of our sustained attempt to enter the european community. The measures which we should now be compelled totake should be directed to strengthening our economy, in association with our partners in the North Atlantic Alliance and the European
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,22nd January, 1963.Free Trade Association; and they should depart as little as possible from the policies which we had advocated as a potential member ofthe European Economic Community.(d) It would be unrealistic not to admit that our exclusion fromthe Community represented a diplomatic reverse. But it alsoconstituted a challenge, to which public opinion would respond ifwisely directed. Our situation should be presented as an opportunityto redouble our efforts to promote greater efficiency throughout the economy.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that the intervention by President de Gaulle had been due not to his conviction that the Brussels negotiations had failed but to hisrealisation that they were within sight of success and that suchsuccess would have been incompatible with his ultimate purpose of creating a Franco-German partnership which would dominateEurope to the exclusion of any Anglo-Saxon influence. To this extent the rupture of the negotiations in Brussels could be presented to our advantage. Nevertheless, it was a serious setback to theGovernments policies and it might compel us to reconsider our existing commitments in a wider context. It was important,therefore, that we should not make light of the situation which wouldprobably confront us or appear to adopt alternative policies on thebasis that they would be as advantageous as membership of theEuropean Community. We should now consult our own interests,while refraining from any action which could be represented as anattempt to destroy the Community. The failure of the negotiations1and the harm to European relations which might result should beseen to be the responsibility of the French Government alone.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the points made in their discussion.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Ministers concerned, to give urgent considera-tion to the measures to be taken if the negotiations forthe entry of the United Kingdom into the european economic Community finally broke down.
