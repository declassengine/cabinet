foreign affairs the Yemen(previous reference :C.C. (63) 16thConclusions,Minute 2)Visit of thePresident ofthe UnitedStates2. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that the Yemeniauthorities had now released the party of United Kingdom service personnel who had been detained in the Yemen after inadvertentlycrossing the frontier.The Prime Minister said that his discussions with the Presidentof the United States, President Kennedy, had re-affirmed the closerelationship between the United States and ourselves. So far as theproposed multilateral nuclear force was concerned, he had given theHouse of Commons a full account of developments in his speechduring the debate on foreign affairs on the previous day. It was satisfactory that President Kennedy had been prepared, at least forthe time being, to subordinate this project to the need to secure agreement with the Soviet Union, if possible, on a treaty to bannuclear tests and to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Inthe light of the negotiations for this purpose which were due to beginshortly, it might be desirable to give further consideration to thepossibility that we might take some initiative in the North atlantic treaty Organisation in relation to the control and management of the nuclear forces at the Organisation^ disposal.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.Federation of rhodesia and nyasaland(previous reference :C.C. (63) 39thConclusions,Minute 4)3. The Cabinet took note with satisfaction that the conferenceat Victoria Falls, over which the First Secretary of State had presided,had reached agreement in principle on the terms of the dissolution of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would convey to theFirst Secretary of State their congratulations on the successof the conference on the dissolution of the Federation of rhodesia and Nyasaland.British Guiana        4.   The Colonial Secretary said that the situation in British(Previous        Guiana was still deteriorating. The general strike was now in itsReference:      10th week; racial rioting was increasing; and it had been necessaryC.C. (63) 29th to send additional United Kingdom troops to maintain order. in conclusions,     normal circumstances the Colony would by now have attainedMinute 3)       independence; but Dr. Jagan&apos;s Government was not only Communistin its sympathies but also incapable of maintaining order unaided.No satisfactory alternative Government, however, was in sight; andit might therefore become necessary to suspend the Constitution andto resume direct rule. But, in view of the possible consequences ofsuch a course in terms not only of developments in British GuianaParliament 1    jhe Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
itself but also of our relations with other members of theCommonwealth and with the United Nations, he was considering whether he should personally visit the Colony and examine thesituation before advising the Cabinet on the action to be taken. TheUnited States Government had already indicated the concern withwhich they would view the emergence of an independent Communistregime on the mainland of South America; and their interest in thefuture of British Guiana would have to be borne in mind.In discussion it was suggested that it might be helpful to exchangeviews on the problem with the Government of Trinidad, who appearedto have dealt successfully with inter-racial problems which were very similar to those which had arisen in British Guiana.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Colonial Secretary.MaltaIndependence(previous reference :C.C. (61) 11thConclusions,Minute 4)5. i he Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the colonial secretary (C. (63) 112) about the attainment of independence byMalta.The Colonial Secretary said that in August 1962, the Governmentof Malta, with the support of all the principal political parties in the island, had formally asked for independence. For this purposearrangements had been made to convene a conference, to which all parties now represented in the Maltese Legislature would be invited,in the second half of July.Three main issues would be likely to arise at this conference;first, whether the official status of the Roman Catholic religion shouldbe maintained; second, whether Malta should be granted membership of the Commonwealth; third, whether the Constitution should bemonarchical or republican. It would undoubtedly be the wish of themajority of the inhabitants of Malta that the Roman Catholic religionshould remain the official religion of the Island; and we had no reasonto dissent, despite certain practical difficulties which would persist inrelation to matters such as marriage and divorce. Nor should there be any objection to accepting an independent Malta as a member ofthe Commonwealth. A monarchical Constitution, however, althoughundoubtedly supported by a majority of the Maltese population,would be opposed by the Maltese Labour Party under the leadership of Mr. Mintoff; and it would be unfortunate if the monarchy weremade a party political issue after Malta became independent.It would be necessary to conclude a Defence Agreement withthe Government of Malta under which they would agree that weshould retain the right to station forces in the Island and that military facilities would not be granted to any other country without ourconsent. In order to ensure the validity of this agreement and toreduce the risk of its repudiation by a future Government of Maltait would be advisable that it should not be concluded until after the island had become independent; and it might be desirable that theGovernment of the independent State should seek the endorsement of a referendum before signing it. It would also be necessary that weshould undertake to provide continuing financial aid to Malta on a scale still to be determined.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) It would clearly be desirable that Malta should retain, after independence, a monarchical Constitution. If necessary, however, thequestion could be considered again when the forthcoming conference had provided an opportunity to test the strength of Maltese feelingon the issues involved.
GovernmentOfficesDispersal ofGovernmentWork from london (TheFlemmingReport)(previous reference :C.C. (63) 29thConclusions,Minute 4)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the chief secretary, Treasury (C. (63) 111), to which was annexed a report bySir Gilbert Flemming on the dispersal of Government staffs from london.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that Sir Gilbert Flemminghad recommended that work for 14,000 Government staffs now inLondon should be moved out of the London area altogether andthat work for a further 5,400 should be moved from central london to the outskirts. In principle these recommendations were right andshould be accepted, although in certain cases the details would need to be further discussed with the Ministers concerned. Meanwhile, theproposals should be discussed with the National and DepartmentalStaff Sides; and a statement on the lines of the draft annexed toC. (63) 111 should be made in Parliament before the Recess.The Governments action in relation to their own staffs shouldbe reinforced by a continuing effort to persuade private industry totake corresponding action; and the Ministers concerned should seek to persuade the nationalised industries for which they were responsible to make a significant contribution to the policy of dispersal.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) It could be argued that it would be wrong to accept theloss of efficiency implied by some of the transfers proposed in theC.C. 44 (63)(b) The maintenance of United Kingdom forces in Malta wasno longer a paramount defence interest in itself, although it mightconstitute a convenient means of providing economic aid to the Island.The main purpose of the proposed Defence Agreement would be toprevent the Soviet Government from obtaining a military footing in malta. From this point of view it was open to question whether theagreement should not be concluded until the Island had become independent; and it was doubtfully v/ise to submit the issue to a referendum. On the other hand it had already been made clear both to the Government of Malta and to Mr. Mintoff that any Sovietintrusion into the Island would not be tolerated either by the UnitedKingdom or by the other member countries of the North atlantic treaty Organisation; and it was improbable that any Government of malta would court the risks involved in entertaining any policy of thiskind, particularly if the Defence Agreement had been endorsed bya referendum.(c) In any event the only alternative course would be to reject the unanimous request of all the main political parties in Malta thatthe Island should now be granted independence; and the political consequences of such action would clearly be unacceptable.(d) Consideration should be given during the conference to thepreservation in the new Constitution of a right of appeal to the JudicialCommittee of the Privy Council or to some alternative judicialtribunal, perhaps of a Commonwealth character.The Cabinet (1) Approved, subject to the points made in their discussion,the proposals in C. (63) 112 for the attainment of independence by Malta.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to report further, inthe light of the proceedings of the forthcoming conferenceon the terms of independence for Malta, on the retentionof a monarchical Constitution by the Island after independence.
Flemming report if the accommodation vacated by Government staffswere subsequently occupied by private industry and the congestion in Central London remained unrelieved. On the other hand theGovernment could not expect to succeed in their efforts to dissuadeindustry from concentrating its operations in London unless theywere themselves seen to be giving a lead in this respect. Moreover,the dispersal of Government staffs would not only make it possibleto surrender accommodation for which very high rents were at present being paid but also relieve the strain on public services in London,particularly transport.(b) When it became necessary to decide the areas to which work should be moved from London the claims of areas of high unemployment, particularly the North-East and Scotland, should beborne in mind. It had already been decided that the Savings CertificateDivision of the Post Office, which employed about 2,200 staff, shouldbe moved to Durham; and for administrative reasons it would benecessary to move the work of the Post Office Savings Bank, involvingabout 7,500 staff, to an area within reasonable distance of Harrogate.It would therefore be right to give special consideration to the claims of Scotland in deciding where to place work from other departments which, under the Flemming proposals, would be moved away fromthe London area altogether and would involve some 800-1,000 staff.(c) In the case of small units of staff it would be right to giverather more weight to the inconvenience and loss of efficiency whichmight be entailed, since their dispersal would not make any significant contribution to the relief of congestion in London.(d) The removal of the Public Records Office from London,although not mentioned in the Flemming Report, might warrantexamination.(e) In view of the current reorganisation of the service departments Sir Gilbert Flemming had made no proposals for the dispersal of their work. At a later stage, however, when the new defence organisation had taken shape, the possibilities of removingsome of its work from London should be reviewed.(/) A public statement about the dispersal of Government staffsmight give rise to a certain amount of criticism and debate, particularly if it were not linked with some indication that the government intended, by reconstructing accommodation in the Whitehall area,to secure a more efficient concentration of staff who must remainin London. It would not be possible to dispense with a statementaltogether; but it might best be made by way of a reply to a writtenParliamentary Question.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposals in C. (63) 111 relatingto the dispersal of Government staffs.(2) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in discussing with theMinisters concerned the relocation of work which wouldbe moved outside the London area altogether, togive special attention to the needs of areas of high unemployment, particularly in the North-East and inScotland.(3) Took note that the Chief Secretary, Treasury, would discuss further with the Ministers concerned those recommendations of the Flemming Report on which agreement had not yet been reached.(4) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in consultationwith the Minister without Portfolio, to give furtherconsideration to the form, timing and content of thestatement about the Flemming Report which it wouldbe necessary to make in the House of Commons beforethe Recess.
9 9 (1&amp; o uWelfareServicesSchool Meals(previous reference :C.C. (62) 4thConclusions,Minute 4)The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Education and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland to circulate a memorandum indicating howlocal authorities exercised their discretion to remit chargesat present and what effect the introduction of a uniformmodel scale of remission might be expected to have,particularly in regard to the more vulnerable families.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a later date.Staggered 8.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the holidays        President of the Board of Trade (C. (63) 108), to which was annexeda draft White Paper about staggered holidays.7. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Education (C. (63) 110) and the Secretary of State for Scotland(C. (63) 113) on the charge for school meals.The Minister of Education said that it would be desirable toincrease the charge for school meals from Is. to Is. 3d., with effect from 30th September, in order to meet the rise in cost since the charge was last reviewed in 1957. Since then the cost of living had risen by12J per cent and average earnings by 30 per cent. It was impossibleto justify the automatic increase in the cash subsidy to parents whichwould result if the charge for school meals were not raised; and, inview of the strong upward trend of expenditure on education,economies must be secured wherever possible. The estimated savingresulting from the proposed increase in the charge would be 6-7 million. Local authorities had discretion to reduce or to remitcharges in case of hardship. The criticism which the increase would inevitably evoke should be largely disarmed if the Government tookthis opportunity to introduce a uniform model scale of remission, asa means both of reducing disparities in local authority practice and of protecting families in genuine need.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that, while not dissentingfrom the proposal in principle, he thought it unwise to introduce anincreased charge in Scotland on the date suggested. The Scottisheconomy was recovering only slowly from the recent recession; andseasonal unemployment would be liable to reappear in the autumn.The increased charge was likely to bear hardly on the larger families,particularly in view of the increasing number of children who wouldhave to take meals away from home as a result of the closure of localschools. The introduction of a model scale for the remission of charges would not necessarily mitigate hardship in Scotland, where localauthorities already gave remission generously. The saving resultingfrom the proposal, which would be less than  1 million in Scotland,would not justify a measure likely to affect adversely a high proportionof Scottish households.In discussion there was general agreement that, if a change wasto be made, it should be made quickly. The longer the 1957 charge was allowed to remain unaltered, the more difficult it would becometo change it; and the disturbing increase in public expenditure as awhole suggested that even relatively small economies should not be ignored. On the other hand an increase in the charge was likely to result in appreciably fewer children taking the school meal; and thenet saving might not be worth the criticism that the increase would attract. The decision must depend to some extent on the effectiveness of the proposed uniform scale of remission in protecting from hardshipnot only the families of the unemployed but also large families with low earnings.
The President of the Board of Trade said that the Governmenthad for some time been under pressure to alleviate the uneconomicand inconvenient concentration of holidays in July and August.Consultation with interested bodies had indicated that possibleremedies depended largely on the willingness of many organisations,particularly the authorities responsible for conducting schoolexaminations, to make radical changes. But it had also suggested thatthere was a reasonable chance that these changes would be acceptedif the Government took some initiative to deal with the problem.As a first step, therefore, it would be helpful to focus public attentionon the issues involved by publishing a White Paper on the lines ofthe draft annexed to C. (63) 108. This would not commit theGovernment to any specific action; but it would carry the implication that, given adequate public support, the Government would seek tocarry the matter further.Among the possibilities canvassed in the White Paper was achange in the dates of the Whitsun and August Bank Holidays. Ofthese the former was the more important, since the holiday periodcould not be extended unless the main school examinations were concluded earlier in the year than at present; and this, in turn, couldnot be arranged unless the Whitsun Bank Holiday, which had hithertotended to interrupt the examination period, was itself moved. the churches had been consulted in 1948 about the possibility of altering the date of this holiday and, with the exception of the Roman catholic church, had raised no objection, provided that the name of the daywas changed in order to dissociate it from the religious festival.It would be desirable that the White Paper should be publishedshortly before the Recess, when the period of maximum holidaycongestion would be approaching, and that, in announcing it in theHouse of Commons, he should indicate that, if public reaction were favourable, he would establish a committee to examine the necessary changes in greater detail.In discussion some doubt was expressed whether the Governmentwould be wise to draw attention to a difficult problem for which theycould offer no clear or certain solution. Moreover, it was arguable that a more drastic reorganisation than the White Paper envisagedwould ultimately be required. It might be desirable, for example,to arrange that the academic year, the financial year and theParliamentary year should all start in January. On the other handpublication of the White Paper would indicate that the Governmentwere aware of public anxiety about the problem; and, by stimulatingdiscussion, it might create the conditions in which all the various interests involved would be prepared to co-operate with theGovernment in a fresh attempt to overcome the obstacles to a morerational and orderly holiday season.The Cabinet-Approved the publication, before the Recess, of a white paper on staggered holidays on the lines of the draft annexed to C. (63) 108.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,4th July, 1963.
