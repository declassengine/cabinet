(60) 34thConclusions,Minute 5)2. The Foreign Secretary said that the recent revolution in Syriaclosely resembled the coup d&apos;etat in Iraq in February. The new government in Damascus appeared to be in effective control of thecountry; and we had therefore extended formal recognition to it.Since some of its members were believed to support Egyptian policies,the position of Saudi Arabia might become increasingly precarious.The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that the Royalistforces appeared to have abandoned the south-eastern part of the yemen and were making little headway in the north. Therepresentative of the President of the United States. Mr. Bunker, whohad recently discussed the situation with the Government of SaudiArabia, had ascertained that the latter might be prepared to abstain from further intervention in the Yemen if the Egyptian Governmentwould agree to bring hostilities to an end and thereafter to withdraw their troops over a period of time. There was no action which we ourselves could usefully take in these circumstances; but. since it must remain our objective to eliminate Egyptian influence from the Yemen,we should continue to support the United States initiative.The Cabinet (1) Took note of these statements by the Foreign Secretary.The Foreign Secretary said that the Government of Somalia hadbeen offended by our refusal to sanction, at this stage, the secession ofthe Somalis in the Northern Frontier District of Kenya and were considering whether they should break off diplomatic relations withthe United Kingdom. It was for consideration whether, in thesecircumstances, we should seek to promote discussions between theparties concerned or whether, at the appropriate moment, we shouldinvoke the assistance of the United Nations.The Commonwealth Secretary said that, during his recent visit to Kenya, he had arranged that the Northern Frontier District shouldconstitute a separate and additional Region within the Colony. This,however, was only an interim measure, designed to hold the situationuntil the forthcoming elections in Kenya had taken place. There was some hope that the new Government of Kenya which would takeoffice as a result of the elections would realise that, if they sought toretain the Northern Frontier District against the will of its Somaliinhabitants, they would incur heavy expenditure in policing theterritory and subsidising its administrative services. It was not impossible, therefore, that they would eventually agree to allow the somalis to secede.In discussion, it was suggested that, even if no useful action asregards the Northern Frontier District could be taken until after theelections in Kenya, we should seek to devise some means of dissuadingthe Government of Somalia from breaking off diplomatic relations in the interval, possibly by assuring them that we should be ready totake part, at the appropriate moment, in the process of further consultation which they were known to have in mind.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theCommonwealth Secretary, to consider whether any further steps might be taken to prevent a breach of diplomatic relations with the Government of Somalia.C.C. 16 (63)Parliament j.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.
Law ofthe Sea(previous reference:C.C. (63) 12thConclusions,Minute 2)UnitedKingdomFisheryLimits3.   The Cabinet had before them (i) a memorandum by the Lord Chancellor (C. (63) 42) on theaction required to extend United Kingdom fishery limits;(ii) a memorandum by the Foreign Secretary (C. (63) 47) abouta proposal by the Canadian Government that a new international conference should be convened to discussthe breadth of the territorial sea and of fishing limits the Lord Chancellor said that the Committee on the Law of theSea had considered the timing of the action required to achieve theGovernment^ aim of extending our fishery limits to six miles. Onthe assumption that we should not secure this objective by agreement,our freedom of unilateral action was inhibited by two Treaties theNorth Sea Fisheries Convention of 1882 between Germany, Belgium,Denmark, France, the Netherlands and ourselves; and theAnglo-French Convention of 1839 (together with the regulations made thereunder in 1843). The former provided that the fishermenof each of the contracting parties should enjoy the exclusive right offishery within three miles from low water mark. If we were to extendour fishery limits, it would be necessary to give the prescribed periodof one year&apos;s notice of termination of this Treaty; and, provided thatwe did so before 15th May, termination would take effect on 15th May,1964. In default of action by 15th May, the Treaty could not be terminated until 15th May, 1965. The Anglo-French Convention of1839 regulated the limits within which the general right of fishery onthe coasts of the United Kingdom and France was exclusively reserved to the subjects of the two countries. The limits were defined as three miles from low water mark. We could not lawfully extend our limitsin the face of this Convention and the related Regulations; but theycontained no provision for termination. Nevertheless, it was arguable that the 1843 Regulations could be terminated on reasonablenotice.In these circumstances it was proposed that we should give noticeof termination of the Convention of 1882 before 15th May and thatat the same time we should give one year&apos;s notice to the FrenchGovernment, terminating the 1843 Regulations on 23rd June, 1964.If so, we should at the earliest possible date convey our decision, witha full explanation of the reasons, to the other members of theCommonwealth concerned, the Irish Republic, the signatories of the1882 Convention, the United States and the other members of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation.In discussion, the following main points were made:(a) Measures on the lines proposed might be interpreted as being directed especially against France in retaliation for the action of theFrench Government in preventing our entry into the european economic Community. The French Government might seek to challenge before the International Court the validity of ourtermination of the 1843 Regulations; and there was a serious risk that the Court would endorse their view. Nevertheless, this risk mustbe accepted.(b) We should proceed with the extension of our own fishery limits whether or not we reached agreement with the danish government in the current negotiations about the proposed extensionof the limits round the Faroes. But we ought not to give those sections of our fishing interests which would be damaged by theextension of the Faroes limits any ground for supposing that unilateral action on our part had prevented an agreement. It would thereforebe preferable to refrain from any overt action to terminate the existingTreaties until the negotiations about the Faroes were concluded.(c) On the other hand, we must allow sufficient time to consult the other countries concerned, particularly the commonwealth countries, before giving notice of termination on 15th May. If, asappeared likely, the negotiations about the Faroes were not concludeduntil 28th April, the interval would be unduly short.
NATOCouncilMeeting(previous reference:C.C. (62) 32ndConclusions,Minute 3)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (63) 44) about the development of a North atlantic treaty Organisation (NATO) nuclear force.The Foreign Secretary said that we had suggested in the courseof the Nassau negotiations, and were now developing in NATO, the concept of a NATO nuclear force, consisting of national contributions under the control of a Trusteeship Group. It was essential to thisconcept that tactical nuclear weapons should be accepted ascontributing to the force, since only in this way would it be possiblefor European countries other than the United Kingdom and theUnited States to participate. The United States Government, onthe other hand, favoured the development of an internationallyowned and internationally manned deterrent force, consisting of surface ships or submarines armed with Polaris missiles. countries participating in this force would be required to contribute to its cost,which might average $600 million a year over a period of 10 years.The United Kingdom and United States proposals were notmutually exclusive.   They could be considered as complementaryC.C. 16 (63)(d) It was for consideration whether we should confine theextension of our limits to six miles or should enlarge them, over aperiod of years, to twelve miles, claiming sovereignty over theterritorial waters in the first six miles and exclusive fishing rights inthe second six miles as well. This question might deserve further examination. But it appeared probable that we could only extendour fishery limits by extending the limits of our territorial sea to thesame extent; and there were cogent objections, on grounds of defence policy, to our appearing to acquiesce in principle in a twelve-mile limit to territorial waters.(e) Even a six-mile limit to territorial waters in the neighbourhoodof, e.g., Gibraltar and Hong Kong could involve us in difficulty if wewere compelled to concede that countries enjoyed the same exclusiverights in relation to their air space as in relation to their territorial waters. There would be advantage, therefore, in seeking, if possible,to bring the law of the air into conformity with the law of the sea inthe sense of establishing a right of innocent passage for aircraftcorresponding to the right of innocent passage of ships at sea. Onthe other hand, there was little prospect that this objective could infact be achieved.The Cabinet (1) .A.greed in principle that we should seek to give notice, before15th May, 1963, of termination of the Regulations of 1843,made under the Anglo-French Convention of 1839, andof the North Sea Fisheries Convention of 1882.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with the LordChancellor, the Home Secretary, the commonwealth secretary, the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries andthe Secretary of State for Scotland to give furtherconsideration to the precise timing of the action to betaken under Conclusion (1) in the light of developments in the current negotiations about the extension of the fishing limits round the Faroes and of the need to giveadequate warning of our intentions to the other countrieslikely to be affected by our termination of the Treaties.(3) Agreed that the United Kingdom should not support theproposal by the Canadian Government to promote a new international conference to discuss the breadth of theterritorial sea and of fishing limits.
means of securing our common objective of anticipating pressure from the Federal Government of Germany to possess and controlits own national nuclear force. We believe that the Federal GermanGovernment would accept the degree of control over a NATO nuclear force which they would derive from membership of a TrusteeshipGroup, exercising peacetime supervision over the force and givingguidance to its military authorities. The United States Government,on the other hand, believed that nothing less than participation in the physical manning of a nuclear force would satisfy German aspirationsin the longer term. Under both concepts the credibility of the NATOdeterrent might be diminished (whether because, under the UnitedKingdom concept, it might be held that the Trusteeship Group wouldbe unable to reach decisions in emergency or because, under theUnited States concept, a veto on the use of the internationally manned force would remain with the countries contributing the warheads).But this would not necessarily be the case; and, on balance, we should accept the risk.The United States Government were at present discussing thecreation of an internationally manned force direct with theGovernments concerned and not in a NATO forum. We had alreadydeveloped our ideas about the military aspects of a multinationalforce in the North Atlantic Council; but there had been littlediscussion of the political control of such a force. He intended toattend a meeting of the Council on 20th March, at which he would explain the lines on which we should hope to see political control ofthe force developed and would also explain the general background ofour Atlantic and European policy.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The principal objective of both United States and UnitedKingdom policy was to prevent the Federal German government from obtaining the possession and control of its own nuclear force.Participation by the Federal German Government in a NATO nuclear force, to which they were financially and politically committed, should help to reduce this risk. But it was not necessarily the only means tothis end; and the question would require further examination in the context of possible developments in international relations.(b) The United States proposals for an internationally manned force were unlikely to find acceptance unless the United Kingdomcontributed to it. The United States Government were at presentsuggesting that we might contribute between  5 and 10 per cent of thetotal cost, a figure which took account both of the contribution whichwe had already made to NATO nuclear forces by assigning theV-bombers and of the cost of the British Polaris fleet. Even on this basis, however, our liability might rise to  100 million or more.(c) But it should not be assumed that we should in fact beprepared to make a contribution of this order to an internationallymanned force; and it would be important to avoid any commitment to do so. It would be equally important, however, not to discouragethe United States Government by adopting a wholly negative attitude.We should therefore acquiesce in their developing their ideas, inconsultation with other NATO Governments, to the greatest extentcompatible with the avoidance, at the present stage, of any specificundertakings on our part. It would also be desirable not to discourage the Federal Government of Germany from active participation in the development of the United States concept, whichthey seemed at present inclined to support.The Cabinet-Took note that, in the light of their discussion, the PrimeMinister would consider further with the Foreign secretary the attitude to be adopted by the United Kingdom at themeeting of the North Atlantic Council on 20th March.
5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theForeign Secretary (C. (63) 43) on the financing of United Nationspeace-keeping operations.The Foreign Secretary said that any suggestion that the costs of future peace-keeping operations should be met by compulsorycontributions from the members of the United Nations organisation would probably be rejected by the Soviet and French Governments,who had hitherto refused to make any contribution at all to expenditure incurred in connexion with such operations. If theypersisted in this attitude, they would be liable to forfeit their rightto vote in the Organisation in 1964; and a critical situation would arise. From a political point of view there would be advantage indeferring a development of this kind until at least the beginning of1964. He had therefore suggested a compromise scheme, underwhich the costs of future operations would be met partly bycompulsory and partly by voluntary contributions. It was not impossible that the Soviet and French Governments would accept ascheme on these lines, which would have the added advantage olmaking it feasible for the United Kingdom to refuse to contribute,beyond their compulsory quota, to operations of which theGovernment disapproved.The Lord Chancellor said that, while he did not exclude thepossibility of voluntary contributions, no scheme which relied on them would be consistent either with the terms of the United nations charter or with the recent judgment of the International Court.Moreover, if voluntary contributions failed to cover the full cost of operations in any given period, the General Assembly would still havethe power to make compulsory assessments to meet the balance andwould undoubtedly do so. Nor would a scheme on the lines proposedby the Foreign Secretary necessarily reduce the risk that Soviet andFrench intransigence might provoke a crisis in the Organisation.The Soviet and French Governments were already in default inrespect of current operations, whereas the scheme now underdiscussion was only intended to apply to future operations. Unless,therefore, the Soviet and French Governments were prepared to makeretrospective contributions, they would in any event be liable to lose their vote at the beginning of 1964. For these reasons he preferred anarrangement whereby the General Assembly, when initiating a peace-keeping operation in future, would impose an initial limit onthe expenditure to be financed by compulsory contributions and wouldthereafter have to renew this authority if further expenditure were required.In discussion, there was general agreement that a scheme basedon compulsory contributions on the lines suggested by the LordChancellor would not only be consistent with the provisions of the charter but would also have the political advantage of making it possible for the General Assembly to review the scope and characterof an operation before authorising further expenditure. It would therefore be appropriate that we should initially sponsor anarrangement on these lines but should be prepared, in the absence of support, to suggest, as a possible compromise solution, a scheme basedon a mixture of compulsory and voluntary contributions on the lines suggested by the Foreign Secretary.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to instruct the UnitedKingdom Permanent Representative at the United nations to suggest to the Working Group considering the futurefinancing of United Nations peace-keeping operations theadoption of a solution on the lines suggested by the LordChancellor in C. (63) 43 and to authorise him, if that scheme commanded insufficient support, to put forward thealternative proposals described in the same memorandum.
6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (63) 48), reporting the conclusionsof the Wages Committee on recommendations by the Review body on the remuneration of National Health Service doctors and dentists.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Review Body had recommended an increase of 14 per cent in the present rates of remuneration of doctors and hospital dentists. This increase was intended to be valid for a three-year period, although the Review Bodywere aware that the resulting remuneration would be too high at thebeginning of the period and too low at the end of it. But they believedthat the present rates had been overtaken much earlier in the previousthree-year period than had been originally foreseen; and they haddated the next period not from 1st January, 1963, as would be strictlycorrect, but from 1st April. Their figure of 14 per cent thereforerelated, as they had themselves made clear, to trends which had occurred over a period &quot; much in excess &quot; of three years; and theyhad stated that they expected the new level to remain appropriate fora period of three years &quot; at least &quot;. In these circumstances it wouldbe reasonable for the Government to regard the recommendations asrelating to a period of approximately four years and as implying,therefore, an average increase of no more than about 5\ per cent per annum.The Wages Committee had felt that there would be no advantage in seeking from the Review Body a detailed explanation of theircalculations or in attaching reservations to the governments acceptance of the recommendations. The best course would be to announce acceptance as soon as possible and to ensure thatprominence was given to the Governments interpretation of theperiod to which the recommendations related. Since the review body had evidently felt some doubt about the triennial basis whichthey had adopted on the recommendation of the Royal Commissionon Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration the Government might, ata later stage, make an informal offer to discuss this aspect of thequestion with them; but no publicity should be given to this offer.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in general agreementwith the conclusions reached by the Wages Committee.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposal in C. (63) 48 that the remuneration of National Health Service doctors and dentists should beincreased by 14 per cent with effect from 1st April, 1963.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister of health and the Minister without Portfolio, to submit to thePrime Minister the draft of an announcement of theGovernments decision and to make appropriatearrangements for its public presentation.7. The First Secretary of State said that the Committee on there organisation of the Railways, of which he was chairman, had madea preliminary examination of the Report of the Railways Boardentitled &quot; The Reshaping of British Railways &quot;. The recommendationsof this Report, which was based on a thorough analysis of theproblem, would involve drastic alterations in the existing system and substantial curtailment of services, especially in the more remote partsof the country. But it also oontained positive proposals of great value, which held out the prospect that in due course the Board&apos;annual deficit of about  150 million could be eliminated.   The
Committee had therefore concluded that, in spite of the considerableobjection which would be raised in the areas affected by the proposals to curtail existing services, the Boards approach to the problem should be accepted, as being in accord with the Governmenfs policyof promoting growth and modernisation in the economy.The chairman of the Board, Dr. Beeching, would announce that day that the Report would be published on 27th March; and theCommittee had therefore considered in what terms a statement mightsimultaneously be made on the Governmenfs behalf and what arrangements should be made to ensure appropriate presentation ofthe Report to the public. The statement should refer to the social and other factors involved in the closure of passenger lines and should give examples of the types of service to which special considerationsmight apply. It should also indicate the advantages to be derivedfrom the Board&apos;s constructive proposals for the more efficienttransport of freight; and it should seek to set in proper perspectivethe delicate question of staff redundancy.In discussion, the following points were raised:(a) The list of stations and lines which it was proposed to closewould give rise to much public protest. The Governmenfs aim,however, should be to convince the public that, while changes on thescale required could not be made without causing individualinconvenience, an efficient railway system would make an invaluablecontribution to the economic well-being of the country.(b) The eventual elimination of the Board&apos;s annual deficit wouldbe of considerable benefit to the Exchequer. But the emphasis shouldbe laid not so much on the Governments concern to make the railwayspay as on the fact that losses were incurred at present because thesystem was not adapted to modern needs. Moreover, an economicrailway system would facilitate a co-ordinated transport policy, whichwould enable adequate services to be provided on the roads as wellas on the railways.(c) Special publicity should be given to the map appended tothe Report, which illustrated the extensive network of bus services,and to the willingness of the operators concerned to expand these services in areas where railway services were withdrawn.(d) The examination by Transport Users&apos; ConsultativeCommittees of objections to proposals for closure of passenger lines would be a lengthy process; and during this time sectional and localdiscontent would be liable to obscure the favourable impression whicheffective initial presentation of the Report might create. Theprocedure, however, was statutory; and it would not be practicable to alter it at this stage. But consideration should be given to other means of accelerating it, e.g., by increasing the number of Committees.(e) In addition, piecemeal announcement of decisions aboutclosures should be avoided, so far as possible. If these decisions could be announced in groups, it would be easier to present convincingarguments in their defence and to limit the amount of parliamentary criticism to which they would be liable to give rise.(/) Steps should also be taken to encourage industrial and other interests to give public support to the proposals in the Report oneconomic grounds.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Railways Board&apos;s Report on &quot;TheReshaping of British Railways &quot; would be published on27th March, 1963.
(2) Invited the Minister of Transport, in consultation with theMinisters concerned, to submit for their consideration,at a meeting in the following week, the draft of a statement to be made on behalf of the Government on the dateof publication, together with proposals for securing themost effective public presentation of the proposals in theReport and for ensuring their implementation, where appropriate, as rapidly as possible.Valuationfor Rating(previous reference:C.C. (63) 15thConclusions,Minute 5)8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Housing and Local Government (C. (63) 46) on the form and scopeof a possible inquiry into the rating system.The Minister of Housing said that, in view of the continuingParliamentary concern on this subject, it might be wise to institutean inquiry into the rating system in order to demonstrate that theGovernment were alive to the issues involved and were not deferringinvestigation until the burden of rates became intolerable. It shouldbe possible to arrange a factual inquiry, which would examine theprobable trend of local government expenditure over the next fewyears and its impact on the rates; the effect of rates on different classesof the community in different areas; and perhaps also the practicability of devising alternative sources of local revenue.In discussion, it was agreed that much of the pressure for an inquiry derived from anxiety about the effects of revaluation and rising rate calls on local or individual interests; but, if an inquirywere instituted, it should probably extend also to the underlyingproblem of the most appropriate means of financing local government services. It might be inexpedient, however, to permit the inquiry toinclude an examination of the methods by which Exchequer grartswere paid to local authorities, since this might delay the current negotiations with local authorities for the incorporation of higlw ay-grants in the general grant. It would also be necessary to cons.derhow far the Government could disclose their estimate of the probabletrend of expenditure on the major local authority services, particularlyeducation, without depriving themselves of freedom of manoeuvrein future negotiations with the local authorities.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Home Secretary, the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster, the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Ministerof Health, the Minister of Housing and the Minister without portfolio, to consider, in the light of their discussion, the composition and terms of reference of an inquiry into the rating system and to report to the Cabinet at a meeting inthe following week.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,14th March, 1963.
