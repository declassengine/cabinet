SubjectFederation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland
2i ^ ^Federation of rhodesia and nyasaland(previous reference:C.C. (63) 32ndConclusions,Minute 4)2833-3a 2The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the first secretary of State (C. (63) 85) about Southern Rhodesia, togetherwith a note by the Prime Minister (C. (63) 86) to which were appendedcopies of exchanges of letters about Southern Rhodesia between thePrime Minister, the President of Tanganyika and the Prime Ministerof Sierra Leone.The First Secretary of State said that any attempt on our partunilaterally to dissolve the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland would be bound to result in an unacceptable situation and that itmust therefore remain our objective to promote a conference on the dissolution of the Federation, which all the Governments concerned would be prepared to attend. The Federal Government and theGovernment of Southern Rhodesia had refused to participate in sucha conference unless Southern Rhodesia were assured of attainingindependence; on the other hand, the Government of northern rhodesia would refuse to take part if we conceded too much to southern Rhodesia&apos;s insistence on this subject. We had thereforesought to devise some compromise between these extreme positions and we had so far succeeded as to persuade the Government ofSouthern Rhodesia that independence for the Colony should coincide with, rather than antedate, the dissolution of the Federation andthat it should be preceded by discussions on the terms of independence.These discussions would begin on 27th May. If they were notconcluded before the conference on the dissolution of the federation was convened, they would have to be resumed subsequently.The Government of Southern Rhodesia, who would berepresented in these discussions by the Prime Minister, Mr. WinstonField, would expect us to recognise that independence for SouthernRhodesia was already overdue and that, in the light of the mandateon which they had been elected, there could be no question of theiraccepting, as a condition of independence for the Colony, any radicalreform of the present Constitution. Nevertheless, they might be persuaded to acquiesce in some measure of advance towards greaterpolitical representation for the African section of the population and some wider degree of non-discrimination. It might be possible,for example, to secure their acceptance of some reduction in the qualifications for the &quot; A &quot; Roll franchise, in order to increase thenumber of African voters on this Roll. We might also explore withthem the possibility of increasing the number of &quot; B &quot; Roll seats orof enlarging the franchise in relation to those seats. In addition,Mr. Field had suggested the abolition of the system of cross voting,which had been devised in order to enable electors on each Roll to influence the election of candidates for seats on the other Roll. the elimination of this system, however, would be contrary to the spiritof the new Constitution; and we should probably be unwise to entertain proposals for this purpose. We should rather seek to secure from Mr. Field some declaration of intention in regard to such issues as racial discrimination, the functions of the Constitutional Counciland a liberal development of the Constitution itself.A settlement on these lines would be very unlikely to satisfyPan-African sentiment. On the other hand, the government&apos;s supporters in the House of Commons might appreciate that it represented the greatest measure of concession by Mr. Field whichwe could realistically expect. It would therefore be appropriate toinform Parliament forthwith that, in the light of recent discussions with the Governments in Central Africa about the immediate stepsto be taken to secure consideration of the problems involved in the orderly dissolution of the Federation, the Government now proposedto arrange for a conference to be convened in Central Africa inthe second half of June and had also invited the Prime Minister ofSouthern Rhodesia to visit London on 27th May to continue discussions on the future independence of Southern Rhodesia.
In discussion, the following main points were made:(a) All the available evidence suggested that, if we grantedindependence to Southern Rhodesia without stipulating that thepresent Constitution should be amended on more liberal lines, theother members of the Commonwealth would not be prepared toaccept her as a fellow member. Even the older members of theCommonwealth would probably take this attitude and would refuseto support us in facing the inevitable criticism in the United Nations.The Afro-Asian members might well decide to leave theCommonwealth entirely.(b) On the other hand, it was very unlikely that we should succeed in persuading the Government of Southern Rhodesia toaccept constitutional changes on the scale which would be requiredto satisfy the other members of the Commonwealth, particularly in africa.(c) We should therefore avoid committing ourselves, during the initial stages of the forthcoming discussions, to the view that any specific changes would be adequate justification of the grant of independence to Southern Rhodesia. We should confine ourselves to warning Mr. Field that it was our practice not to concedeindependence to a territory until arrangements had been made toensure fully representative government; and we should leave him totake the initiative in making proposals for this purpose.(d) It would probably be advisable thereafter to seek to adjourn the discussions until the conference on the dissolution of theFederation had taken place. We might represent to Mr. Field thatthis course would be in Southern Rhodesia&apos;s ultimate interest since,once the Federation had been effectively dissolved, we should bebetter placed to consider the independence of Southern Rhodesia asa separate entity.(e) For the same reason, we should emphasise to Mr. Field thatit would be to the advantage of Southern Rhodesia to consider thepossibility of maintaining economic links with the northern territories and that this possibility would be best explored in the context of the dissolution of the Federation.(/) If, nevertheless, the discussions reached a point at which it became clear that such constitutional changes as the Governmentof Southern Rhodesia were prepared to contemplate were unlikely to be accepted by the rest of the Commonwealth as an adequatebasis for future Southern Rhodesian membership of theCommonwealth, we should consider frankly consulting the other member countries about the dilemma which we faced in seeking to bargain with a Government which, for all practical purposes, was already independent and was not susceptible to any form of direct control or intervention by ourselves.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that the overriding consideration must be the maintenance of the unity of theCommonwealth; and we must avoid putting ourselves in a position inwhich we should be compelled, in effect, to choose between SouthernRhodesia and the rest of the Commonwealth. We should thereforerefrain from committing ourselves in the initial discussions to acceptingany particular degree of constitutional change as sufficient to justifyus in granting independence to the Colony; and we should retain our freedom of action to consider Mr. Field&apos;s own proposals ontheir merits and to consult the rest of the Commonwealth, if we sodecided, about their adequacy.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the First Secretary of State to inform Parliamentof the Governments intentions as regards thearrangements to be made for discussion of the orderly
dissolution of the Federation of Rhodesia and nyasaland and the grant of independence to SouthernRhodesia.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State to be guided, in his forthcoming discussions with the Prime Minister ofSouthern Rhodesia about the terms of independence for southern Rhodesia, by the considerations which had emerged during their discussion.(3) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to consider, inconsultation with the Leader of the House and the chief whip, how the Governments supporters in the Houseof Commons might best be brought to appreciate thestrength of feeling on this subject in the rest of theCommonwealth and the great difficulties which faced theGovernment as a result.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,21st May, 1963.
