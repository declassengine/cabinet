foreign affairs the Yemen(previous reference:C.C. (63) 44thConclusions,Minute 2)C.C. 46 (63)1. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that evidencehad come into our possession which suggested that Egyptian forcesin the Yemen had been using a form of poison gas. The evidence hadbeen submitted to the United Nations authorities, who were pursuingenquiries.Laos(previous reference:C.C. (63) 39thConclusions,Minute 2)The Foreign Secretary said that there were some grounds forhoping that the situation in Laos might be slowly improving. TheSoviet Government appeared to be disposed to exercise rather moreinfluence on the course of the current negotiations; and the Polishmember of the Control Commission was adopting a lessunco-operative attitude. Efforts to arrange a meeting between theparties to the dispute were continuing; and in the meantime themilitary situation in the Plain of Jars had been stabilised.The Cabinet Took note of these statements by the Foreign Secretary.2. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the foreign secretary (C. (63) 102, 109 and 115) on United Kingdom policy towardsSouth Africa.The Foreign Secretary said that resolutions calling for theexpulsion of South Africa from the United Nations or for theapplication of full economic sanctions against the Republic would shortly be moved in the Security Council of the United Nations. TheUnited States Government had indicated that they would be preparedto vote against both these resolutions, which would thus be likely tobe defeated without the use of the veto. An alternative resolution,proposing a total arms embargo, v/as then likely to be put forward.The United States Government were not committed to oppose suchan embargo in all circumstances; but they would be prepared to joinus in sponsoring a more moderate resolution, which would not be inmandatory terms and, although condemning apartheid, woulddistinguish between arms for external defence and arms for therepression of internal disorder.The South African Charge d&apos;Affaires had recently soughtassurances that the existing Defence Agreement between the SouthAfrican Government and ourselves would be maintained and thatarms orders already placed in the United Kingdom would becompleted. He had been informed that, while the United KingdomGovernment could not commit its succsesor, it could perhaps beassumed that contracts already placed would be fulfilled.In discussion the following points were made:(a) Commonwealth African countries were not likely to be content with anything less than a total arms embargo against SouthAfrica. Moreover, since Ghana occupied the Commonwealth seat inthe Security Council, it was not certain that we should succeed in securing the adoption of a moderate resolution. If the question were then transferred to the General Assembly, we might find ourselves in an isolation which would cause us serious embarrassment.(b) The adoption of a moderate resolution on the lines proposed would not involve any great change in our present policy as regardsthe export of arms to South Africa. But it might become necessaryto prohibit the export of certain supplies of small arms which theSouth African Government were at present permitted to buy from private dealers.PolicytowardsSouth Africa(previous reference:C.C. (63) 39thConclusions,Minute 2)
3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Education (C. (63) 119) on the preservation of the Nubianmonuments which were liable to be submerged as a result of theconstruction of the High Dam across the Nile.The Minister of Education said that the cost of the new scheme forsaving these monuments which had been adopted by the united nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO)would be $36 million. The Government of the United Arab Republicwould be prepared to place contracts for the work as soon as a sumof $32 million had been pledged by countries prepared to participate.The United States Government had agreed to contribute one-thirdof the total cost; and contributions from other countries already-amounted to over $19 million, leaving a deficit of only $750,000 to bemade good. If we did not contribute to the project, the UnitedKingdom would be the only country with a major archaeologicalreputation to abstain from participation. He therefore proposed thatwe should agree to subscribe $250,000.In discussion the following points were made:(a) At a time when the Egyptian Government were failing to honour the agreed arrangements for compensating British subjectswhose assets in Egypt had been expropriated and, in addition, weresuspected of using poison gas in the Yemen public opinion in thiscountry would be liable to criticise any contribution by theGovernment to a project of the kind proposed.EgyptNubianMonuments(previous reference:C.C. (61) 61stConclusions,Minute 4)(c) The fact that the interests of the High Commission Territoriesmight suffer if we adopted a more restrictive policy in relation to theexport of arms was an additional argument for avoiding, if possible,any significant change in the present arrangements.(d) The United Kingdom had a substantial financial interest inthe supply of arms to South Africa. For aircraft alone current ordersamounted to  26 million, while orders worth  1^ million were currentlyunder negotiation and further orders, worth  47 million, were in prospect.(e) The adoption of a moderate resolution on the lines proposed would still leave us in difficulty in the case of certain types of arms supplies, since equipment such as tanks, armoured cars and helicopterscould be used both for external defence and for the enforcement ofapartheid. Moreover, even if it were agreed to prohibit the export offurther weapons of this sort, we could hardly refuse to permit thesale of ammunition and spares for weapons and vehicles which wehad already supplied to the South African Government.(/) A more discriminatory resolution, particularly one inmandatory terms, would be deeply resented by the South african government and might endanger the Simonstown Agreement, whichwas of considerable strategic importance to the United Kingdom.This risk, however, must be weighed against the damage which mightbe caused to our relations with other Commonwealth countries, insome of which other important defence interests were at stake, if theUnited Kingdom were thought to be facilitating the supply to SouthAfrica of arms which could be used for repressive purposes.The Cabinet Authorised the Foreign Secretary, in the light of their discussion, to instruct the United Kingdom delegation at theUnited Nations to join the United States delegation in seeking to promote a resolution on the lines of paragraph 5 ofC. (63)115.
4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (63) 122) about a proposedreplacement of the Queen Mary.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the proposal now putforward by the Cunard Company for the construction of a Q.4 was even less attractive than the earlier proposal for a Q.3 (which parliament had endorsed only with considerable reluctance), particu-larly in so far as it involved a larger proportionate contribution fromthe Government at more favourable rates of interest. Moreover, theCompany intended that the Q.4, unlike the Q.3, should be used forwinter cruising. This would be bound to stimulate demands fromother companies for Exchequer assistance in support of any of theirown ships which might be put to a similar use. The Economic PolicyCommittee had therefore reached the unanimous conclusion that,despite the political criticism which might be evoked by a decision which would be represented as a virtual withdrawal from the expresstrans-Atlantic liner service, the Company&apos;s proposal should be rejected. In announcing this decision, however, the Government shouldalso undertake to increase the amount of Exchequer credit to be madeavailable for shipbuilding under the new credit scheme.In discussion there was general agreement with this view.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Cunard Company should be informed thattheir new proposal for the construction of a ship (Q.4) toreplace the Queen Mary was unacceptable to theGovernment.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Minister of Transport, to arrange that theannouncement of the decision under Conclusion (1) above should be accompanied, if possible, by a statement thatthe Government proposed to increase the amount of exchequer credit to be made available for shipbuildingunder the new credit scheme.Shipbuilding(previous reference:C.C. (63) 32ndConclusions,Minute 8)Replacementfor the queen MaryC.C. 46 (63)(b) On the other hand the current policies of the egyptian government were irrelevant to a scheme which was designed to preserve in perpetuity monuments which were of historical interestand international concern. Although it seemed unlikely that the SovietGovernment would contribute to the project, our own reputation asa civilised country required us to respond to the appeal.(c) It was understood that the United States Government had arranged to discharge their contribution by drawing on blockedcurrency balances in Egypt. It was for consideration whether we should adopt a similar course and should take the opportunity so afforded toarrange for a corresponding payment to be made to United kingdom citizens whose assets in Egypt were at present blocked.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that the United Kingdom should contribute the sum of $250,000 to the project which had now been adopted by the United Nations Educational,Scientific and Cultural Organisation for the preservation of the Nubian monuments.(2) Invited the Minister of Education, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Foreign Secretary,to give further consideration to the possibility that this contribution might be paid in such a way as to enable theGovernment to arrange for a corresponding payment to united Kingdom citizens whose assets in Egypt wereblocked.
North AtlanticTreatyOrganisationNuclear Force:Mixed-MannedComponent(previous reference:C.C. (63) 43rdConclusions,Minute 5)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary on the establishment of a nuclear force under the auspices of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) (C. (63) 121).The Foreign Secretary said that, while discussion of the proposal by the United States Government for the establishment of a multilateral Nuclear Force had been temporarily suspended as aresult of the recent discussions between the Prime Minister and thePresident of the United States, the United Kingdom Governmentcould not continue to maintain a wholly negative attitude towards this project. He therefore proposed that we should take the initiative in proposing to the North Atlantic Council the establishment of a nuclear Control Commission on the lines described in his memorandum. This initiative should not be taken until there hadbeen an opportunity to evaluate the results of the forthcoming discussions with the Soviet Government about an agreement to terminate nuclear tests; but our policy in respect of the proposedmultilateral force had commanded considerable support in NATOand many of our allies would welcome a further lead by the UnitedKingdom on the wider question of the management and control ofthe nuclear weapons at the disposal of the North Atlantic Allianceas a whole.In discussion the following points v/ere made:(a) Although the United States Government had accepted thatthe final decision on their proposal for a multilateral force shouldawait the results of the current re-examination of NATO strategy andforce goals, they were still actively canvassing support for it. any initiative at the present stage might therefore give rise to furthercontroversy.(b) Although there would be advantage in promoting betterarrangements for the political control of nuclear weapons at thedisposal of NATO, further consideration would need to be given tothe nature of that control and to the purposes which it would be designed to serve. Our own position was complicated by our possessionof an independent deterrent and by the consequent need to ensure thatany arrangements which we might seek to promote in NATO wouldnot jeopardise our own vital interests. It would be desirable to arrangefor further study of this problem.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with the foreign secretary, to arrange for a study of the arrangements forthe management and control of nuclear weapons at thedisposal of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation whichit would be in our interest to advocate.(2) Agreed to resume their consideration of the proposed NuclearControl Commission in the light of the results of the studyto be undertaken under Conclusion (1) above and of the outcome of the forthcoming discussions with the SovietGovernment about an agreement to terminate nuclear tests and related issues.
