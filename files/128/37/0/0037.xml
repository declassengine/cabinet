U.C. 37 (63)Federation of rhodesia and nyasaland(previous reference:C.C. (63) 36thConclusions,Minute 2)1. The First Secretary of State informed the Cabinet that therewas now some reason to hope that the Prime Minister of SouthernRhodesia, Mr. Winston Field, would be prepared to attend the projected conference the dissolution of the Federation of rhodesia and Nyasaland and to waive his earlier stipulation that the UnitedKingdom Government must first concede independence to SouthernRhodesia. But, in view of certain indications that the Government ofSouthern Rhodesia were divided on this issue, we oould not rely on mr. Field;s attending the conference until we had received his formalassurance to this effect. The arrangements for the conference, to be convened on 24th June, should therefore stand; and it would bedesirable, if possible, to publish in advance the texts of his recentexchanges with .Mr. Field. This would depend, however, on ourreceiving from Mr. Field an assurance that he would in fact attend the conference. Meanwhile, we should continue to avoid committing ourselves to any precise indication of the degree of constitutional advance in Southern Rhodesia on which we might wish to insist asa condition of eventually conceding independence to the Colony.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement by the first secretary of State.resignation of theSecretaryof State forWar*2. The Cabinet discussed the possible implications of theassociation between the former Secretary of State for War,Mr. Profumo, Mr. Stephen Ward and Miss Christine Keeler. They had before them a Note by the Prime Minister (C. (63) 99), to which was appended a report by the Lord Chancellor on this subject.The Prime Minister said that he himself had had no knowledgeof Mr. Ward and his associates until early in the present year, whenhe had become aware of rumours linking the name of Mr. Profumowith that of Miss Keeler, who was herself known to be connectedwith Mr. Ward. At that point the Chief Whip had asked Mr. Profumowhether there was any truth in these rumours. Mr. Profumo hadadmitted to the Chief Whip on 4th February, 1963, that he had becomeacquainted with Miss Keeler in the summer of 1961; but he had maintained that their relationship was an innocent one and that hehad brought it to an end in December of that year. In severalsubsequent discussions with the Chief Whip and the Attorney-Generalhe had adhered to his earlier statement and had continued to assert thathe had ended his friendship with Miss Keeler as soon as he was warnedby the then Secretary of the Cabinet. Sir Norman Brook, that hisassociation with Mr. Ward was unwise. Sir Norman Brook had indeedadvised Mr. Profumo on 9th August, 1961, that the Security service were concerned by the connection between Mr. Ward and the SovietAssistant Naval Attache, Captain ivanov; and on the same dayMr. Profumo had sent a letter to Miss Keeler which, althoughostensibly designed merely to defer a social engagement, was in factintended to bring their relationship to an end. He had also maintained that he had not thereafter seen Miss Keeler; and, if this statement could be accepted, their relationship had lasted only from July to august 1961 and not from July to December 1961 as Mr. Profumohad mistakenly declared in his personal statement in the House ofCommons on 22nd March, 1963.In giving his warning to Mr. Profumo Sir Norman Brook hadbeen concerned only to advise him of the possible security riskimplicit in his acquaintance with Mr. Ward. Neither Sir Norman northe Security Service had any knowledge at that time of Mr. Profumo&apos;s*Previoasly recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET
relationship with Miss Keeler; and they had no reason to suppose thaiMr. Profumo had already compromised himself in circumstances inwhich a security risk might arise. For these reasons he himself had notbeen informed of the warning which had been given to Mr. Profumo;and when, on 22nd March of the present year, Mr. Profumo had made his personal statement in the House of Commons, in the course ofwhich he had denied that there had been any improper relationship between himself and Miss Keeler, he had felt bound to accept it as anhonest statement. The&apos;fact that Mr. Profumo had declared that he intended to take legal action if rumours continued to circulate outsidethe House of Commons and had in fact subsequently taken such action and been awarded damages was, he had felt, additional proof that thestatement had been made in good faith.Thereafter, however, there had been renewed rumours, in thePress and elsewhere, which tended to call in question Mr. Profumo&apos;personal statement. On 9th April the Leader of the Opposition had sent him the record of a conversation on 26th March between mr. Ward and Colonel Wigg, M.P., in which the former had maintained that, so far as he knew, the relationship between mr. Profumo and Miss Keeler had been innocent but that he had keptthe Security Service informed of the visits exchanged between them.On 7th May Mr. Ward, at his own request, had been interviewed bythe Prime Ministers Principal Private Secretary. He had complained of enquiries which the police were making about him and had indicated that, unless these enquiries were discontinued, he might feel obliged to institute proceedings for libel and to call Mr. Profumo as awitness. He had hinted that the relationship between Mr. Profumo and miss Keeler was closer than had hitherto been represented; but hehad produced no evidence in support of this allegation.. He had beeninformed that there was no action which the authorities could take asregards enquiries which the police were making in the ordinary courseOf their duty. On 19th and 20th May Mr. Ward had written to theHome Secretary and the Leader of the Opposition respectively,alleging that Mr. Profumo^s personal statement had been untrue.In these circumstances he had become convinced that an enquiry was warranted. He had therefore invited the Lord Chancellor toexamine the implications of the allegations which were gainingcurrency; and this enquiry had acquired additional urgency when, on 4th June, Mr. Profumo had resigned from the Government and had publicly admitted that his earlier statement in the House of commons had been false.The Lord Chancellor&apos;? investigation of the course of events since mr. Profumo lirst met Miss Keeler in the summer of 1961 had jevealedno grounds for supposing that security had been endangered.Nevertheless, the episode was now to be the subject of debate in theHouse of Commons on 17th June: and the Government must expect to face a severe challenge on the manner in which they had handledthe case. Public opinion had been shaken by the disclosure that a minister of the Crown could so far abuse the unique degree of privilegeattaching to a personal statement in Parliament as deliberately tomislead his colleagues in the Government and the House of Commons;and the Government would be required to show that they had actedthroughout not merely with good judgment but also in honesty of purpose.In discussion there was general agreement that the critical issue which would face the Government would be one of good faith ratherthan of good judgment. It was now widely believed that the security service had known, from the outset, of the relationship between mr. Profumo and Miss Keeler and that either they had failed to informthe Prime Minister of this potential risk to security or that they had done so and that the Prime Minister had failed to take any action atthe relevant time. It was also widely believed that those Ministers whohad taken part in the final discussion with Mr. Profumo before- he
made his personal statement on 22nd March and had to some extentassisted him in drafting that statement must themselves have suspectedat the time that the statement disclosed less than the full truth aboutthe association between Mr. Profumo and Miss Keeler. The first ofthese allegations could be rebutted by reference to the facts which theLord Chancellor nad now established. Neither the Security Servicenor any other individual in authority had been aware of any connection between Mr. Profumo and Miss Keeler until rumours on this subjectbegan to circulate early in 1963; and there appeared to be no truth in Mr. Ward&apos;s assertion that he had given the Security Serviceinformation  about the relationship between  Mr.  Profumo  and miss Keeler. The second allegation, however, might be more difficultto counter, especially since Mr, Profumo had admitted to the chief whip as early as 4th February, 1963, that a letter which he had sent toMiss Keeler (which was in fact sent on 9th August, 1961, as a resultof the warning which he had received that day from Sir NormanBrook) had bcc-n couched in affectionate terms. He had also admitted that on one occasion he had given her a present and that he had twicebeen alone with her in Mr. Ward&apos;s flat. These facts were known tothose Ministers who had discussed with Mr. Piofumo early on22nd March the text of the persona! statement which he was to makein the House of Commons later that day; and it might well be asked why they had not insisted at the time on examining their possibleimplications more deeply, particularly by asking Mr. Profumo for acopy of the letter and so judging for themselves whether it conveyedany presumption of  an  improper  association.  By  acceptingMr. Profurao&apos;s own account of his relationship with Miss Keeler, theycould be held to have failed to exercise the degree of judgment requiredin circumstances in which suspicions should surely have been amused.On the other hand the Ministers concerned the Leader of theHouse, the Minister without Portfolio, the Chief Whip and the attorney-General (who had been accompanied, at the discussion withMr, Profumo on 21st March, by the Solicitor-General)--maintained that, although they had known at that interview that a letter fromMr. Profumo to Miss Keeler existed, they had had no grounds for refusing to accept Mr. Profumo&apos;s own statement that it was aninnocent letter, intended merely to terminate the relationship. Theyhad taken this attitude the more confidently in that, on the afternoon of that day, several representatives of the Press had informed theMinister without Portfolio that they had seen a copy of the letter andregarded it as of no great importance. In these circumstances theyhad felt entitled to accept Mr. Profumo:s statement to the same effect,especially since it came at the end of a series of interviews between mr. Profumo and individual Ministers, beginning with his discussionwith the Chief Whip on 4th February, in which Mr. Profumo had consistently denied that there had been any impropriety in hisrelationship with Miss Keeler.In further discussion, the following points were made:(a) It was doubtful how far, in defending their actions in theHouse of Commons, the Government could rely on Mr. Profumo&apos;sown statement that he had not seen Miss Keeler again after August1961. It had been alleged that in December 1962, when an incident hadtaken place outside Mr. Ward&apos;s fiat, Mr. Profurno&apos;s motor car hadbeen seen in the neighbourhood. Moreover, Miss Keeler had informed the police on 30th January, 1963, that only a few weeks before thatdate she had been asked by Mr. Ward to try to obtain certain secret information from Mr. Profumo. Both incidents suggested that theassociation between Mr. Profumo and Miss Keeler might havepersisted for longer than the former had maintained,(b) In conducting his enquiry the Lord Chancellor had notquestioned either Mr. Ward or Miss Keeler. Both individuals, however,had been shown to be thoroughly unreliable; and no confidence could
have been placed in any statements which they might have made.Moreover, Mr. Ward had been arrested by the police on a criminalcharge during the latter stages of the Lord Chancellor^ investigations;and., while this case was sub judice, it would have been improper to seek information from him.(c) It was known that Mr. Ward, in his capacity both as anosteopath and as a portrait painter, had been familiar with manyindividuals prominent in public life, including several Members ofParliament. There was some risk that, during his forthcoming trial,he might seek to involve some of these persons in the scandal whichhad now developed.(d) It might be held that, as a result of Mr. Ward?s interview withthe Prime Minister^ Principal Private Secretary on 7th May, 1963, theGovernment should have taken further action to satisfy themselves that Mr, Profumo&apos;s personal statement had been true. On the otherhand, it had been clear that Mr. Ward&apos;s only purpose was to seek to persuade the Prime Minister that, if the police were not instructed to discontinue their enquiries, he himself would give further currency toallegations about the relationship between Mr. Profumo and MissKeeler. It had therefore been decided to disregard this attemptedblackmail, particularly since Mr. Ward, although asserting that the relationship between Mr. Profumo and Miss Keeler had been moreintimate than was generally supposed, had produced no evidence insupport of this allegation.(e) The Lord Chancellor had been unable to discuss with theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who had been absent on a visit to the United States during his enquiry, the allegation that Mr. Wardand an individual, who must be assumed to have been Captain Ivanov,had visited the Chancellor of the. Dnchy\s house on 31st October, 1962.The Chancellor of the Duchy had, in fact, informed the foreign secretary at the time that Mr. Ward and Captain Ivanov had invitedthemselves to his house on that occasion and that neither he nor anymember of his family knew either individual. The Lord Chancellorsreport would incorporate this explanation.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.J,12th June, 1963.TOTAL P.06
