The First Secretary of State informed the Cabinet that, in thelight of developments since their earlier meeting that day, it appearedpossible that the representatives of the Government of SouthernRhodesia would seek to insist that, as a condition of their willingness to attend the projected conference about the future association between the Territories of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland,Southern Rhodesia should be granted independence forthwith. Thisstipulation, if made, would import a new and dangerous factor into1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord privy Seal (C. (63) 56), proposing a conference of European and commonwealth countries on the development of satellite communications.The Joint Parliamentary Under-secretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that our interests would be likely to be best served byparticipating in a single, world-wide communications system ratherthan by trying to develop a separate system, independent of the UnitedStates. In order to secure the initiative in this matter and to ensure that negotiations with the United States authorities might proceed froma position of strength, we should suggest to other interested governments, particularly in Europe, that, following further technical discussions which would be held in June, we might convene an inter-governmental conference at which the wider implications ofsatellite communications systems could be discussed. The terms of the invitation to such a conference, the range of countries to be invitedand the instructions to be given to the British delegation would require futher consideration; but there might be advantage in indicating, inthe debate on this subject to be held in Parliament on the following day, that we intended to promote discussions on this basis. By thetime they took place we should have at least an interim report on the design study for a satellite of our own, which was now in hand; andwe should also have a clearer idea of the scope and nature of the contribution which the United Kingdom might make to an eventualjoint system.In discussion, there was general agreement that it would not be practicable for the United Kingdom to develop a completelyindependent satellite communications system and that our efforts inthis field should be based on co-operation with the United States cabinet/ith European and Commonwealth countries or with both groups.But the appropriate basis of partnership could not yet be determinedand it might therefore be premature to declare too explicitly at thisstage that we should in no circumstances seek to promote a systemindependently of the United States. During the Parliamentary debate,therefore, the Governments spokesmen should indicate that, inprinciple, we endorsed the concept of a system organised on ascomprehensive an international basis as possible and that our first step in seeking to give effect to this concept would be to take counselwith the countries associated with us in the European launcher development Organisation and the European Space research organisation, and possibly with others, on the best form of organisation for the purpose.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Aviation and the Postmaster-general to be guided, in the Parliamentary debate on satellite communications on the following day, by the considerations advanced in their discussion.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of satellite communicationsat a later meeting.
the situation. There could be no question of conceding immediateindependence to Southern Rhodesia. On the other hand, if we refusedto recognise, even in principle, the aspirations of the Governmentof Southern Rhodesia in this respect, they might well absentthemselves from the proposed conference and so frustrate its purpose.Moreover, the Governments supporters in the House of commons would be likely to criticise the outcome of the present discussions ifthe claim of Northern Rhodesia to secede from the Federation was conceded but the analogous claim Of Southern Rhodesia to attainindependence was totally rejected. For these reasons it might be advisable that the statement to be issued at the conclusion of thediscussions should recognise not only that any Territory which sowished should be allowed to secede from the Federation but also thatany Territory should have the right to proceed in the normal way to constitutional independence at the appropriate time and under theappropriate conditions.In discussion, there was some support for this view. For all practical purposes Southern Rhodesia was already an independentcountry; and there could be little doubt that the last elements of theColony&apos;s formal subordination to the United Kingdom would haveto be removed in the foreseeable future. We should not neglect anopportunity to recognise the realities of the situation and, at the sametime, to extricate ourselves from a position in which, while having no power to compel the Government of Southern Rhodesia to modify their racial policies, we remained responsible for defending thosepolicies to world opinion.On the other hand, there were grave political objections toconferring independence on a colony in which a European minoritysought to impose their will on an African majority by increasinglyrepressive measures. It had been our deliberate and consistent policyin recent years to defer the grant of final independence to a colonyuntil it had reached the stage of constitutional development at whichthe majority of its inhabitants enjoyed the decisive voice in themanagement of public affairs. If we departed from this principle inthe single case of Southern Rhodesia, our action would be condemnedby the rest of the Commonwealth; and we should find ourselveswithout support, except possibly from Portugal and the Union ofSouth Africa, in the face of intense international criticism. Even if wecould not prevent the Government of Southern Rhodesia from seeking to assert formally the independence which they already enjoyed inpractice, it would be better that they should be seen to do so by a unilateral act than that we should appear to condone action whichwould be unprecedented in the history of the progressive transfer of power to our former dependencies.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thefuture status of Southern Rhodesia would inevitably become a liveissue as soon as Northern Rhodesia exercised the right of secessionwhich we now proposed to recognise. For, at that point, the Federationwould automatically dissolve and Southern Rhodesia, as a separateentity, would have some claim to proceed to the independent statuswhich she would probably have achieved some years ago if theFederation had not been created. Nevertheless, in view of the veryserious political objections to conceding independence to SouthernRhodesia at the present juncture, the wiser course, on balance,appeared to lie in deferring a decision on this issue for as long aspossible. If, therefore, the Government of Southern Rhodesia raised the question during the present discussions, they should be informedthat the scope of those discussions was limited to the future of theFederation; that their purpose was confined to ascertaining whether some alternative basis of association between the constituentTerritories could be devised; and that the issue of independence for those Territories would not arise until a later stage. On this basis, thestatement to be issued at the end of the discussions would recognise
Chief AnthonyEnahoro(previous reference :C.C. (63) 19thConclusions,Minute 3)3. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the question whetherChief Anthony Enahoro should be returned to Nigeria under theFugitive Offenders Act, 1881.The Attorney-General said that the Opposition in the House ofCommons were now likely to agree that there was no substance in thereasons for which they had claimed, in the debate in Parliament on26th March, that, if Chief Enahoro were returned to Nigeria andwere convicted on the second count of the charges preferred against him, he would be liable to the death penalty. But they had sinceadduced fresh reasons pointing to the same conclusion; and, although he did not himself endorse the process of argument involved, thenew point which had now been raised involved complex questionsof the precise construction of the statute in question and he wouldnot feel able to give Parliament an absolute assurance that the death penalty could not be imposed. Moreover, although it was plain thatthe Attorney-General of Nigeria did not believe that the death penaltycould be imposed on conviction on the existing charges, he had refusedto give any undertaking on this point which could be publicly quoted;nor was he willing to give, in his capacity as a Law Officer as distinct from his capacity as a member of the Government of Nigeria, the assurance, which the Nigerian Government had refused to give, that,if Chief Enahoro were returned to Nigeria, no new charges involving the death penalty would be preferred against him in respect of hisactions up to the present time.In discussion, it was suggested that, since there appeared to belittle prospect of obtaining undertakings from Nigeria which would satisfy Parliament that Chief Enahoro, if returned, would not be puton trial for his life, Parliament would be likely to remain of theopinion that the Home Secretary could not properly decide that itwould be just to return him to Nigeria. But a decision to this effect would be unwelcome to the Government of Nigeria; and it would be particularly unfortunate to subject relations between the UnitedKingdom and Nigeria to strain at the time when the Government of nigeria had just sought our agreement that Nigeria should become a republic within the Commonwealth. In view of the serious and complex issues involved, it would be desirable to defer a final decisionfor a short time further.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion at a later meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,29th March, 1963.that any Territory which wished to secede from the Federation must,in principle, be allowed to do so but would contain no reference tothe subsequent question of independence.The Cabinet Invited the First Secretary of State to be guided, in the concluding stage of his discussions with the Government ofSouthern Rhodesia, by the considerations indicated by thePrime Minister.
