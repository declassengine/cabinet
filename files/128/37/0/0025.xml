A recent meeting betweenMalayan and Philippine representatives had contributed to animprovement in relations between the two countries; and in a subsequent message President Sukarno of Indonesia had expressed to the Prime Minister of Malaya his readiness to enter into personaldiscussions with him.The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that, in the absenceof energetic action by Prince Souvanna Phouma, the Prime Ministerof Laos, there was an increasing risk that fighting would break out between forces controlled by the two wings of the NeutralistGovernment. Some of the Governments troops in the Plain of Jarshad seceded to the Pathet Lao; and General Phoumi might take theopportunity to reopen hostilities against those who were under thecontrol of Prince Souvannouvong. It might help to stabilise thesituation if an outpost of the International Control commission were established in the Plain of Jars; and, after consultation with theUnited States Government, he had invited the Soviet ForeignMinister, as co-chairman of the Geneva Conference on Laos, toco-operate in bringing pressure on the Commission for this purpose.The Foreign Secretary said that he had been given a veryfriendly reception during his recent visit to Japan. The JapaneseGovernment had been pleased to be accepted as members of theOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development andhad shown themselves eager to have the sponsorship of the UnitedKingdom Government for entry into other international organisa-tions. Japan should be able to contribute a significant degree of aid to under-developed countries; and there was likely to be scope for increasing trade between Japan and the United Kingdom.The Foreign Secretary said that there were indications that theFrench Government might not oppora arrangements which hadbeen suggested by Dr. Schroeder, the West German ForeignMinister, for permanent machinery to enable contact to bemaintained between ourselves and the countries of the european economic Community. This machinery would supplement, and notreplace, Western European Union.The Cabinet Took note of these statements by the Foreign Secretary.2. The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that, in the light of the cabinets previous discussion, the Committee on Strategic Exportshad come to the conclusion that it would be appropriate to accede to the requests made by the Iraqi Government for the provision of facilities for the training of officers and for the supply of tanks,aircraft and ammunition.In discussion it was agreed in principle that the Iraqi requestsshould, so far as practicable, be met and that preparations should bemade for this purpose. But, in view of the announcement that day that the Governments of Egypt, Iraq and Syria proposed to establish a Federal State, it would be expedient to defer action to give effectto this decision until the significance of this new development couldbe assessed.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that preparations should be put in hand to meet the requests made by the Government of Iraq for theprovision of training facilities and military equipment.SECRET2831-1 a 2IraqExport ofArms(previous reference:C.C.

16:3Export ofLarge DiameterSteel Pipe(previous reference:C.C. (63) 23rdConclusions,Minute 5)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the President of the Boardof Trade (C. (63) 60) about the export of large diameter steel pipefrom the United Kingdom to the Soviet bloc.The Foreign Secretary said that on 21st November, 1962, theNorth Atlantic Council had decided to invite member countries to stop delivery of large diameter pipe to the Soviet bloc under existing contracts and to prevent new contracts for such deliveries&quot; to the extent possible &quot;. We had made clear to the Council duringthe discussion preceding this decision that we had no means of preventing such exports by United Kingdom firms. We had, however,agreed not to veto the CounciFs decision, provided that it was clearly understood that in the case of the United Kingdom the words &quot; tothe extent possible &quot; would mean &quot; not at all &quot;.In pursuance of the CounciFs decision the Federal Governmentof Germany had recently placed an embargo on further exports ofsteel pipe by German firms to the Soviet bloc. If a United Kingdomfirm now secured an order for steel pipe from the Soviet Union,there would be strong resentment in the Federal Republic. Therewould also be repercussions on our relations with the Governmentof the United States, who maintained that the early completion ofthe oil pipeline connecting the Soviet Union with her satellites inEurope would have serious strategic consequences for the West. Hehad thought it necessary, however, in discussion with Dr. Schroeder,the Federal German Foreign Minister, to make it clear to him that,if the Government were to seek to frustrate any order for steel pipewhich any United Kingdom firm might succeed in obtaining fromthe Soviet Union, they might fail to secure the endorsement ofParliament.The President of the Board of Trade said that the Soviet union had approached the South Durham Steel and Iron Company earlier in the present month. It was likely that the firm would wish to send a representative to Moscow in the near future to discuss the termsof a possible contract. He had made it clear to the firm that therewould be no objection on the Governments part to their proceeding with these negotiations; and they might succeed in obtaining anorder. It had been suggested that the United States might beprepared to place orders of their own with the South DurhamCompany, which would have the effect of pre-empting the firm&apos;capacity to manufacture steel pipe of the size in question; but therewas as yet no concrete evidence to suggest that any orders of thiskind would in fact be placed.In discussion there was general agreement that it would be undesirable, both on economic and on political grounds, to seek to obstruct the negotiations in prospect between the South DurhamCompany and the Soviet Government or to prevent the fulfilment of any contract that might be negotiated as a result. It would be right, however, to give some public explanation of the government&apos;s policy in this matter, including some account of the discussions inthe North Atlantic Council and of the specific reservation which wehad placed on the CounciFs ultimate decision, even though thiswould place the German Foreign Minister in a position of some difficulty in view of his own public assertion that the CounciFs(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to give further considerationto the desirability of giving effect to the arrangements tobe put in hand under Conclusion (1) above, in the lightof the new situation created by the announcement thatIraq would be linked with Egypt and Syria in a FederalState.
decision had been unanimous. It would be better, on balance, to defer the publication of a statement on these lines until the SouthDurham Company had received a firm order.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with thePresident of the Board of Trade, to prepare a statementof the Governments policy on the export of largediameter steel pipe to the Soviet bloc on the lines indicated in their discussion.(2) Agreed that the statement should not be issued unless anduntil the South Durham Steel and Iron Company hadnegotiated a firm order from the Soviet Union.United King-dom fishery limits(previous reference:C.C. (63) 16thConclusions,Minute 3)4. The Lord Chancellor informed the Cabinet that the Law ofthe Sea Committee had examined, in the light of the most recent developments, the implications of the Cabinets decision in principlethat we should give notice, before 15th May, of our&apos; intention to terminate at 15th May, 1964, the North Sea Fisheries convention of 1882 and the regulations made in 1843 under the Anglo-FrenchConvention of 1839, which at present precluded our extending ourfishery limits to 6 miles. It was no longer necessary to defer action for this purpose until the conclusion of the negotiations with the danish Government about the proposed extension of the fishery limits around the Faroes, since they had now unilaterally decidedto extend those limits. We should need to consider whether it wouldbe to our advantage to challenge their action before the international court; but, since we could not afford to defer a decision on thetermination of the Treaties for the considerable interval which wouldelapse before the International Court could be expected to give aruling on the action of the Danish Government, we should now give notice of termination forthwith, without prejudice to the questionwhether, in the light of further examination of the political and legalissues which would be involved, we should invoke the Court.It was for consideration, however, whether, in giving notice of termination, we should at the same time indicate how far we proposed to extend our fishery limits. The interests affected, bothdomestic and international, would naturally be concerned to have a precise forewarning of our intentions. On the other hand, we were seeking to promote a fisheries conference, to be attended by thecountries of the European Economic Community (E.E.C.) and theEuropean Free Trade Association (EFTA), in order to try to secure for the fishermen of the predominantly exporting countries of EFTAgreater access to the predominantly importing countries of theE.E.C. The French Government would be reluctant to take part in discussions for this purpose; and it had therefore been suggestedthat we should refrain from announcing the precise degree of extension of our own fishery limits and, by leaving it to be implied that these limits might be enlarged beyond 6 miles, should bring pressure to bear on the French Government to attend the proposed conference. If, however, this action were regarded as implying thatwe might claim a unilateral right to extend our fishery limits beyondthe limits of our territorial waters, it could be challenged as a breach of our obligations under the Geneva Conventions on the territorial sea and the Contiguous Zone and on the High Seas: and, soregarded, it could have damaging repercussions on our defence interests.As a possible compromise between these points of view, we might announce that we intended to extend the limits of our
territorial waters to 6 miles in order to secure fishery limits of thesame extent but that we were considering challenging the action ofthe Danish Government before the International Court and that if,as a result, it appeared to be admissible to claim fishery limits outsidethe iimits of territorial waters, we should reserve our right to do so.In discussion there was considerable support for this point ofview. United Kingdom fishing interests appeared to be divided onthe merits of extending our fishery limits. The deep sea fishermenwere anxious to promote the proposed conference between thecountries of E.E.C. and EFTA and would prefer that, for thispurpose, the announcement of our intention to give notice of termination of the Regulations of 1843 and the Convention of 1882should be postponed for six months. But they were prepared to defer to the insistence of the inshore fishermen that there should beno further delay in taking action to extend our own limits. By givingnotice of termination forthwith we should satisfy this demandwithout necessarily committing ourselves to extend the limits byany precise amount when the notice expired on 15th May, 1964.During the interval it should be possible to explore the scope for fresh arrangements designed to protect both our own fishing interestsand those of the EFTA countries; and it would also be possible toexamine how far, in the light of international law, it would be feasible to extend our fishery limits (if we decided to do so) withoutrisking the adverse consequences for our defence interests whichwould follow if we were compelled to enlarge the limits of ourterritorial waters to the same extent. Moreover, it was idle to hopethat, by deferring notice of termination for a further period, weshould succeed in persuading the French Government to berepresented at the proposed conference between E.E.C. and efta countries. They would challenge our right to terminate theRegulations of 1843 in any event; and we should gain nothing by seeking to evade this issue.On the other hand it was very desirable that we should do nothing to inhibit the proposed conference between E.E.C. andEFTA countries both because the success of such a conference should ultimately contribute to the greater prosperity of our ownfishing industry and because it was to our advantage to be seen tosupport any action which was consistent with our declared intentionto maintain close economic relations with Europe, despite the rejection of our claim to accede to E.E.C. For these reasons it wouldbe wiser to concentrate on promoting the conference, even if thisimplied that, by deferring notice of termination of the regulations and the Convention until 15th May, 1964, no effective change in thepresent position could take place until 15th May, 1965.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that the considerations which had emerged from the Cabinets discussions were evenly balanced; but the wisest course appeared to lie in givingnotice of termination of the Regulations and the Conventionforthwith, without specifying at this stage the precise extent towhich we might ultimately enlarge our fishery limits. This would leave us free to take the necessary decision, if necessary, when theperiod of notice expired but would also indicate that in the interimwe should be prepared to seek to negotiate fresh arrangementsacceptable not only to ourselves but also to the countries of E.E.C.and EFTA. On this basis the conference of these countries shouldtake place as soon as possible, since we must be prepared, in termsboth of legislative authority and administrative action, to implement the notice of termination, if necessary, by 15th May, 1964.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Chancellor, as Chairman of the Committeeon the Law of the Sea, to arrange, in consultation withthe Ministers concerned, that, before 15th May, 1963,
5. The First Secretary of State said that he had now replied tothe letter of 29th March, 1963, from the Prime Minister of Rhodesia,Mr. Winston Field, on the lines agreed by the Cabinet at their previous meeting and had also obtained Mr. Fie!d&apos;s agreement tothe publication that day of the texts of both the letter and the reply.While no further communication had yet been received from theGovernment of Southern Rhodesia, they might well take the viewthat the qualified assurances, contained in our reply, about the attainment of full independence by Southern Rhodesia wereinsufficiently precise to be acceptable. If so, they would probablydemand a conference in May, to settle the details of the attainment of full independence by the Colony, before agreeing to attend theconference on future relationships between Southern and northern rhodesia which it was hoped to convene later in the year. If were fused to accede to this demand, they might assert their independence unilaterally and enter into some form of association with the Union of South Africa.In discussion it was agreed that we should continue to seek to gain time, in the hope that the Government of Southern rhodesia would gradually see more clearly both the advantages of continuedeconomic association with Northern Rhodesia and the dangers of unilateral action. For this purpose it might be helpful to promotediscreet publicity which would bring both these considerations tothe attention of public opinion in the Colony. It would be equally important, however, to avoid any action which might have the effectof alienating the present Government of Southern Rhodesia to an extent which might lead to a refusal on their part to continue discussions with the United Kingdom Government. We should thenbe faced with the problem of bringing the present Federation of rhodesia and Nyasaland to an end without the co-operation of anyof the parties to it. But, since the situation might henceforwarddevelop more rapidly, further consideration should now be given tothe form of the legislation which would in any case be required to dissolve the Federation.The Cabinet (1) Invited the First Secretary of State to give consideration to possible means of impressing on public opinion in southern Rhodesia both the advantages of continuedeconomic association with Northern Rhodesia and thenotice should be given to terminate the Regulations of1843, made under the Anglo-French Convention of 1839,together with the North Sea Fisheries Convention of1882.(2) Agreed that this notice of termination should not specify atthis stage the extent to which United Kingdom fishery limits might be enlarged on the expiry of the notice.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary, the Home Secretary and theCommonwealth Secretary to arrange, as a matter of urgency, for the necessary consultation with othercountries affected by the notice of termination to be putin hand.(4) Invited the Lord Chancellor to arrange for furtherconsideration to be given to the desirability of challengingbefore the International Court the action of the danish government in unilaterally extending the fishery limitsaround the Faroes.
risks involved in any unilateral action by the Governmentof Southern Rhodesia to declare the Colony&apos;independence.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with the first secretary of State, to give consideration to the form ofthe legislation which would be required to dissolve theFederation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion at an early meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,11th April, 1963.
