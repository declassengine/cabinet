Rhodesia and 1.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the FirstNyasaland Secretary of State on various issues arising in connection with the(Previous dissolution of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (C. (63)Reference: ]55   ]56 and 159)C.C. (63) 47thM^nutif?)&quot;5&apos; The First Secretary of State said that good progress had beenmade towards the dissolution of the Federation, particularly inrelation to the terminal arrangements for Federal public servants and the identification of Federal functions to be transferred to the territories. The allocation of the Public Debt and Federal assets and liabilities still awaited detailed discussion; but generalagreement had been reached on joint arrangements for the Karibahydro-electric station and for air and rail communications betweenthe Territories.Agreement had also been reached on the introduction of internal self-government in Northern Rhodesia; and it was proposed tohold general elections under the new Constitution in January 1964,in which Barotseland had agreed to participate. No date for the attainment of full independence by Northern Rhodesia had yetbeen settled.It would be desirable that Nyasaland should be granted full independence in July 1964, a date which was acceptable to thePrime Minister, Dr. Banda. Both Dr. Banda and the Governor ofthe Territory hoped that Nyasaland might maintain allegiance tothe Crown for the first six to twelve months of independence, onlythereafter becoming a republic. Such an arrangement would havethe advantage of retaining the stabilising influence of the Governor,even if in a different capacity, during the transitional period; andit would also avoid the risks implicit in an unduly hasty negotiation of a republican Constitution.In discussion it was emphasised that the objections to an interim period of monarchy, particularly in relation to the dignityof the Crown itself, had recently been represented to theGovernment of Kenya, who had been thinking on the same lines as the Government of Nyasaland. If these objections were waivedin the case of Nyasaland, it would be difficult to sustain them inthe case of Kenya, where the Colonial Secretary regarded it as important that the transition to republican status should coincide with the attainment of independence. The question should be further considered when the Colonial Secretary returned from his currentvisit to the Far East.The First Secretary of State said that the Prime Minister ofSouthern Rhodesia, Mr. Winston Field, bad asked whether theUnited Kingdom Government were concerned that SouthernRhodesia should maintain defence forces at a level which wouldprovide a contribution to Commonwealth defence; if so, whetherthey would make a financial contribution towards this purpose;and whether the United Kingdom required a military base in southern Rhodesia. The embarrassment with which these enquiriesconfronted us had been somewhat reduced by the subsequentdecision of the Government of Southern Rhodesia to curtail thestrength of the Royal Rhodesian Air Force. Even so, it appeared that, on military grounds, negative replies should be returned toall Mr. Field&apos;s questions. On the other hand quite apart from theassistance which the Rhodesian Armed Forces had given the UnitedKingdom in two world wars, they had recently co-operated with british forces in operations both in the Middle East and Swaziland;and there would undoubtedly be disappointment and resentment in southern Rhodesia if it appeared that we no longer had any use for the loyalty and patriotism of the Colony&apos;s inhabitants.
In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The operational assistance which Rhodesian forces could offer to the United Kingdom was now of only marginal value,although there was no military objection to continuing to provide them with training facilities in the United Kingdom. On the otherhand it would remain important that the Colony should continue to afford us the overflying and staging facilities which we enjoyedat present.(b) Any assistance given to the Southern rhodesian government in maintaining its defence forces would. be liable to provoke criticism from the African members of the Commonwealth,who might deny overflying facilities to aircraft of the RoyalRhodesian Air Force.(c) On financial as well as political grounds it would bedifficult to justify a contribution to the maintenance of southern rhodesian defence forces; but the possibility of some degree ofsubvention need not be entirely excluded, particularly if, after the assets and liabilities of the Federation had been apportioned, thequestion of future financial assistance to the Territories arose andit appeared reasonable in that context to have some regard to the contribution which Southern Rhodesian defence forces might make to Commonwealth defence.The Cabinet (1) Took note of C. (63) 155, 156 and 159 and of the points made in discussion.(2) Agreed  that  Northern  Rhodesia should attain  internal self-government on the basis of elections next January.(3) Agreed that Nyasaland should be accorded independence inJuly 1964.(4) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with theCommonwealth Secretary, to give further&apos; considerationto the desirability of maintaining monarchical rule in nyasaland for a period after independence.(5) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with theCommonwealth Secretary, the Minister of Defence andthe Chief Secretary, Treasury, to give furtherconsideration to the reply to be given to the request bythe Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia for guidance on the future position of Southern Rhodesian defence forces in relation to Commonwealth defence.2. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the suggestionthat the United Kingdom might take part in the forthcoming discussions in Washington and Paris of the technical and political aspects of the establishment of a multilateral nuclear force withinthe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). They had beforethem drafts of the terms in which a decision to participate in, orto abstain from, these discussions might be announced.C.C. (63) 54th It was agreed that, since the terms of reference of the discussionsConclusions, appeared to confine them to countries seriously interested in minute 3) establishing a multilateral force, participation by the UnitedKingdom would lead inevitably to an implied commitment on our part to subscribe to the multilateral force itself and to charges of bad faith if, in the event, we declined to do so. It was unlikelythat the United States Government would be prepared at this stage to amend the terms of reference. Moreover, even if they were willing to do so, we should then be under an obligation to play aNorthAtlanticTreatyOrganisationMultilateralForce(previous reference:
full part in the discussions; and this might make it even moredifficult for us to avoid a commitment to contribute to the forceitself. But, if the Government accepted any commitment, explicitor implied, to contribute to a multilateral force, the political repercussions in this country would be serious.Nevertheless, in terms of our relations with the United StatesGovernment and the Federal Government of Germany, the effects of an unqualified refusal to take any part in the forthcoming discussions would be equally, if not more, damaging. We had nevercommitted ourselves to participate in the force itself; but we had at various times given the United States Government encouragementin their efforts to establish the force and they would have somegrounds for accusing us of a breach of faith if we were now towithdraw completely from the enterprise. We should therefore seek tofind an intermediate course, which would enable us to give the UnitedStates Government the degree of support to which they could resonably regard themselves as entitled and to exert some influence on the development of the project but to avoid any commitment to contribute to the force itself otherwise than by the provision of facilities in this country.The Prime Minister suggested that, for this purpose, theForeign Secretary, at his forthcoming meeting with the UnitedStates Secretary of State, Mr. Rusk, should recapitulate the earlierhistory of the project. At Nassau we had discussed with the UnitedStates Government the creation of unified NATO nuclear forcescontaining certain defined elements, which were to include a UnitedStates national contribution, a United Kingdom nationalcontribution and, possibly, a mixed-manned contribution (whichhad at that time been considered in terms of a Polaris submarinefleet). We had discharged our obligation as regards our nationalcontribution by assigning our V-bomber forces to NATO and by undertaking similarly to assign our Polaris submarines when they came into service. But we had not undertaken to contribute tothe mixed-manned force as well; and in the subsequent discussions with the President of the United States, in which we had agreedto continue discussions with our allies on possible means ofestablishing a closer association of NATO countries with the deterrent forces of the West, we had merely recognised that a mixed-manned force would be one possible means of securing this objective. Against this background the proposal to arrange for detailed discussion of various aspects of the multilateral force onthe basis of the suggested terms of reference placed the UnitedKingdom Government in a dilemma. On the one hand, we couldnot at this stage accept the implied commitment to contribute tothe multilateral force itself, since we regarded ourselves as havingdischarged in full the only obligation which we had assumed underthe Nassau Agreement. On the other hand, we were anxious notto let it be supposed that a difference of opinion had developedbetween the United Kingdom and United States Governments or that we were failing to give the United States the help and support which they had a right to expect from their closest ally. We should therefore be prepared to be represented at the forthcoming discussions as observers and to give in that capacity such help and advice as we could. But our participation in the discussions on this basis must be clearly recognised as not involving us in any commitment to contribute to the force itself, if it were eventuallyestablished.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for thepreparation of a memorandum, on the lines indicated
in his summing up, which might serve as a directive tothe Foreign Secretary for his forthcoming discussion withthe United States Government of the projectedmultilateral nuclear force.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,21st September, 1963.
