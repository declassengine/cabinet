ForeignAffairsConference of african StatesTurkeyIndonesia(previous reference :C.C. (63) 10thConclusions,Minute 2)Saudi Arabia(previous reference :C.C. (63) 4thConclusions,Minute 3)2. The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs informed theCabinet that the projected Conference of African States had nowassembled at Addis Ababa. The tone of the initial proceedingssuggested that it would provide opportunities for the expression of Pan-African and anti-colonialist sentiment which might wellembarrass us in dealing with our problems in Africa.The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that an abortivemilitary rising had recently taken place in Turkey and that, althoughthe Government appeared to have reasserted their control without undue difficulty, it was unfortunate that internal political tensionshould have been exacerbated in a member country of the north atlantic Treaty Organisation.The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs informed the Cabinetthat the Government of Indonesia had recently promulgated a decreeexpropriating the United Kingdom and United States oil companies operating in Indonesia. We had joined the United States in protestingvigorously against this action; and the United States Governmenthad indicated that they might withhold further aid from Indonesiain retaliation. There were some signs that the Government ofIndonesia would be prepared to discuss the position in due course;but they did not appear disposed to make any immediate concessions to our representations.The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that, in response to a request from the Government of Saudi Arabia, we had agreed tomake available United Kingdom military advisers for training theNational Guard, commonly known as the &quot; White Army&quot;. this action, in which the United States Government concurred, shouldreinforce the regime in Saudi Arabia against internal dissension.The Cabinet Took note of these statements by the Minister of State forForeign Affairs.Nuclear Tests(previous reference :3.*   The Cabinet had before them:(i) The text of a letter from Mr. Khrushchev in reply to theC C (62) 57th message about nuclear tests which the Prime Minister and theConclusions, President of the United States, President Kennedy, had jointly sentMinute 1)       to him on 24th April.(ii) The text of a draft reply to this letter, which the PrimeMinister had invited President Kennedy to endorse.The Prime Minister said that, although Mr. Khrushchev&apos;s lettergave little indication that the Soviet Government were disposed toreach agreement on the subject of nuclear tests, it did not reject thepossibility of further discussions between representatives of theGovernments of the United Kingdom, the United States and theSoviet Union. He had therefore thought it right to invite President* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.secret parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
NorthAtlanticTreatyOrganisationNuclear Force(previous reference :C.C. (63) 18thConclusions,Minute 3)4. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that the UnitedStates Government had recently asked us to participate in the multilateral nuclear force which it was proposed to create under theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). As a result of had discussions with the President of the United States at Nassau inDecember 1962, we had undertaken to assign our V-bomber force to NATO; and arrangements had been made for the formal dischargeof this commitment in the near future. We were under no obligationto make any further contribution to the NATO nuclear force.Moreover, the military value of the projected multilateral or mixed-manned element was open to serious question. The United StatesGovernment, however, attached political importance to this conceptand we could not refrain from endorsing it in principle. But it wouldbe to our advantage to defer for as long as possible a decision on thequestion whether we should contribute to a force of this nature.The Cabinet Took note,Minister.with approval, of the statement by the PrimePublic Order(previous reference :C.C. (63) 28thConclusions,Minute 3)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (63) 88) about the scope for amendment of the public order Act, 1936.The Home Secretary said that, in the light of the Cabinet&apos;s earlier discussion of this question, he had considered, in consultation withthe Attorney-General, the possibility of promoting legislation whichwould both increase the penalties for offences under Section 5 of theAct and would enlarge the scope of that Section by making it an offence to incite hatred of any section of the public, albeit withoutspecific reference to racial hatred. The draft Bill appended to C. (63) 88would achieve both purposes. He had discussed the proposedenlargement of Section 5 with Mr. Iremonger, M.P., who waspromoting a Private Member&apos;s measure designed to make theincitement of racial hatred an offence.Mr. Iremonger had indicated that he would be prepared towithdraw his own proposal and to support the alternative provisionenvisaged by the draft Bill. Others of the Governments supportersKennedy to consider a further joint message to Mr. Khrushchev, whichwould be designed partly to remove certain misconceptions which mr. Khrushchev appeared to entertain about the scope and purposeof the proposed system of inspection of nuclear tests and partly to reaffirm the willingness of the Governments of the United Kingdomand United States to undertake further discussions in orderto promote agreement on a treaty to prohibit nuclear tests.Mr. Khrushchev&apos;s reaction to this offer would depend, to some extent,on the value which he attached to the prospect of further discussions with the West in the light of his pending confrontation with theCommunist Government of China about the ideological differences between China and the Soviet Union. But it would be in our interestto maintain our initiative, at least until the outcome of thatconfrontation was relatively clear.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement by the PrimeMinister.
The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Home Secretary to announce in parliament that the Government would shortly introduce a Bill toincrease the penalties for offences under the Public MeetingAct, 1908, and Section 5 of the Public Order Act, 1936, onthe basis proprosed in C. (63) 88.(2) Invited the Home Secretary, in dealing with the associatedquestion of an amendment to Section 5 of the public order Act, 1936, to be guided by the considerationsindicated by the First Secretary of State in his summing up.SECRET3213-1 a 3C.C. 34 (63)in the House of Commons, however, had indicated that they would feel bound to oppose it on the ground that it would represent anunwarrantable restriction of free speech. In these circumstances thewisest course might lie in introducing legislation which would be confined to increasing the penalties for offences as at present defined in the Act. The need for such an increase was urgent if the Governmentwere not to be criticised for having insufficient power to dealadequately with any further outbreaks of violence which might occurat public meetings.In discussion the following points were made:(a) If the proposed amendment of Section 5 would not in factstrengthen the existing law, there would be no advantage in promotingit. If, however, it would enlarge the scope of the law to the extent thata speaker using words which were calculated to incite hatred but werenot in themselves threatening, abusive or insulting would be guilty ofan offence, it was very doubtful whether the Government would bewell advised to appear to be seeking to impose this additional degreeof restriction on freedom of speech.(b) On the other hand, there was considerable and continuingpublic anxiety that the powers available under the present law were inadequate to deal effectively with deliberate attempts by groups ofpolitical extremists to stir up hatred of minority racial groups,particularly the Jewish community. If renewed violence of this kindbroke out, it would be held that the Government, by failing to takeadditional powers to prevent the incitement of racial hatred, had contributed to this result and must take responsibility for it. As against this, however, the Governments decision should not be materiallyaffected by the possibility that militant racial groups, whatever public sympathy they might enjoy, might take the law into their own hands.Moreover, powers for dealing with deliberate attempts to disruptpolitical meetings were already contained in the Public Meeting Act,1908; and these powers would, if necessary, have to be used.(c) A proposal to amend Section 5 of the 1936 Act on the lines suggested would be bound to be controversial. But the Parliamentarytimetable would make it impossible to pass any additionalcontroversial measure through all its stages before the summer recess.The First Secretary of State, summing up the discussion, saidthat the balance of advantage at this stage appeared to lie in refraining from any attempt to amend Section 5 of the Public Order Act, 1936,and in confining the scope of new legislation to the proposed increasein the penalties both under that Act and under the Public MeetingAct, 1908. Nevertheless, it would be appropriate that theannouncement of the Governmenfs intentions in this respect, whileavoiding any precise commitment for the future, should allow itto be inferred that the situation would be kept under close review andthat, if further experience showed that the powers available under theAct of 1936 were insufficient to maintain public order, further legislation might have to be introduced at a later date.
CommercialPolicyOverseasTradeNegotiations6. The President of the Board of Trade informed the cabinet of the results of various recent international discussions affecting ouroversea trade interests.A meeting of the Council of the European Free Trade Association(EFTA) had taken place in Lisbon on 9th and 10th May. agreement had been reached to abolish all internal tariffs by the end of 1966,some three years ahead of the date originally envisaged. There wereminor exceptions in the case of Norway and Austria; but for practical purposes the member countries of EFTA would have created, by1966, a mutual free trade area.A meeting of Commonwealth Trade Ministers had taken placein London on 13th and 14th May. This had revealed a certain disparityof interests between the member countries of the Commonwealth,who were now tending to fall into three groups the United Kingdomitself, which was a fully developed industrial economy; an intermediate group, consisting of the producers of temperateagricultural foodstuffs; and the less developed countries, whoseeconomies were still largely dependent on tropical products.Nevertheless, the discussions had shown once again the strength ofthe ties of sentiment and tradition which underlay the Commonwealthrelationship; and, although it had not been possible to establish a unified Commonwealth attitude towards the imminent discussions inrelation to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), theCommonwealth countries had agreed to provide each other, so faras possible, with mutual support.The Ministerial meeting of the GATT had been held at Genevafrom 16th to 21st May. The most important issue had concerned theprinciples which should govern the detailed negotiations on tariff reductions which were due to begin in May 1964. These discussions had revealed a sharp difference of approach between the United Statesand the member countries of the European Economic Community(e.c.). The United States had favoured the concept of linearreductions in tariffs; the E.E.C., on the other hand, had pressed fora larger reduction in high tariffs than in low tariffs. A compromisehad finally been evolved which, while endorsing the principle of linearreductions, envisaged, as a simultaneous objective, the reduction ofespecially high tariffs which constituted genuine barriers to trade.To some extent this compromise had merely postponed the effectivedecision; and the issue of principle might arise again in the course ofthe detailed discussions which it would now be necessary to undertake.Nevertheless, it was satisfactory that a breakdown of the conferenceat the outset had been avoided, especially since the negotiations which now lay ahead were likely to be difficult and protracted. During those negotiations we must seek to promote action to help agriculturalproducers and to encourage the development of a more generousattitude towards the problems of the under-developed countries.Special machinery had now been established to consider whether any amendment of the present rules of the GATT might be justified inthe interests of the trade of the less developed countries and to examine further measures to the same end.In discussion it was suggested that, while most of the provisionsof the Trade Agreement between the United Kingdom and Australiacould be allowed to remain in force until the probable results of thediscussions in the GATT could be seen more clearly, the provisions relating to cereal imports were now inconsistent with the Governmentsnew agricultural policy, could not be renewed into the next cereal yearand would probably have to be re-negotiated at an early date.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the President of the Board ofTrade and of the points made in their discussion.
South Africa(previous reference :C.C. (63) 23rdConclusions,Minute 6)Export ofArms(previous reference :C.C. (63) 1stConclusions,Minute 3)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the chief secretary, Treasury (C. (63) 87), about the export of arms to SouthAfrica.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that, of the three items atpresent in question, the 7-62-mm. ammunition would probably beused only for testing purposes. Equally, the 77-mm. high explosiveammunition was a normal requirement of the South African forces.The Strategic Exports Committee had therefore taken the view thatthe export of these two items v/ould not be inconsistent with theGovernments policy of refusing to supply arms which might be used by the South African Government to suppress civil disturbances.The request for 3,500 -38 Smith and Wesson revolvers, however,presented more difficulty in relation to this criterion. The SouthAfrican Government had rejected our informal suggestions that theyshould withdraw this request; and it now seemed likely that they intended to make it a test of our future intentions. The position was further complicated by the fact that the revolvers in question were of lease-lend origin; and the consent of the United States Governmentwould therefore have to be obtained before they could be exported to South Africa.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) Although it would be desirable to ascertain informallywhether the United States Government would agree to the exportof the revolvers, it would be unwise to appear to be seeking to transfer to them the responsibility for the effective decision. The South african government would be liable to retaliate by asking us to supplyrevolvers which were not of lease-lend origin; and we might incur,in relation to the United States, a moral obligation not to supply arms to South Africa which might be to our commercial disadvantage inother cases.(b) It had been made clear to the South African Government in1961 that they could not expect us to supply small arms and relatedammunition, in view of the political risk that weapons of this kind could be used for the suppression of civil disturbances. It could be argued that we should continue to adhere to this declared policy. But,if the South African Government chose to make a test case of their current application for revolvers, we should need to weigh theimportance of maintaining our previous policy against the dangerof provoking retaliatory action by the South African Governmentwhich might jeopardise not only our defence facilities in South Africabut also the substantial orders for military equipment which we might otherwise hope to obtain from the South African Government.(c) On the other hand, we should not lightly risk alienatingAfrican opinion in this matter, particularly since pressure for a banon the export of arms to South Africa was mounting in the security council of the United Nations.The First Secretary of State, summing up the discussion, saidthat, while there appeared to be no objection to the export of thefirst two items covered by the current application by the South african government, the proposed export of revolvers raised issues which made it desirable that we should undertake a comprehensive reviewof our policy as regards the export of arms to South Africa. A decisionon the export of the 3,500 revolvers in question must await the outcome of this review.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the export to South Africa of 10,000 rounds of -62-mm. ammunition and 2,400 rounds of 77-mm. high explosive ammunition.
(2) Took note that the First Secretary of State would advise thePrime Minister to arrange for a review of the government&apos;s policy on the export of arms to South Africa, withparticular reference to the request by the South african government for the export of 3,500 -38 revolvers.(3) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs to ascertaininformally whether the United States Government wouldbe likely to raise objection to the export to South Africaof revolvers of this type which were of lease-lend origin.Malaysia 8.   The Commonwealth Secretary said that the recent discussions(Previous        with the Government of Malaya about the level of defence aid to be reference:      provided by the United Kingdom had been inconclusive. With theC.C. (63) 25th agreement of the Chief Secretary, Treasury, he had offered a conclusions,     contribution of  15 million towards the capital expenses of them mute l)       Malayan  defence  programme  up  to   1966;   but  the  MalayanDefence Aid    Government had not accepted this offer, which they claimed was insufficient to enable them to provide for the defence of the borneo territories after their forthcoming incorporation in Malaysia. Theywere unwilling to contemplate the alternative course of curtailing their development programme; and the United Kingdom therefore facedthe choice of either accepting a greater liability for the defence of malaysia or offering more generous defence aid. The Malayan PrimeMinister would probably expect to discuss the matter further with theMinister of State, Colonial Office, who would be visiting Malaya inthe near future.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the offer of  15 million,which exceeded the  124- million authorised by the Cabinet, covered the whole of the foreign exchange element in the Malayan defence programme so far as purchases to be made in the United kingdom were concerned. The Malayan Government intended to spend afurther  3 million on purchases of defence equipment from othercountries; but there was no reason why the United Kingdom should assume this additional liability. Malaya was the richest country inSouth-East Asia; and any increase in our present offer of aid wouldbe liable to have serious repercussions elsewhere, particularly in India.In discussion it was suggested that it might become essential tooffer some further measure of defence aid to Malaya. The militarythreat which would face Malaysia, on its creation, would be liable tobe more grave than had been foreseen when the financial implications of this constitutional change had been first considered. Moreover,under present plans United Kingdom forces in Singapore would bereduced as a result of the transfer to the Government of Malaysiaof responsibility for internal security; but, if the local forces werenot built up to the necessary level, these reductions might not besecured. On the other hand, it would be premature to commit ourselves, without further consideration, to any specific amount ofadditional defence aid to be offered to Malaya; and, in so far as suchaid might eventually be given, it might be desirable to consider howfar it should be related to additional purchases in the United Kingdom.The Cabinet-Invited the Commonwealth Secretary and the chief secretary, Treasury, to consider further, in the light of their discussion, the extent of any additional defence aid thatmight be offered to the Government of Malaya and toarrange for the Minister of State for Colonial Affairs, during his forthcoming visit to Malaya, to ascertain, without commitment, the scope for further negotiation with theGovernment of Malaya on this subject.
broadcasting policy(previous reference :C.C. (63) 12thConclusions,Minute 5)Television bill. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that theannouncement that the British Broadcasting Corporation would shortly introduce a second television programme would be likely to lead to increased pressure from the Governmenfs supporters in theHouse of Commons for the provision of similarly increased facilitiesfor Independent Television. The fact that the imposition of the newlevy on the Independent Television programme companies was expected to lead to a substantial decrease in the present level of theirprofits would add force to the view that a second independent television channel should be introduced at an early date. While no provision would be made in the Bill now before Parliament for theprovision of such a channel, it would be desirable that the Postmaster-General should indicate in the course of debate that the Governmentwould be prepared to give favourable consideration to its introduction in due course, if this appeared to be warranted by the demand.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of this statement by the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster.10. The Minister of Transport said that the Railways Boardand the London Transport Board would shortly announce increases in the fares on public transport vehicles, both rail and road, forjourneys to and from London. These increases, which were necessary on commercial grounds, would take effect on 23rd June, 1963. Therewould be no change in the fares for journeys of less than four miles;and the fares for journeys of more than intermediate length wouldalso be unaffected. But fares for intermediate distances would beincreased by about 10 per cent.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Minister of Transport.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,23rd May, 1963.Transport(previous reference :C.C.
