SECRET1. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE recalled that intheir discussion of the United Kingdom strategic nuclear deterrent on 4 March (of which, by agreement, no minutes had been circulated) the Cabinet had been informed of the highly favourable terms on which it reemed likely that the United States would be prepared to make the Trident 2 (D5) missile system available to Britain, in place of the Trident 1 (C4) system agreed on in July 1980.    In accordance with the authority given at the conclusion of that discussion, an agreement had now been concluded.    This agreement would now be announced that afrernoon, and the formal Exchangee of Letters embodying it would be presented to Parliament in a White Paper.    His statement in the House of Commons, which would be repeated in the House of Lords, would concentrate on three points:  the need for the new missile;  the cost issues involved;  and the fact that present plans did not envisage Britain taking advantage of the greater capacity of Trident 2 in order to deploy greater striking power than she would have done with Trident 1.    He would be publishing an Open Government Document explaining the decision, as well as more condensed publicity material designed for wider audiences;   copies had been circulated to members of the Cabinet at the present meeting. Suitable material was also being made available to Conservative Party organisations throughout the country.In the course of a brief discussion it was noted how clearly the publicity material brought out the relatively small cost of the strategic nuclear deterrent, including the means of protecting it, by comparison with defence expenditure on other capabilities, eg antisubmarine warfare.    Opinion in the Glasgow area would also welcome the news, which should be emphasised, that the switch from Trident 1 to Trident 2 would increase the amo&apos;int of money spent on developing sho re facilities for the deterrent but not the amount of land involved.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion,  said that the Cabinet endorsed the agreements on the acquisition of Trident 2 and noted the favourable terms which had been negotiated, particularly in relation to offset arrangements and surcharge payments.The Cabinet. -1. Agreed that the United Kingdom should acquire a four-boat Trident 2 force under the agreements reached with the President and the Secretary for Defense of the United States.2. Invited the Secretary of State for Defence to announce the decision to acquire Trident 2, and the agreements reached with the United States, to Parliament that afternoon.3. Took note that Britain&apos;s allies would now be informed of the decision before it was announced.1SECRET
CONFIDENTIALTARYy Healthmend ^t) BinC-ofeagan2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill would receive its Second Reading in the House of Commons on 22 March.    He proposed thatit should then be referred to a Special Standing Committee.    He did not himself favour this procedure, but there was considerable pressure for a continuation of the experiment which had been conducted in the previous Session.    It might be that the result of referring the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill to a Special Standing Committee woulc be to convince a larger number of Members of Parliament that the experiment should be discontinued,THE PRIME MINISTER said that in the public debate on the restructuring of higher education the Government&apos;s case was going by default.    The impression had been given on television that the Chairman of the University Grants Committee, Dr Edward Parkes, was remote from the realities.    Steps should be taken to correct this impression, perhaps by arranging for Dr Parkes tc appear on television again.    She would discuss further with the Secretary of State for Scotland and other colleagues most closely concerned whether the Secretary of State should take part in the Supply Day debate on Scottish higher education on 17 March instead of carrying out his speaking engagement in connection with the by-election at Glasgow, Hillhead.The Cabinet -1        Took note.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Leader of the Opposition had protested publicly about what he regarded as the failure of the Government to consult the Opposition on the suggestion that President Reagan might be invited to address Members of both Houses of Parliament in Westminster Hall during his visit to the United Kingdom in June.    It was unthinkable that the Head of State of our major ally, and the effective Head of the Atlantic Alliance, should pay an official visit to this country, as the guest of The Queen, without being invited to address Members of both Houses. The obvious venue for such an address was Westminster Hall, which was part of the common heritage of the United Kingdom and the United States.    All that had happened so far was that a United States official had been shown the Hall by the Serjeant at Arms and Black Rod.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALShe had made it clear to Mr Foot that in her view earlier formal consultation with the Opposition parties would have been premature. The Shadow Cabinet had discussed the matter the previous evening, but in an earlier discussion that she had had with Mr Foot, it had appeared that the Opposition&apos;s objections to the proposal were threefold.    They regarded Mr Reagan as a highly controversial figure;  but that had also been true of Mr Kosygin.    They argued that he had only been in office for a relatively short time:  he had, however, been Head of State for longer than had General De Gaulle when he spoke in Westminster Hall in 1960.    Finally, the Opposition attached great importance to their riew that any address should be given in the Royal Gallery (as for all other Heads of State or Government since the war except General De Gaulle) rather than in Westminster Hall.    This was a trivial and small-minded objection.    Although the United States Government appear to take a relaxed view of the venue, it would be hard to justify according the President a lesser privilege than General De Gaulle;  and it would be unfortunate if the Royal Gallery were used and Mr Foot then chose to represent this as a capitulation to pressure from the Opposition. The choice seemed to be to hold a joint meeting in Westminster Hall, in the probable absence of many members of the Labour Party, or to hold it in the Royal Gallery with greater all-Party participation. She was strongly inclined towards the former option, subject to the view of the Cabinet, but she would take a final decision in consultation with colleagues most closely concerned after she had seen Mr Foot again later that day.The Cabinet -2,       Agreed that, subject to the outcome of the Prime Minister&apos;s further discussion with Mr Foot, arid to consultations with other parties concerned, President Reagan should be formally invited to address Members of both Houses of Parliament during his visit to the United Kingdom in June.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatstories current in the Soviet Union of nepotism and corruption affecting members of President Brezhnev&apos;s family suggested that changes in the leadership might be imminent.    It seemed that Mr Chernenko&apos;s star was now in the ascendant.THE SECR.ETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that a decision was needed soon on whether to proceed with the agreed timetable for the withdrawal of British forces from Belize.    If the date for withdrawal were postponed, the garrison might have to remain for a considerable time.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatMr Haughey had been elected Taoiseach as a result of having obtainedthe support of a number of independent members of the Dail throughpromises of Government aid for their constituencies. Thesepromises would affect his Government&apos;s economic policies, andMr Haughey was therefore likely to seek to divert attention away fromthe economic field by taking a hard line towards Northern Ireland.In discussion it was noted that Mr Haughey&apos;s recent speech had been ill-received in Northern Ireland and was likely to have the effect of rallying support for Mr Paisley.    Recent Irish election rercults had shown the weaknesses of the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system of proportional representation.The Cabinet -Took note.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that heunderstood that the Community&apos;s case against the actions by the United States steel companies had been presented ineptly by the Commission in Washington.    It might become necessary for the United Kingdom to take an independent initiative.    The Secretary of State was also concerned that tne Italians were failing to implement the Community&apos;s agreement on the control of steel production* and considered that the United Kingdom should stiffen the Commission&apos;s resolve to ensure that all member states complied with the agreement.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY reported that he would be discussing the Mandate with the French Foreign Minister on 15 March and that the Prime Minister and he would be discussing the handling of the negotiations with the Presidents of the Council of Ministers and the Commission on 16 March.The Cabinet -Took note.5. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENTsuggested that the various forms of assistance available for small businesses were not sufficiently well known to those directly concernec or to local people, such as accountants, bank managers and solicitors, to whom they might turn for advice.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that there was general agreement in the Cabinet that more could be done to draw to the attention of those concerned the various forms of assistant and support that the Government now provided for small businesses, and to create an informed body of public opinion on the needs of and opportunities for small businesses.    It should be possible to make mo use both of television and of the Press for this purpose.The Cabinet -1.       Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation with the Lord President, the Secretary of State for the Environment, the Secretary of State for Industry and the paymaster General to consider and make recommendations for improvements in the arrangements for ensuring that information about the availability of Government assistance and support for small businesses was as widely disseminated as possible.5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that reports from London Transport&apos;s bus ar.d train depots suggested that support for the one day strike called on 10 March to protest about the forthcoming rise in London Transport fares had been much less than wholehearted.    The staff concerned came out largely because they were ordered to do so by their unions, though the unions had been able to work up an industrial issue which had no doubt helped to ensure support for the strike.    The London Transport Executive were now concerned at the possibility of action by London Transport staff to encourage or to incite passengers not to pay the new fares. The Executive would prepare to take disciplinary action if the need arose.The Cabinet -2.      Took note.Cabinet Office 11 March 19826CONFIDENTIAL
