CONFIDENTIAL1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.4j^g 2. THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the internal situation inPoland appeared to have stabilised.    Tight control was being maintained by the authorities, who were encountering cnly passive resistance at present, although there might be more serious trouble with the Solidarity movement in the spring.    No more than cosmetic vi0Us changes were expected in the martial law regime, but it had beenrenCe. agreed that the International Committee of the Red Cross should82) 2n,j have early access to political detainees, who still numberedc*u8ion several thousand.    Successive meetings of the North Atlantic Council&gt;te 2     &apos; (NAC) had been considering what Western counter-measures shouldbe taken both against Poland and against the Soviet Union. The Americans were pressing for a stronger response than many of Britain&apos;s European partners were prepared to contemplate. There was thus a danger of a damaging public split in the Alliance, which might come to a head at the next NAC meeting on 3 February. The Defence and Oversea Policy Committee would be considering what Britain might do to avert this danger, as well as to safeguard existing British contracts, for example in the important case of John Brown Engineering.    There did not appear to be any foundation for rumours that the Japanese were preparing to pick up Soviet contracts with which otheT   Western firms were unable to proceed. Meanwhile the European Community had agreed on 26 January to suspenu its programme of subsidised food sales to Poland and to .   . redirect the Community funds involved to humanitarian assistancethrough the voluntary agencies.naTHE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that, as the Cabinet would be aware, iou8 there was to be a general election in the Republic of Ireland ontenCe&lt; 18 February, following the defeat of the Government in the Dail in1)  ^ a vote of confidence on one of the budget proposals put forward by thelu8i0ris Government under Dr Fitzgerald.ce 3The Cabinet Took note.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL^AlRNlTY a* THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the Foreign Ministers onMonday had failed for the third time to resolve the four key outstanding issues on the Mandate.    The United Kingdom was not isolated on ^trnai a^  * t^lem:  ot^ers had reserves on certain agricultural points. But *F0r   ^eet^ng        the United Kingdom was largely isolated on the budget, mainly becauselister *e 0thers insisted that our refunds should be degressive, by which 125 JailUaS they meant that the rate of the refunds should come down regardlessfCC(8i)of what happened to our unadjusted net contributions.    The ForeignPrevi and Commonwealth Secretary had made it clear that we could agreeRe{er   8 to a reduction in our refunds only if and as our unadjusted netf ence&gt;               ,^2%       contributions came down.    The Belgian Foreign Minister, asCotlcluF; President of the Council, and the President of the Commission wereMinute8* ns&apos; now making contact with national capitals to search for a way forwardc uncil^iste THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the Council of Ministers(Forei rs (Foreign Affairs) on 26 January had solved the problem of the price*6 Jatl8n Affairs) to be paid for sugar imported from the African Caribbean and PacificLry (ACP) countries into the Community.    The ACP countries would gettevi0u more for their sugar in the current marketing year, but the storage^efe^en- levy at Preeent Paid bY Tate and Lyle had been suspended for threeyears from 1982-83.    This was a satisfactory outcome and our hope 0llclusi was tbat ^e st ra8e levy would in practice never be reimposed.dilute 3OXXS&apos; The Council had also discussed the dispute with the EuropeanParliament about the 1982 Community Budget.    The Parliament had adopted a Budget larger than the one agreed by the Council, and it was argued that the Parliament&apos;s action had been illegal.    It might be necessary to devise some means of taking the issue to the European Court, and consideration was being given as to how this might be done. The British Government would have to decide whether to pay its first contribution to the 1982 budget in February on the basis agreed by the Council or the basis adopted by the Parliament.The Cabinet -Took note.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALlfiti h Rail4. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that theAmalgamated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) had announced a further round of strikes on 3, 4 and 7 February. The British Railways Board (BRB) had decided not to pay other railmen for whom there was no work on Sunday 31 January and any subsequent Sundays.    They were considering whether to stop overtime payments on other days, but had not taken a final decision.    There was no immediate prospect of escalation either by ASLEF or the BRB.    For the time being it seemed best to allow the pressures to build up on ASLEF. Press reports about malpractices by footplatemen had angered ASLEF members at first, but might now be affecting the morale of the rank and file;  and they would also shortly be feeling for the first time the effects of the loss of pay resulting from strike action.    The majority of the ASLEF leadership were, however, militants with little regard for the damage being done to the future of the railways.    The effects on coal stocks and the economy generally were being caretully monitored. Morale among rail commuters remained high.    If the industrial action continued beyond a further two weeks, it might be necessary to consider whether there was any initiative which might resolve the dispute. Meanwhile there should be no suggestion that the Government was likely to intervene, and the handling should be left to the BRB.The Cabinet -1.Took note.^eantoTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that evi0Us Mr John De Lorean had been to see him on 21 January and again,^efence&gt; following a meeting in New York with his Board and his advisers, on thes^2) 2nd previous evening, when he had made proposals for strengthening theuMusi0n company&apos;s balance sheet.    He had told Mr. De Lorean that no more^ute 4     &apos; Government finance was available and that the Government would behaving an inquiry into the state of the company carried out by a team from Coopers and Lybrand assisted by Sir Kenneth Cork;  this would be completed within two weeks.    It had been made clear publicly that the Government had offered no further help or comfort to Mr De Lorean and the company had committed itself to trading henceforth on a cash basis only,     Production was being cut back and substantial redundancies were being declared.    There was a possibility that Sir Kenneth Cork might advise that the company would be viable at a lower rate of production and that a purchaser might be sought for-it on that basis;  it was however probable that Mr De Lorean would need to sever his connection with the company.    So far there have been no adverse political consequences in Northern Ireland.    He would keep hi3 colleagues informed of further developments.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe Cabinet -2.       Took note.5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C(82) 1) on the Government&apos;s economic strategy and its implications for the preparation of his forthcoming Budget.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet recognised that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would have to determine both the main budgetary judgment and the details of budgetary measures in the light of the situation and prospect as they appeared nearer the time.    The discussion had shown that the Cabinet agreed that it would be right to continue on the broad strategy which the Government had followed hitherto.    It was essential not to put at risk the objective of reducing inflation;  within that the aim should be to enable the country to take advantage of the prospects of recovery.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2. Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to take account of the views expressed and the points made in discussion in the preparation of his forthcoming Budget.Cabinet Office 28 January 19824CONFIDENTIAL
