CONFIDENTIALPa p T^FAIR^ENTARY   l- The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the^ House of Commons during the following week.3Ul THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that, if theCanada Bill completed its progress through the Commons as planned on ^eyi Us ^ March, she would hope to be able to arrange its introduction in theerence- House of Lords on 9 or 10 March, with Second Reading on 16 or 18 March^(82) 5^&apos; and Royal Assent by 25 March.    She could not, however, guarantee this^Ollclusions timetable.    Although the House of Lords authorities had taken the view^ute i that the Bill was unamendable, there was a possibility of a hostile motionbeing tabled on Second Reading, and there might well be a substantive debate on each clause at Committee Stage.    It was important that the House should not be given the impression that they were being forced to consider the Bill to a predetermined timetable.    This made it undesirable that any announcement should be made about the date of a possible Royal Visit to Canada before the Bill had made significant progress in the Lords.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that it was to be hoped that the House of Lords would deal with the Canada Bill no less expeditiously than the Commons.    The possibility of a Royal Visit to 1 Canada around the end of March should if possible be kept open for the moment, and the timing of any public announcement should be reviewed once the Canada Bill had been introduced in the House of Lords.The Cabinet -Took note.*AlRS 2  THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that a new Government had not yet^ *    been formed in the Republic of Ireland following the general election.e*ai*d The Prime Minister would be chosen when the Dail met on 9 March.The leader of the Fianna Fail Party, Mr Haughey, wa s facing a challenge to his position from Mr Desmond O&apos;Malley.^ THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the observers whom the Government^efV^ Us would be sending to the forthcoming elections in El Salvador had not yetC~ erenCe, been chosen.    It was intended to select distinguished persons fromC0    ) 6th outside politics.    None of the other members of the European\y C   sions Community had agreed to send observers, and it seemed likely that2     &apos; observers weuld be present only from a number of Latin Americancountries including Venezuela and Honduras. There was a risk that the British observers&apos; report, which would be published, would be criticalCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALof the conduct of the elections.    But the decision to send observers could be defended on the grounds that only their presence enabled a fair judgment to be made about the validity of left wing attempts to discredit the elections as a sham even before they took place.In discussion the point was made that, while it was right to assist the Americans in their policies in Central America, Eritiah involvement in El Salvador would be criticised not only on the left but by some of the Government&apos;s supporters in the country.    It was important that the names of the British observers should be announced soon, in order to avoid any impression that the Government were having second thoughts about the wisdom of their decision.    It was not widely known that the Unitea States provided El Salvador with far more economic than military aid by value.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that there was no sign of any political solution in Poland.    Nothing was to be expected from the current meetin of the Plenum of the Polish Communist Party nor from the meeting of the Sejm the following day.    General Jaruzelski&apos;s government was still facing the dilemma that if it relaxed the martial law regime it would hav to face further unrest in the country, while if it maintained the present restrictions the economy would continue to deteriorate.    It was clear from recent reports that Western action to restrict the provision of credit was beginning to affect the Polish economy.The Cabinet -Took note.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALFaIRS 3* THE LORD PRIVY SEAL reported the main results of theCouncil of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) on 23-24 February.    The Council PUllcil of ^aa discussed Japan&apos;s reaction to the Community&apos;s request for positiverasters steps to reduce their trade surplus.    It was agreed that their measures,, reign although a step in the right direction, had not been nearly enough and/aii?s) that; the pressure should be kept up on them to do more.    The Councili&apos;^^ebr kac* commissioned further studies of the scope for common action andUarY        would consider the matter again at its next meeting in March. The evious Council had agreed to a number of minor advances in the negotiations forJerelce- ^e accession of Portugal.    Following discussion of the proposal by theP^) 5th German and Italian Foreign Ministers for a European Act, Foreignj,nclusi0ris Ministers had asked a group of officials to work on a revised draft of^te 2 this document.    It would not require legislation and the United Kingdomintended to try to replace the word &quot;Act&quot; by a more appropriate title. The Council had agreed that its meeting on Tuesday 23 March should be reserved for a serious discussion of the 30 May Mandate. The Presidents of the Council and the Commission were to have bilateral contacts with member states in the meantime.    The Commission would be producing illustrative figures of the scale of the problem and the possible method of solving it.    The Council&apos;s discussion of Poland had gone well and all member states except Greece, and possibly Denmark, had agreed to the idea of imposing restrictionc on importb of manufactured goods and luxury products from the Soviet Union.l^**Y THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that on Sundaye^ 21 February he had been called upon for the second time to chair af meeting of Finance Ministers to decide on a realignment within theefe^ Us European Monetary System.    The negotiations had been difficult andetice. prolonged.    They were not helped by the fact that the Belgians had0tJ ^) 6tb announced in advance their intention of securing a 12 per centlin^Usions devaluation, and that, throughout the negotiations, their Finance6 3 Ministei was in touch with his Prime Minister who was continually-speaking to the press.    In the end agreement had been reached on a Belgian devaluation of 8j per cent.    The Danes had made a bid for a devaluation of 7 per cent but were able to secure agreement to no more than 3 per cent.    It had been agreed that any consequential devaluations of &quot;green&quot; rates should be postponed until after the agricultural price-fixing negotiations.    A very technical prcblem had arisen over the French wish to avoid the creation of a 1 per cent negative monetary compensatory amount for France and in the end Finance Ministers had agreed to suspend the usual rule until the end of March.    The result  would be that France would enjoy a very small preferential advantage for a few weeks.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE LORD PRIVY SEAL reported that only 75 per cent of the electorate had voted in the Greenland referendum but 52 per cent of the votes had been in favour of withdrawal from the Community.    This meant that a majority of the electorate had not voted for withdrawal and the Danish Government would now have to decide what to do.In discussion it was stressed that the United Kingdom should insist on very tough negotiations about the terms of Greenland&apos;s withdrawal. If the Community made it easy for Greenland to withdraw, and especially if they were allowed to establish a 200-mile fishing limit and sell the resulting catches freely in the Community market, the Government would encounter serious political difficulties at home with the opponents of Community membership in general and the Community fishing policy in particular.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office 2 5 February 19824CONFIDENTIAL
