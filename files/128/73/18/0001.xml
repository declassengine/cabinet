As the Frime Minister had informed Parliament earlier that afternoon, he himself would be visiting Washington on 22 April.    He would be putting counter-proposals to Mr Haig, who was himself clearly disappointed by the results of his talks in Buenos Aires and did not appear to rule out continuing his attempts at negotiating a settlement.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that maximum diplomatic, economic and military pressure would need to be exerted if the Argentine Government were to be brought to agree to acceptable provisions in three crucial areas in particular:  withdrawal arrangements;  the interim administration; and provision for negotiating a definitive solution.    Meanwhile it was important to preserve the confidentiality of the draft proposals, and comment should be kept to aSECRET
SECRETminimum.    She would arrange for the Press to be told that the Cabinet had taken stock of the present position, particularly in the light of the Argentine proposals communicated by Mr Haig and of the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s forthcoming visit to Washington.The Cabinet -2.
