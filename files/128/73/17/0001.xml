He was in discussion with the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Trade about the need for and timing of emergency legislation, and the drafting of a Bill on a contingency basis had almost been completed.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that a particular problem arose in relation to the Trading with the Enemy Act. If Argentina declared war on the United Kingdom, the draconian provisions of the Act would automatically come into effect.    It would be preferable for the Act to be brought into force by Order in Council, and any emergency legislation should contain a provision to this effect.The Cabinet -2. Took note.1CONFIDENTIAL
