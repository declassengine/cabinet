There was a general recognition in the United States that the strategy of applying diplomatic, economic and military pressure on Argentina was correct.    There was strong support for the United Kingdom in American public opinion.    The United States Administration were prepared to consider further economic measures against Aigentina, which would have not only an immediate impact on Argentina but a helpful effect on the attitude of the United Kingdom&apos;s European partners. But the United States had a very strong interest in an early resolution of the dispute before the crisis deepened still further, and Mr Haig had not abandoned his efforts to seek a diplomatic solution or his emphasis on the need for a new initiative.    They had discussed a range of ideas, including some which had originated from the Peruvian Government, had made clear that Britain was prepared to discuss proposals for a settlement provided that Argentine forces were withdrawn from the Islands and that the outcome of negotiations affecting sovereignty was not prejudged.    The ideas put forward by Senor Perez de Cuellar were vague;  but he might, as a Peruvian, have a useful role to play when a suitable opportunity occurred.    It was important to make a constructive diplomatic effort, even if it was unlikely to succeed: international opinion should be left in no doubt that the United Kingdom really wished to secure a peaceful solution.    Although it was difficult to predict the Argentines&apos; reactions, the signs were that recent British military successes had had the effect of increasing their determination.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that the sinking by a British submarine of the cruiser General   Belgrano, with the probable ioss of many Argentine sailors, would need careful presentation. At the time of the Argentine invasion only luck and the skill of British Servicemen had prevented the loss of HMS Endurance and casualties to British forces.    The overriding concern was the protection of BritishHeSECRET
SECRETforces.    Although Argentina had been warned on 23 April that any approach by Argentine warships or military aircraft, which could amount to a threat to interfere with the mission of British forces in the South Atlantic, would encounter the appropriate response, general authority to attack Argentine warships constituting such a threat outside the Total Exclusion Zone had not been given until the day after Argentine forces had launched an attack on the fleet.    Further military action in the next weeks might be necessary in order to reduce the dif icultie9 of an opposed landing on the Islands, should one become necessary.THE CHIEF OF THE DEFENCE STAFF briefed the Cabinet on the military situation.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that there was general support for the view that further diplomatic initiatives were needed with the dual aim of securing the withdrawal of Argentine troops and maintaining broad international support for the United Kingdom position.    There was wide admiration for the professionalism and skill which the Armed Services had shown in the recent engagements.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office 4 May 19822SECRET
