Spain. 1.   The Foreign Secretary said that the United States Govern-(previous        ment had proposed that the Governments of the United KingdomUeference:      and France should join with them in making a further declarationCM.(46) 18th   designed to precipitate the end of the Franco regime in Spain.  this conclusions,     would state that, so long as General Franco continued in control of minute 2.)      Spain, the Spanish people could not look for full and cordialassociation with those nations of the world which had overthrownthe totalitarian regimes in Germany and Italy.   It would express the hope that the Spanish people might soon find means to bringabout the peaceful withdrawal of General Franco, the abolition ofthe Falange, and the establishment of an interim Government whichwould give the Spanish people the opportunity to determine freelythe type of government they wished to have and to choose their leaders.  Such an interim Government must be prepared to facilitatea political amnesty, the return of exiled Spaniards, freedom of assembly and political association and free public elections.    an interim Government dedicated to those ends should receive the recognition and support of all freedom-loving peoples.The Foreign Secretary said that after full consideration he was satisfied that it would be expedient to make such a declaration. Atthe same time, he thought it right to draw the Cabinets attentionto the risks involved. There was some danger that, by forcingGeneral Franco&apos;s withdrawal, we might plunge Spain into anothercivil war. Alternatively, he might be succeeded by a Governmenthardly more acceptable to us. There was also the possibility that, asa result of this declaration, there might be some interruption of theessential supplies which we were now drawing from Spain. Withthis in view he had asked the Departments concerned to make an urgent review of alternative sources of supply, particularly of fertilisers, iron ore, pyrites and resin.The Foreign Secretary added that the suggestion had been made that, as an alternative procedure, the Spanish situation might havebeen brought before the Security Council. He did not himself see how this matter could have been brought before the Council, underthe terms of the United Nations Charter; but he had asked the attorney-General to verify that this alternative procedure wouldnot in fact have been practicable.It was the view of the Cabinet that, in spite of the risks involved, it was necessary that firm action should now be taken tobring about a change in the political regime in Spain.The Cabinet-Agreed that His Majesty&apos;s Government should join withthe Governments of the United States and France inmaking a public declaration on the lines indicated by theForeign Secretary with a view to securing a change ofGovernment in Spain.2. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that, without prior notification to His Majesty&apos;s Government and contrary to theprovisions of Article 5 of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty of 1942 with Persia, the Soviet Government had publicly announced their intention to retain troops in some parts of Persia after the2nd March, 1946, pending the clarification of the situation there.He informed the Cabinet of the terms of a note of protest which hehad caused to be presented to the Soviet Government. This called attention to the understanding that both Eussian and Britishtroops would be withdrawn from Persia by the 2nd March, 1946, inaccordance with the terms of the Treaty, and pointed out that any failure on the part of the Soviet Government to withdraw their troops from Persia by that date would be regarded by us as a breach of their obligations to us under that Treaty.
The Foreign Secretary said that he did not propose to take theinitiative in bringing this new development before the security council. If it was to come before the Council, it should be brought forward by the Persian Government and not at the instance of oneof the Great Powers.In discussion the suggestion was made that insufficient publicityhad been given to the fact that the British troops had been withdrawn from Persia by the agreed date. The Prime ministers aid that he would take the opportunity of referring to this in his speech in the Defence debate in the House of Commons that afternoon.The Cabinet-Took  note with approval  of the Foreign  Secretary&apos;sstatement.Syria andthe Lebanon.(previous reference erence:CM. (46) 16thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Foreign Secretary said that it had now been agreed that!French and British troops should be withdrawn from Syria by the [30th April, 1946. The arrangements for the withdrawal of troops]from the Lebanon were still under discussion.The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked for an assurance thatthe troops to be withdrawn from the Levant States would not beheld in the Middle East. It was important that the reduction ofour military commitments should produce a corresponding reduction of our military expenditure overseas.The Cabinet were informed that, although the troops solwithdrawn might not themselves be returned to this country, ourlwithdrawal from Syria would result in a net reduction in the BritishJforces in the Middle East.world supplies ofCereals.ProposedPoliticalDiscussionswith UnitedStates andCanadianGovernments.(previous reference erence:CM. (46) 19thConclusions,Minute 8.)4. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the memorandunby the Lord President (CP. (46) 80) proposing that further step;should be taken to impress upon the Governments of Canada antthe United States the need for increased production of wheat. Thejjalso had before them a further memorandum by the Lord Preside^(CP. (46) 90) emphasising the urgency of this problem.The Prime Minister said that he had arranged for the Ministejof Food to go to Washington to take part in the discussions of the  Combined Food Board about the revision of the proposed alloca;tions of wheat for the current six months and, in particular, tjassist the Indian Food Delegation in presenting their case. ThMinister^ mission related, however, to the short-term problem. Th)Cabinet had now to consider the issues about production over th;next two years which were raised in the Lord Presidentmemoranda.The Lord President reminded the Cabinet that, while the gajbetween supplies and demand for the current period was wideninthe first estimates for the subsequent period showed the prospetof another most serious gap.   Accumulated stocks would by the whole been exhausted and there would be little to rely upon excewhat was produced at the next harvest.   There seemed therefolevery likelihood of an even worse shortage next year than thijunless the main exporting countries could be induced to increa;their acreage.   At present few countries were even purportingtake steps proportionate to the gravity of the situation.   In tiUnited States, the President seemed anxious to help, but neitbhe nor his advisers seemed to be making satisfactory progress,however, the President could instruct his agricultural advisersrevise their target of spring sowings and to alter the balanceprices between wheat and coarse grains, there was still timesecure a substantial improvement in the prospects of averting
major famine next year. In Canada, there was evidence that theGovernment were by no means anxious to increase sowings or toadvise farmers to adopt a rotation of three years&apos; cereals and oneyear fallow instead of two years&apos; cereals and one year fallow.For ourselves, we could make special arrangements to securewheat from Canada and other Commonwealth countries, but it wasidle to suppose that the United Kingdom could maintain a positionin which it received all that it required while other parts of theCommonwealth India, South Africa and parts of the colonial empire were starving. We were the principal importing countryand there was a duty on us to take the lead in representing theworld&apos;s needs to the producing countries with a view to inducingthem to increase their sowings. The political repercussions in thiscountry if next year there was starvation in the Empire and con-tinued stringencies here would be very serious. In his opinion, bothduty and interest made it necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto take most energetic action to avert the crisis.He made two main suggestions. First, he thought thatimporting countries should do all they could to give-assurances toexporting countries, about their purchases for the next few years.The Canadian Government had already been told that the UnitedKingdom would pay $1-55 for all wheat purchased up to the endof 1947 and a price not below $1 for the following two years. Attheir last meeting the Cabinet had invited the Minister of Food to explore the possibility of giving a similar assurance to theAustralian Government. Could not the Governments of India,France and other importing countries now be asked to give similarassurances to the United States ? Secondly, to secure the co-operation of the United States and Canadian Governments, it seemed desirable to put the situation before them as dramaticallyas possible. It was necessary to enlist the enthusiasm of the Presi-dent, Mr. Byrnes and Mr. Dean Acheson in the United States, andof Mr. Mackenzie King1 and his Cabinet in Canada to overcome the reluctance of farming interests to expand their acreage. For thispurpose he suggested that the Foreign Secretary should, within thenext few days, pay a short visit to both the United States and canada. He realised that this was a big request to make : hethought, however, that the situation justified it.The Foreign Secretary said that he would like more time toconsider this suggestion. If he went to America, he would beexpected to discuss other matters besides the world wheat situation;and it was possible to exaggerate the importance of the personalapproach. It might be preferable to raise these issues in the firstinstance through our Ambassador in Washington, who had greatinfluence with the members of the United States Administration.In further discussion the following points were made : &apos;(a) The United States and Canada had learned from experiencethat a drastic increase in wheat acreage might have disastrousresults. A subsequent failure in demand might break prices and reduce farmers to bankruptcy. Further, excessive sowings of wheatmight result in a seriously unbalanced agriculture and an exhaustedsoil.(&amp;) How could the importing countries finance long-term con-tracts for the purchase of United States wheat? We were notourselves proposing to buy wheat from the United States; but towhat extent could India guarantee to buy United States wheat with-out drawing upon our pool of United States dollars ? The FrenchGovernment, on the other hand, had gold resources and should beable to purchase wheat in the United States and to give an assur-ance that they would do so. The United States Government miglitalso be willing to arrange tied loans through the Export-ImportBank to countries ready to give assurances that they would importwheat from the United States over the next few years.(c) The possibility of increased exports from the Argentineshould not be overlooked, although the political situation thereprevented any further approach at the moment.
id) The Australian harvest could not affect the situation beforethe end of 1946, but a fresh appeal might be made to the australian government for still further efforts. India was one of the naturalmarkets for Australian wheat, and any request to Australia mightbe linked up with the suggestion that the Indian Government, inaddition to meeting its immediate needs, should build up a reserve for the future. It might be possible for India to give an assurance tothe Australian Government for considerable purchases over a termof years. From the political aspect it was preferable that she should obtain assistance towards her food supplies from within the Empirerather than from the United States. These political points mightbe put to the Australian Minister Resident in London, in additionto the approaches which the Minister of Food had already been authorised to make (CM. (46) 19th Conclusions, Minute 8) fromthe supply point of view.(e) It was important that the United States and canadian government&apos;s should be made to realise the implications of food shortage and famine in terms of civil disorder, loss of productionand particularly-delay in demobilisation.(/) Had the estimates of next year&apos;s harvests taken sufficientaccount of the recuperative power of Europe? M. Bidault was reported to have said that France would be growing a further2-g million acres of wheat this year; and more should be forthcoming from the Danube basin. The Foreign Secretary had been assured that practically all the corn-growing land in the Soviet Union wouldbe tilled this season, despite the shortage of implements and there might be an exportable surplus from the Soviet Union. Thisstrengthened the case for suggesting that the Soviet Union shouldrelieve U.N.R.R.A. of responsibility for supplying wheat to poland and Czechoslovakia.(g) Could any action be taken to increase spring sowings, beforethe Emergency Economic Committee for Europe met at the beginningof April to consider cropping policy for the autumn -and theslaughter of livestock ? The Minister of State doubted whether further action could be taken at this stage. In parts of Europethere was not enough seed to plant land which was ready for sowing,and attempts were being made to substitute vegetable crops for cereals.(h) It was suggested that in the near future a White paper should be presented setting out the action taken by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment with a view to averting world-wide famine.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider whether theFrench Government and the Governments of otherimporting countries might not be asked to give exporting countries assurances as to their purchases of cereals overthe next few years, those countries with dollar resourcesbeing invited to give assurances to the United StatesGovernment.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for India to consult theGovernment of India as to the possibility of their givingsimilar assurances to exporting countries, particularlyAustralia.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs todiscuss with the Australian Minister Resident in london the political point noted in paragraph (d) above.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider wdietherthe purchase of wheat from the United States by countries without dollar resources might be financed bytied loans from the Export-Import Bank.(5) Decided to resume discussion of the remaining issues raised in CP. (46) 80 and 90 at a further meeting to be heldon the following day.
5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the PrimeMinister and Minister of Defence (CP. (46) 88) covering the draftof a White Paper announcing the post-war code of pay, allowances,retired pay and Service gratuities for commissioned officers of the armed Forces.The Prime Minister said that the new arrangements had been worked out by an inter-Departmental Committee, whose recom-mendations had been approved by a Ministerial Committee over which he had presided. The new code for officers followed the same general principles as had been adopted in the code for other rankswhich had been approved by the Cabinet and announced inDecember 1945. The new rates represented a substantial improve-ment on those at present in force.The Cabinet-Approved the new code of pay, &amp;o, for commissioned officers of the Armed Forces set out in the draft white paper annexed to CP. (46) 88; and took note that theWhite Paper would be presented to Parliament on the6th March.6. The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda bythe Foreign Secretary : CP. (46) 78 submitting the recommendations of the overseas Reconstruction Committee regarding the instructionsto be given to the United Kingdom representatives on the far eastern Commission on the control of Japanese industry;CP. (46) 79-setting out the arguments for and againstthe proposal that the Japanese should be forbidden to buildmerchant ships other than coastal craft.The Foreign Secretary said that in fixing the level of economic life for Japan in the early post-war period the Overseas Recon-struction Committee had tried to avoid creating conditions whichwould make it necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Government to incurexpenditure for the relief of Japan. The only point on which theCommittee had been unable to reach agreement was whether theJapanese should be allowed to build merchant ships other thancoastal craft, and the opposing arguments on this question were fully set out in CP. (46) 79. His own view was that the proposedprohibition on the possession of aircraft or aircraft factories would itself be effective in preventing future Japanese aggression, and thatit was unnecessary on security grounds to prohibit the building ofocean-going ships. He also believed that the prohibition of ship-building in Japan would not in itself have much effect on the prosperity of our own shipbuilding industry, and that if Japan weredenied a mercantile marine she would be driven to balance herpayments by a more intensive export drive, which was likely to beprejudicial to United Kingdom exports.The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that to allow the building of merchant ships other than coastal craft would mean that theJapanese would be able to create a valuable war potential of skilled men and technical experience, and would enable them to start any future war with the great advantage of having a mercantile marine.These opportunities could not be denied to Japan merely by limitingher annual steel consumption, as proposed, to 3-5 or 3-7 million tons. He did not propose that the prohibition of shipbuildingshould remain in force for all time, but it should at least be main-tained until Japan had given reasonable evidence of her intentionto pursue a peaceful policy in future. It was now suggested that,if Japan were denied a mercantile marine, she would be driven to balance her payments by a more intensive export drive; but the language used on this point in the memorandum by the Economicand Industrial Planning Staff of the Foreign Office (O.R.C (46) 18)was merely that the restriction would make it necessary for Japan to export a &quot; rather larger quantity &quot; of manufactured goods.
The Minister of War Transport supported the First Lord&apos;sargument. He added that the prohibition of shipbuilding would bemuch easier to enforce than other restrictions.The President of the Board of Trade said that we should not seek to impose on Japan restrictions which we had little hope ofbeing able to maintain for more than a short period. experience with Germany after the war of 1914-18 showed that, if the numberof restrictions imposed were excessive, the result was that within ashort time they all had to be removed. Japan must export to live.If she were compelled, not only to forgo her shipping earnings, butalso to pay for foreign shipping to carry her exports, she would be driven into increasing her export trade in consumer goods.In further discussion, it was pointed out that, althoughDominion Governments had been informed of the substance of the memoranda before the Cabinet, they had not yet offered any observa-tions on the proposals; and it was suggested that before reaching afinal decision the Cabinet should know the views of DominionGovernments, particularly the Governments of Australia and NewZealand.The Cabinet (1) Asked the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to invitethe Governments of Australia and New Zealand tocommunicate at once their views on the issues raised in cp. (46) 78 and CP. (46) 79 and to enquire whetherthe other Dominion Governments had comments to offer on these issues;(2) Agreed to resume consideration of these memoranda attheir meeting on the 8th March.Shipbuilding.. 7.   At their meeting on the 25th February the Cabinet hadShipbuilding agreed that the Shipbuilding Advisory Committee proposed inAdvisory CP. (46) 64 should contain representatives of the shipping industry,Committee. including at least one who could represent the views of officers and(Previous seamen of the merchant navy.Reference: -j^e Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by the FirstCM. (46) 18th Lord of the Admiralty (CP. (46) 91) reporting the results of conclusions, confidential conversations which he had had on this point withMmute 7.) representatives of both sides of the shipbuilding industry.The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that both the shipbuildersand the shipbuilding unions were strongly opposed to the inclusion in the Committee of a representative of the officers&apos; and seamen&apos;sunions. They had suggested that any point which these unions hadto raise could be conveyed to the Committee through the NationalMaritime Board. He had considered the Cabinets suggestion thatthe views of officers and seamen of the merchant navy might berepresented on the Committee by someone who was not a directrepresentative of their unions. He saw some difficulty, however,about accepting this compromise, since the organisations ofemployers and workers in the shipbuilding industry would be directly represented on the Committee.The Minister of War Transport supported the First Lord&apos;sstatement, and suggested that the views of officers and seamen of themerchant navy might be conveyed to the Committee through therepresentative of the Ministry of War Transport.In discussion it was agreed that the alternatives before theCabinet were to insist on the inclusion of shipowners and repre-sentatives of the officers&apos; and seamen&apos;s unions or to exclude bothshipowners and representatives of the unions. It was pointed outthat there was always a tendency for industries to oppose theinclusion in any advisory committee of representatives of theconsumer.     This attitude had been successfully resisted in the
appointment of working parties by the Board of Trade, and there seemed to be no good reason for yielding to the views of the ship-building industry on this occasion.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the ShipbuildingCommittee set up under Cabinet authority in October 1944 hadcontained no representatives of these unions and no protest had beenmade on this account. If, however, it was the view of his colleagues that representatives both of the shipowners and of the officers&apos; andseamen&apos;s unions should be included in the Committee, he wouldconvey this decision to the representatives of the shipbuilding industry. It would make the decision more palatable to them if hecould tell them that the suggestion would be made to the neutralchairman that, when matters of exclusive interest to the ship-building members of the Committee had to be considered, they mightbe handled through a sub-committee which would not include therepresentatives of either side of the shipping industry.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Shipbuilding Advisory Committee should contain representatives of shipowners and of the officers&apos;and seamen&apos;s unions of the merchant navy.8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (OP. (46) 76) about the employment of Roman Catholicsby the British Council in Spain.The memorandum explained that, under an agreement concluded in 1940, all teachers and British personnel employed in BritishInstitutes in Spain were to be Roman Catholics. No other foreign government had sought to impose a similar restriction, and it was undesirable that we should continue to submit to this requirement,which had been accepted in 1940 owing to the importance of counter-ing Axis propaganda in Spain at that time. If the SpanishGovernment were informed that we could not adhere to the agree-ment, there was a certain risk that the British Council, which had done good work in Spain, might have to close down its activitiesthere; but, in all the circumstances, it was recommended that our ambassador should be instructed to inform the Spanish Governmentthat we no longer felt able to operate under the conditions laid downin 1940 and must withdraw from the agreement. At the same time,he should express the hope that this would not involve any inter-ference with the work of the British Council in Spain.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Spanish Government should be informedthat His Majesty&apos;s Government must withdraw from theagreement made in 1940 whereby all teachers and british personnel employed in British Institutes in Spain were tobe Roman Catholics.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,ith March, 1946.Spain.Employmentof roman catholics bythe british council.(previous reference:CM.
