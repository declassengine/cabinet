World Food The Cabinet were informed that a telegram had been receivedSupplies.        from the British Food Mission in Washington pointing out that,Allocation       while the offer of His Majesty&apos;.s Government to introduce breadof Cereals.   .   rationing in the United Kingdom if it were also-introduced in the(Previous       United States had temporarily given His Majesty&apos;s government reference:      the initiative in the discussions on the Combined Food Board,CM. (46) 32nd  nothing would be gained by pressing the rationing proposal further,Conclusions.)   as it would not be practicable for the United States and canada to  introduce  bread  rationing.    If  we  were  to  maintain theinitiative, some further proposal should now be made.   There was some prospect that the United States Government would give firmguarantees of future imports into the United Kingdom to maintaincurrent consumption and to rebuild stocks if we could now offer some immediate diversion of cargoes to meet the urgent needs ofother areas.The Minister of Food said that since the last meeting of theCabinet he had been informed that there was likely to be an almost complete failure of Canadian supplies during July, August and september, with the result that there might be a short-fall in supplies to the United Kingdom in these months of 600,000 tons ormore. This new development made the United Kingdom position-even more precarious and he felt that any proposal to lend wheat from United Kingdom resources to U.N.R.R.A. should be strongly resisted unless the United States Government would formallyundertake (i) to repay to the United Kingdom, for shipment not later than the 15th June, the total amount lent; (ii) to ensure thatany increase in United Kingdom stocks above the 775,000 tonsminimum resulting from the repayment of this loan did not resultin any reduction in the United Kingdom allocation; and (iii) tomake available for shipment to the United Kingdom during the months of June and July such quantity of wheat not exceeding600,000 tons as the United Kingdom found it necessary to callforward out of their allocation.Moreover, it seemed to him essential that, concurrently withthe offer of the loan, which in no circumstances should exceed50,000 tons a month for the two months April and May. the extraction rate in the United Kingdom should be raised to 90 percent, and 8 per cent, of barley should be incorporated in the grist.These measures would secure a saving of approximately 50,000 tonsof wheat a month.In discussion there was general agreement that it was desirablethat His Majesty&apos;s Government should maintain the initiative and that for this purpose some offer to divert grain shipmentsshould be made. The Cabinet were not, however, prepared to approve at this stage the proposals for increasing the extraction rate to 90 per cent, and adding 8 per cent, of barley to the grist.On current estimates the amount of wheat and flour under thecontrol of the Ministry of Food in the United Kingdom at the30th June would be equivalent to 1,185,000 tons of wheat or -8 weeks&apos; supply, and to this should be added the stocks of flourin retail shops and the supplies of wheat on farms, which would bring the figure of 9 - 8 weeks&apos; supply up to about 12 weeks&apos; supply.In these circumstances, it seemed reasonable to take the risk ofdiverting 100,000 tons of wheat from the United Kingdom during april and May, provided that the guarantees suggested by theMinister of Food could be obtained over the hand of the President.Points in discussion were : (a) What steps could the United States Government take,short of bread rationing, to increase supplies of wheat availablefor export from the United States? Would it not be possible toobtain larger supplies if a higher price were offered to the farmer?Should we not&apos; suggest this to the United States Government,pointing out at the same time, with appropriate publicity, that theproblem could be largely solved if they took resolute action toreduce the amount of cereals fed to animals ?
The Minister of Food said that he did not think that any increase over the present price of $1-83 per bushel was likely toproduce substantially greater supplies of wheat. Nor would theUnited States Government be prepared to face the drastic reduc-tions in livestock, with the consequential shortage of meat nextyear, which would be involved in any large cuts in the amounts ofcereals used for animal feeding.(b) The suggestion was made that it might be desirable to invite the United States Government to join with His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in proposing to the Governments of Canada, Australiaand the Argentine that an executive body should be establishedconsisting of the Food and Agriculture Ministers of the fiveGovernments concerned, together with a representative of u.N.R.R.A., and that the Governments and U.N.R.R.A. shouldpledge themselves to support any emergency measures which this body might recommend.(c) It was suggested that the Minister of Food should seekconfirmation from the Canadian Government of the statementrecently made to him by the Chairman of the Canadian WheatBoard that shipments of wheat from Canada in July, August and september would not exceed 50,000 tons a month. It was difficultto believe that the short-fall would be of this magnitude.(d) When the Combined Food Board were discussing the alloca-tion of the additional 100,000 tons which would become available inApril and May through the diversion of shipments from the UnitedKingdom, our representative should make it clear that some share in the increased supplies thus made available ought to go to theBritish zone in Germany and to countries within the area of theLondon Food Council, such as India.After further discussion, the, Cabinet (1) Agreed that the United Kingdom representative on the combined Food Board should be authorised to statethat His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared toagree to the diversion from United Kingdom stocks orshipments afloat of up to 100,000 tons of wheat duringthe months of April and May on condition that theUnited States Government would give a formal under-taking, over the hand of the President, (i) that an equivalent amount would be shipped to the UnitedKingdom in repayment not later than the 30th June,(ii) that the repayment of this loan should not beregarded as a reason for reducing the United Kingdomallocation, and (iii) that the United States Governmentwould make available to the United Kingdom Govern-rhent during the months of June and July such quantityof wheat as was necessary to meet any short-fall inCanadian wheat exports which made it impossible forthe Canadian Government to meet their present pro-gramme of wheat shipments to the United Kingdom.(2) Agreed that, for the present, there should, be no increasein the extraction rate in the United Kingdom and no.incorporation of barley in the grist.(3) Agreed that the 100,000 tons of wheat made available bydiversions from United Kingdom stocks or shipmentsafloat should go into the general pool and should notbe regarded as available solely for increased shipments to U!N.R.R.A. countries, and that in negotiation theUnited Kingdom representative should seek to ensuiethat some part of the United Kingdom contributionwent to the British zone in Germany and to otherLondon Food Council areas such as India.Of/ice, S.W. 1,12th April, 1946.
