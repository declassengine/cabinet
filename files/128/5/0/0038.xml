1. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary(CP. (46) 175) covering the report of the Anglo-American Com-mittee of Enquiry into Palestine and the Condition of Jews inEurope; and the report (CP. (46) 173) of a Committee of officialsappointed by the Prime Minister to examine the recommendations made by the Anglo-American Committee.The Foreign Secretary said that the report of the Anglo-American Committee was due to be published on the followingevening. Since it had been discussed by the Defence Committee onthe 24th April, he had studied it further; and he believed that, ifthe situation were skilfully handled in consultation with the UnitedStates Government, it might be possible to bring about a reasonable on the basis of the Committee&apos;s recommendations. Hewas not in favour of an immediate reference to the Security Council.He thought that this would be regarded as a confession of failureand would have unfortunate effects on other aspects of our foreignpolicy. The essence of our policy should be to retain the interestand participation of the United States Government in this problem.The enquiry had been made by an Anglo-American Committee andthe report should be considered by the two Governments jointly. it contained many recommendations which we could not carry out without the help of the United States Government; and it was essential that we should ascertain at once to what extent we couldrely on their assistance.It followed that His Majesty&apos;s Government should not definetheir attitude towards the report as soon as it was published. Forthe moment it would suffice to say that the report was beingconsidered by the two Governments in consultation. We could thenwatch the reactions to the report. He himself believed that these would not be so violent as had been predicted by His Majesty&apos;representatives abroad. In any event we should not be undulyalarmed by some initial clamour from the Arab States.The first step must be to work out in detail the line to be takenin our approach to the United States Government.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he agreed with the views expressed by the Foreign Secretary. The United.&apos;States Government had joined in the appointment of the Committeeand they should be associated with the decision on its recommenda-tions. His Majesty&apos;s Government could not carry out the Com-mittee&apos;s recommendations without assistance. If the United StatesGovernment were unwilling to help, there might then be a case forreferring to the United Nations. There was a possibility that oneof the Arab States might refer the question to the Security Council,but this need not affect our immediate action.It was probable that there would be some outbreak of disorder in Palestine when the report was published; and on this accountit wras important that the discussions with the United StatesGovernment should be pressed forward so that decisions could betaken on the report without undue delay.Discussion showed that there was general agreement on thefollowing points : -(a) The report was likely to create a most difficult situation for us. It would accentuate all the existing difficulties and createmuch trouble with both Jews and Arabs.(&amp;) The Committee appeared to have made no serious attemptto grapple with the problem of the Jews in Europe. Their only practical recommendation, under this part of their terms of refer-ence, was that a large number of these Jews should, go to Palestine;and the whole responsibility for the serious consequences of such,an influx was to be left on our shoulders.(c) It would be very difficult for His Majesty&apos;s Government tocarry out alone the Committee&apos;s recommendations. Every effort should, therefore, be made to persuade the United States Govern-ment to shoulder some part of the responsibility. We should requiremilitary and financial assistance as well as political support.[31888-5]   &apos; b 2
On the military side, the Chief of the Imperial General staff said that, while he thought that the British troops available for usein Palestine should be sufficient to handle any trouble caused by the mere publication of the report, substantial reinforcements wouldbe required if it were to be announced that the policy recommended in the report was to be adopted. If further troops had to be sentto Palestine, the planned rate of demobilisation could not be main-tained.On the financial side, the Chancellor of the Exchequer saidthat the proposals for the settlement of 100,000 Jewish immigrantsand the improvement of Arab conditions in Palestine would requirecapital expenditure of about  100 millions and recurrent expendi-ture of from  5 to  10 millions. In view of the magnitude of our overseas expenditure we could not lightly accept further obliga- Itions of this order.(d) If the policy recommended in the report was to be adopted,one of the first steps to be taken should be the disarmament of the illegal organisations in Palestine. Action to this end had been delayed while the enquiry by the Anglo-American Committee was proceeding, but incidents such as that which had recently occurred at Tel-Aviv were trying the patience of British troops, who mightbe provoked into taking the law into their own hands. Althoughit was the Jewish organisations which were causing most of the trouble at present, any search for arms should extend to Arabs aswell as Jews.(e) We should not allow the United States Government to losesight of the Committee&apos;s first recommendation which, afteremphasising that the whole world shared&quot; responsibility for theJewish victims of Nazi persecution and for the resettlement of alldisplaced persons, recommended that the United Kingdom and united States Governments should together and in association withother countries, endeavour immediately to find new homes for the mall. In commenting on this recommendation the Committee had expressed their conviction that special provision could and shouldbe made in existing immigration laws to meet the present situation.The United States Government should, therefore, be pressed to take their share in the resettlement of displaced persons.(/) The problem of the resettlement of European Jews shouldbe dealt with as part of the general refugee problem. Our repre-sentative on the United Nations Special Committee for refugees and Displaced Persons had been urging that the disposal of displaced persons should remain the responsibility of the united nations and should not be handed over to a specialised agency.It was preferable that particular aspects of the report should betaken up in this way with the appropriate Committees of the united nations Organisation, rather than that the report as a whole should come before the Security Council. Thus, it would be preferable that the future of the mandate should be referred in due course tothe Trusteeship Council.While there was general agreement that the first step must beto consult with the United States Government and press them to share with us the responsibility for dealing with the situation created by the report of the Anglo-American Committee, some ministers felt that we should at the same time be considering how this situation could best be handled vis-a-vis the United Nations.If we continued to keep the matter solely between ourselves and theUnited States Government, the suspicions of the Soviet government might be aroused. And it was doubtful whether we should be well advised to leave to others the initiative of bringing the matter beforethe Security Council. We ought to prepare in advance for thesituation which would arise if the United States rejected our request for their active participation in handling this problem. It was common ground that we could not put into operation, unaided, thepolicy recommended in the report. It might, therefore, be worth considering whether we should not invite the United States Govern-ment to join with us in notifying the Security Council that the two
Governments were together considering the recommendations madein the Report of the Anglo-American Committee and that, if they found themselves unable to adopt common measures for handling the situation, they would bring the matter before the security council and invite their advice. The Security Council would inany event become aware of the negotiations which were proceeding;.and it seemed desirable that some such step should be taken to ensurethat His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States Governmentretained the initiative.The Foreign Secretary said that such a notification could bemade only to the Security Council and he would prefer that, if thismatter came before the United Nations at all, it should not cometo the Security Council. He would himself prefer that at this stage the discussions should be kept between the two Governments whicfthad appointed the Committee; and the Meeting of Foreign ministers in Paris would give him an opportunity of discussing the problem in detail with the United States Secretary of State. His object inthese discussions would be to make it clear that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment could not handle this situation alone and that theUnited States Government could not continue to offer advice without being ready to take some share of the responsibility. For thispurpose he would like to be provided with detailed information onthe financial and administrative implications of adopting the policy recommended in the Report. Thus, he would be glad if the Chiefsof Staff could arrange for a more detailed analysis to be made ofthe military forces &quot;which would be required if this policy were adopted. He would like to have from the Treasury a firm estimateof the financial implications of adopting the Report; and theColonial Office might make a study of the implications of the Reportfrom the point of view of securing a satisfactory trusteeship agree-ment for Palestine. He would himself arrange for the ForeignOffice to study the problem of disposing of the refugees in Europe,including the extent to which Jewish refugees should have priority over other displaced persons. He would also propose, in his conver-sations with the United States Secretary of State, to ask whatcontribution the United States Government could make towards thedisposal of the Poles for whom His Majesty&apos;s Government were atpresent responsible.The Foreign Secretary said that, in the light of thesepreliminary conversations, he would like to propose that a bodyof experts should be jointly appointed by the Foreign Office andthe State Department to consider these problems in detail. Hewould also like to suggest that the military implications of adopting the Report should be considered by the Combined Chiefs of Staff.The Chief of the Imperial General staff said that, if the consent ofthe United States Government were first obtained, the Chiefs ofStaff would have no objection to such a joint study through the combined Chiefs of Staff.The Foreign Secretary said that, if his proposals were approved,no official statement would be made, on the publication of the report,about the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards its recommendations. The official announcement would be confined toa statement that His Majesty&apos;s Government were in consultationwith the United States Government. It was, however, important that some unofficial guidance should be given to the Press. Inparticular, it should be made clear that the United States couldnot expect to offer advice on this problem without assuming someshare of the responsibility : it should be suggested that the proposalsfor Jewish immigration into Palestine should be viewed as part ofthe wider problem of the resettlement of European Jews and otherdisplaced persons : and attention should be drawn to those passages in the report which described the illegal Jewish organisations inPalestine. It would be convenient if, for this purpose, the Secretaryof State for the Colonies could arrange to have a confidential talk with Lobby Correspondents during the course of the following day..5-5] B 3
Other points raised in the course of the discussion were(g) It was agreed that copies of the Eeport of the Anglo-American Committee should be communicated at once to theDominion Ministers now in London; and that the Prime minister should explain, at the meeting of Dominion Ministers on thefollowing day, the line which His Majesty&apos;s Government were proposing to follow on the publication of the Report.(h) It was also agreed that the Prime Minister should arrangefor the Leaders of the Opposition to receive advance copies of theReport; and that he should explain to them in confidence, beforethe Report was published, the line which His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere proposing to take.(i) Reference was made to a recent attack by Jewish terroristson British troops at Tel-Aviv, in which six British soldiers had lost their lives. It was agreed that it would be convenient if theSecretary of State for the Colonies could make a statement about this incident in the House of Commons on the following day, and take that opportunity of expressing appreciation of the way inwhich British troops were conducting themselves under very difficultcircumstances in Palestine.The Cabinet :-(1) Agreed that, on the publication of the Report of the Anglo-American Committee on Palestine, no immediate state-ment should be made defining the attitude of HisMajesty&apos;s Government towards the recommendations made in the Report; but that, in the first instance, theForeign Secretary should endeavour to ascertain howfar the United States Government would be preparedto give, not only political support, but also active militaryand financial assistance, in giving effect to the policy recommended in the Report.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to arrangefor his Department, in association with the ForeignOffice, Treasury and Chiefs of Staff, to provide theForeign Secretary with the detailed information whichhe required, for the purposes of his forthcoming conver-sations in Paris with the United States Secretary ofState, regarding the political, military and financial implications of giving effect to the policy recommended in the Report.(3) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would report to theCabinet in due course the results of his conversations with the United States Secretary of State regardingthe attitude of the United States Government towardsthe Report of the Anglo-American Committee.Parliament.Expenses ofMembers.previous reference:CM. (46) 29thConclusions,Minute 7.)2. At their meeting on the 1st April, the Cabinet had invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Home Secretary and the chief whip to consider in what form the substance of the recommenda-tions made by the Select Committee on Members&apos; Expenses could best be presented to Parliament and the public. The Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(CP. (46) 171) reporting the conclusions which he and his colleagues had reached.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, since the cabinet had last considered the matter, opinion in the House of commons had moved against acceptance of the Select Committee&apos;s recom-mendations that all Members should be allowed  500 of theirincreased salary of  1,000 as an expense allowance free of incometax. He and his colleagues accordingly felt that the best course was for the Government simply to propose that the salary of aMember of the House of Commons should be raised from  600 to 1,000 a year, no change being made in the procedure for claiming,
within that salary, relief from income tax in respect of Parlia-mentary expenses. It followed that Ministers whose salaries were less than  5,000 a year, the Chairman of Ways and Means, the deputy Chairman, the Leader of the Opposition and any memberreceiving a pension as an ex-Prime Minister should be given, inaddition to their present salary, one-half of the salary paid to private Members of Parliament and allowed to claim relief from income tax in respect of their expenses as Members of Parliamentup to that amount. He and his colleagues had also reviewed the salaries of Ministers receiving less than  5,000 a year, and they recommended that the salaries of the Minister of Pensions and theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster should be raised from  2,000to  3,000 a year, while the salaries of the Assistant Postmaster-General and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry ofPensions should be raised from  1,200 to  1,500 a year. It wouldbe necessary to decide whether the proposed addition to the salary of the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster should be paid out ofthe revenues of the Duchy or from monies provided by Parliament.They also recommended that the proposed arrangements for theissue of season tickets to Members living in or near London shouldbe confined to the period during which Parliament was in Session.All the proposed changes in salary should take effect as from the1st April, 1946.In discussion, there was general support for the proposal that members of the House of Commons should receive an increase in salary from  600 to  1,000 a year without any change in theexisting procedure for claiming relief from income tax in respect of expenses. Some Ministers felt, however, that it would be better togive Ministers receiving salaries of less than  5,000 a year a straightforward increase of  500 and to allow them to claim relief from income tax in respect of Parliamentary expenses instead of adopting the suggestion made in paragraph 4 of CP. (46) 171.In support of this it was pointed out that the proposals in cp. (46) 171 would give a Parliamentary Secretary in the Houseof Commons a marked advantage over a Parliamentary secretary in the House of Lords. It was also suggested that the right to claim relief from income tax in respect of expenses as a Memberof the House of Commons should be given to Ministers in receipt of salaries of  5,000 a year. On the other hand, it was urged that anyproposal under which a Minister would be entitled to claim relief from income tax on his salary as a Minister in respect of hisexpenses as a Member would involve a much greater change in thelaw and might give rise to considerable opposition in Parliament.Moreover, although the proposals in paragraph 4 of CP. (46) 171were less simple than the alternative suggested in discussion, theywere nearer to the original proposals of the Select Committee andon this account were to be preferred on tactical grounds.Other points in discussion were : (a) In view of the proposal.to increase the salaries payable tothe Assistant Postmaster-General and the Parliamentary Secretaryto the Ministry of Pensions, it was suggested that some increase of salary should be granted to the Captain of the Gentlemen at Arms,the Captain of the Yeoman of the Guard, and the Lords in Waitingwho performed Parliamentary duties in the House of Lords.(6) There was general support for the view that the salary ofthe Postmaster-General should be raised to  5,000 a year.(c) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he proposed thatthe salary payable to the Solicitor-General for Scotland should beraised from  2,000 to  3,000 a year. If the Solicitor-General forScotland was a Member of the House of Common he would receive an additional  500 in accordance with the proposal in paragraph 4of CP. (46) 171.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the salary of the Postmaster-General shouldbe raised to  5,000 a year.
(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to discuss withthe Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs the sugges-tion that increases should be made in the salaries payable to those members of His Majesty&apos;s Household whoperformed Parliamentary duties in the House of Lords.(3) Subject to (1) and (2), approved the proposals in cp. (46) 171 and agreed that the announcement of theGovernments decisions should be made by theChancellor of the Exchequer.ImportProgrammesfor Mid-1946to Mid-1947.(previous reference:CM. (46) 14thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (46) 168) covering a notesubmitted by the Treasury, with the approval of the Balance ofPayments Working Party, on the import programmes for the second half of 1946 and the first half of 1947.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that these proposals were based on the assumption that the United States loan would begranted. If the loan were rejected by Congress, heavy cuts in the programmes would be necessary. When the Cabinet had reviewed the import programme for 1946 on the 11th February, it had been estimated that there would be a deficit of  770 millions in thebalance of payments for the year. It now appeared, however, that exports in 1946 would be much higher than had previously been estimated, while, owing to supply difficulties, imports in the first half of 1946 would fall short of previous estimates. Taking these and other factors into account he estimated that the deficit for 1946would be only  687 millions. The provisional programme suggested for the first half of 1947 was designed to balance our target incomeon current account in the first half of 1947, and he hoped that theCabinet would endorse the acceptance of this as an aid to which departments should work. The proposed import programmes didnot completely satisfy the demands made by Departments, but therewas general agreement at the official level with the proposals putforward.In discussion the following points were raised :  .(a) It was suggested that where, owing to supply difficulties,a Department had been unable to obtain the imports for which ithad budgeted, some allowance should be made to enable it topurchase other supplies which might be available. Thus, anysavings effected by the Ministry of Food owing to shortage of cerealsupplies might be expended on obtaining more dried eggs or canned fruit.(b) The possibility of obtaining additional food supplies from italy and other Mediterranean countries should be explored.(c) An effort should be made to increase exports from theBritish Zone in Germany in order to reduce the deficit on theoperation of the British Zone. In particular, the possibility ofincreasing exports of wine should be investigated.(d) The Minister of Food said that he was arranging to importwines from South Africa and Australia.(e) The Minister of Health drew attention to the shortage of timber, increased supplies of which were urgently required for thehousing programme. He urged that there should be no restriction on imports of timber or of timber houses from Sweden.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would consider any proposals for increasing imports of timber, though there werecurrency difficulties in connection with imports from Sweden.(/) Attention was drawn to the importance of placing as feffrestrictions as possible on imports of machinery, particularly foimining and agriculture.
(g) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs drew attention to Table IV in Appendix D of the note, which seemed tosuggest that there would be a large reduction in imports ofRhodesian tobacco in the first half of 1947. Tobacco productionin Southern Rhodesia had been greatly expanded with our fullapproval, and it would be most unfortunate if our imports from rhodesia were suddenly reduced.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that no change of policy was contemplated as regards the import of tobacco from Rhodesia.(h) The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he hoped thatit would be possible to review before September the continuance of petrol rationing. He suggested that this should be reconsideredas soon as a decision had been reached on the United States loan.(i) The Lord President suggested that the proposed import programmes should in future be considered by the ministerial committee on Economic Planning before they were submitted tothe Cabinet.   This was agreed.The Cabinet (1) Subject to consideration of the points made at (a) to (/)approved the import programmes for the second half of1946 and the first half of 1947, and agreed that the aim should be to achieve a balance between the expenditureon imports and the target income on current account inthe first half of 1947.(2) Agreed to make a further review of these programmes, andin particular to consider the question of the abolitionof petrol rationing, as soon as a decision had beenreached about the United States loan.Leakage of 4.   The   Prime   Minister   drew   attention   to   prematureInformation.     disclosures in the Press of proposals contained in the atomic energy Bill.He had recently arranged for the Lord Chancellor to examineall apparent leakages of information on matters under discussion by the Cabinet or its Committees; and he would be glad if thislatest disclosure could be examined in accordance with the new procedure, which was described in his memorandum CP. (46) 163.The Minister of Supply said that he had already given instructions for enquiries to be made within his Department; andhe undertook to report the results to the Lord Chancellor.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,29th April, 1946.
