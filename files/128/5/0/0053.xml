Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.White paper on the Call-upto the Forces.(previous reference:CM. (46) 52ndConclusions,Minute 3.)1. The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the business which it was proposed to take in the House of Commons in thefollowing week.The Second Reading of the Hill Farming Bill would be taken on the 3rd June. The Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary ofState for Scotland would move the Second Reading and the Ministerof Agriculture would reply to the debate. The remaining stages ofthe Ministerial Salaries Bill would also be taken on the 3rd June.On the 4th and 5th June there would be a debate on ForeignAxffairs. After discussion it was agreed that the Foreign secretary should both open and reply to this debate. The parliamentary under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs would also speak;and the Prime Minister might intervene, probably on the secondday, if the course of the debate turned towards the defence aspectsof foreign policy or other matters of general importance.On the 6th June the House would discuss Scottish business in committee of Supply.On the 7th June the House would be adjourned until Tuesday,the 18th June.At their meeting on the 27th May the Cabinet had contem-plated that the statement by the Minister of Labour announcing the presentation of the White Paper on the call-up to the Forces in1947 and 1948 should be so framed as to make it possible for thismatter to be discussed in the course of the forthcoming debate onForeign Affairs.The Lord President said that it had since been represented tohim by the Chief Whip that it would not meet the convenience ofthe House to discuss this White Paper on that occasion, and thatit would be preferable to afford facilities for a separate debate at alater date. It was agreed that, if the demand was pressed for facilities to discuss the White Paper, the suggestion should be made that this debate might be held in Committee of Supply on the first day after the Whitsun Recess.World Food 2.   The Lord President said that the misunderstanding with supplies. the authorities in Washington regarding the results of his recentMission of mission had now been satisfactorily cleared up.   His statement inthe Lord the House of Commons on the previous day had been made with thePresident to concurrence of the United States authorities.    He was much the United indebted to the staff of the British Embassy in Washington for theStates and valuable assistance which they had given in clearing up thisCanada. misunderstanding.(previous reference:CM. (46) 52ndConclusions,Minute 5.)Debate in The Lord President informed the Cabinet that the Oppositionthe House of   leaders now wished to have a debate on food questions on the commons.       following day.   He understood that they proposed to discuss, notonly the results of his mission to Washington, but also the general administration of the Ministry of Food.   He thought it desirable,therefore, that the Minister of Food should take part in the debate.After discussion, it was agreed that if the debate was openedby Mr. Churchill the Lord President should speak first on behalfof the Government. The Minister of Food would then speak at theend of the debate.[32142-3]
bread rationing.(previous reference:CM. (46) 52ndConclusions,Minute 5.)Rations of feeding-stuffs.(previous reference:CM. (46) 52ndConclusions,Minute 5.)The question was raised whether in the course of this debate the Government should announce their intention to introduce bread rationing. It was argued that the Government&apos;s intention was likely to become known before long and that, in view of the compli-cated administrative arrangements to be made, an announcement would have in any event to be made a considerable time beforerationing came into force. The rationing of bread was likely tobe a considerable shock to the public. There might, therefore, be advantage in announcing at once that the Government were likelyto find it necessary to ration bread and were completing the prepara-tion of a rationing scheme. The final decision to ration, and thedetails of the scheme, would then be announced at a later stage.After discussion, it was agreed that it would be expedient forthe Minister of Food to make such a preliminary announcement inthe debate on the following day. He would emphasise that thescheme was being prepared mainly as an insurance against a riskof shortage in the future, and he would include words to discouragethe hoarding of flour. When the time came to announce the detailsof the scheme it would be advisable for the Minister of Food to makea broadcast.The Cabinet then resumed their discussion of the joint memo-randum by the Minister of Agriculture and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland (CP. (46) 201) on rations of animal feeding-stuffs.The Minister of Agriculture said that since the Cabinefs last meeting he had made a further review of the position and, on thebest estimate that could now be made, the prospects for the autumnappeared even more unfavourable than had previously beensupposed. The Cabinet had previously thought that it might bepossible to proceed on the second of the three alternative assump-tions stated in CP. (46) 201. He would not now feel justified in recommending them to proceed on anything but the third or leastoptimistic of these assumptions. If, in fact, it proved that this assumption was unduly pessimistic it would be easy to increasecoupon values at short notice. The decision which he was asking the Cabinet to take would be unpopular; in particular, it wouldbe criticised by the large number of domestic poultry-keepers and members of pig clubs, who would be adversely affected by it. Hewas satisfied, however, that this was the right course to take.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that he was in entire agreement with the Minister of Agriculture. He feared, however,that, owing to the recent drought, the loss of milk production inScotland might be rather more than the 5 per cent, indicated inparagraph 12 of CP. (46) 201.The Minister of Food also supported the proposals in the [memorandum.In discussion reference was made to the importance of main-taining the efficiency of the system for collecting pig swill which Ihad been created during the war.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Agriculture and the Secretaryof State for Scotland to proceed on the basis of the mostpessimistic of the three assumptions in CP. (46) 201as to the quantity of feeding-stuffs that would beavailable for animals during the winter, and to announce the appropriate winter scales of rations, intimatingthat if supplies improved supplementary rations wouldbe issued.(2) Invited the Minister of Agriculture to arrange, in consulta-tion with the Board of Trade, for a review to be made ofthe existing arrangements for the collection of pig swill

The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for War (CP. (46) 211) suggesting that some relaxation might now be made of the existing rules restricting marriages between british Servicemen and foreign women.The Secretary of State for War said that it was proposed inhis memorandum, with the concurrence of the Foreign Secretary,that the existing restrictions should now be relaxed to the extent of allowing marriages between Servicemen and foreign women (otherthan Germans and Japanese) if the local military commanderconsidered that there were good reasons for, and no security objec-tions against, the marriage; that marriages with German women should be authorised only in very special cases; and that the absolute ban on marriages with Japanese women should be main-tained. It was his personal view that the time had now come whenthe restrictions on marriages with Germans could be furtherrelaxed; but he wished to obtain further advice on the legal positionand to consult the Commander-in-Chief on the security aspects ofthe matter before submitting definite proposals on this point to theCabinet.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Air said thatthe Air Ministry supported the recommendations made in cp. (46) 211. They would have preferred that the discretion toauthorise in exceptional cases marriages between British airmenand German women should be vested in the Air Ministry; but theywere prepared, for the sake of uniformity, to agree that thisdiscretion should be exercised by the Commander-in-Chief.In discussion it was pointed out that the relaxations proposedby the Secretary of State for War would give rise to difficultiesin various directions. The principal points made in the discussion were : 1(a) These relaxations would enable women of ex-enemynationality to become British subjects. This would be contrasted with the Government&apos;s reluctance to confer British nationality on allied nationals who had fought against the enemy during the war,often under British command. It would also be contrasted withthe Governments refusal to accept the argument that a foreigner&apos;smarriage with a British woman gave him a right to prolong hisresidence in the United Kingdom.(b) A German woman marrying a British soldier would acquireBritish nationality; but a British woman marrying a foreigner whohad fought in one of the Allied Forces would in most cases lose herBritish nationality. This was a situation which would give riseto adverse comment. If marriages between British Servicemen andGerman women had to be allowed, could it be provided that the woman should not thereby acquire British nationality?It was pointed out that this could not be done without legis-lation; and legislation on this subject would raise many of the complex issues of British nationality which were about to be examined by a conference of experts from all the self-governingparts of the British Commonwealth. It would be most undesirable that the United Kingdom Government should introduce legislation on a limited part of this complex subject in advance of the findings of that conference.(c) As regards the legal validity of the existing restrictions,The Lord Chancellor said that he had little doubt that theCommander-in-Chief had the right, as a matter of discipline, to prohibit men under his command from contracting marriages with german women. The view was, however, expressed that, if, in defiance of these restrictions, a British soldier contracted a marriagewith a German woman, the marriage could not be regarded asinvalidated by the fact that the consent of the Commander-in-Chiefhad not been obtained.
The Prime Minister said that it was clear from the discussion that the proposals put forward in CP. (46) 211 required furtherconsideration by the various Departments concerned before a finaldecision could be taken by the Cabinet. This was not a questionwhich could, be decided wholly or mainly on security grounds; andthe legal and political difficulties which had been mentioned in thediscussion applied to marriages with Austrians, Hungarians,Bulgarians, &amp;o, as much as to marriages with Germans. Theproblem should therefore be reconsidered as a whole.The Cabinet-Invited the Home Secretary to discuss the issues raised in CP. (46) 211 with Ministerial representatives of theService Departments, the Foreign Office, the dominions office and the Control Office for Germany and Austria,and to submit revised proposals for consideration by theCabinet.Italy. 4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ForeignDisposal of Secretary (CP. (46) 204) regarding the disposal of a number of refugees.        Yugoslav and other refugees in Italy.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that, in view of the reduction in the strength of theBritish forces in Italy, the War Office would be unable to maintainthese refugees under British military control after the 1st June.The Foreign Office were, however, reluctant to transfer the responsi-bility for their maintenance to the Italian Government. TheItalians would be unable to keep them under control and they would tend to scatter and form into bands which would add to the diffi-culties of maintaining public order in Italy. It was also likely that they would so conduct themselves as to complicate Italo-Yugoslav relations and they might even provide the yugoslav government with an excuse for intervening in Italy, with thesupport of the Soviet Union. In the circumstances described inthe memorandum the Foreign Office had been forced to the con-clusion that the only alternatives which they could recommend tothe Cabinet were : (i) that these refugees should be transferred tothe British Zone of Germany, or (ii) that the strength of the british forces in Italy should be increased to the extent necessary to enablethe War Office to continue to be responsible for maintaining themin Italy.In discussion objection was raised on various grounds to theproposal that these refugees should be transferred to the british zone of Germany. Thus, the Cabinet had thought it inexpedientthat the Polish troops under British command in Italy should betransferred to Germany, as it was thought that the presence of these troops in Germany would prejudice Anglo-Soviet relations; thesame risk attached to transferring to Germany these Yugoslavrefugees, many of whom had been supporters of GeneralMihailovitch or members of the Royalist Yugoslav Army. Secondly,we had undertaken to receive in the British Zone 1-J millionGermans from Poland, in pursuance of a joint agreement betweenthe occupying Powers; and we had still to find accommodation inour Zone for about 1 million of these. There were also in the UnitedStates Zone some 180,000 Germans belonging to our Zone; and, inview of accommodation difficulties, we were seeking to persuade theUnited States authorities to retain about half of these in their Zone.Our prospects of securing their agreement to this would be gravelyprejudiced if we transferred to our Zone a large number of refugees from Italy. Thirdly, there were security considerations to be taken into account. The control, of displaced persons was oneof the biggest problems which we now had to face in the british zone; and the difficulties of this problem would be aggravated bythe transfer of these refugees from Italy. Finally, the transfer ofthese people to Germany would increase the risk of their having
eventually to be accommodated in the United Kingdom; and therewas little practical possibility of absorbing any of these people intothe foreign population of this country, in addition to the Poles andothers for whom we had already to provide.In further discussion it was pointed out that the responsi-bility of the United States Government towards these refugees in italy was no less than our own, and the suggestion was made thatthe United States Government should be asked to assist in their disposal. It was, however, the view of the Cabinet that no suchapproach should be made to the United States; for, even if it were successful, we should ourselves be left with the responsibility for maintaining some part of these refugees.The general feeling of the Cabinet was that we could notassume any further responsibilities for the care and maintenance of foreigners who, for political or other reasons, were unable to returnto their own country; and that, as these Yugoslav and other refugeesin Italy could no longer be maintained by British military authori-ties there, the right course was to leave the Italian Government tomake the best arrangements they could for their disposal.The Cabinet-Invited the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to inform the Foreign Secretary of theviews  which   had   been   expressed   in   the   cabinets discussion.ge of*mation.viousrence:(46)50thlusions,105. At their meeting on the 20th May the Cabinet had invited the Lord Chancellor to enquire into the source of a leakage ofinformation about the decision to bring to this country the polish troops now under British command in Italy.The Lord Chancellor said that, from enquiries which he had made, he was satisfied that the news reports to which the Cabinetsattention had been drawn were based on a statement broadcast fromRome on the 18th May. On this occasion, therefore, it seemed clearthat the news reports were not based on information obtained in thiscountry about the proceedings at Ministerial meetings. If it were thought desirable to ascertain how this information became available in Rome, the Foreign Office could no doubt instituteenquiries there.The Prime Minister said that there had been another recentoccasion on which information which was under confidential dis-cussion in this country had been published by a foreign broadcastingservice. He proposed, therefore, to ask the Foreign Office to make enquiries into both these cases.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,30th May, 1946.
