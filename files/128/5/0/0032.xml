World Pood THE Cabinet were informed that, since they had last discussedSupplies.        the position on the 25th March, it had become increasingly doubtfulAllocations      whether the exporting countries would, in fact, honour the alloca-of Cereals.       tions of cereals which had been provisionally agreed during the(Previous       visit of the Minister of Food to Washington in March.  The amountReference:      of grain which was actually coming forward for export from theC.M.(46)27th   United States was falling far short of the level expected whenConclusions,     the allocations were discussed; and Mr. La Guardia was applyingMinute 4.)      strong pressure in Washington for an increase in the provisionalallocations for U.N.R.R.A. countries.  As a result, a special meetingof the Combined Food Board was being held that day to review the provisional allocations; and it was likely that our representativewould be pressed to accept some substantial reduction in the alloca-tions provisionally proposed for the United Kingdom and othercountries within the area of the London Food Council.The Foreign Secretary read to the Cabinet three telegrams onthis subject which had been received the previous evening fromHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington (Nos. 2271-2273). the ambassador, after consultation with the Food Mission in washington, thought it desirable that our representative shouldbe enabled to make some constructive proposals at the meeting ofthe Combined Food Board. He therefore suggested that the cabinet should first determine what amount of wheat could be diverted beforethe 30th June, 1946, from supplies programmed for the UnitedKingdom, as a result of cuts in domestic consumption and reductionof stocks; and that from this we should offer an immediate contribu-tion of three or four ship-loads to meet the immediate needs of u.N.R.R.A. countries during April. This, however, could only bejustified if we were also prepared, by the diversion of supplies. programmed for the United Kingdom, to underwrite South Africa&apos;s requirements up to the 30th June and to give a token contribution of five or six ship-loads to India. If these diversions to meet themost immediate needs did not wholly exhaust the amount which theUnited Kingdom were able to spare, the balance might be offered for distribution among other claimants in an order of prioritysuggested in telegram No. 2273. If, however, our representativewere authorised to make such an offer at the meeting of the combined food Board, he should make it clear that any such contribution from the United Kingdom would be subject to acceptance of thefollowing conditions : (i) that exporting countries, particularly theUnited States and Canada, would themselves make additional contributions and would take the administrative measures requiredto make such contributions reliable and effective; (ii) that the UnitedStates would ship to India such amounts, in addition to any madeavailable from Commonwealth sources, as would avert widespreadstarvation; (iii) that there would be no reduction of the amountsinformally promised from Australia and Canada to countrieswithin the area of the London Food Council; and (iv) that canada and the United States would give absolute assurances to supplyduring July, August and September the amounts needed to maintainthe required level of consumption in the United Kingdom.The Foreign Secretary said that he agreed that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment ought, if possible, to put forward some constructive proposals to meet the critical situation which had developed.Would it not be possible for us to make some contribution by reducing our wheat stocks in the United Kingdom ? Under present plans these were not to fall below 775,000 tons. He understood fromthe Minister of Food that the average monthly consumption of wheat in this country was about 400,000 tons; and that, even in winter,the average monthly import was about 370,000 tons. Was it essential, in the desperate situation with which the world was nowfaced, that we should maintain a working stock of 11 weeks&apos; supply?Could we not run the risk of allowing our stocks to fall to a levelrepresenting 8 weeks&apos; supply, if we obtained firm guarantees onthe lines suggested by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador that the United
States and Canada would provide us with a regular flow of importssufficient to maintain our stocks at that reduced level ? We shouldhave to insist upon a firm commitment: but, if this were forth-coming, we should be able to put into the pool something not far short of 100,000 tons towards the immediate needs of countries whose stock position was far less favourable than our own.Although this was not mentioned in the telegrams which heread to the Cabinet, he had some reason to believe thatMr. La Guardia would also suggest at the meeting of the combined food Board that the United Kingdom might secure further economies in wheat consumption by introducing a system of bread rationing. On this point he proposed that our representative onthe Combined Food Board should say that we should be preparedto introduce bread rationing in this country if it were introduced in the United States and Canada.The Minister of Food said that he could not recommend theCabinet to modify their earlier decision that wheat stocks in theUnited Kingdom should not be allowed to fall below a level of775,000 tons at the 30th June, 1946. These stocks would have tobe built up to 900,000 tons by the end of September, as an insurance against the difficulties of transport during the winter months; andhe was satisfied that 775,000 tons was the minimum mid-summerlevel which could be accepted. Even in normal times, when therewas no difficulty in securing rapid replenishment, the trade hadnot thought it wise to operate on a lower stock level than 775,000tons. And, in his view, it would be highly dangerous to allowstocks to fall below that level at a time when neither supply nortransport was reliable. Recent experience did not encourage himto rely on assurances of any given rate of supply from the UnitedStates. Finally, the course suggested by His Majesty&apos;s ambassador and the Foreign Secretary assumed that we could continue to rely on obtaining from Canada the wheat imports needed to meet our immediate requirements. His representative in Washington had,however, telephoned at a late hour the previous evening, to saythat the Canadians had now informed him that they were unlikely to be able to export to the United Kingdom more than about one-halfof the wheat which we had expected to come from them over thenext few months. Canadian farmers were holding back supplies in the hope of a rise in price and, although the full quantitiespromised were likely to be delivered in due course, there seemedno hope of avoiding a substantial short-fall in the Canadiansupplies on which we had been counting for the coming months in these circumstances the Food Mission in Washington, though they had collaborated in preparing Washington telegrams Nos.2271-2273, which the Foreign Secretary had read to the Cabinet,now felt that it would be inexpedient to take the risk of offeringany contribution from United Kingdom supplies. The Minister there-fore recommended that our representative on the Combined food board should confine himself to making the offer that we would intro-duce bread rationing here if it were also introduced in the UnitedStates and Canada. He suggested that instructions to this effect should be despatched to Washington forthwith; but that the cabinet should defer taking any further decisions until they kneAV what course the discussions on the Combined Food Board had taken and what reception there had been for the offer that we would introduce bread rationing if it were introduced in the United Statesand Canada.The general sense of the Cabinet was that, as the probableshort-fall in world supplies would make it impossible to realise allthe allocations provisionally determined in March, it would bedifficult for the United Kingdom to adopt a completely nonpossumus attitude. At the same time, we should not be too readyto make concessions and must be firm in demanding that ourminimum needs should be met. There would, however, be a tacticaladvantage in ourselves taking the initiative in proposing bread rationing by the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada.1-3] b 2
In, further discussion the following points were made:-(a) Argentine. In view of the probable short-fall in supplies from Canada and the United States, we should exploit all practicable means of increasing exports from the Argentine.The Minister of Food reported that he hoped to have secured by the end of the week the staff for the proposed Food Mission tothe Argentine. It was agreed that no time should be lost in gettingthem to the Argentine. Meanwhile, approaches could be made through the diplomatic channel now that the Argentine electionshad resulted in the establishment of a Government with a clearmandate from the jjeople.It was suggested that there might be room for adjustment inthe margin between the price paid to the producer in the argentine and the price at which wheat was sold for export. The foreign secretary said that, if the Minister of Food would supply him withthe necessary facts, he would consider . whether he could make representations on this point to the Argentine Government.(p) Long-term contract with Canada. Farmers in all producing countries were tending to hold back their wheat in the hope of a risein price. It would have a steadying effect if an announcement couldbe made of long-term contracts for considerable quantities at theprices now ruling.The Minister of Food said that he had already given theCanadian Minister of Agriculture a firm assurance that we wouldbuy Canadian wheat for $1-55 up to the end of 1947. He thoughtit would be useful if the period covered by this assurance could nowbe extended to June 1948 so as to cover the whole of the cropharvested in the summer of 1947. A long-term contract must,however, specify the quantities to be purchased at this price; andthe Canadians had hitherto been inclined to ask us to contract fora larger amount than they were likely to be able to deliver to us inpractice. It would be unwise for us to contract to take, at this fixedprice, whatever wheat Canada might offer, for we ought to leaveourselves free to satisfy some part of our requirements from other sources if prices in other countries fell below f 1-55.It was the general view of the Cabinet that up to June 1948we should find little difficulty in disposing elsewhere, at the priceproposed, of any Canadian wheat which was not required in theUnited Kingdom; and that on this account we should not be nervousof entering into large forward contracts for this period. the quantities to be specified in the contract could be negotiated betweenthe Minister of Food and the Canadian Minister of Agriculture.As soon as an agreement had been reached, a public announcement should be made, with a view to discouraging farmers from holdingback their wheat in the hope of a rise in price.The Chancellor of the Exchequer concurred in the viewssummarised above, both on the period of the contract and on thequestion of quantity.(c) Responsibility of His Majesty&apos;s Government. It was emphasised in the discussion that the responsibility of HisMajesty&apos;s Government was not confined to assuring the supply ofwheat to the United Kingdom alone. The Cabinet must also haveregard to the effects of food shortage in other parts of the BritishCommonwealth, in Germany and in other foreign countries forwhich we had some responsibility. Famine in India might havemost far-reaching effects on the constitutional negotiations now inprogress there. Famine in Germany would involve us in increased expenditure and the retention of a larger number of British troops.Famine elsewhere in Europe could not fail to be reflected in thegeneral field of foreign policy. Thus, though the United kingdom could meet her own needs with Canadian wheat, she was vitallyconcerned in the decisions of the Combined Food Board affecting-other countries and in the supplies forthcoming from the UnitedStates and the Argentine.
259CM. 32 (46).The Cabinet-(1) Approved the despatch of a telegram to Washington, whichwas drafted during the meeting, instructing the UnitedKingdom representative to state, at the meeting of the combined Food Board, that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould be prepared to introduce bread rationing in theUnited Kingdom if it were also introduced in the UnitedStates. He should be at liberty to include in his state-ment a reference to Canada, as well as the United States,if he considered this desirable.(2) Agreed that arrangements should be made for publicity tobe given to this proposal as soon as it had been made..-(3) Agreed to defer any further decisions as to the acceptanceof a reduction in the United Kingdom allocation ofwheat until they knew with what reception this offerhad met.(4) Authorised the Minister of Food to negotiate with theCanadian Government a long-term contract to buysubstantial quantities of wheat at a fixed price of$1 - 55 a bushel up to June 1948.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,10th April, 1946.
