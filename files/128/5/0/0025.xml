GovernmentpublicityService.Speeches by persons otherthan Membersof theGovernment.(previous reference:CM. (46) 23rdConclusions,Minute 6.)1. The Prime Minister recalled that at their meeting on the11th March the Cabinet had invited him to consider whether furtherdirections should be given to the Ministry of Information or itssuccessor regarding its policy in handling speeches made by persons other than members of the Government. He and the lord president had now considered this matter and had come to theconclusion that it would be inappropriate to issue any general directions. The point could best be dealt with on individual casesas they arose.The Cabinet-Took  note,  with  approval,  of  the  Prime  ministers statement.Parliament. 2.   The  Lord President  recalled  the  suggestion  that  the debate on projected debate in the House of Commons on the World FoodWorld Food Situation might be held on the 25th March. From the point situation. view of economy in Parliamentary time, it would be convenient to(Previous hold the debate then, in connection with the remaining stages ofReference: the Consolidated Fund Bill. It had, however, been represented toC.M.(46)24th him that the debate should not take place until the Minister of FoodConclusions,     had returned from the United States.Minute 1.)  he Prime Minister said that, according to his latest informa-tion, the Minister of Food should be back in this country beforethe end of the present week. The Minister would, however, wishto have an opportunity for consultation with the Cabinet before this debate took place; and it seemed preferable that the debate should not be held before the week beginning the 1st April.The Cabinet Endorsed the Prime Ministers view that the House ofCommons debate on the World Food Situation should not take place until some days after the Minister of Food had returned to this country from the United States.Persia.(previous reference:CM. (46) 23rdConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Foreign Secretary said that the United States Govern-ment had decided that they would bring the Persian situation beforethe Security Council if it was not raised by the Persian Govern-ment. They had reached, and published, this decision because they feared that pressure by the Soviet Government might prevent thePersian Government from raising the matter themselves. Thelatest indications were, however, that the Persian Governmentwould bring the matter before the Security Council in spite of strong pressure by the Soviet Government to dissuade them from doing so.The Foreign Secretary said that he had some reason to believethat the explanation of recent Soviet activities in Persia was tobe sought in their oil interests, rather than a desire to acquire freshterritory or an outlet to warm-water ports. He had heard that ifAmerican oil companies obtained concessions in Persian Azerbaijanthey might be able to draw oil away from the Russian oilfields atBaku. He would be grateful if the Minister of Fuel and power would arrange for his technical experts to let him have a report onthis point.  The Minister of Fuel and Power undertook to do this.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.[31633-1]
Egypt. 4.   The Foreign Secretary said that the Egyptian Government!Treaty h.a.6. appointed twelve persons to negotiate with His Majesty&apos;;&apos;Revision.        Ambassador in Cairo the revision of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty,(Previous        These included no representative of the Wafd.   It would, in his reference:      view, be inexpedient for us to question on this ground the competenceCM. (46)llth   of the negotiating body appointed by the Egyptian Government:Conclusions,     such an attitude on our part might be represented as interference in minute 3.)      the  domestic  concerns of  another  Government.    The  Foreign]Secretary proposed, however, to ask the Egyptian Government for Ian assurance that the negotiating body was sufficiently representa-tive to warrant the assumption that a new Treaty negotiated after discussion with this body had a reasonable chance of being ratified&apos;by Egypt-In discussion it was pointed out that it was unfortunate that,representatives of the Wafd had not been included in the negotiating!body, and this was likely to give rise to difficulty in the future. At Ithe same time it was recognised that there were strong arguments against declining to negotiate with the body which the egyptian government had appointed for this purpose.   We should not put ourselves in a position in which it could be said that we were willingto discuss Treaty revision only with a body of our own choosing.The Cabinet-Took note that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cairo wouldbe authorised to open discussions about the revision of theAnglo-Egyptian Treaty with the negotiating bodyappointed for this purpose as soon as the egyptian government had given satisfactory assurances that thisnegotiating body was sufficiently representative to warrant the assumption that a new Treaty negotiated after discussion with them had a reasonable chance of being Iratified by Egypt.Syria andthe Lebanon.(previous reference:CM. (46) 16thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Foreign Secretary said that it had now been agreed thatthe withdrawal of British and French troops from Syria would becompleted by the 30th April, 1946. From the Lebanon the Britishtroops could be withdrawn by June 1946, but the French Govern-ment claimed that they could not complete the withdrawal of their troops until a much later date. The Lebanese Government weredissatisfied with the position and proposed to bring the matter again to the Security Council.The Foreign Secretary thought that the French were exagger-ating the physical difficulties of completing their withdrawal fromthe Lebanon. In any event, it would be embarrassing for us toretain our troops there for longer than we needed, merely to ensurethat our final withdrawal coincided with that of the French. he therefore proposed that final arrangements should now be made towithdraw our troops by the end of June.The Cabinet Agreed that arrangements should be made to complete thewithdrawal of British troops from the Lebanon by the endof June 1946.Denmark.RussianEvacuationof Bornholm.6. The Foreign Secretary said that he had recently asked thatthe withdrawal of the remaining British troops from Denmarkshould be expedited; and this bad enabled the Danish Governmentto inform the Soviet Government that all British troops would shortly be withdrawn from Danish territory. It wras, he believed,as a result of this that the Soviet Government had nowr decided towithdraw their troops from the island of Bornholm. Their evacua-tion from Bornholm had already begun and was to be completed within a fortnight.
7. The Minister of Health called attention to the statement made by the Prime Minister of Greece that law and order, thenecessary prerequisites for the holding of free elections, did not exist in Greece at the present time; that armed organisations wereimposing their ideologies by violence; and that only monarchistcandidates were able to move freely about the country. If we wereto maintain our objection to any postponement of the elections, it seemed important that an early statement should be made explainingin some detail the steps which we had taken to ensure that theelections could be held in conditions which allowed the free expres-sion of political opinion. Full publicity should be given to any such statement.There was general agreement with this suggestion; and theForeign Secretary undertook to take the first suitable opportunityfor making a considered statement on this point.8. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (46) 111) proposing that we should now accede to the request of the Emperor of Ethiopia for the surrender ofhis son-in-law, Dejazmach Gugsa.During the Battle of Makalle in 1935 Gugsa had gone overto the Italians by previous arrangement and had thereby contri-buted largely to the defeat of the Ethiopians. In 1941 the emperor of Ethiopia had asked the British military authorities to surrenderGugsa; and the Minister of State in Cairo, on his own responsibility,had approved the advice of the Chief Political Officer, East AfricanCommand, that Gugsa should not be surrendered to the Emperorbut should be deported. Gugsa was then given some form of assurance that he would not be handed over to the Emperor, andhe was interned in the Seychelles, where he had since been livingwith ten relatives and retainers on a subsistence allowance paid byHis Majesty&apos;s Government. In 1942 the Emperor had renewed hisapplication for Gugsa&apos;s surrender and the matter had come beforethe War Cabinet, who decided that in view of the commitmententered into in the previous year Gugsa could not be surrendered.The Emperor had again renewed his application in October 1945;and had now instructed his Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs toraise the matter with the Foreign Office during his present visit to London.The decision not to surrender Gugsa was not only bad in inter-national law, but contrary to the general policy of handing overQuislings to the countries they had sought to betray. On the otherhand, we had given our word to Gugsa that he would not be surrendered; and to give him up now would involve going back onthe assurance given to him and on the decisions taken by the WarCabinet in 1942. The Foreign Secretary recommended neverthelessthat Gugsa should now be surrendered to the Emperor.Discussion showed that it was the view of the Cabinet that,on the merits, Gugsa ought to be surrendered to the Emperor. Theonly question was whether the present Government were committed by the assurances given to him on the authority of the Ministerof State, then a member of the War Cabinet, and by the WarCabinets subsequent decision in 1942 that these assurances shouldbe honoured. Some Ministers were apprehensive that a decisionto go back on these assurances now might be thought to imply somederogation from the right of asylum. As against this, it waspointed out that the document signed by Gugsa in 1941 included the statement &quot; I understand that I shall be paid a subsistence allowance until the end of the war when my position will be reviewed.&quot; It was arguable that this reference to a review extended,not merely to the payment of the subsistence allowance, but to thecase as a whole.The conclusion of the Cabinet was that, despite the assurances given to Gugsa in 1941, the right course now was to surrender himto the Emperor.
The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that Gugsa should be surrendered tothe Emperor of Ethiopia.(2) Took note that, before any communication was made to the ethiopian representative in London, the foreign secretary would consult with Mr. Anthony Eden, whohad been Foreign Secretary when these assurances weregiven to Gugsa in 1941 and when the matter came beforethe War Cabinet in 1942.CivilAviation.Constructionof newbuildingsand runwayat FiltonAirfield for the brabazon I aircraft.(previous reference:C.M.(45)10thConclusions,Minute 3.)9. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs (CP. (46) 99) reporting the con-clusions of the Civil Aviation Committee on proposals made by theMinister of Supply and of Aircraft Production for the provisionof facilities at Filton Airfield for the construction of prototypes ofthe Brabazon I aircraft.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that authorityfor the design and construction of two prototypes of this aircraft had been given by the War Cabinet in December 1943 (WM. (43)167th Conclusions, Minute 2) and that in June 1945 the Cabinet had authorised the then Minister of Aircraft Production to start workon the construction of an assembly and flight-testing shed, on theunderstanding that the expenditure to be incurred would not exceed 50,000. Authority was now sought for the acquisition of180 acres of land for the construction of an extended runway, andfor the completion of the assembly building and flight shed. Thetotal cost of the project, including the construction of air frames and engines, would be  7,535,250. The first aircraft to be produced(the Mark I) would be powered with Centaurus reciprocatingengines, aud would be followed by three Mark II aircraft withProteus gas turbines. B.O.A.C. were prepared to give orders forthe Mark II aircraft, but they did not regard the Mark I type as asatisfactory aircraft for its intended purpose; and the Committeehad formed the impression that the Ministry of Civil Aviation didnot regard either type of the Brabazon I with great enthusiasm. If.therefore, the matter had had to be determined solely on the operators opinion, the Committee would have had some hesitation in recommending that the project should proceed. They had felt,however, that, in view of the great experience in aeronautical know-ledge which would be gained from the development of the Brabazon I aircraft, in the field of both civil and military aviation, the project should be carried out. Work must start at once on the extension ofthe existing runway at Filton if it was to be completed by the timethe Mark I prototype was ready to begin its flight trials in May1947. The Committee therefore endorsed the proposal of theMinister of Supply and of Aircraft Production that the land needed for this extension of the runway should be acquired by the exerciseof his existing powers under the Defence Acts.The Committee had also given some consideration to theproposal that Filton should be used as a civil airport for Bristol.Additional runways and terminal buildings and hangars wouldbe required for this purpose, and the Minister of Civil Aviationwould have to acquire up to 520 acres of land in addition to the180 acres required for the main runway. At first sight this seemed an economical proposition, but the details were being con-sidered further by the Ministry of Civil Aviation in consultationwith the Treasury and other Departments concerned.The Cabinet first considered whether the main project should go forward.The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Civil Aviation,said that, although B.O.A.C. were not interested in the Mark Itype of the Brabazon I aircraft, they had agreed that orders ontheir behalf should be placed for three Mark II types.   Their lack
of enthusiasm for this aircraft was partly due to their belief that by 1950, when it was likely to come into operation, other improvedtypes might be available. The Minister of Civil Aviation himself,however, definitely supported the view that the project should go on.. The President of the Board of Trade said that the Brabazon I aircraft was likely to be as good as any of the competing UnitedStates aircraft which were now being produced. If we were to achieve a competitive position in civil aircraft design, it was essential that this project should go forward.The Cabinet next considered by what powers the land shouldbe acquired for the extended runway and for the possible provisionof the main Bristol airport at Filton.The Minister of Supply and of Aircraft Production pointedout that, as work on the runway must begin at once, he must proceedunder the powers contained in the Defence Acts, 1842 to 1935,which had been conferred on him by the Ministry of Supply Act,1939, and had been made available for purposes such as the present by the Supplies and Services (Transitional Powers) Act, 1945.There was general agreement that the land required for the runway should be acquired under the powers contained in theDefence Acts. It was, however, desirable to avoid introducingfresh legislation to authorise the acquisition of additional land for developing the Filton site as the main Bristol airport. TheMinister of Supply and of Aircraft Production should consult with the Minister of Health and the Minister of Civil Aviationwith a view to ensuring that the powers required for this purposewere taken in the Civil Aviation Bill and, if necessary, in theAcquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) Bill.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that approval of the project for the extension of the runway should not be regarded ascommitting the Goverment finally to the plan for establishing themain Bristol Civil airport at Filton. This plan required furtherconsideration between the Departments concerned. This wasagreed.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed  that  the  project  for the construction of the brabazon I aircraft should proceed.(2) Approved the extension of the main runway and the con-struction of an assembly building and flight shed atFilton on the lines proposed in CP. (46) 99.(3) Agreed that the land required for the extension of the runway should be acquired under the Defence Acts,1842-1935.(4) Invited the Minister of Supply and of Aircraft Produc-tion to consult with the Minister of Health and theMinister of Civil Aviation with a view to ensuring thatany further powers needed for acquiring additional landfor developing the Filton site as the main Bristol air-port were included in the Civil Aviation Bill and, ifnecessary, in the Acquisition of Land (authorisation procedure) Bill.10. The Cabinet had before them (i) a memorandum by theParliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Civil Aviation (CP. (46) 110),covering a draft of the Civil Aviation Bill; and (ii) a memorandumby the President of the Board of Trade (CP. (46) 113) raisingobjections to Clause 4 (1) of the Bill, which prohibited the airways corporations from using aircraft, components, accessories or equip-ment designed or manufactured outside His Majesty&apos;s dominions,except with the approval of the Minister or under any generalauthority given by him.
Discussion first turned on the objections of the President of theBoard of Trade to Clause 4 (1) of the Bill.The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Civil Aviation, saidthat this Clause was based on a similar provision in the british overseas Airways Act, 1939. If, however, the Cabinet decided to sustain the objections raised by the President of the Board of Trade,the best course would be to omit Clause 4 (1) and rely on the general Ipowers conferred on the Minister by Clause 3 (2) to give directions to the Corporations as to the exercise of their functions.The Foreign Secretary supported the proposal of the Presidentof the Board of Trade that the Bill should not in terms prohibit theuse of foreign aircraft, accessories or equipment. Any such prohibition-prohibition might react unfavourably on our ability to sell such productsas locomotives and ships to foreign countries.The Minister of Supply and of Aircraft Production said thatwhile he would not object either to the suggestion that Clause 4 (1)should be omitted, reliance being placed on the powers of theMinister under Clause 3, or to the proposal that Clause 4 (1) shouldbe redrafted in the terms of the Annex to OP. (46) 113, he hopedthat there would be no departure from the agreement reached by the Lord Presidents Committee on the 26th January (L.P. (46)3rd Meeting, Minute 2) that the manufacture of aircraft or partsof aircraft and the carrying out of major repairs by the Corporationsshould be subject to the consent of the Minister. This control was essential for the purpose of maintaining the efficiency of the aircraft industry in this country, and this, in turn, was essential for themaintenance of our war potential.In further discussion it was urged, on the one hand, that clause 3 gave the Minister all the necessary powers to secure the objects of Clause 4 (1), and that the proper course was to omitClause 4 (1). On the other hand, it was argued that, if reliance was placed entirely on the powers of the Minister under Clause 3,difficult questions might arise, both when the Bill was before Parlia-ment and in actual administration, as to the precise control exercis-able by the Minister over the Corporations.The Prime Minister said that the general sense of the cabinet was against the retention of Clause 4 (1). The question whether,if Clause 4 (1) were omitted from the Bill, reliance could be placedon the powers in Clause 3 or whether some alternative provision onthe lines of the draft in the Annex to OP. (46) 113 should besubstituted for Clause 4 (1) should be considered by the Minister ofCivil Aviation in consultation with the Minister of Supply and of aircraft Production before the meeting of the Legislation Com-mittee on the following day.Other points in discussion were : (a) It was suggested that the detailed statement of the powersof the three Corporations should be transferred from Clause 2 of theBill to a Schedule.(b) The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Civil Aviation,undertook, with reference to Clause 32, to see that the powers of theMinister to replace buildings extended to farm buildings as well ashouses.(c) The Secretary of Slate for Dominion A ffairs asked whetherit was right that the duty under Clause 32 to provide alternative accommodation should be limited to cases in which it appeared tothe Minister of Civil Aviation to be desirable to do so. It wasagreed that this point could be considered by the legislation committee.
The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that Clause 4 (1) of the draft Bill should be omittedand invited the Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry ofCivil Aviation, to consider, in consultation with, theMinister of Supply and of Aircraft Production, what, ifany, alternative provision should be inserted in the Billto give to the Minister of Civil Aviation control over theuse by the Corporations of foreign aircraft, accessoriesor equipment.(2) Approved the draft Civil Aviation Bill annexed to cp. (46) 110, subject to the preceding conclusion and to detailed examination by the Legislation Committee.11. The Cabinet had before them (i) a note by the foreign secretary (CP. (46) 114) covering a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster on the future level of Germany&apos;s indus-trial production; and (ii) a further memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (46) 115) outlining the instructions which shouldbe sent to our representatives at the forthcoming discussion of thisquestion on the Allied Control Council in Berlin.In the memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster it was recalled that it had been agreed at Yalta andPotsdam that the plan for extracting reparations from germany should be so designed that Germany would be left with sufficientresources to subsist without external assistance at an average livingstandard not exceeding that of European countries other than theUnited Kingdom and Russia. Discussions had been started inBerlin to determine the level of industry which Germany shouldbe permitted to retain, but they had for a long time made little progress. Eventually, on the 31st December, 1945, a plan hadbeen put forward by the United Kingdom Delegation to the allied co-ordinating Committee. This plan, although it was the leastdrastic plan that seemed possible under the Potsdam Agreement,already involved so serious an interference with the german economy as to cause Ministers much uneasiness. It had, however,been regarded as too lenient by our Allies. A revised plan had now been submitted to the Control Council by the Allied EconomicDirectorate. This had been accepted by the American and soviet representatives on behalf of their Governments, and the Britishand French representatives had undertaken to obtain the views oftheir Governments by the 20th March. The new plan was described in CP. (46) 114. It represented concessions by both sides, but in nearly every case the Russian concessions had been substantially greater than those of the other Powers. In the view of the british delegation the plan represented a fair interpretation of the potsdam Agreement. A substantially more lenient attitudetoward Germany could not be adopted without modification of that agreement. While the new plan had many disadvantages, its acceptance would remove a source of irritation which had cloudedrelations in Berlin and might pave the way to a better under-standing.The Foreign Secretary&apos;s memorandum (CP. (46) 115) sug-gested that the British Delegation should be authorised to acceptthe new plan on certain assumptions.   These were: (i) That Germany, with its present Western frontiersremaining unchanged, would be treated as a single economic whole;and that, in &quot;the event of any alteration in the Western frontiersor of a decision against a centralised economic administration, theplan would call for revision.(ii) That the population of Germany would not exceed66-! millions.3-1] c
(iii) That exports would be possible to pay for imports to theextent envisaged in the plan, thus obviating a charge on the occupying Powers or other external assistance.Our representatives should insist that the situation in germany should be reviewed periodically with the above assumptions in mind and that there should simultaneously be reviews of the extent towhich the measures taken to ensure elimination of the German war fpotential had been effective. They should stress the importance of !encouraging agriculture and other peaceful industries; and should recommend the modification or removal in due course of any limita-tions inherent in this plan on the expansion of peaceful industries,subject always to the requirements of essential security. Finally,they should make it clear that acceptance of the above conditions for the review and possible modification of the plan need not affectimmediate action for determining the amount of equipment to beremoved from Germany as reparations.The Foreign Secretary said that these proposals for a reviewwere necessary to ensure that a balance of payments could, in fact,be achieved, and that a continuing burden was not imposed on theBritish taxpayer. The British Exchequer was now contributingsome  80 to  90 million a year. He estimated that, if this planwere accepted, the cost in two or three years&apos; time should be reducedto about  25 million.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster recommended theacceptance of the plan in the terms proposed, despite its manydisadvantages. He called the attention of the Cabinet to the factthat the plan foreshadowed unemployment of the order of4-4^ million in Germany. The level of industry proposed was thatof 1932, which had produced the conditions in which Hitler had risen to power. The British Zone, as the most highly industrialisedzone, would have to bear the main burden of this unemploymentThis made it the more urgent to establish a central GermanAdministration so that the British Zone could obtain relief fromthe agricultural production of the other zones.The Lord President said that, while it might be necessary toaccept the plan as a working principle for the present, he was much concerned at the prospect that it held out. We seemed to be headingfor economic chaos in Germany which would injure our own economic interests. While we should prevent the rebuilding of awar potential in Germany, it was not good policy to ruin theGerman economy. A population of this size could not be reduced toa pastoral condition. To keep in force a plan which foreshadowedso large a figure of unemployment seemed to be inviting a repetition of the events which led to the break-up of the Weimar Republic.There was general agreement with these views. At the sametime, the plan, with all its disadvantages, would at least afford an agreed basis on which to start. The course of events might make possible its early revision and, if so, revision would begin from abetter starting-point than had at one time seemed possible.In further discussion the question was raised of obtainingfurther supplies of timber and potash from Germany. TheChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that this was underconsideration.The Cabinet-Agreed that the British representatives on the allied control Council in Berlin should be authorised to acceptthe plan outlined in CP. (46) 114 subject to the reserva-tions set out in CP. (46) 115 and summarised above.

The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theParliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP. (46)112) covering a revised draft of a treaty with Transjordan.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the colonies said that negotiations with the Transjordan delegation had proceeded in an atmosphere of great cordiality. The draft now before the Cabinet followed the main lines of that which they had approved on the 28th February. It had received the approval ofthe Foreign Office, the Board of Trade, the Treasury and the Chiefsof Staff.After discussion the Cabinet Approved the conclusion of a treaty with the TransjordanGovernment in the terms of the draft attached to CP.
