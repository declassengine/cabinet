world supplies ofCereals.Supplies toGermany,(PreviousBeferenoe:CM. (46) 10thConclusions,Minute 4.)1. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that at a meetingon Food Supplies on the 5th. March, Ministers had agreed that the combined Food Board should be asked to allocate a total of 1,340,000tons of wheat to the three Western zones of Germany for the first six months of 1946. They had, however, been informed that, evenif this allocation were made, it would be some time before shipmentsin pursuance of the allocation could arrive in Germany; and theimmediate needs of the British zone were such that, unless further supplies could be obtained at once, it would be necessary within thenext few days to reduce the ration below the present level of 1,000calories a day. To maintain the ration at its present level 150,000tons of wheat were needed during March. Ministers had, therefore,decided (i) that the Combined Food Board should be asked at once toauthorise the purchase of 260,000 tons of wheat on account of theallocation to be made to Germany; and (ii) that, if this authoritywere obtained, grain from stocks in the United Kingdom might be shipped to meet Germany&apos;s immediate needs up to 150,000 tons, onthe understanding that we should reimburse ourselves, both for this and for an earlier loan of 112,500 tons, out of the 260,000 tons to be shipped from the United States. Subsequently, however, theMinistry of Food has reported that, even if the necessary authoritywere obtained from the Combined Food Board, it might not in fact be possible to buy wheat in the United States at once. They had,therefore, suggested that no supplies should be sent to germany from this country until corresponding amounts had been actuallybought in the United States and licensed for export. Acceptanceof this suggestion would involve a delay which would make it inevitable that the ration in the British zone of Germany should bereduced below the level of 1,000 calories a day. Meanwhile, it hadbeen established that it would not in fact be practicable to supplymore than 75,000 tons of grain to Germany before the end of Marchfrom sources within our control. If that reduced amount could besupplied, it should be possible to maintain the nominal ration at thelevel of 1,000 calories a day, although that ration would bedishonoured from time to time in some areas.The Prime Minister asked the Cabinet to consider whether theUnited Kingdom should take the risk of advancing this reducedsupply of 75,000 tons of grain to the British zone of Germany, inthe expectation of being able to obtain in replacement supplies inthe United States against the allocation to be made to Germany.He himself considered that, in view of the grave situation in theBritish zone, this risk ought to be accepted, and that suppliestowards this total of 75,000 tons should start to be shippedforthwith.Points made in discussion were : (a) The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Foodemphasised that under this proposal the United Kingdom would be making a loan to Germany before the Combined Food Board haddetermined Germany&apos;s allocation and before wheat had actually been purchased against that allocation. In so far as Canadian wheatmight be involved, she reminded the Cabinet of the stipulation madeby the Canadian Government that their wheat should only be used tomeet United Kingdom needs. Treasury authority would berequired for the purchase of this United States wheat for the benefitof Germany.The Cabinet were informed that this Treasury authority hadbeen obtained.(b) It had been said that Russia had offered to supply 500,000tons of wheat to France. If they had a surplus, could they notsupply some to the western zones of Germany ? The Cabinet were informed that the making of such an offer to France did not neces-sarily imply that Russia had an exportable surplus of wheat. It.was known that in Austria the Russian zone had at the moment less
food than the other zones. If Russia had any surplus, she was more likely to send it to Poland, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia than tothe Western zones of Germany; and the Combined Food Board wereto be asked to put such a proposal to the Soviet Government.(c) The world food situation was now so serious that, apart altogether from any further demands from Germany, this country might be unable to secure the wheat supplies required to maintain our present standards. The Ministry of Food should therefore be considering what further economies could most easily be made.After further discussion the Cabinet \(1) Invited the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry ofFood to arrange, in consultation with the Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster and the Minister of Transport,for 75,000 tons of grain from supplies in this country or within our control to b&apos;e shipped to Germany duringthe current month to meet the immediate needs of theBritish zone of Germany, on the understanding that theamounts so supplied would be replaced from the alloca-tion to be made to Germany by the Combined Food Board.(2) Invited the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry ofFood to arrange for plans to be prepared for securingfurther economies, if required, in grain consumption inthe United Kingdom.Parliament. 2.   The Lord President referred to the business to be taken in business in     the House of Commons during the following week,the House of On the 12th March, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of StateCommons. for Air would open the debate on the Air Estimates. Shouldanother Minister reply to the debate ? The view of the Cabinet wasthat the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Air should seek the leave of the House to make a second speech in reply tothe debate.On the remaining stages of the Police Bill on the 13th March,the Home Secretary expected some criticism on the ground that this bill was symptomatic of a general tendency to cut down the func-tions of local authorities. The Cabinet were informed that arrange-ments were being made for Ministers to meet, before the debate,some of the Governments supporters who were concerned about this general point; and the Minister of Health said that he would be willing to attend this meeting, if desired.On the 14th March, when the Army Estimates were taken, theSecretary of State for War would open and the Financial secretary would reply to the debate.On the 15th March there would be a debate, on the Adjourn-ment, on the Cabinet Mission to India. The Prime Minister under-took to speak in this debate.India.DraftDirectiveto cabinet mission.(previous reference:CM. (46) 16thConclusions,Minute 7.)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for India (CP. (46) 96) covering the draft of a directiveto the Cabinet Mission to India.The Cabinets discussion is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s standard file of Cabinet Conclusions.The Cabinet-Invited the Prime Minister to issue a directive to theCabinet Mission to India in the terms of the draft attachedto CP. (46) 96.
4. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the foreign secretary&apos;s memoranda (CP. (46) 78 and 79) on the future of japanese industry.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that, as requested by the Cabinet, he had ascertained the views of theGovernments of Australia and New Zealand on the outstandingquestion whether Japan should be allowed to build merchant ships other than coastal craft. The Australian Government consideredthat the balance of the arguments was in favour of prohibiting japan from building ships of more than 2,000 gross tons. They were seeking technical advice on the question whether the restriction shipbuilding to vessels below this tonnage would effectively preventJapan from building up a war potential in shipping. The NewZealand Government were also impressed by the arguments in favourof prohibiting Japan from building ocean-going ships; and they thought it unwise to permit, so soon after the Japanese surrender,facilities which wrere inherently dangerous and might also be interpreted as marking the beginning of a lenient policy towardsJapan.The Foreign Secretary said that the United States naval authorities had that day announced that, within six months from japan&apos;s surrender, the Japanese shipyards had rebuilt 524 vesselstotalling over one million gross tons, and had under construction133 new- merchant ships with an aggregate tonnage of over 370,000gross tons. The new construction programme which was beingcarried out under United States direction would bring the Japanesemercantile marine up to about 1,800,000 gross tons. This announce-ment seemed to imply that the question now- before the cabinet was already being prejudged by the unilateral action of the UnitedStates authorities in Japan.The Foreign Secretary said, however, that in spite of the views expressed by the Governments of Australia and New Zealand, he still considered that the balance of the arguments was againstimposing these severe restrictions on Japanese shipbuilding. our existing economic difficulties in respect of Germany should he a warning against carrying restrictions which seemed desirable on security grounds to lengths which would seriously prejudice Japan&apos;sprospects of rebuilding a peace-time economy sufficient to supporther population. Such a policy could only result in imposing on allied Governments the burden of contributing to the support of japan&apos;s population. In these circumstances he thought that thebest course would be to allow the Far Eastern Commission to con-sider to what extent Japan should be allowed to retain her ship-building industry, as part of the general question of the futurelevel of Japanese industry as a whole; and to avoid limiting the discretion of the United Kingdom representative on the Commissionin these discussions by deciding in advance that Japan should notbe allowed to build any ocean-going ships. He recommended, how-ever, that our representative on the Commission should be instructedto make it clear from the outset that His Majesty&apos;s Government inthe United Kingdom were not prepared to undertake any financial burden in assisting Japan to meet the economic consequences of any restrictions imposed on Japan&apos;s industry.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, the President of the Boardof Trade and other Ministers supported the views expressed by theForeign Secretary.The First Lord of -the Admiralty said that he was glad to havethe support of the Governments of Australia and New Zealand forthe views which he had expressed in the Cabinets earlier discussion;and he still supported the proposal that Japan should be prohibited from building ocean-going ships. As this question was to bediscussed on the Far Eastern Commission, it might be helpful toobtain the views of the Combined Chiefs of Staff. The Ministerof War Transport said that he also adhered to the views which hehad put forward in the Cabinets earlier discussion.
Japan.Procedure forthe Division ofReparationsbetween theAllies.The Cabinet (1) Approved the general recommendations put forward ijCP. (46) 78 for the control of Japanese industry and thefuture level of Japan&apos;s economic life;(2) Agreed that the particular question of the extent to which japan should be allowed to retain her shipbuilding industry should be left open for discussion on the far eastern Commission, as part of the wider problem, andthat our representative should not prejudge the discus-sion of this question by demanding at the outset that japan should be prohibited from building any ocean-going vessels.(3) Agreed that our representative on the Far Eastern Com-mission should make it clear from the outset that HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom were notprepared to undertake any financial burden in assistingJapan to meet the economic consequences of any restric-tions imposed on Japan&apos;s industry.(4) Invited the Foreign Secretary to prepare, in tlhe light of the cabinets discussion, instructions to our representative on the Far Eastern Commission; and to give the UnitedStates Government an opportunities  ty to express their viewson these instructions before proposals based on them were put before the Far Eastern Commission.5. The Cahinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (46) 92) covering a report by the Economic andIndustrial Planning Staff on the procedure for determining theAllied shares in reparations from Japan.   This recommended : (i) That His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United kingdom should seek agreement with other Allied Powers to a division of japanese reparations on broad political lines rather than on a statistical basis;(ii) That the Governments of Canada, Australia, New zealand and India should be informed of this proposal and advised that itwould be mutually advantageous for the different members of theCommonwealth to reach, possibly by means of discussion betweenthe Commonwealth Delegations at Washington, a preliminaryunderstanding regarding the shares which each would aim at sercuring;(iii) That after allowing the Governments of the Dominionsand India a brief interval in which to comment on this proposal, theUnited Kingdom representative on the Far Eastern Commission in washington should be instructed to bring it before the Commission.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that heconcurred in the proposals summarised in paragraphs (ii) and (iii)above.The Cabinet-Approved the recommendations made in CP.

The Minister of Health said that the Cabinet had approvedon the 8th January the heads of the National Health Service Bill,and the draft Bill had subsequently been approved by the social services Committee. From the discussions which he and theSecretary of State for Scotland had held with representatives ofthe interests concerned it seemed to him that the opposition to theBill was likely to be less than might have been expected. TheLondon County Council had decided to support the proposals inprinciple; and this should weaken the opposition from localauthorities. Government supporters might be critical of theproposal to provide private pay-beds in hospitals and of the methodof remuneration of doctors. Unless, however, pay-beds were provided, some of the best specialists would not be attracted intothe National Health Service and. the growth of private nursinghomes would be encouraged. It was not unreasonable that the state should provide privacy for those willing to pay for it^ so long asnon-paying patients were not thereby prejudiced. As regards the remuneration of doctors, he was satisfied that under a full-timesalaried service, which was advocated by some government supporters, it would not be possible to give freedom in the choice of a doctor. There might be some comment on the amount of thecompensation payable to doctors in consequence of the prohibitionof the sale and purchase of practices. Compensation would, how-ever, be payable only to doctors who before an appointed day agreedto join, the National Health Service; it would normally be credited to the doctor and paid only on his death or retirement from theService; and doctors entitled to compensation would have no claimto superannuation in respect of any period before the date whenthey entered the Service.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that, subject to certain modifications (set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 of CP. (46) 89) whichhad already been accepted by the Cabinet, the Scottish proposals would be in accord with the scheme proposed for England andWales. He had agreed with the Minister of Health that the claimmade on behalf of Scottish dentists for compensation for the lossof capital value of dental practices should be resisted; and the onlyoutstanding difficulty was the suggestion, made in paragraph 4 (a)of CP. (46) 89, that members of central and local bodies set up underthe National Health Service should receive payment for loss of renumerative time in attending meetings. In view of the precedents for this in Scotland, he was bound to be challenged on the point when the Scottish Bill came before Parliament; but for the present he would be content to accept the suggestion made at the meetingof the Social Services Committee on the 4th March that there shouldbe an inquiry into the question whether such payments should bemade.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the assumption bythe Exchequer of the whole cost of the hospital service would relievelocal authorities of a very heavy burden of expenditure and wouldhave to be accompanied by an. adjustment of other exchequer grants. It was important that there should be no misunderstandingon this point and, as soon as the Bill was introduced, a clear state-ment must be made to the effect that there would have to be a general review of the scheme of Exchequer relief to local rates, and that measures would have to be taken to see that with the introductionof the changes provided for in the Bill other changes were also made which would ensure that the richer local authorities did not secure all the benefit from the transfer. There were various detailedpoints on the financial clauses of the Bill which should be cleared up before it came before the Legislation Committee, and he would arrange for these points to be discussed by officials later in the day.The Cabinet-(1) Approved, the draft National Health Service Bill annexed to CP. (46) 86, subject to any amendments of thefinancial clauses which might be agreed on between theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Health,
and invited the Minister of Health to submit it to theLegislation Committee.(2) Agreed that when the National Health Service Bill was introduced a statement should be made about the effectof the transfer of hospital expenditure from localauthorities to the Exchequer, and invited the Chancellorof the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Minister of Health to settle the terms of this statement.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for aCommittee to be appointed to enquire into the point raised in paragraph 4 (a) of CP. (46) 89 about payment for loss of remunerative time.The Lord President said that he and the Lord Privy Seal had thought it right to invite the Cabinet to consider, before theyauthorised the introduction of these Bills, the prospects of com-completing the Legislative Programme during the current Session.Despite what the Minister of Health had said, he believed thatthese Bills would be extremely controversial and, even if the EnglishBill were given a Second Reading before Easter and both Billswere sent to Standing Committees under a timetable, it would barelybe possible to get them through all their stages in the House ofCommons before the end of July. There was a risk, therefore, thatthe present Session would have to be prolonged for about six weeks in order to give the House of Lords time to consider the Bills; and,unless other Bills could be introduced in the House of Lords, itwould be difficult to find legislative business for the House ofCommons during that period. There wras also a risk that some ofthe Bills shown in Annex III to CP. (46) 94 would be crowded out and have to be postponed until the next Session.The following points were raised in discussion of the lord presidents statement : (a) The Prime Minister asked whether it might not be expedient to carry over to the next Session some of the legislation which could not be completed in the current Session.The Lord President undertook to examine this.(b) The Secretary of Slate for Dominion Affairs said that hewould discuss with the Lord President and the Lord Privy Sealmeans of relieving the congestion in the House of Lords towardsthe end of the Session. He would welcome any arrangement ofbusiness which would give the House of Lords more legislation atthe preseirt stage.(c) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was essentialto pass the Exchange Control Bill during the current Session and desirable that the Cable and Wireless Bill should also be passed this session.(d) The Satellite Towns Bill might be started in the House ofLords.The Cabinet-(4) Agreed that the National Health Service Bills should beintroduced as soon as practicable.(5) Invited the Lord President, the Lord Privy Seal, theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs and theParliamentary Secretary to the Treasury to consider what steps should be taken to make the best possible useof the Parliamentary time available for legislation during the remainder of the current Session.(6) Took note that the Lord President would examine thepossibility of carrying over into the next Session some public Bills which had not been completed by the end ofthe current Session.Cabinet Offices, S.W. 1,8th March, 1946.
