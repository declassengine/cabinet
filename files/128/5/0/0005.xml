1. The Prime Minister said that he had been informed bythe Minister of Labour and National Service that the total numberdemobilised from the Armed Forces by the 31st December, 1945,was 1,510,080. The staffs of the Service Departments, the Ministryof War Transport and the Ministry of Labour were to be congratulate-lated on having attained the target figure which had been set bythe Cabinet.The Foreign Secretary said that the release of man-power fromthe munitions industries had been far less satisfactory. From esti-mates based on returns of persons employed at the 24th Novem-ber, 1945, it appeared that the numbers released by the end of theyear would be about 500,000 below the approved target. Civilindustries were in urgent need of man-power, and there would be serious criticism of this apparent failure of the munitions industries to reduce their labour force in accordance with the approvedprogramme.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the planned reduc-tions in Admiralty production programmes were being achieved.The forecasts to which the Foreign Secretary had referred were based, so far as concerned the Admiralty, on a calculation made bythe Ministry of Labour of the way in which the total labour forcein shipbuilding was divided between merchant shipbuilding and naval building. He could not accept this calculation and he thoughtthat the figures required further examination.The Prime Minister said that, at the request of the Chairmanof the Man-Power Committee, he was proposing to discuss with theSupply Ministers the serious position disclosed by these latest estimates of releases from the munitions industries up to the endof 1945.t2. The Foreign ^Secretary said that, after consultation withthe Treasury and other Departments concerned, he was now in aposition to make an offer of further economic assistance to Greece.This offer would be communicated to the Greek Government in thecourse of the next few days. He hoped that it would be accepted;for, the sooner we could establish the Greek economy on a sound basis, the sooner we should be able to withdraw our troops from greece and reduce our heavy military expenditure in that area.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he hoped that the substantial credit which was to be offered to Greece would, in fact,prove effective in re-establishing the Greek economy. He was some-what sceptical of the capacity of the Greek Government to put theirown house in order; but he hoped that this latest effort to that endwould be successful, as he was most anxious to see an early reduc-tion in our military expenditure in Greece.The Foreign Secretary said that the Polish Government hadnot been willing to accept our proposals for the settlement of the outstanding liabilities, military and civil, of the previous PolishGovernment in London. We had been ready to forgo all militarydebts on the score of services rendered by the Polish Army to theAllied cause, and had proposed that the civil debts should be liquidated by a token payment of  5 millions in gold. At thesame time we had offered to supply them with surplus military stores which they could have set against the gold payment. TheForeign Secretary had thought this a reasonable settlement, and the reception of our proposals by the Polish Government had been disappointing. It was clear, however, that the matter could notbe carried further at the present stage.The Foreign Secretary said that the Netherlands Governmenthad delayed the opening of the proposed negotiations with the Indo-nesian leaders. Dr. van Mook had not yet returned to Batavia.This delajr was unfortunate, since it was most important, both for financial reasons and because of political reactions in India, thatwe should reduce as quickly as possible our military commitments in the Dutch East Indies.
The Foreign Secretary said that, in view of the very greatimportance of promoting a settlement between the netherlands government and the Indonesian leaders, he had decided to send outSir Archibald Clark Kerr on a special mission to the Dutch east indies.UnitedNationsOrganisation.First general assembly.government hospitality.3. The Foreign Secretary gave the Cabinet an account of theproceedings at the First General Assembly of the United nations organisation.During the first week there had been a tendency on the partof some Delegations to resort to lobbying on important questionssuch as the election of the President, the elections to the security council and the appointment of the Secretary-General. TheForeign Secretary had thought it advisable to do his best to checkthis tendency at the outset; and, having once indicated his viewson these questions, he had adhered to them in spite of pressure from other Delegations. This stand had, he thought, produced good results up to date and he proposed to maintain the same attitude as regards the appointment of the Secretary-General.The general spirit of the Assembly was reassuring.- There wasnone of the easy enthusiasm which had characterised the early days of the League of Nations. There was a keen sense of practicalresponsibility and a general recognition that peace could not be guaranteed merely by passing resolutions.Some discussion followed about the arrangements for enter-taining foreign delegates. Insufficient provision seemed to havebeen made for ensuring that the guests at official receptions were introduced to one another; and it was suggested that there wouldbe better opportunities for Ministers to make contacts withimportant visitors from abroad if Government receptions weresmaller and better organised than those given hitherto.The Foreign Secretary said that many of the members of the delegations were not well known to Foreign Office staff stationed in London, most of whom were in any event so fully occupied withthe business of the Assembly that they could not give as much time as might be desired to these official receptions. On future occasionsof this kind it would be worth while to take special steps to bring back to London members of the Foreign Service stationed in foreign capitals, who would be more familiar with the members of theforeign Delegations. He considered that further attention shouldbe given to the whole question of the organisation of government hospitality on these occasions.The Minister of State said that the Conference Department ofthe Foreign Office, in consultation with officials of the government hospitality Fund, could see what further arrangements could bemade to organise smaller receptions at which United kingdom representatives would have better opportunities for making contacts with the members of the foreign Delegations, and also for ensuring that at the larger gatherings Ministers were introduced to theleading members of the other Delegations.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of State to review the existing arrangements in the light of the points raised in thediscussion.Trade UnionRepresenta-tion.(previous reference:W.M.(45)54thConclusions.)The Foreign Secretary said that it had been suggested that facilities should be given for the World Trade Union Congress tobe represented at the First General Assembly. It was his view thatrepresentation at the United Nations Organisation should belimited to national Governments. While he had no objection to representatives of the World Trade Union Congress being presentin London during the meeting of the Assembly in an advisory
4. The Prime Minister reported that he had received two telegrams from the Minister of Food- (Amaze Nos. 6483 and 6485)giving the results of his discussions in Washington regarding theworld wheat situation.The position disclosed by these telegrams, which had been circulated to the Cabinet, was very serious. There was a prospectivedeficit of 5J million tons in the first half of 1946, and it would benecessary to impose substantial cuts in the demands of all importing countries. The Minister of Food set out in his telegram the cutsnow proposed by President Truman ias a result of the discussions which had taken place in Washington. These included a cut of215,000 tons, or 8-1 per cent., in the United Kingdom requirements.The means of meeting this would have to be discussed in detail afterthe Minister of Food had returned from Washington; but it seemed likely to involve increasing the extraction rate to 85 per cent, witha consequent effect on the supply of animal feeding-stuffs. there might also be some question as to the amount of barley used for beer.Heavy cuts were proposed for all the London Food Committeecountries, and particularly heavy cuts for Germany and Austria.It was proposed that the three western zones of Germany and austria should receive only 1,490,000 tons, as against estimated requirements of 2,525,000 tons. This would mean that the caloryvalue of the food available would be reduced from 1,550 caloriesto 1,200 calories a day, which would involve wide-spread starvation.The Prime Minister said that the supplying countries should be urged to increase their exports to the maximum. He had already communicate with the Prime Minister of Australia and it wouldbe necessary to bring the utmost pressure to bear on the Argentine,the United States and Canada.The Minister of Food was anxious to know before he left theUnited States on the 17th January whether the Cabinet agreed tothis plan in principle and were prepared to accept the allocationsproposed.Points made in discussion were : (a) It would probably be necessary to provide an additional30,000 tons for Ceylon and 70,000 tons for South-East Asia, as thesituation in these areas was already most serious. It was recognisedthat these additional supplies mighty have to be found from theUnited Kingdom allocation.(h) Owing to recent developments in Bombay, Madras and otherparts of Southern India, the latest estimate, received that morning,of the minimum requirements of India was 150,000 tons aboveprevious figures. India was most anxious now to receive 150,000 tonsa month during the first three months of 1946.(c) The requirements of all Eastern countries were affectedby the rice situation. The deficiency between supply and demandfor rice could only be met if adequate supplies were obtained fromSiam. Much was being done to stimulate exports from Siam bysupplying consumer goods and a certain quantity of gold. Thequestion was raised whether insistence that 1\ million tons of riceshould be handed over by the Siamese Government as a free giftwas not slowing down the rate of supply. If the demand for freerice could not be waived altogether, it might be postponed.There wias considerable support for this view. The cabinet were informed that the position was being kept under review by the overseas Reconstruction Committee.capacity, he was not prepared to agree to their being admitted to -the Assembly on the same footing as the representatives of national governments.The Cabinet-Endorsed the view taken by the Foreign Secretary on thisquestion.
(d) The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that inmaking his estimate, that the cuts proposed would leave the foodration in Germany at about 1,200 calories a day, he had assumed(i) that 60,000 tons of wheat already procured had not been includedin the allocation, and (ii) that 250,000 tons of coarse grains wouldbe received from the Argentine, as suggested in paragraph 18 of the telegram &quot;Amaze&quot; 6483. Even so, the supplies in the pipe-linewould be reduced from 410,000 tons to 200,000 tons, which was avery low figure.(e) The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that, accordingto his information, there was already starvation in the Russian zone of Lower Austria. If U.N.R.R.A. took over responsibility for thewhole of Austria, including the Russian zone, the amounts nowallotted to Austria would have to be spread over the whole country,with the result that the calory value on the average would, probablybe reduced to about 800 a day.There was general agreement that, in spite of this, it was desirable that U.N.R.R.A. should assume responsibilities in Austriain accordance with existing plans.(/) The Cabinet were informed that, if the extraction rate inthe United States were raised from the present figure of about 70 percent, to 80 per cent., this would produce an additional supply of1,750,000 tons of wheat in a full year. Allowing for delay in makingthe change, it might produce by the end of June some 500,000 tonsof wheat which would be readily available for export. Should not an appeal be made to the United States to raise their extraction rate ?The Cabinet considered that this was a matter which should beraised at an appropriate stage with the United States, and perhapswith other exporting countries, thought all these countries wouldhave difficulty in making the change owing to lack of machineryfor enforcement. In the first instance, however, it should be decided whether the extraction rate was to be raised in this country, andthat decision should be postponed until the Minister of Food had returned from Washington.(g) The Minister of State said that the United States had aconsiderable surplus of maize which, if it could be tapped, wouldprovide substantial relief. He understood that transport difficulties might preclude its being brought to the eastern seaboard for ship-ment, but that transport to the Pacific coast was not impracticable.If that was so, the problem of its export was primarily one&apos; ofshipping.The Minister of War Transport said that it would be difficult for him to arrange shipment from the Pacific coast of larger quantities of grain than he was already arranging to ship from the pacific coast of Canada.The Minister of Health suggested that the Americans should beasked to make additional ships available for this purpose. It wasindefensible that maize should not be shipped from areas where itwas surplus to areas where there was starvation if there was any possible way of moving it. Could not the charitable instincts of theAmerican people be aroused and a &apos;&apos; mercy fleet&apos;&apos; be organised tobring grain from Pacific ports ?(h) It was suggested that the first step was to focus world opinion on the wheat shortage. The facts were not known. In thiscountry there was no sense of the need for economy in bread. InAmerica even persons in positions of responsibility had no idea ofthe gravity of the situation.Discussion followed about the best means of giving publicity to the situation. The suggestion was made that the foreign secretary should include a statement on the subject in his forth-coming speech to the United Nations Assembly. On the other hand,it was argued that it would not be wise for the United kingdom to take the initiative in appealing for help from the United States.It might be better that the initiative should be left to one of the
smaller consuming countries.  Alternatively, the facts could be pub- -lished by the Combined Food Board or the Food and agriculture organisation.The Foreign Secretary said that he would like to have furthertime to consider this aspect of the matter. He doubted whether itwas wise to address to the United States an appeal ad misericordiam.It might be more effective to put the matter on the basis ofenlightened self-interest : world recovery and demobilisation wouldbe delayed if there was famine in Europe or Asia this winter. he did not believe that the figures in the Minister of Food&apos;s telegramrepresented America&apos;s last word : he thought that, when it came to the point, further supplies might be forthcoming.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Prime Minister to inform the Minister of Foodthat they would accept in principle allocations based onthe United States proposals, as set out in his telegramsAmaze Nos. 6483 and 6485, though they must express their grave concern about the effects of the cuts proposed,particularly in Germany and Austria.(2) Agreed to consider further the measures to be taken in thiscountry as soon as possible after the return of theMinister of Food from Washington.(3) Agreed to consider further the best method of givingpublicity to the facts&apos;of the world wheat situation andof inducing the United States and other supplying countries to increase their exports.5. The Cabinet had before them a joint memorandum by theForeign Secretary and the Minister of Information (CP. (46) 7)drawing attention to the importance of developing British publicity and information services in South Eastern Europe.The Foreign Secretary said that the best means of preventing the countries in South-Eastern Europe from being absorbed into an exclusive Soviet sphere of influence was to provide a steadystream of information about British life and culture. If this wasto be done effectively the Minister of Information and he would need the support of their colleagues in strengthening the staffsengaged in this work both in London and in the offices of PressAttaches abroad, and in providing rapid transport for publicitymaterial. The increases of staff proposed should enable reductions to be made in the publicity staffs attached to military missions.What was proposed was consistent with the plans for a new organisation to handle Government publicity overseas, and with theproposals for the future role of the British Council.Points in discussion were : (a) The Minister of Health said that information which be hadreceived from countries such as Czecho-slovakia and Hungary indi-cated that there had been no adequate publicity in those countries for the implications of the change of Government which had takenplace in the United Kingdom.(b) The Secretary of State for Air said that a number ofpersons with suitable Press experience might be obtained from theRoyal Air Force if arrangements were made for their release in class B.The Cabinet Approved the proposals made in CP. (46) 7 for the develop-ment of publicity services in South-Eastern Europe.
House ofLords.Creation of life Peers,Admission ofWomen andBepresenta-tion ofGovernmentDepartments.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secre-tary of State for Dominion Affairs (CP. (46) 2) covering a copyof a letter from Viscount Cecil of Chelwood seeking his views ona proposal that Viscount Cecil should put down a Motion in thefollowing terms : &quot; 1. That it is expedient to create a limited number of life peers to sit and vote as Peers in this House.2. That women should be eligible to be made Peers on the same terms as men.3. That on the motion of a Minister of the Crown this Housemay permit any person holding a Government office toattend and speak at a Debate on any specified question.&quot;The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that this enquiry from Viscount Cecil was only one example of representa-tions which he was constantly receiving from other quarters, andthat it would be impossible for him to avoid giving some indica-tion of the Government^ attitude on these matters. His own opinion was that there was much to be said for the creation of Life peers and the admission of women, though both would involve legislation;but that the proposal relating to the representation of GovernmentDepartments in the House of Lords was impracticable.Discussion showed that the general view of the Cabinet was against the first and third proposals. With regard to the proposal that women should be eligible to sit in the House of Lords, therewas agreement with the view that, if this proposal were found,after debate initiated by a Private Member, to command a generalmeasure of support in the House of Lords, the Government should consider introducing legislation to give effect to it. In the firstplace, however, it would be necessary to ascertain the views ofH.M. The King.The Cabinet-Invited the Prime Minister to ascertain His Majesty&apos;swishes and to consult with the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs regarding the reply to be given toViscount Cecil&apos;s enquiry.Cabinet Offices, S.W. 1,15th-January, 1946.
