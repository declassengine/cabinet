The Foreign Secretary said that at a later meeting of the,Cabinet he would make a special report on the proceedings at the paris meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers. Meanwhile,there were various other matters of, or affecting, foreign policywhich he would like to take this opportunity to mention to hiscolleagues on his return from Paris.The Foreign Secretary recalled that, at his suggestion, thePrime Minister had arranged for the Chiefs of Staff to send out aspecial mission of investigation to report on the extent to which the demilitarisation clauses of the armistice were being carried out inthe British Zone of Germany. When he suggested the despatch ofthis British mission, he had not been aware that the United states authorities intended to bring forward at once to the Allied control council in Berlin their proposal for the appointment of an Inter-Allied Commission to carry out a similar enquiry in all the occupiedzones of Germany. This proposal had now been adopted by theAllied Control Council, who had appointed a special committee to supervise the investigation. It might give rise to misunderstandingif we now proceeded with an independent investigation in theBritish Zone, and he therefore proposed that the staff of the british mission should be draAvn upon to provide the British element in theInter-Allied Commission.The Prime Minister said that he had already asked the Chiefsof Staff to arrange for this to be done.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that in theHouse of Lords on the 15th May attention has been drawn to anorder issued with the authority of the Allied Control Council inBerlin authorising the destruction of German war memorialsincluding those of the 1914-18 war. Lord Saltoun, who had raisedthis matter, was dissatisfied with the answer given by the Parlia-mentary Under-Secretary of State for War and had given notice ofhis intention to raise the matter again on the 23rd May. TheSecretary of State suggested that the Foreign Secretary might, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,reconsider the policy underlying this order before the matter was raised again in the House of Lords.The Foreign Secretary undertook to look into this point and tomake a report to the Prime Minister before the 23rd May : a copyof his report would be sent to the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs, for the purpose of the resumed discussion in the Houseof Lords.The Foreign Secretary said that he thought it important toavoid further delay in the holding of the plebiscite in Greece. Atthe next meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers in June oneof the main issues was likely to be the withdrawal of occupyingtroops from all countries in South-East Europe. It would be greatly to our advantage if agreement could be reached on the simultaneouswithdrawal of all these troops; and for this reason it was mostimportant that we should be in a position by then to agree to theimmediate withdrawal of British troops from Greece. The FrenchGovernment had, unfortunately, declined to share in the supervision of the arrangements for the plebiscite; but from conversations whichhe had had with the United States Secretary of State in Paris, he hoped that the United States Government would lend their assistance.In discussion the view was expressed that there might be someuneasiness among Government supporters at the holding of anearly plebiscite in Greece, and at the failure to secure the co-opera-tion of the French in supervising the arrangements. A dangerous situation would arise if the plebiscite resulted in a narrow majority in favour of the King&apos;s return. Not only would such a result berepresented as the consequence of British diplomacy; it was also likely to lead to a fresh outburst of violence in Greece. Would it not be possible, even at this late stage, to prevail upon the King to renounce his claim to return to Greece?[32062-5]b 2
The Foreign Secretary said that, while the King would be junwilling to make such a renunciation in advance, it was not to beassumed that he would consent to return if the plebiscite resultedin no more than a narrow majority in his favour. Nor need it beassumed that there would be even a small majority in favour of theKing&apos;s return. The evidence of the recent elections, and ofcompetent observers in Greece, suggested that a plebiscite held underfair conditions might result in a clear majority against the King&apos;?return.The Foreign Secretary said that, while he would continue to watch the position closely, he was satisfied that the balance ofadvantage lay on the side of holding the plebiscite at an early date.Egypt. The Prime Minister said that the Opposition leaders had con-(Previous tinued to press that facilities should be given for an early debateReferences: on Egypt in the House of Commons, and it had now been agreedC.M.(46)45th that such a debate might take place, in Committee of Supply, on conclusions, the 24th May. The Foreign Secretary would reply to the debate.Minute 3; and He would bring out the positive arguments in favour of with-C.M.(46)48th drawing British troops from Egypt, and would make it clear that conclusions, this was not a policy of weakness but part of a constructive planMinute 2.)      for preserving peace in the Middle East.The Chief Whip should take special steps to keep a House onthe 24th May, in case the Opposition should call for a division.Palestine. The Cabinet were informed of a further exchange of messages(Previous        between the Prime Minister and President Truman (TelegramsReference:      T. 264/46 and 272/46) regarding the steps to be taken by the twoCM. (46) 45th   Governments on the report of the Anglo-American Committee on conclusions,     Palestine.   It had now been agreed that the two GovernmentsMinute 5.)      would, independently but simultaneously, invite the Jews and Arabsto submit within one month.their views on all the recommendations in the report.   These invitations were to be issued that day.   There-after, a joint study of the implications of the report would be carriedout by experts nominated by the two Governments.   president truman was selecting a group of experts for this purpose, and wehad undertaken to indicate the subjects which we wished to be covered in this joint study.   President Truman had also undertaken to consider our suggestion that at a later stage there should be aconference convened by the two Governments but attended by repre-sentatives of the Jews and Arabs.The Foreign Secretary said that in this exchange of messagesthere was evidence that the United States Government were ready to contemplate assuming some practical share in the responsi-bility for Palestine. They now seemed to be willing to remove thisquestion from the realm of propaganda and to study its practical implications on a business-like footing. He believed that our declaration of policy in respect of Egypt had had a salutary effecton the attitude of the United States Government towards co-opera-tion in the Middle East.The Prime Minister asked whether it was intended tomake any announcement in Parliament that day about the invita-tions which were being extended to the Jews and Arabs to express their views on the report. It was pointed out that it was nowr too late to concert any agreed announcement with the United StatesGovernment. It was decided that in these circumstances it wouldbe preferable not to volunteer any Parliamentary announcement that day, but to answer any questions which might be put in parliament on the following day as a result of the announcement which wouldhave been made meanwhile in Palestine.Polish Armed The Foreign Secretary said that it was a continuing sourceForces under of embarrassment to him, in discussions on the Peace TreatyBritish with Italy, that substantial numbers of Polish troops should still beCommand. retained under British command on Italian soil.

Man-Power.Call-up to theForces in theTransitionPeriod.(previous reference:CM. (45) 58thConclusions,Minute 5.)2.   The Cabinet had before them (i) a memorandum by the Foreign Secretary (CP. (46) 194)covering a revised report by the Man-Power Committeeon the call-up to the Forces in the transition period; and(ii) a memorandum by the Minister of Supply (CP. (46) 126)and a note by the Lord President (CP. (46) 138) on the call-up of apprentices.The Prime Minister said that after considering the pro-posals in CP. (46) 194, in conjunction with a memorandum by theChiefs of Staff showing the estimated requirements of the Forces in1946 and 1947 and a memorandum by the Foreign Secretary on theimportance of maintaining adequate Forces to support our foreignpolicy, the Defence Committee had recommended (D.O. (46) 16thMeeting, Minute 1) that the Cabinet should accept the scheme pro-posed by the Foreign Secretary. The possibilities of securingfurther reductions in the static formations of the Army, of recruiting larger numbers of women in the Women&apos;s auxiliary services and of pooling common services, were being pursued; andas a result of these steps some relaxation of the call-up of appren-tices in 1947 might be possible. It was also intended to bring to theattention of Dominion Prime Ministers the heavy burden nowimposed on the man-power of the United Kingdom by the defenceobligations of the British Commonwealth.The Foreign Secretary said that the scheme which hehad recommended (Scheme D) had been arrived at after an exhaustive study of possible alternatives. Under this scheme men called up during 1947 and the early part of 1948 would serve for a fixed period of two years, which would be reduced to 1-^ years for those called up later in 1948. Deferment would continue to begranted on the existing bases to men in coalmining, agriculture andthe building and building materials industries. This would includeapprentices in those industries, but the deferment of apprentices inother industries would be discontinued for the whole of 1947, andmost students would also continue to be called up until September1948. Men already in the Services at the 1st January, 1947, wouldbe released according to age and length of service, and the aim wouldbe to release before the end of 1947 all men called up before the1st January, 1944, and before the end of 1948 all men called up before the 1st January, 1947. It was true that this meant keeping in the Forces until 1948 some men Avho had already served two years on the 1st January, 1947, so that men with up to 4J years&apos; service would be serving side by side with men called up for only two years.It was, however, inevitable that there should be a discrepancy ofthis kind in the transition period, and adequate Forces were essential if we were to meet our commitments overseas. Indeed, in any announcement about the call-up, the Government must reserve theright to lengthen the period of service if the international situation deteriorated. The man-power available for the Forces under scheme D did not wholly meet the estimated demands submitted bythe Chiefs of Staff to the Defence Committee, but it should bepossible for the Services to reduce their demands for men bytroops to the United Kingdom, were now virtually completed; and,, % \ *lin order to expedite their movement, he had persuaded the UnitedStates authorities to make a special loan of shipping for thispurpose. He had arranged to inform General Anders of these arrangements on the following day, and had intended to make anannouncement in Parliament on the 22nd May. It was thereforeunfortunate that these arrangements should have been prematurelydisclosed on the previous day by the Press and the B.B.CIt was agreed that special enquiries should be made with a viewto tracing the source from which information about these arrange-ments had reached the Press and the B.B.C
recruiting larger numbers of women. Moreover, the position of theArmy might be eased if&quot; the other two Services assumed some of the purely administrative duties which at present fell wholly on theArmy. The scheme before the Cabinet was designed for the tran-sition only and the working out of a permanent peacetime scheme, inwhich full use should be made of Auxiliary Forces, should proceed without delay.Discussion turned first on the question whether the UnitedKingdom could afford to maintain Forces of the size proposedduring the transition period.It was pointed out that under Scheme D over one million men would still be in the Forces at the end of 1947. This represented a very heavy burden on the productive capacity of the nation andshould be regarded as a maximum figure which ought to be reduced if there was a marked improvement in the international situation.It was also urged that the demands of the Services were not basedon any proper technical examination of the potentialities of new weapons, with the result that full value in striking power was notbeing obtained. Again, many economies could be made if servicesnow performed by uniformed personnel were undertaken bycivilians. Was it necessary that the number of men retained in theRoyal Navy at the 31st December, 1947, should be almost twice the pre-war number; and would it not be possible to reduce theman-power demands of the Royal Air Force by providing for alarger number of regulars ?In reply, it was pointed out that the size of the Forces was kept under constant review by the Defence Committee. It was,however, impossible to make sudden readjustments to take accountof new developments in weapons. It had also to be borne in mind that very large numbers of troops were required for policing duties on the Continent. Any precipitate reduction in the size of theForces would be damaging to our position at the present criticalstage of international affairs. Experience after the 1914-18 war1 had shown the disastrous effect on our foreign policy of the failure to back it up with adequate Armed Forces.Discussion then turned to the question how far it would bepossible to defer the call-up of apprentices in 1947.It was pointed out, on behalf of the Production Departments,that 1947 would be a critical year in the process of industrialreconversion and that from the point of view both of economic recovery and of building up an adequate war potential it was most desirable that there should be at least some deferment of apprentices,particularly of those who were within a year of completing theirapprenticeship. While it was recognised that to some extenttraining could continue during service in the Forces, e.g., in thecase of men who entered R.E.M.E., for the vast majority of appren-tices call-up meant a serious interruption of training.On the other hand, it was pointed &quot;out that any scheme fordeferment inevitably led to the submission of unjustifiable claims and that if any measure of deferment were to be granted to appren-tices in 1947 is was essential that there should be a strict scrutiny of all applications. Moreover, unless the total man-power demandsof the Services were reduced, the deferment of apprentices in 1947could be carried out only at the expense of retaining other men inthe Forces for longer periods.Other points in discussion were : (a) The Minister of Labour should pursue with employers&apos;and workers&apos; organisations the question of shortening the periodof apprenticeship. With proper training much of the time spentby apprentices could be saved.(b) The Minister of Education said that paragraph 9 (c) ofthe report annexed to CP. (46) 194 appeared to discriminate againstArts students. In any public announcement this discriminationshould be avoided. No change in the number of students deferredwould be involved.
(c) The Minister of Fuel and Power suggested that it mightbe desirable to make specific provision in the scheme for men whoopted to enter the coalmining industry.The Foreign Secretary said that if any such provision wasspecifically made in the scheme as announced, there would be claims for similar treatment from other industries. He accordingly suggested that, as had been done in the past, this matter shouldbe left to arrangement between the Departments concerned afterthe scheme had been brought into operation.(d) There was general agreement that the Government should publish their proposals during the following week in the form ofa White Paper.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Man-Power Committee to consider whatrelaxation of the call-up of apprentices in 1947 mightbe made, having regard to the reduction in the demands for men for the Forces likely to result from increasedrecruitment to the women&apos;s auxiliary services and theassumption by the Navy and the R.A.F. of some of thecommon service tasks which now fell wholly on the Army.(2) Subject to (1), approved the revised scheme for call-up inthe transition period proposed in CP. (46) 194, on theunderstanding that it might have to be amended in thelight of developments in the international situation.(3) Invited the Man-Power Committee to prepare for con-sideration by the Cabinet early in the following week a draft White Paper setting out the scheme.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theLord President (CP. (46) 185) covering the report of a committeeappointed by him to consider the policies which should govern theuse and development of our scientific man-power and resourcesduring the next ten years.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Committee&apos;main conclusion was that, unless urgent steps were taken to double the output of science graduates from the universities, there wouldbe a very grave shortage of qualified scientists in this country.They accordingly recommended that the Government should sponsoran ambitious programme of university expansion at the earliestpossible moment. Both the Lord President and he agreed that thisshould be done and they sought the authority of the Cabinet to publish the report, which had been prepared with a view to publi-cation, and to announce in the House of Commons that the Govern-ment were in general agreement with its conclusions, which wouldinvolve a substantial liability on the Exchequer, and commendedthem to the immediate and serious consideration of the universitieswith a view to the formulation of detailed proposals for expanding the facilities for the training of scientists, in consultation with theUniversity Grants Committee. Most of the additional facilities would have to be provided in the provincial universities and itwould be for the universities themselves to work out details with the guidance of the University Grants Committee, the membership ofwhich had recently been strengthened.The following points were made in discussion : (a) The Minister of Education hoped that in working out theproposals in the report, as well as in other matters concerning the universities, the Ministry of Education would be brought more fully into consultation than had been customary in the past.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he accepted the viewthat there should be a greater measure of consultation with theMinister of Education on university affairs and proposed to discuss with the Minister of Education how this could best be secured.
(b) The Parliamentary and Financial Secretary, Admiralty,suggested, with reference to recommendation (25) on page 25 of theReport, that defence science should rank equally with civil science.It was pointed out, however, that this recommendation related onlyto the reconstruction period during which the priority proposed for civil science appeared to be justified.(c) The Secretary of State fof!Dominion Affairs stressed theimportance of post-graduate work in science.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this point was recognised in paragraph 55 of the Report.The Cabinet Agreed that the report of the Committee on ScientificMan-Power should be published and that a statement should be made on behalf of the Government on the lines proposed in CP. (46) 185.4. The Secretary of State for the Colonies called attention tohis memorandum (CP. (46) 196) reporting the latest developments in connection with the proposed cession of Sarawak to His Majesty.The Cession Rill had come before the Legislative Council of sarawak on the 16th May, when its second reading was carried by18 votes to 16; and the third reading was carried on the 17th Mayby 19 votes to 16. Although the Bill had been carried by the votes of the European members of the Council, the two Members of Parlia-ment who had been sent out to ascertain by independent enquirywhether the proposed cession would be in accordance with the wishes of the inhabitants had telegraphed that the voting fairly repre-sented the view of the Council as constituted. It thus appeared that the Members of Parliament, having sounded public opinion throughout the territory, were content to leave the decision to theCouncil as constituted and did not now question the Council&apos;decision. They did not suggest any suspension of the next stage,in which Rajah Brooke would seek the authority of his supreme council to sign the Instrument of Cession.After consulting the Prime Minister and the Lord Privy Seal,the Secretary of State for the Colonies had therefore given instruc-tions that the proceedings for the cession of the territory shouldtake their course if the Supreme Council, at their meeting that day,authorised the Rajah to cede the territory to His Majesty.In discussion it was pointed out that criticism in this country was likely to be directed to the fact that a majority of the non-European members of the Legislative Council had voted againstthe proposal for cession. The Secretary of State for the colonies said that this criticism might be met partly by explaining that theLegislative Council was so constituted that 50 per cent, of its votingpower was in the hands of members representing only 25 per cent,of the native population, and partly by the independent testimonyof the two Members of Parliament now visiting the territory to theeffect that the voting fairly represented the view of the LegislativeCouncil as constituted.The Cabinet Took note with approval that the acting British Repre-sentative in Sarawak had been authorised to sign the instrument of Cession on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment if the Supreme Council at their meeting that dayauthorised Rajah Brooke to cede the territory to HisMajesty.Sarawak.(previous reference:CM.
