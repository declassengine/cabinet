parliament. 1,   The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the business business in which it was proposed to take in the House of Commons in thethe House of    following week.Commons. The remaining stages of the Trade Disputes and Trade unions bill would be taken on the 1st and 2nd April. It was desirablethat Ministers should make a special point of being available fordivisions throughout those two days.On the 3rd April, on the Navy Estimates, there would be a debate on Naval Recruiting. The Parliamentary Secretary and theCivil Lord of the Admiralty would speak on behalf of the Govern-ment, but the Secretary of State for War was asked to be in attendance during the debate in case points were raised which affected all three Services.On the 4th April there would be a debate on the World, food situation. It was agreed that the Government spokesmen shouldbe the Prime Minister and the Minister of Food. It would probablybe convenient for the Prime Minister to open the debate.Business on the 5th April would include the Report Stage and third Reading of the Patents and Designs Bill. The Solicitor-General should be in attendance during this debate in case legalpoints were raised.India.Proceedingsof cabinet mission.(previous reference erence:CM. (46) 25thConclusions,Minute 13.)2. The Prime Minister said that he had been considering what arrangements should be made to keep his colleagues in touch withthe proceedings of the Cabinet Mission to India.Major questions of principle must, of course, be considered bythe Cabinet as a whole, but it would be convenient to entrust to a smaller body the task of following in detail the day-to-day progressof the work of the Mission. He proposed that this task should beassumed by the India and Burma Committee, strengthened for thispurpose by the addition of the Lord President, the Foreign Secretary,the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and the parliamentary under-Secretary of State for India.Telegrams to and from the Mission on matters of general interest would be circulated to all members of the Cabinet. Therewould, however, be many matters of detail with which the cabinet as a whole need not be concerned; and there might also be delicatestages in the negotiations at which detailed information about theexchanges between the two sides would be best kept for the timebeing within a narrower circle. He therefore proposed that tele-grams in this second category should be circulated only to themembers of the enlarged India and Burma Committee.The Prime Minister added that he would supplement these arrangements by letting the Cabinet have at intervals his personalimpressions on the development of the discussions.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the arrangements proposedby the Prime Minister for keeping the Cabinet in touchwith the proceeedings of the Mission to India.Sarawak.(previous reference:CM. (45) 52ndConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for the Colonies (CP. (46) 118) regarding the future of sarawak.The Secretary of State for the Colonies recalled that at their meeting on the 13th November, 1945, the Cabinet had decided inprinciple that Rajah Brooke&apos;s offer to cede Sarawak to His majesty should be accepted if he first obtained the consent of his Councillorsin the territory.[31633-4]The Rajah had sent an emissary tohold2pre-
liminary consultations with his Councillors and thereafter had madea definite proposal for cession in January. The Secretary of state had, however, been advised that further formal decisions shouldbe taken by the Council in Sarawak in order that the cession, mia^tbe made in proper legal and constitutional form. There had alsobeen pressure in Parliament that the Government should satisfy themselves by independent enquiry that the cession would be inaccordance with the wishes of the people of Sarawak; and arrange-ments had been made, with the Prime Minister&apos;s approval, for two members of Parliament to go to Sarawak to undertake such an enquiry. The Rajah had accepted the need for these additional measures; but a further difficulty had now arisen about the positionof the Rajah&apos;3 brother, the Tuan Muda, who had rights of succes-sion under the wills of previous Rajahs. The Law Officers had advised that it would be necessary for the Council in Sarawak topass a law setting aside the wills of the two previous Rajahs, barringthe rights of succession under them and authorising the cession ofthe territory by the Rajah in Council. The Tuan Muda was willincto accept the decision of the Council on the question of cession&quot;provided that he was allowed to attend their proceedings in person and to state his case to them. The Rajah was, however, unwilling to allow this, as he thought it undignified to ventilate in the Councilwhat he regarded as a family quarrel. The Secretary of Statethought it inexpedient to press the Rajah to allow his brother togo to Sarawak to put before the Council in person his objections tothe cession of the territory. He feared that, if this point were pressed, the Rajah might withdraw his offer to cede the territory.In discussion the view was expressed that, as it was proposedto set aside the rights of succession of the Tuan Muda, it wouldbe somewhat high-handed to refuse to allow him to state his case before the Council. Though Rajah Brooke was the present rulerof Sarawak, the territory was at present under British military administration; and His Majesty&apos;s Government could not avoidsharing the responsibility for preventing the Tuan Mucla from pro-ceeding to Sarawak to put his objections before the Council. Ina matter of this kind it was necessary, not only that justice shouldbe done, but that it should be seen to be done; and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should not be a party to any arrangement by which thelegal claims of the Tuan Muda wmrld be brushed aside without proper consideration by the Council,The Foreign Secretary added that in present circumstances itwould be specially inexpedient to appear to have neglected any ofthe proper legal forms connected with the transfer of territory.In view of current events in Persia, it would be very dangerousfor us to invite controversy over an agreement made with the Rajah,while he was in this country, for the cession of territory now under british military administration. It would be embarrassing to us if this matter were brought before the Security Council and it wereargued there we had taken over the territory without ensuring thatthe Tuan Mucla had been given an opportunity to present to theappropriate constitutional body his objections to the cession.The Law Officers had also recommended that the Treaty ofCession should be made subject to ratification by Parliament. while there was at present no rule of law or constitutional practice which necessitated such a course, they suggested that it would be expedient to establish a practice of submitting for ratification by Parliamentall treaties involving transfer of territory to, as well as from, theCrown. The Secretary of State pointed out in his memorandum that this recommendation raised wider political issues and wasrelated to the general question of Parliamentary control overColonial Constitutions, which was due to be fully explored in con-sultation with the various Departments concerned. He advised thatthe proposed cession of Sarawak should not be delayed until this fullstudy of the wider issue had been completed; and he thereforeinvited the Cabinet to agree that this Treaty in respect of Sarawakshould not be submitted to Parliament for ratification.
In a short preliminary discussion, the view was expressed thatthere would be political disadvantages in adopting the suggestionput forward by the Law Officers.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord Chancellor to review, in the light of the cabinets discussion, the legal aspects of the questions raised in paragraphs 5 and 6 of CP. (46) 118, and to sub-mit his recommendations for consideration at the Cabinet&apos;smeeting on the 1st April.Building- 4.   The Minister of Health drew the Cabinets attention to theBrick danger that the housing programme would be delayed in the summerProduction. months by a shortage of bricks. A memorandum which he had circulated on this subject (CP. (46) 103) had been considered ata meeting under the Prime Ministers chairmanship on the13th March (H.G. (46) 3rd Meeting) when it had been agreed thatall brick makers in the Forces should be offered release with theusual Class A benefits. But at the meeting of the Man-Power Com-mittee on the 15th March (M.P. (46) 5th. Meeting, Minute 2) ithad been decided that there were insuperable objections to thisscheme and a committee of officials had been appointed to explorealternative means of providing the brick makers required. TheForeign Secretary had now submitted to the Prime Minister therecommendations of this committee, the essence of which was thata fresh offer of release in Class B should be made to brick makers,and that men who refused such release should be told that unless they had strong objections they would be posted to work in brick-works for a stated period, in uniform and on service pay. It wasnot, however, proposed to apply any compulsion and on this account the proposals seemed to him to be inadequate. The Foreign secretary had also suggested that bricks might be imported from Belgium.This possibility was already being explored.The Foreign Secretary said that to release brick makers out ofturn with Class A benefits would be regarded as a breach of themain principles of the demobilisation scheme, and would also leadto a demand for Class A benefits from all men previously released in Class B. As regards the objections raised by the Minister ofHealth to the alternative proposals, it had always been his view thatit would be highly dangerous to attempt to apply military penaltiesto Servicemen who refused to undertake civilian work, and this hadnot in fact been attempted even during the war. He had suggested the importation of bricks from Belgium as a means of dealing withthe immediate situation, since it would be some time before theeffect of releasing brick makers from the Forces would be reflected in increased brick production. If the Departments concerned would work out proposals for importing bricks from Belgium, he wouldbe willing to take the matter up with the Belgian Government.The Minister of Works said that brick production was no longerbeing held up through difficulties in securing the release of brick-works from Government requisition. The main difficulty now wasthe shortage of skilled labour. The total numbers employed at thebeginning of March amounted to 21,000, whereas 58,000 workers would be required to secure an adequate production. A numberof the skilled brick makers whose release from the Forces had been applied for as far back as November 1945 had not yet been released.When he had accepted the alternative proposals made at the meetingof the Man-Power Committee on the 15th March, he had under-stood that they would be more effective than the original suggestion of release with Class A benefits. If, however, any man who hadobjections to being posted for work in brickworks in uniform wasto be allowed to refuse, the scheme would in his view be ineffective.
Other points in discussion were : (a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would raiseno objection on financial grounds to a scheme for importing Belgiaabricks to remedy the shortage during the next few months.(b) The Foreign Secretary suggested that special steps shouldbe taken to ensure that no difficulties arose in connection with thetransport of bricks. Thus, it might be desirable for the Ministry ofSupply to have a reserve of lorries which could be brought into usein an emergency, and the Ministry of War Transport might consider with the Admiralty whether it would be possible to use tank-landing craft for the conveyance of bricks from Belgium.(c) The Minister of Fuel and Power said that to avoid any holdup of brick production through shortage of fuel he should be givenearly estimates of the amount of coal required for brickworks duringthe rest of the year.After further discussion, The Foreign Secretary suggested thatthe proposals for the release of brick makers which he had submittedto the Prime Minister should be revised so as to lay less stress onthe fact that the posting of Servicemen to work in brickworks fora stated period in uniform would in the last resort depend on the willingness of the men to accept transfer. Thus, though it wouldhave to be made clear that refusal to accept transfer would not beregarded as a refusal of military duty, the assumption should bethat the men would go to the work to which they were posted. Itshould also be understood that the Services must immediately renew the offer of Class B release to all brick makers in the Forces and do their utmost to ensure that all skilled brick makers were in fact madeavailable for brick production at the earliest possible date whetherby release in Class B or by posting to brickworks to work in uniform.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to revise, on the lines whichhe had suggested, his proposals for making skilled men available from the Forces for brick production.(2) Took note that the Minister of Health was investigating,in consultation with the other Ministers concerned, thepossibility of importing bricks from Belgium; and agreed that, if it appeared to be possible to meet some part of the expected demand for bricks in this way, theForeign Secretary should invoke the good offices of theBelgian Government.(3) Took note that other measures to improve the production ofbricks, including any necessary plans to ensure that therewas no breakdown in the arrangements for the transportof bricks, would be considered at the meeting on housingwhich was to be held under the chairmanship of thePrime Minister later in the day.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,28th March, 1946.
