2. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Lord President(CP. (46) 177) and the Minister of Supply (CP. (46) 178) aboutthe handling of the Parliamentary discussion of the governments proposals regarding the future of the iron and steel industry.In discussion of the Lord Presidents memorandum it wasagreed that the Government should find Parliamentary time fora single day&apos;s debate on their proposals, and that this debate shouldbe taken on a Government motion in the following terms : &quot; That this House approves the decision of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to submit to Parliament proposals for transferringto the ownership of the nation appropriate sections of the ironand steel industry with a view to its efficient organisation in the public interest.&quot;Discussion of the memorandum by the Minister of Supplyturned on the question whether the Government should publish a written justification of their proposals in advance of the debate.The Minister of Supply had already undertaken to publish thereports submitted to him by the Iron and Steel Federation andby the Joint Iron Council; and in his memorandum he proposedto preface these reports with a short memorandum explaining theGovernments policy.The Minister of Supply said that he had favoured the issueof an explanatory memorandum, on the lines of the draft annexed to CP. (46) 178, in order to put it on record (i) that there hadalready been numerous enquiries into the iron and steel industry;(ii) that the line separating those parts of the industry which shouldbe taken into public ownership from those which should beleft to private enterprise could not be drawn without detailed examination of&apos; the industry, firm by firm; (iii) that the indusrty was no longer composed of independent units of private enterprise,but was under the control of a strong centralised trade associationwhich exercised a dominating influence on its policy and pricestructure; and (iv) that the Governments decision was firmly basedon commercial and economic considerations.8-7] b 21. The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the business which it was proposed to take in the House of Commons in thefollowing week.On the 6th May the Lord President would move the SecondReading of the Civil Aviation Bill. The Parliamentary Secretary,Ministry of Civil Aviation, would reply to the debate.The Secretary of State for Scotland asked that the lord president should include in his speech a statement designed to allay the anxiety which was felt in Scotland about the future use ofPrestwick Airport. He had already forwarded a draft of sucha statement to the Minister of Civil Aviation. The Lord Presidentundertook to bear this point in mind.The remaining stages of the Borrowing (Control and Guaran-tees) Bill would be taken on the 7th May. It was agreed that theHouse could, if necessary, sit late to complete this business : any demand by the Opposition for a further day for this Bill shouldbe resisted.On the 8th May the Minister of Town and Country Planningwould move the Second Reading of the New Towns Bill. his parliamentary Secretary would reply to the debate. The Secretaryof State for Scotland could intervene, if necessary, to reply to scottish points.The remaining stages of the Housing (Financial Provisions)(Scotland) Bill would be taken on the 9th May.On the 10th May there would be a debate, in Committee ofSupply, on the Control Office for Germany and Austria. TheChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster would speak on behalf ofthe Government; and a Ministerial representative of the ForeignOffice should be in attendance.
As against this, it was urged in discussion chat the choicelay between publishing the reports of the industry, without comment,and issuing a White Paper which contained a full and convincingstatement of the Governments oase The short draft annexed to cp. (46) 178 would secure the advantages of neither of these courses.The Cabinets conclusion was that the preferable course wouldbe to publish at this stage only the reports of the industry and to reserve for the debate in the House of Commons the full statementof the Governments case. Meanwhile, the Committee on the socialisation of Industries should consider how the Governmentscase could best be presented in the debate; and should, in particular,determine what should be said in the debate about the line of Idemarcation between those parts of the industry which were to be taken  into public ownership and those which were to be left to private enterprise. It was also desirable that special steps shouldbe taken to see that the issues raised by the reports of the industry were properly presented to the public; in particular, it was impor-tant that the public should recognise that the report of the Ironand Steel Federation dealt only with the technical requirements for the reconstruction of the industry and offered no solution ofthe problem of providing the finance required to carry through this large scheme of reconstruction.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord President to announce, in his statement Ion Business in the House of Commons later that day,that the Government would find time for a single day&apos;debate on a Government motion about the future ofthe iron and steel industry.(2) Agreed that no written explanation of the governments proposals should be given to Parliament in advance ofthe debate; but authorised the Minister of Supply toproceed forthwith to present to Parliament a white paper embodying without comment on the Government&apos;?proposals, the reports submitted by the Iron and steel federation and the Joint Iron Council.(3) Invited the Lord President to arrange for the Committeeon the Socialisation of Industries to consider how theGovernments proposals could best be presented toParliament in the debate; and, in particular, what shouldbe said in the debate about the line of demarcationbetween those parts of the industry which were to betaken into public ownership and those which were tobe left to private enterprise.(4) Invited the Lord President to arrange for suitable guidance to be given to the Press on the publication of the white paper referred to in Conclusion (2) above.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Food (CP. (46) 182) setting out the. prospects for supplies of wheat and flour to the United Kingdom during thenext few months. This showed that on the most optimistic assump-tions stocks at the end of September would be 620,000 tons of wheat and 305,000 tons of flour. On a pessimistic view, there might beno stocks of wheat and only 255,000 tons of flour. In these circum-stances the Minister recommended the following further economies in consumption : (i) the extraction rate to be increased to 90 per cent;(ii) the output of biscuits and similar products to be reducedby 25 per cent.;(iii) the allocation of fat and sugar for the manufacture ofcakes and flour confectionery to be reduced by 12-1 percent, with a view to securing that less flour was usedfor making cakes.World food supplies.UnitedKingdomWheat andFlourPosition.(previous reference:CM. (46) 47thConclusions,Minute 2.)
The Cabinet also had before them a joint memorandum by theMinister of Agriculture and the Secretary of State for Scotland(CP. (46) 184) urging that the extraction rate should not beincreased in view of the consequent loss of animal feeding-stuffs;and a further memorandum by the Minister of Food (CP. (46) 183)covering letters from the United States Secretary for Agricultureand the United Kingdom representative on the Combined food board.The Minister of Food said that during the critical months ofthe summer we should be dependent on the United States for some part of the wheat requirements of the United Kingdom and othercountries in the London Food Council area and for all the require-ments of the British Zone in Germany. The United StatesGovernment had given us firm undertakings in respect of part ofour requirements, but there was a large element of faith about these undertakings and it was difficult to be sure that they would be fulfilled. As an instance of the difficulty of the position, he saidthat according to a preliminary estimate United States shipmentsduring May would be only 720,000 tons, after allowing for certainquantities carried forward from April. The United States had proposed that practically none of this should go to areas of UnitedKingdom responsibility. Moreover, this low shipment in Maymeant that, in order to live up to their original estimate that theywould export 6 million tons in the first six months of the year, theUnited States would have to export 1,400,000 tons in the followingmonth, which would be physically impossible.The Minister of Food said that his more pessimistic figuremight well be exceeded; but, even if in the event the suppliesreceived were mid-way between his best and worst assumptions,we should not at the end of September have an adequate workingstock. There was, therefore, a very strong case for putting intoeffect at once the further economies in consumption which wererecommended in his memorandum.Discussion first turned on the proposal to increase the extraction rate. Arguments in support of this proposal were put forwardpartly on the basis that further consumption economies were required in order to conserve the United Kingdom stock position;and partly on the basis that, in order to ensure adequate suppliesof wheat from the United States for countries for which the UnitedKingdom Government were responsible, it was necessary that weshould do more to match the measures taken to reduce by 25 per cent,the consumption of wheat in the United States. After discussion the Cabinet agreed that the proposal should be considered from the angle of conserving United Kingdom stocks of wheat and flour.The Minister of A gricidture said that stocks were not likelyto fall to the extent suggested by the Minister of Food&apos;s morepessimistic assumption. The Minister of Food had for this purposeput at 155,000 tons the amount of home-produced wheat available during August and September; and he himself saw every reasonto suppose that this would be of the order of 300,000 tons. Therewere also passages in the letters circulated with CP. (46) 183 which gave grounds for thinking that the prospects were not so bad as hadbeen predicted. The United States, for instance, were nowexpecting a good harvest. In these circumstances was it right totake a step which could not fail to have a most serious effect onfeeding-stuffs and a consequential and lasting effect on supplies of meat, eggs and milk? The proposal had heen rejected by theCabinet in the previous week; had the situation now alteredsufficiently to justify a different view?Ministers appreciated the strength of these arguments. Butthere was general agreement that, even if the worst fears of theMinister of Food were not realised, the outlook for United Kingdomstocks were so unpromising that there were strong arguments forevery possible measure of economy.
In further discussion the suggestion was made that the proposed increase in the extraction rate might be regarded &quot;as a temporary measure for the summer months, and that, if there was a prospectof a return to the 85 per cent, rate in the autumn, it might not benecessary to reduce the rations of animal feeding-stuffs at once; or alternatively, if a reduction in rations was inevitable, that farmerscould maintain their animals during the summer months on a lowerration if they were given the prospect of a return to a higher levelin the autumn. In this connection the Cabinet was informed thatthe monthly rate of consumption of cereal feeding-stuffs was now about 200,000 tons a month. Millers&apos; offals were now coming-forward at the rate of 60-65,000 tons a month, and no oats or barleywere being imported. On present rates, therefore, stocks wouldbe exhausted by about the end of July. An increase in the extraction rate would reduce supplies of millers&apos; offals to about 40,000 tons amonth assuming that the consumption of flour remained at itspresent level.The general view of the Cabinet was that in all the circum-stances the balance of advantage lay on the side of increasing the extraction rate to 90 per cent, as a temporary measure during the summer months.Discussion then turned on the proposals to reduce by 25 percent, the output of biscuits and similar products, and to reduce by12-^ Per cent, the allocation of fat and sugar for the manufactureof cakes and flour confectionery.There was general agreement that economies should be sought in these directions. Some Ministers felt, however, that greaterreductions could be made than those proposed by the Minister ofFood. It was suggested that the output of biscuits might be reducedby 33^ per cent.; and that the allocation of fat and sugar for cakesmight be cut by 25 per cent. After discussion it was agreed thatthe cut in biscuits should be 25 per cent., as proposed; but that thereduction in the allocation of fat and sugar for making cakes and flour confectionery should be increased from 12^ per cent, to 25 percent.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that, as a temporary measure, the extraction ratefor flour should at once be increased to 90 per cent.(2) Invited the Minister of Agriculture and the Secretary ofState for Scotland to make it clear to farmers that theirplanning for livestock should not be based on the assump-tion that this increased rate of extraction and the con-sequent reduction in millers&apos; offals for animal feeding-stuffs would be maintained indefinitely; and agreed thatthe position should be reviewed again before September1946.(3) Agreed that the current production of biscuits and similarproducts should be reduced by 25 per cent.(4) Agreed that the allocation of fat and sugar for the manii-facture of cake and flour confectionery should be reducedby 25 per cent., with a view to securing a reduction inthe consumption of flour and cakes.4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofTransport (CP. (46) 174) proposing increases in the charges of the controlled railways and the London Passenger Transport Board.The Minister of Transport said that the only dhange in rail-way charges during the war had been an increase of 16f per cent,in freight rates and fares made in 1940. From 1941 to 1945 therehad been a steep rise in costs, which now stood at about 70 per cent,over the pre-war level; but the exceptionally heavy Governmenttraffic and passenger-train loadings during the war had produced,in spite of higher costs, not only the  43-5 million payable annuallyto the controlled undertakings under the railways agreement, butalso substantial surpluses which had fallen to the Exchequer.  Since
11G.M. 40 (46).the end of the war, however, receipts had been falling rapidly owing&apos;to the decline in Government traffic and the increase in road trans-port facilities, and it was estimated that for the year 1946 therewould be a deficit of  47-6 million which would fall on theExchequer. Railway charges ought not to be left at an uneconomiclevel wholly out of line with the increased costs, and he had there-fore proposed to the Lord Presidents Committee (L.P. (46) 14thMeeting, Minute 3) that charges should be increased from the1st July, 1946, the means of raising the required additional revenuebeing referred to a consultative committee consisting of the threepermanent members of the Railway Rates Tribunal. Subsequentconsultations with the Departments mainly concerned had led himto the conclusion that, if charges were to be raised from the 1st July,the consultative Committee would not have time to make an adequateenquiry into the matter and he now proposed that the Governmentshould, on their own responsibility, announce a further increase of16f per cent, in railway charges, the effect of which would be tobring these charges up to 33^ per cent, over the pre-war figure.Workmen&apos;s fares and season ticket rates would concurrently bebrought up from 10 per cent to 25 per cent, above the pre-warfigure, and he would explore with the London Passenger transport board the possibility of making a corresponding increase in theirfares. These increases would not go the whole way to wipe outthe estimated deficit, and he therefore suggested that he should ask the consultative committee to undertake a detailed enquiryfor the purposes of a long-term adjustment of charges.The Lord President said that he agreed in principle that therewas a strong case for trying to bring the income and expenditureof the railways into balance before they were brought under nationalownership. The Board of Trade had suggested that, since any earlyincrease in freight charges would impede industrial recovery andthe export driveL the burden should be borne entirely by passenger fares. He himself thought that this would be difficult on political grounds; but, in view of the revenue which had accrued to theExchequer during the war years, might not the immediate increasebe limited to say 10 per cent, instead of 16f- per cent. ?The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he agreed that theremust be some increase in railway charges during 1946, and that itwas important to avoid a situation which would entail an increasein railway charges immediately after nationalisation. On the otherhand, the proposed arrangements for financing the railways afternationalisation were likely to lead to some saving in interest charges and it might not be entirely out of the question for the Governmentto carry some part of a temporary deficit. He had originally thoughtthat the proposed increase might be confined to passenger fares, buthe was now satisfied that there must also be some increase in freight charges. There were, however, strong arguments for avoiding any increase in coal freight charges.Other points in discussion were :  (a) The Minister of Health said that any increase in freight charges for building materials would give a further impetus to the already alarming increase in building costs. The price increases which had already taken place in such materials as steel, lead, cast-iron goods and bricks had already endangered the subsidy rates,and further increases due to higher freight charges would frustrate the attempts which he was making to redress the position.(b) The Minister of Food said that increased freight charges would involve new price margins for food traders and would resultin an increase in the cost of living unless the Chancellor of theExchequer was prepared to increase the food subsidies.(c) The Minister of Fuel and Power said that, if the higherfreights were charged on coal, there would be an average increaseof Is. 3d. a ton in the price of rail-borne coal, or lQd. a ton on allcoal, including sea-borne coal.   Moreover, in the London area the
price of domestic coal would rise by 2s. Qd. a ton. The increasein the price of coal would put up the cost of living index figure by-25. The higher freight charges on other commodities would nodoubt result in further increases in the figure; and if it reached 205there would have to be a consequential increase in miners&apos; wages,which would start a further cycle of increased costs. While he couldnot object to the proposals of the Minister of Transport, he thoughtit right to bring these considerations to the notice of the Cabinet.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed in principle that some increase in railway charges,including freight charges, should be made as soon aspossible in order to reduce the estimated deficit on rail-way working in 1946.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerof Transport to consider, in the light of the points raised in discussion, what should be the amount and the incidence of the increase and to submit revised proposals to the Cabinet.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,2nd May, 1946.
