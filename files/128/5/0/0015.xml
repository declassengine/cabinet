1. The Lord President said that it had been assumed hithertoin that the debate that day on World Food Supplies would be openedof by a Government speaker. The Opposition had now indicated,however, that they claimed the right to open, as they had asked forthe debate and sought an opportunity to criticise the Governmentsadministration. The precedents supported this claim and he under-stood that, if the Speaker had to settle the issue, he would probablydecide it in favour of the Opposition. It would, of course, have been preferable that the statement by the Minister of Food should nothave to follow an Opposition speech.The Cabinet- -Agreed that the precedents supported the claim made bythe Opposition, and that it would be inexpedient to seek to resist this claim.The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the business Avhichit was proposed to take in the House of Commons during thefollowing week :  The Report Stage of the National Insurance (industrial injuries) Bill would be taken on the 18th and 19th February. TheMinister of National Insurance and his Parliamentary secretary would handle these debates.On the 20th and 21st February a debate on Foreign affairs would take place on the Adjournment. It was proposed that thereshould be a general debate until 6-30 p.m. on the 21st February,and that the remainder of the time up to 10 -15 p.m. should be allocated to a discussion on Palestine. The Prime Minister would decide, in consultation with the Foreign Secretary and the lord president, who should speak on behalf of the Government in this debate.The Third Reading of the National Insurance (industrial injuries) Bill would be taken on the 22nd February.Lords. 2. At their meeting on the 15th January the Cabinet had of invited the Prime Minister to ascertain His Majesty&apos;s wishes-s, regarding a Motion which Viscount Cecil of Chelwood wished to of have discussed in the House of Lords about (i) the creation of life and Peers; (ii) the admission of women to the House of Lords; and (iii)the representation of Government Departments in the House ofLords.The Prime Minister said that he had communicated to TheKing  the  general  sense  of  the   Cabinets   discussion  on  the15th January; and His Majesty had indicated that he would prefer that no action should be taken at the present time on any of the5th    three proposals put forward in Lord CecLTs Motion.The Secretary of State for Dominion A fairs said that, althoughthe Motion proposed that &apos;&apos; women should be eligible to be madePeers on the same terms as men,&quot; Lord Cecil was mainly concernedwith the more limited proposal that women who were Peeresses intheir own right should be enabled to take their seats in the Houseof Lords, and he might confine his argument to this limited proposal.In discussion, there was general agreement that, if the limitedproposal were found to command substantial support in the Houseof Lords, it would be difficult for the Government to avoid adopting a sympathetic attitude towards it though legislation would berequired even for this limited purpose, and no indication could begiven of the stage at which the Government might find room for such legislation in their programme for this Parliament.After further discussion, the Cabinet (1) Took note that the Secretary of State for Dominion affairs would ascertain from Lord Cecil whether he had not31507-3]

The Prime Minister said that in recent weeks there hadHospitality. necessarily been a considerable amount of Government entertainingin honour of the Delegates attending the First General Assembly ofthe United Nations Organisation. He hoped, therefore, that all ministers would do their best to reduce to a minimum the amountof Government hospitality offered during the next month or so.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of the Prime Ministers statement.Select 4.   The  Cabinet considered  a memorandum by the LordCommittee      President (CP. (46) 46) about the publication of the secret reports of on National     the Select Committee on National Expenditure.Expenditure. It was explained in the memorandum that, where considerationsPublication of national security had precluded the publishing of recom-of Secret mendations or of the arguments on which they were based, theEeports. Select Committee had had power to submit a secret report tothe Prime Minister for consideration by the War Cabinet; and tensuch secret reports had in fact been submitted. A Motion had been tabled in the House of Commons in October 1945 by Mr. ClementDavies, M.P., and Mr. R. R. Stokes, M.P., asking that all thesesecret reports should now be published. It was known, however, thatthe object of the Motion was to secure the publication of the reportof the 9th March, 1944, on tank production; and it was suggestedin the memorandum that the question for decision by the cabinet was whether that particular report should be published. Aftersummarising the arguments for and against publication, thememorandum recommended the publication of this particular report,together with the reply which had been sent to it on behalf of the coalition Government.In discussion of this proposal differing views were expressed.In favour of publication the following arguments wereadvanced : -(a) Considerations of national security had prevented publica-tion during the war, but there was no security objection to publication now that the war was over. The lifting of the banon disclosure of proceedings in Secret Session was a further argument in favour of publishing this report on a subject whichhad frequently been discussed in Secret Session.(5) It was in the public interest that criticisms made by a responsible body against the Government of the day should be made known to the public. Neither Ministers nor officials nor seniormilitary officers should be led to think that they could be permanently protected from public discussion of their short-comings.(c) Our record in tank production during the war had notbeen satisfactory. Those who had criticised the Governmentsperformance at the time were entitled to have published now thefacts which would enable them to substantiate their charges.Publication of the facts was equally desirable from the point ofview of preventing similar mistakes in any future war.(d) It was suggested in the memorandum that Mr. Churchillmight be given an opportunity of adding to the reply which the coalition Government had made at the time to this report by theSelect Committee. Mr. Churchill had, however, recently sold for publication in an American newspaper one of the speeches which
he had. made in Secret Session. He had done this without con-sultation with the present Government; and some Ministers feltthat, on this account, he was not entitled to special consideration as regards the publication of this report.(e) The Select Committee had been appointed by Parliament;and the disposal of its reports was not a matter which rested inthe discretion of the Government alone. The Government mightbe charged with disregarding the rights of Parliament if it con-tinued to withhold these reports from publication when the considerations of national security which alone had preventedpublication at the time had ceased to be applicable.The main arguments against publication were as follows : (/) These reports were compiled and presented as secretreports, and much of the evidence on which they were based wasgiven in confidence under an assurance of secrecy. publication would be an abuse of this confidence, which might adversely affectthe securing of secret information in any future enquiry of asimilar kind.This objection would apply with even greater force to the publi-cation of the evidence on which the reports were based : that might even affect adversely the relations between Ministers and theirconfidential advisers. The Lord President said, however, that hehad not contemplated the publication of the evidence and believedthat any demand for this could be successfully resisted.(g) These reports were produced specifically for considerationby the War Cabinet, and they had a status analogous to cabinet papers. The constitutional implications of publishing such documents should be carefully considered.(h) Publication of the report of tihe 9th March, 1944, was bound to provoke keen controversy about our war-time tank pro-duction. The report alone would not be sufficient to establish thefacts; and, unless the issue was to remain undetermined, it wouldbe necessary to hold a public enquiry into the whole matter.Experience suggested that such enquiries stirred up much con-troversy and bitterness without securing any great public advantage.And at the present time we could ill afford the time which ministers and senior officials would have to spend in preparing their evidencefor such an enquiry.The Lord President said that he had hoped to be able to resistsuccessfully any demand for a public enquiry.(i) It would not be possible in practice to confine publicationto the report of the 9th March, 1944, on tank production. Thoughthe Members who had tabled the Motion were interested only inthat report, other Members would doubtless press for the publica-tion of other reports; and, if one were published, the publicationof the others could not be refused.(;&apos;) In the controversy which would follow the publication of thisreport, criticism of our war-time tank production would be directednot only against Mr. Churchill, but against the Coalition Govern-ment as a whole. Ministers who had been Members of the coalition government might find it necessary to defend themselves againstcriticism; and the resulting situation might be politically embarrassing-rassing for the present Government.(k) This was not an appropriate moment at which to invitecontroversy on this subject.. The Government already had enoughto do in meeting current problems and carrying out their ownprogramme, without going out of their way to involve themselvesin this controversy. And the attention of the public should bedirected now to the problems of the present and the future ratherthan to the mistakes of the past.Moreover, publication during the next month or so might haveundesirable repercussions in the United States on the forthcoming discussions of the proposed Loan Agreement; for it might be argued that it was the shortcomings of our own tank production which had made it necessary for us to obtain such substantial numbers of tanks on Lend-Lease from the United States.
Disposal ofthe german fleet.(previous reference:CM. (45) 14thConclusions,Minute 1.)(t) Mr. Churchill, as Head of the Government to which thereport had been presented, should be consulted before it was published; and it would in any event be undesirable to proceed withpublication until he had returned to this country.After a full discussion, the Cabinet 5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the First Lordof t the Admiralty (CP. (46) 49) covering the report of the tripartite Naval Commission appointed by the Berlin conference to advise on the allocation of the German fleet and to handle otherdetailed matters arising out of the naval clauses of the Protocol.The First Lord of the Admiralty siaid that Annex A to cp. (46) 49 contained the report of the proceedings of the Corn-mission and their recommendations, while Annex B gave a detailedsummary of the allocations made by the Commission and acceptedby the Admiralty. The recommendations of the Commission were generally acceptable, subject to a number of reservations, detailsof which were given in Annex D. In paragraph 6 (i) of his memorandum he had proposed that, while we should formallyassociate ourselves with the proposed joint request to France to destroy inoperable German warships, we should not be under any obligation to press this request in the face of any reasonableFrench objection. He had since learned, however, that theGovernments of both the United States and the Soviet union had already decided to act independently in this matter and thatthe United States Government were unlikely to make the request to France. Accordingly, the point made in paragraph 6 (i) nolonger arose.There had been difficulty in reaching agreement on the alloca-tion of harbour vessels and floating harbour equipment, includingfloating docks, and he proposed that the allocation of such vessels and equipment should be subject to the reservations set out inparagraphs 2 and 3 of Annex E) to CP. (46) 49.He hoped that it would be agreed that the formal acceptancewhich he proposed could now be communicated to the United Statesand Soviet Governments, since there was evidence that the SovietGovernment were likely to make a number of unacceptable requestsif the conclusion of the agreement were further delayed.In discussion, the following points were made :  (a) The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries asked whetherthe trawlers mentioned in Annex B of the memorandum were engaged in fishing for Germany at the present time.The First Lord of the Admiralty said he understood that mostof these trawlers were so engaged. He hoped that the K.F.K. shipsmentioned in Annex B might form a useful addition to the british fishing fleet.(b) The Minister of Fuel and Power pointed out that only onetanker had been allocated to the United Kingdom as against sevento the Soviet Union and three to the United States.The First Lord of the Admiralty explained that most of thetankers allocated to the United States and the Soviet Union werenot large ocean-going vessels and that the Minister of War Trans-port was satisfied that by obtaining the fast tanker Nordmark in exhange for a number of landing craft we had made a good bargain.(c) The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster suggested thatthe wording of paragraph 3 of Annex D to CP. (46) 49 should provide specifically for permanent retention of the floating docksrequired for voyage repairs to ships of other nations and for temporary retention of the floating docks required for repairs toallocated ships. The text might be settled between the admiralty and the Control Office.
The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the Control office had already been consulted on this point, and he was satisfied thatthe present wording of paragraph 3 sufficiently covered the pointmade by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. The Ministerof War Transport endorsed this view.The Cabinet Agreed that the Governments of the Soviet Union and theUnited States should be informed forthwith that HisMajesty&apos;s Government accepted the report of the TripartiteNaval Commission, subject to the reservations noted in annex D to CP. (46) 49.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Labour (CP. (46) 38) on the supply and allocation ofGerman prisoners of war.The Minister of Labour said (in correction of the figures givenin paragraph 2 of his memorandum) that, in addition to the 197,000German prisoners already in this country, it was estimated that about 118,000 could be brought from Canada and the United States-23,000 in February, 47,000 in March and 48,000 in April. There-after, further numbers could be brought from Germany. In para-graph 3 of his memorandum he had referred to the possibility of bringing 20,000 from Norway. It would not, however, be possibleto provide transport for them before May. Meanwhile, theNorwegian Government were pressing to be relieved of the burdenof these prisoners at the earliest possible moment; and, as additionalprisoners from the British Zone of Germany could be brought tothis country in their place, he agreed with the Foreign Office viewthat negotiations should now proceed for the return to germany of the German prisoners in Norway.The Minister proposed that the task of allocating prisoners ofwar to different employments should continue to be discharged bythe Inter-Departmental Committee on the Employment of Prisonersof War and that the Committee should be asked to give highest priority to (i) work directly or indirectly furthering the housing pro-gramme ;(ii) urgent work in connection with this year&apos;s harvest andseasonal food processing; and(iii) the clearance of stores.In accordance with the suggestion made at the Cabinet meeting onthe 20th December he had considered whether any change should bemade in the constitution of the Committee, but he had come to theconclusion that the existing arrangements should stand since it was always possible for the Committee to bring into consultation, as required, the Departments concerned with the movement of prisonersof war to this country and their accommodation pending allocation.Points in discussion were : (a) The Secretary of State for Air pointed out that an earlier memorandum by the Minister of Labour (CP. (45) 305) had mentioned the employment of prisoners of war by the service departments on work (including the removal of Defence works)which otherwise would have to be done by members of the Forces.He hoped that the Ministers present proposals did not mean thatit would no longer be possible to employ prisoners of war for these purposes.The Minister of Labour said that the employment of prisonerson such work was not excluded.(b) The Minister of Agricultv,re and Fisheries said that, inview of the new campaign for increased food production in this
country, the maximum number of prisoners of war should be allocated to agriculture.(c) The Secretary of State for Scotland drew attention to thestatement^ in paragraph 6 of CP. (46) 38 that no special priority should be given to demands for German prisoners to replace italian prisoners withdrawn under the repatriation programme. He would shortly lose a considerable number of Italian prisoners now employedin agriculture in Scotland, and he urged that special priority shouldbe given to the replacement of Italian prisoners withdrawn from agriculture. He also suggested that the Minister of Works shouldbe obliged to provide accommodation for prisoners allocated to agriculture, where existing accommodation was not available.The view of the Cabinet was that, while all possible steps shouldbe taken to make available an adequate supply of prisoners to meetthe needs of Scottish agriculture, special priority on the lines suggested by the Secretary of State for Scotland could not be given.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that up to 118,000 German prisoners of war shouldbe brought to this country from Canada and the UnitedStates up to the end of April, and up to 185,000 should bebrought from Germany as transport and accommodationpermitted.(2) Agreed that the Inter-Departmental Committee on Employ-ment of Prisoners of War should proceed forthwith toarrange for the allocation of prisoners of war in 1946on the lines set out in paragraphs 5 and 6 of CP. (46) 38.Man-Power. 7.   In connection with the discussion recorded in the precedingEmployment Minute the Prime Minister suggested that further considerationof Foreign should be given to the possibility of using foreign labour to relieveLabour. the acute shortage of man-power in certain essential industries.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he was alreadyinvestigating the possibility of employing in coalmining membersof the Polish Forces now in this country. It would be necessaryto ascertain how far they were willing to engage in the work and suitable for it; and he would also have to find out to what extent the National Union of Mineworkers would be willing to agree tothe employment of Poles in the mines. It was unlikely that any verylarge numbers could be so employed.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he attached thegreatest importance to terminating as soon as possible the heavyfinancial liability involved in maintaining the Polish Forces andhe strongly supported the view that any Poles who did not returnto their own country should be used to mitigate the man-powershortage in the United Kingdom.The Secretary of State for War pointed out that members ofthe Polish Forces would shortly be asked to decide whether theywere willing to return to Poland. It would be undesirable to make,meanwhile, any such general offer of employment in this country as would reduce the numbers electing to return to Poland.The Home Secretary said that many members of Allied forces were anxious to settle in this country, and that in offering temporaryemployment care would have to be taken to avoid conceding any right to permanent settlement in this country.In further discussion there was general support for the viewthat the possibility of making temporary use of foreign labour to relieve the present man-power shortage should be explored as amatter of urgency.
117 CM. 15 (46).- 70The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Prime Minister to appoint a Committee ofMinisters to examine, in the light of the existing man-power shortage, the possibility of making increased useof foreign labour, particularly in essential industries which were now finding special difficulty in recruitinglabour;(2) Took note that the Minister of Fuel and Power would continue meanwhile his enquiries irfto the possibility of employing members of the Polish Forces in the coal-mining industry.8. At their meeting on the 1st November, 1945, the cabinet had agreed that official Victory Celebrations should be held in 1946,and the Prime Minister had appointed a Committee of ministers to formulate plans and to supervise the working out of detailed arrangements by Committees of officials.The Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (46) 57) containing the recommendations of the ministerial Committee and annexing a detailed report by aCommittee of officials.Discussion first turned on the proposal that the celebrationsshould be held on Whit Saturday, the 8th June.The Chancellor of the Exchequer reminded the Cabinet thatthe Labour Party Conference was to open, in Bournemouth, onMonday, the 10th June. If the Victory Celebrations were held onthe Saturday, members of the Executive would find difficulty intransacting their preliminary business before the opening of theConference; and Members of Parliament and other members ofthe Party might find it difficult to be present at the opening ofthe Conference because of local obligations during the week-endof the celebrations.On the other hand, it was felt that, if the celebrations were tobe held on a working day at all, there were strong arguments forchoosing the day before the normal Whitsun holiday, as this wouldinvolve much less disturbance with production than any other date.It should not be impossible to arrange the business for the LabourParty Conference so that the celebrations on the Saturday wouldnot in practice interfere materially with the opening of theConference on the Monday.The possibility of holding the celebrations on a Sunday wasalso discussed. While the parades could be associated with churchservices, it was recognised that strong objections would be raised,by certain sections of public opinion and in certain parts of thecountry, to holding the entertainments on a Sunday. It was thegeneral view of the Cabinet that the celebrations should be heldon a week-day.The Cabinet were informed that it would be more convenient for the Government of India if the celebrations could be postponed until later in the year. Postponement would, however, bring thedate near to the holiday season and would also have the result thata much smaller proportion of the troops taking part in the paradeswould be men who had seen active service during the war.The Cabinet&apos;s conclusion was that the best date for thecelebrations would be that proposed by the Committee, namelySaturday, the 8th June.Other points in discussion were : -(a) Ethiopia should be represented in the Victory March along with the belligerent Allies. Consideration would be given to thesuggestion that Egypt and Iraq should also be represented.(6) Allied nationals who had served in the R.A.F. should beincluded in the R.A.F. contingent in the parade;   but it was preferable that they should not appear as separate parties.(c) The Indian contingent would not exceed a thousand.[31507-3] cYietoryCelebrations.(previous reference erence:CM. (45) 48thConclusions,Minute 4.)
(d) The services,of the General Post Office should be included among the civilian services represented in the parade. The CivilService generally might perhaps be represented by a Home Guardcontingent.The Home Secretary said that his Committee would be glad to consider any further suggestions for the. inclusion in the paradeof representatives of other aspects of the national effort duringthe war.(e) The Committee would consider the most appropriate meansof associating with the parade Mr. Churchill and other members ofthe war-time Governments.(/) It was desirable that entertainments should be held in otherparks in London besides the four Royal Parks. This point wouldbe covered in the advice which was to be given to local authorities.The Cabinet -Invited the Home Secretary, after taking into account thevarious points made in discussion, to submit to HisMajesty the proposal that victory celebrations should beheld on Whit Saturday, the 8th June, on the lines proposedin CP. (46) 57.Commemora- 9.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thetive Postage    Postmaster-General  (CP. (46) 43) proposing the issue of corn-Stamp, memorative postage stamps in connection with the proposed VictoryCelebrations.The Postmaster-General said that it had become the practice to make special issues of postage stamps to celebrate major events in the history of the country and he thought it would be generally agreed that there should be such an issue to celebrate the victory.He contemplated that special issues of the 2\d. and 2d. stampsshould be on sale for about two months. He proposed to submit forHis Majesty&apos;s pleasure that the emphasis in the design should beon peace and reconstruction rather than on military victory. Thesuggestion had been made that one of the stamps should be of anon-traditional type, omitting The King&apos;s head; and he would beglad of the Cabinet&apos;s guidance on this suggestion.The Cabinet welcomed the proposed commemorative issue ofstamps. It was their view that the design for both denominationsshould include The King&apos;s head.In discussion, reference was made to a proposal that thereshould be a special issue of postage stamps to commemorate theformation of the United Nations Organisation. In its original formthe proposal had been that there should be a common design agreedupon by all the United Nations. This was not now thought to be practicable. An alternative would be to have a United Kingdomissue, and it was suggested that one of the two victory stamps nowproposed might well make an allusion to the creation of the united nations Organisation. This suggestion was not favoured by theCabinet.The Secretary of State for Scotland asked that, in addition tothe Tine Arts Commission and the Council of Industrial Design, theFine Arts Commission for Scotland should also be consultedregarding the designs of the new issues.   This was agreed to.The Cabinet (1) Approved the issue of special commemorative stamps of the2\d. and 3rf. denominations in connection with the pro-posed Victory Celebrations.(2) Expressed the view that the design for both denominationsshould include The King&apos;s head.
Clothes 10.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the PresidentRationing.       jf the Board of Trade (CP. (46) 55) setting out his proposalsfor increasing the clothing ration.The President of the Board of Trade said he must shortlyannounce the ration proposed for the next period beginning onthe 1st May. He proposed that for the four months from the1st May to the 1st September the ration should be raised to a levelof 42 coupons a year, as compared with 36 a year for the currentperiod. For the subsequent six months he hoped to achieve a levelof 52 coupons a year. In addition to special supplements for children and industrial workers, he proposed to make an allowance of coupons to men and women in the Forces to enable them to wearcivilian clothes when on leave.Points in discussion were : (a) The Lord President feared that the announcement of theseproposals, coming on top of fresh food restrictions, might have a depressing effect on the public, and he thought it would be necessaryto give special care to the publicity arrangements.(b) The Prime Minister asked whether special arrangements could not be made for household linen.(c) The President of the Board of Trade said that it would notbe possible to take these articles off the ration : the available supplies would immediately be absorbed by hotels, restaurants, clubs, &amp;c.He was, however, considering whether some arrangement could notbe made for rationing household linen separately from clothing.It was the view of the Cabinet that such an arrangement, byrelieving housewives, would assist greatly in making the continuanceof clothes rationing acceptable to the public.(d) Doubt was expressed about the proposed concession to menand women on leave from the Services.The President of the Board of Trade said that there had been considerable pressure for such a concession in Parliament. It was proposed to use for this purpose between 10 and 15 million coupons,which was less than the equivalent of the addition of one couponto the general ration.On the other hand, the Service Ministers did not think itnecessary to press strongly for the concession; and the general feeling of the Cabinet was that any concession that could be made should now be given to the civil population. The Services had beenvery generously treated in the matter of civilian clothing.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the proposal to issue coupons to men andwomen in the Forces on leave should be abandoned.(2) Subject to (1) above, approved the proposals made by thePresident of the Board of Trade in CP. (46) 55&apos;.United 11.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theNations Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (CP. (46) 59) regardingOrganisation, the policy to be followed in the event of an application by the admission Government of Eire for membership of the United nations of Eire. Organisation.Reference was made to the possibility that, if Eire became amember of the Organisation, she might raise there the question ofthe partition of Ireland.(3) Invited the Postmaster-General to submit for His Majesty1 pleasure that peace and reconstruction rather than military victory should be the main motive of thedesigns.
The Home Secretary said that, before the Cabinet determinedtheir policy in this matter, he would wish to have an opportunity of ascertaining the views of the Government of Northern Ireland.The Cabinet-Agreed to defer consideration of the question raised in cp.
