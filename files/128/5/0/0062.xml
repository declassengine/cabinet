Expenses ofMembers of bodies to beEstablishedunder theNationalHealthService.(previous reference:CM. (46) 44thConclusions,Minute 5.)1. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP. (46) 245) and the Secretary of State forScotland (CP. (46) 248) on the question whether provision should bemade for payment for the loss of remunerative time in attendingmeetings of some of the new bodies to be established under theNational Health Service.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in pursuance of the cabinets decision on the 9th May, a Committee of officials had beenappointed to consider this question and their report was annexed to CP. (46) 245. They recommended that the principle of compensa-tion for loss of remunerative time in attending the meetings of these bodies should be accepted, and he himself supported that recom-mendation. It was not necessary, however, for the Cabinet at thisstage to discuss the matter in detail; and the Secretary of State forScotland had asked, in his memorandum, that no decision should betaken for the present on the question whether the payment shouldbe at a flat rate or on the basis of the actual wages lost subject to a prescribed maximum. For the moment it would suffice if the cabinet authorised the Minister of Health to move an amendment to theNational Health Service Bill empowering him to make regulations under which it would be possible to authorise the payment of allowances for loss of remunerative time as well as travelling and subsistence allowances. The basis of the payment for loss of renumerative time could then be decided later : that decision could,if necessary, be deferred until the Government had received thereport of the committee which was to be appointed to enquire intothe more general question of the payment of allowances forattendance at meetings of local authorities.The Lord President said that, if the National Health service bill were amended on the lines proposed, he feared that the Govern-ment might be said to have conceded, in advance of the independent enquiry which was about to be made, the principle of payment for loss of remunerative time to members of local authorities. He wasalso anxious that it should be made clear that payment for the lossof remunerative time would not always be made in addition tosubsistence allowances, for there were serious risks in allowing suchEayments to be cumulative. He therefore suggested that it woulde preferable not to make the proposed amendment of the national health Service Bill, but to await the report of the Committee onthe Payment of Allowances for Attendance at Meetings, of LocalAuthorities, which should be available by the end of the year, and thereafter to introduce a Bill dealing with the payment of allowances both to members of local authorities and to membersof the new bodies under the National Health Service.In discussion several Ministers supported the view that adecision on this matter should be deferred until the report of theenquiry into the more general question was available; and The LordChancellor expressed the opinion that there would no difficulty inincluding in a single Bill at a later stage provisions for allowancesboth to members of looal authorities and to members of the newbodies under the National Health Service. Alternatively, it wassuggested that the proposed amendment of the National health service Bill should be so drafted as not to imply that allowances for loss of remunerative time would be given in addition to subsistenceallowances.The Minister of Health said that, if the National Health service bill was to be amended as proposed, it was desirable that this shouldbe done during the Committee stage : for if it were left until theReport stage it was more likely to provoke a general debate on thequestion of payment for the loss of remunerative time to membersof local authorities. He did not believe that by taking power tomake payments for the loss of remunerative time to members ofthe new bodies to be set up under the National Health Service hewould prejudice the wider enquiry into the question of the payment[32264-8] b 2
152 cof allowances for attendance at meetings of local authorities. Hehad in fact already considered the course suggested by the lord president, but he had been advised that it would be impossibleto deal in a single Bill with allowances for attendance at meetingsof local authorities and allowances for attendance at meetings ofthe new bodies under the National Health Service Bill. In any event, the Secretary of State for Scotland would be placed in a verydifficult position if the question were deferred until after the more general enquiry had been completed, for in view of the currentpractice in Scotland it would be impossible to omit all provisionfor such payments from the National Health Service (Scotland)Bill, which was to be introduced at the beginning of the 1946-47Session. While he recognised that there might be some occasions on which a member who received both a subsistence allowance and a payment for loss of remunerative time would be over-compensated,there were undoubtedly other cases in which the payment of botha subsistence allowance and an allowance for loss of remunerativetime could be amply justified. He was, however, prepared to reconsider the wording of the proposed amendment to the national health Service Bill with a view to seeing whether it would bepossible to indicate that the payment of an allowance for loss of renumerative time would not necessarily be additional to the pay-ment of a subsistence allowance.In further discussion reference was made to the composition and terms of reference of the Committee which was to be appointedto consider the payment of allowances for attendance at meetingsof local authorities. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said thathe was not altogether satisfied with the terms of reference whichhad been proposed; and other Ministers expressed some doubts aboutthe suggested membership of the Committee. It was agreed thatthese points should be further considered by the responsible ministers, in the light of the discussion, but that the matter neednot be submitted again to the Cabinet.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the National Health Service Bill should be amended in Committee to empower the Minister ofHealth to provide by Regulation for the payment of allowances for loss of remunerative time to members ofsome of the bodies established under the Bill, on theunderstanding that the munster of Health would recon-sider the wording of the proposed amendment with aview to avoiding any suggestion that such payments would always be made in addition to subsistenceallowances.(2) Agreed that the basis on which payment should be made forthe loss of remunerative time to members of bodies estab-lished under the National Health Service should be left for later decision, preferably in the light of the recom-mendations of the proposed Committee on the Paymentof Allowances for Attendance at Meetings of LocalAuthorities.(3) Took note that the Minister of Health would consult further with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretaryof State for Scotland, regarding the membership and terms of reference of the Committee on the Payment of allowances for Attendance at Meetings of LocalAuthorities.2. The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the business which it was proposed to take in the House of Commons in thefollowing week.On the 1st July there would be a debate in Committee ofSupply on Education.On the 2nd July the Committee Stage of the Cable and WirelessBill would be taken, and also the Committee Stage of Service Votes.Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.
153CM. 62 (46).260BurmaLegislatureBill.Business inthe House ofLords.If time allowed, further progress would be made with the Diplo-matic Privileges (Extension) Bill.On the 3rd July there would be a debate in Committee ofSupply on Colonial Affairs.The Report Stage and Third Reading of the New Towns bill would be taken on the 4th and 5th July.The Lord President said that the Opposition might ask for early debates on bread rationing, India and Palestine. The first of these subjects should be taken on a Supply day; and he would try to persuade the Opposition to use Supply days for the other two subjects, if they were to be debated at all. The Prime ministers aid that a debate on India should be delayed until after the return of the Cabinet Mission. On Palestine nothing could usefully besaid in the immediate future, and he would ask the Leader of theOpposition not to press for an early debate.In further discussion reference was made to the effect of aJll-night sittings on the attendance of Government supporters atStanding Committees. It was suggested that, if the House had to sit very late in future, the Whips might arrange to release at a relatively early hour Government supporters whose attendance was required at Standing Committees on the following day.The Prime Minister said that some difficulty might arise overthe Burma Legislature Bill, which was to be taken in the House ofCommons on the following day. The Government would find itdifficult to resist the criticism which was likely to be made of someof its provisions. He had particularly in mind those relating tothe numbers of the Upper House of the Burma Legislature, theproperty qualifications for membership of that House and theproposal to enfranchise persons between the ages of 18 and 21.He thought that on these points the Government should accept someof the amendments which would be proposed. There was generalagreement with this view. It was also desirable that a seniorMinister should be available to assist the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for India in the debate. The Lord Privy Sealundertook to be in attendance during the debate.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs asked when the cable and Wireless Bill and the Civil Aviation Bill would beready for discussion in the House of Lords. The Chief Whip saidthat proceedings in the House of Commons on the first of these bills would be completed shortly; but it was not expected that theCivil Aviation Bill would be through the House of Commons beforethe 12th July. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs saidthat in that event it would not be possible to pass the Civil AviationBill through the House of Lords before the Summer Recess.bread rationing.(previous reference:CM. (46) 52ndConclusions,Minute 5.)3. At their meeting on the 27th May the Cabinet had agreedthat a rationing scheme for bread and flour should be prepared.They now had before them a memorandum by the Minister ofFood (CP. (46) 247) proposing that bread rationing on the scaleset out in the Appendix to the memorandum should be introduced on the 21st July.The Minister of Food said that he had hoped that it might bepossible to avoid the introduction of a measure which was boundto be unpopular and would give rise to considerable administrative difficulties. The prospects of the harvest in the United States and canada were indeed good and in the long term our supply position was likely to be easier than had at one time been feared. This,however, did not alter the fact that in the next three or four months our situation would be very difficult. He estimated that stocks would be down to 513,000 tons at the end of August andto 551,000 tons at the end of October. And these figures assumed that the United States Government would carry out to the fulltheir obligations to this country, and that 575,000 tons would be
received from, the new home crop by the end of October. Even ifthe estimates were realised, our wheat stocks in August to Octoberwould be substantially below the level of seven weeks&apos; supply(equivalent to 760,000 tons at present rates of consumption) whichwas considered the minimum safety level.In these circumstances he considered that it would be recklessnot to introduce rationing at the earliest convenient date; and he asked for the Cabinets authority to announce at once thatrationing would be introduced on the 21st July.The scheme would cover bread, flour and flour confectionery.The normal adult would have a ration of 9 ounces a day and therewould be special rates for children of various ages, expectant mothers and manual workers. The last category covered 9 million men and 3 million women, and their rations would be 15 ouncesand 11 ounces respectively. In addition, bread would be available at catering establishments; canteens catering for heavy workers would have treble the normal allowance; and special arrangements would be made for agricultural and other workers who had noaccess to canteens and were entitled to the special cheese ration.To give elasticity, bread coupons would be interchangeable withordinary points coupons.The Minister did not disguise his belief that this, or indeedany, scheme of bread rationing would be unpopular. He would,however, be able to announce simultaneously an increase in the meat ration of 2d. a week; this might help to reconcile the public to the scheme. He would also do his best to see that the schemewas properly understood by the public. For this purpose he asked that the Ministry of Food should be granted a special priority inthe allocation of advertising space among Government Depart-ments in the next few weeks.It was the general view of the Cabinet that bread rationingshould now be introduced, as recommended by the Minister of Food.This was necessary, not so much for the purpose of reducing flourconsumption the scales proposed would secure only a 5\ per cent,economy in consumption but rather for the purpose of obtainingcontrol over consumption so that savings could be secured withoutinequity later on if they were found to be necessary.The Cahinet (1) Agreed that bread rationing on the scales set out in theAppendix to CP. (46) 247 should be introduced on the21st July.(2) Took note that the meat ration would be increased by 2d.a week from the same date.(3) Authorised the Minister of Food to announce these changesforthwith in the House of Commons.(4) Invited the Lord President to arrange for the central office Of Information to secure for the Ministry of Foodduring the next few weeks a sufficient share of the news-paper advertising space available to GovernmentDepartments to enable them adequately to present the bread rationing scheme to the public.Termination 4.   The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that it was &apos;of Combined proposed to issue to the press on the 29th June a joint statement byFood Board. President Truman, Mr. Mackenzie King and himself to the effectthat the Combined Food Board would be terminated from the1st July, its activities being taken over by the newly formedInternational Emergency Food Council, which had just held its first meeting.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of this proposal.
Broadcasting.(previous reference:CM. (46) 29thConclusions,Minute 9.)5. The Cabinet considered a joint memorandum by the lord president and the Postmaster-General (CP. (46) 241) on broad-casting policy.The Lord President recalled that the Cabinet had already approved the recommendations on future broadcasting policy madeby the Ministerial Committee on Broadcasting and the proposals made by the Postmaster-General and himself for the reorganisation of the B.B.C. home services.   It had seemed desirable that thereshould be a general debate on broadcasting policy before thisreorganisation took place and for this purpose a White Paper, aproof of which was annexed to CP. (46) 241, had been prepared.Meanwhile notice had been given in the House of Commons of a motion proposing that the question of the renewal of the B.B.C.Charter should be referred to a Joint Select Committee of bothHouses. There had also been a debate in the House of Lords on theprevious day on a motion by Lord Brabazon asking for an inde-pendent enquiry before an extension of the B.B.C. Charter was granted, and, though the Postmaster-General had succeeded in getting Lord Brabazon to withdraw his motion, it was clear thatthere was a strong demand in both Houses of Parliament and inthe press that there should be some enquiry before the Charterwas renewed.   He himself believed that it would be unwise toappoint a Joint Select Committee and that, if any enquiry were tobe made, it should be held by a Departmental Committee on the linesof the Ullswater Committee.   If this suggestion had been pressedat an earlier stage, it might have been expedient to hold such anindependent investigation before the Charter was renewed; butneither the Coalition Government nor its successor had taken theopportunity of initiating an independent enquiry when there wasyet time, and if the Opposition had felt strongly in favour of suchan enquiry they should have challenged the Prime Minister&apos;s state-ment in February 1946 that it was not proposed to arrange for anindependent investigation. In the limited time now available beforethe present Charter expired, it would be impossible to carry out asatisfactory enquiry; and the B.B.C. would be gravely handicappedif they had to remain in uncertainty about their future until the charter was about to expire.In discussion there was general support for the view that itwould be unwise to initiate any independent enquiry at this latedate. It was suggested, however, that it might be advantageous to limit the period for which the Charter was renewed to five insteadof ten years and to indicate, if necessary, that the Governmentwould consider wrell before the end of this period whether anindependent enquiry should then be held. This course might be defended on the ground that during the next three or four years there were likely to be big advances in technical development, whichhad for the past six years been held up by war conditions.Other points in discussion were : (a) The Prime Minister suggested that the importance of regional devolution should be moie strongly emphasised in theWhite Paper.(&amp;) It was explained that the Postmaster-General had indicated in the House of Lords that an opportunity would be givenfor a debate on the White Paper before the Summer Recess. If,however, the debate were postponed until after the Summer Recessit would probably be possible to offer two days for the debate, andthe Opposition might prefer this.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the B.B.C Charter should be renewed for aperiod of five years from the 1st January, 1947.(2) Agreed that the suggestion of holding an independent enquiry before the Charter was renewed should be resisted, but that, if necessary, an indication should begiven that the Government would consider the possibility261
of instituting such an enquiry before the end of theperiod of five years for which the Charter was to be renewed.(3) Authorised the Lord President and the Postmaster-general to arrange for the publication of the draft White Paperannexed to CP. (46) 241, subject to the point mentionedin paragraph (a) above, and to such other amendments as might be necessary in view of the decision that the charter should be renewed for only five years.(4) Took note that the Lord President and the Chief Whipwould discuss with the Opposition the choice of a date for a debate on broadcasting policy.british nationality.nationality of MarriedWomen.(previous reference:CM. (45) 55thConclusions,Minute 5.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary and the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (CP. (46)236) on the nationality of married women.The Home Secretary explained that, from informal discussions which had recently taken place between officials of the UnitedKingdom and Dominion Governments, it appeared that theDominion Governments were now prepared to agree that the law of British nationality should be so amended as to provide (i) thata British woman on marriage to a foreigner, whether or not sheacquired his nationality under the law of his country, should notlose her British nationality unless she took some overt step to renounce it; and (ii) that a foreign woman, on marriage to a british subject, should not thereby acquire British nationality, but shouldhave the right to apply for it, and that if she applied, the grantingor withholding of British nationality should be within the discretion of the competent authorities in the British country concerned. TheHome Secretary asked that the Cabinet should now approve these changes in the law, and that Dominion Governments should be askedfor their formal concurrence, with a view to ia public announcement in this country showing that the difficulty which had previouslyprevented legislation on this subject had now been overcome.The Minister of State said that the Foreign Office supported the proposals put forward in the Home Secretary&apos;s memorandum.In discussion reference was made to the proposal that aconference of experts should be held later in 1946 to consider morefar-reaching changes in the principles of British nationality law.The question had been raised whether the Government of india should be represented at this conference. The Cabinet consideredthat in view of the uncertainty of the constitutional position inIndia, it was impossible to decide at the present stage whether itwould be appropriate that the Government of India should beinvited to send a representative to this conference.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom should in due course introduce legislationamending the provisions of British nationality lawregarding the nationality of married women in the sense proposed in CP. (46) 236 and summarised above.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to askDominion Governments for their formal concurrence inthis proposed change in the law of British nationality.(3) Took note that, when the concurrence of Dominion Govern-ments had been obtained, the Home Secretary would announce that the principle of these changes in the lawhad been accepted and that legislation to give effect tothem would be introduced in due course in the Parlia-ment at Westminster.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,27th June, 1946.
