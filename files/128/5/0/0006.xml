1. The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the business which it was proposed to take in the House of Commons during thefollowing week.On the 24th January there would be a debate on a government motion inviting approval of the policy outlined in the White paper on Civil Aviation. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry ofCivil Aviation should move this Motion, but it would be necessaryfor a member of the Cabinet to speak in reply to the debate.The Lord President said, that, in the light of his experiencesduring his recent visit to North America, he was apprehensive aboutthe effects of American competition on the trans-Atlantic air routesunless the British Corporations were able quickly to equip themselves with American aircraft for use until such time as suitable types ofBritish civil aircraft became available.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had recentlyagreed to find dollars for the purchase of four American aircraft,either Constellations or Boeings, for such temporary use on the trans-Atlantic routes. The Cabinet should, however, be aware that air Vice-Marshal Bennett, who was to be a director of the projectedSouth American Airways Corporation, took the view that theLancastrian could carry civil traffic across the Atlantic. This view had not hitherto been accepted by the Ministry of Civil Aviation;but it was a matter for consideration whether the Lancastrian shouldnot be used on the trans-Atlantic routes to South America.The President of the Board of Trade said that, if B.O.A.C.had been willing to place orders at an earlier stage, they could by now have been equipped with British aircraft. He believed thatB.O.A.C. had deliberately refrained from ordering British aircraft in order to get into a position in which the Government would be forced to agree to their acquiring American aircraft. He thoughtthat a searching enquiry should be held into the policy followed byB.OA.C. in this matter.The Prime Minister agreed that enquiry should be made intothe points which had been raised in the discussion, so that theGovernment spokesman in the forthcoming debate might be in aposition to deal with these matters.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord President to enquire into the points notedabove, in consultation with the Minister of CivilAviation; and agreed that the Lord President should reply to the debate on the 24th January.The Prime Wlinister informed the Cabinet of a statement whichhe was proposing to make in the House of Commons on the22nd January regarding the establishment of an organisation underthe Ministry of Supply for the production of fissile material requiredfor the development of the Governments programme for the use of atomic energy. This would make it clear that the Governmentsobject in establishing this production plant was to make available.as speedily as possible fissile material in sufficient quantity to enable usto take advantage rapidly of technical developments as they occurred,and to develop our programme for the use of atomic energy as circumstances might require. He would announce at the same time that Marshal of the Royal Air Force Lord Portal of Hungerford hadbeen chosen as head of this production organisation; and thatProfessor J. D. Cockcroft had been selected for the post of Directorof the Research and Experimental Establishment at Harwell.The Cabinet-(2) Took note with approval  of  the- terms of the  PrimeMinister&apos;s proposed announcement on this subject.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had arranged togive notice of introduction of the Control of Investment Bill on the22nd January and to publish the text of the Bill on the following day. It would be inconvenient, from the point of view of publicity,if this Bill and the National Insurance Bill were published on thesame day.The Loral President said that it was important, from the pointof view of the Parliamentary time-table, that the National insurance bill should be published as soon as possible after parliament reassembled. It was proposed to take the Second Reading of that bill on the 6th and 7th February, and the House would need at least two clear weeks in which to study the terms of the Bill before theSecond Reading.The Cabinet-(3) Invited the Lord President and the Chief Whip to consider,in consultation with the other Ministers concerned, what arrangements could be made to avoid the loss of publicity which would occur if the Control of Investment Bill andthe National Insurance Bill were published on thesame day.Business in The Cabinet were informed that the Second Reading of thethe House Bank of England Bill would be taken in the House of Lords on theof Lords. 22nd January. No petitions against the Bill had yet been lodged,Bank of and it seemed likely that it would not be necessary to refer the BillEngland Bill,    to a Select Committee.   The Governor of the Bank of England had undertaken to speak from the cross-benches in support of the Bill.Investment(Control and guarantees)Bill.2. At their meeting on the 13th December the Cabinet had invited the Social Services Committee to consider what changesmight be made in the conditions for the receipt of assistance byunemployed persons who had exhausted their title to benefit.The Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by theMinister of National Insurance (CP. (46) 14) reporting theconclusions reached by the Committee.Limitation of The Minister of National Insurance said that, in consultationUnemployment with the Assistance Board, he had gone carefully into the possibilityBenefit. of making such changes in the conditions for the payment ofassistance as would remove any legitimate sense of grievance on thepart of persons who had to resort to assistance on the exhaustion oftheir right to unemployment benefit, but he had come to theconclusion that a solution to the problem could not be found on theselines. Meanwhile, there was increasing evidence that long-termunemployment was re-emerging in&apos; the development areas, and theAssistance Board had reported that over the last six weeks there hadbeen about 750 new applications for assistance each week, 90 percent, of the applicants being persons who had exhausted their rightto unemployment benefit. He was satisfied that, unless some provision was made in the Bill to meet the position of such personsin the period before the Governments full employment policy took effect, a very awkward Parliamentary situation would arise; and he accordingly proposed that, as an emergency measure during a periodof, say, two years from the passage of the Bill, he should have powerto give to all contributors insured for unemployment special creditswhich would entitle them to a further spell of benefit in that period up to a maximum of 26 weeks. It should be possible to provide thisextra benefit from the insurance fund which had been built up duringthe war and no increase in contribution rates would be necessary.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in putting forwardthis proposal the Minister of National Insurance was asking theCabinet to reopen their decision of the 13th December that the BillNationalInsuranceScheme.(previous reference:CM. (45) 62ndConclusions,Minute 2.)
should provide for a limit of 30 weeks on the payment of unemploy-ment benefit, with the normal extensions for contributors with goodemployment records. The Government would appear to have little&apos;confidence in their power to carry through their policy of full employment if, at a time of great labour shortage, they put forward proposals which would make it possible for people to draw con-tinuous unemployment benefit for as much as 2\ years. It was truethat there were special difficulties in the development areas, but the remedy for these was to press forward with schemes for the provisionof work suited to the local circumstances and not to provide for thepayment of additional unemployment benefit throughout the whole country. He hoped that it would be possible to avoid any recurrence of nation-wide unemployment, but if unemployment of this kind diddevelop, it would not be in the years covered by the Ministersproposal but at a later date. He was concerned that, if an additionalspell of 26 weeks&apos; benefit were once conceded, it would never bepossible to withdraw it. There should be no real difficulty in gettingParliament to accept the Bill with a limit of 30 weeks on thepayment of unemployment benefit; but if, in the event, there proved to be very strong opposition to such a provision he would be preparedto consider making some concession.The President of the Board of Trade confirmed that a con-siderable measure of unemployment was appearing in the develop-ment areas. Schemes to provide employment in the development areas were, of course, being actively pursued, but there would bean inevitable time-lag before these schemes matured, and the position might not be fully remedied until about- the beginning of 1948.It was estimated that by the end of 1946, there would be about250,000 unemployed in the development areas, of which, on past experience, some 37,500 would probably have been unemployed for over twelve months. Outside the development areas the amount of long-term unemployment would be negligible.The Minister of Health said that the position in the develop-msnt areas reinforced the case for an extension of the payment ofunemployment benefit. He recognised that the view was strongly held in some quarters that the payment of benefit for an additionalperiod should not be a charge on the insurance fund; but he didnot see why such additional payments should not be carried by theExchequer. He did not favour paying benefit to persons who could not longer be regarded as in the employment field. The essentialpoint, however, was that persons in the development areas whowere anxious to work, but for whom no work was available, shouldnot be penalised when they exhausted their right to benefit underthe present conditions. Outside the development areas there shouldbe no difficulty in offering work to all applicants for benefit long before the expiry of 30 weeks. Unless some provision was madeon the lines suggested by the Minister of National Insurance theBill would be bitterly opposed in Parliament; and, in his view, itwould be disastrous to adopt the suggestion of the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer that the Government should wait and see what wasthe extent of the opposition.The Foreign Secretary said that it had always been contem-plated that there might be special difficulties during the period ofdislocation immediately after the end of the war and that, as  minister of Labour in the Coalition Government, he had agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer that  100 millions of the accumulated reserves of the unemployment insurance fund shouldbe regarded as available to meet these emergency conditions. he attached the utmost importance to maintaining the insuranceprinciple and he was convinced that the insurance fund should not carry more than the payment of unemployment benefit for a periodof 30 weeks, with the normal extensions for contributors with goodemployment records. There was no reason, however, to penalise aclaimant who had exhausted his right to unemployment benefit and,
through no fault of his own, could not obtain employment; and hesuggested that a solution might be found by providing, for an emer- &quot;gency period of about five years, that where an applicant wascapable of and available for work but could not obtain it, he mightbe referred to the Court of Referees who, after considering all thecircumstances of the case and the conditions of the locality, mightrecommend to the Minister that payment at benefit rates should becontinued for such further period as they thought fit. There wouldbe no question of imposing any means test on the claimant; but,in making their recommendations the Courts of Referees wouldhave regard to such matters as whether he was a young, single person who could reasonably be expected to move to another area,whether he could reasonably be regarded as within the industrial field, and how soon new opportunities for employment would beavailable in the locality. The cost of these additional payments should not fall on the insurance fund, but should be met out ofmonies provided by Parliament.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in principle, he was willing to accept the suggestion made by the Foreign Secretary, buthe would like an opportunity of considering the form of the Clauseto give effect to it.The Lord President supported the proposal made by the foreign secretary. He pointed out, however, that it was essential that theBill should be published during the coming week and suggested that,in these circumstances, the necessary new Clause should be drafted in the widest possible terms, leaving the details of the scheme tobe worked out in Regulations.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the inclusion in the National Insurance Bill ofa provision on the lines suggested by the Foreign Secre-tary at &quot; X &quot; above, and invited the Chancellor of theExchequer, in consultation with the Foreign secretary and the Minister of National Insurance, to settle theterms of the necessary Clause.The Prime Minister recalled that at their meeting on the13th December the Cabinet had agreed that the Social services committee should consider a proposal that provision should be madein the National Insurance Bill for varying the rates of contribution in sympathy with the state of employment. He had been informedthat since then the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe other Ministers mainly concerned, had agreed on the inclusion in the Bill of a Clause giving him power, by order subject to affirmations-tive resolution, to vary the rates up or down, if it seemed to himdesirable to do so with a view to maintaining stability of employ-ment. He understood, however, that it was not proposed to provide that the variations should be made automatically according to a prescribed scale. Was it not dangerous to take a wide power ofthis kind which would be exercised without reference to anyobjective standard 1 Would it not be possible to relate the possiblevariations to the level of unemployment or to trends in world trade ?The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he and the other ministers concerned had considered very carefully whether the pro-posed Clause should contain a scale according to which contributions would be varied. They had, however, felt that no sufficient datawere available at present for drawing up such a scale and that,apart from this, it would be objectionable to include in the Clauseany figure implying that the Government accepted as &quot;normal&quot;a particular percentage of unemployment. The Clause would, how-ever, be drafted in such terms as not to preclude the inclusion ofa scale in any order which might be made under it.The Jjord President supported the view that it would be impos-sible to include in the Clause any objective test, whether by referenceto a figure of unemployment or by reference to trends in world trade.
The Cabinet (2) Approved the inclusion in the National Insurance Bill ofa Clause giving the Chancellor of the Exchequer power,by order subject to affirmative resolution, to vary therates of contribution up or down if it seemed to himdesirable to do so with a view to maintaining stability of employment.(3) Took note that the Clause would not preclude the making of an order providing for automatic variation by reference to some objective test.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,17th January, 1946.
