1. The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the business which it was proposed to take in the House of Commons during thefollowing week.The Committee Stage of the Coal Industry Nationalisation Billshould be completed by Easter. Efforts would be made to agreewith the Opposition on a voluntary timetable; but, if these failed,a Motion for a compulsory timetable would have to be carried, andthis would be debated on the 4th February.The Prime Minister congratulated the Minister of Fuel and power and the other Ministers who had spoken on behalf of theGovernment on their handling of the Second Reading of this Bill.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he was much indebtedto the Lord President and the Chancellor of the Exchequer for their assistance both in the Debate and in the preparation of the Bill.On the 5th February the Chancellor of the Exchequer wouldmove the Second Reading of the Investment [Control and guarantees) Bill and the Solicitor-General would reply to the debate.  The Bill would then be referred to a Standing Committee.The Second Reading of the National Insurance Bill and theCommittee Stage of the Financial Resolution would be taken onthe 6th and 7th February. The Second Reading would be moved by the Minister of National Insurance and it had been arranged,after consultation with the Prime Minister, that the other Govern-ment spokesmen should be the Prime Minister, the Lord Privy Sealand the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of national insurance.2. The Lord President asked for the Cabinets guidance onthe reply to be given to a number of Parliamentary Questionssuggesting that the wireless licence fee for old age pensioners should remain at 10s. or, alternatively, that old age pensioners shouldbe entitled to pay the full fee by instalments. Although there was likely to be a good deal of support for this suggestion, he felt thatit should be resisted. It would be difficult to restrict such a con-cession to old age pensioners. Indeed, some of the Questionsproposed that licences at a reduced rate should be given also to widows, disabled ex-Servicemen and persons in poor circumstances.Moreover, it seemed inappropriate that such a concession should bemade at a time when legislation was before Parliament to increasethe rate of old age pensions.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, although the cost would not be prohibitive, the proposal was wrong in principle andshould, he thought, be resisted.The Postmaster-General said that he was advised that he couldnot properly prescribe different fees for different classes withoutspecific statutory sanction. The grant of free licences to blind persons was specifically authorised by the Wireless Telegraphy(Blind Persons Facilities) Act, 1926. As regards the alternative of pajanent by instalments, the administrative cost of such a concession had been estimated at  250,000 a year.In further discussion stress was laid on the administrative difficulties of operating a scheme for granting licences at a reducedfee to old age pensioners, particularly since such pensioners oftendid not maintain a separate household.   It was also pointed outthat many old age pensioners were in employment and could wellafford to pay the full fee.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord President to state, in reply to theseParliamentary  Questions,   that  the &quot; Government  were unable to accept the proposal that old age pensioners andother classes should be enabled to obtain wireless licencesat a reduced fee, or on pa3rment of the full fee by instalments.
Meeting ofDominionPrimeMinisters.3. The Prime Minister said that he had been considering, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,whether it would not be advantageous to hold a meeting of dominion prime Ministers in London in the early summer. They had agreedthat this would be an opportune time for such a meeting; and,subject to the views of the Cabinet, he proposed to put thissuggestion to the Prime Ministers of the Dominions. No public announcement would, of course, be made until their views had been ascertained. The Government of India would be represented atthis meeting.The President of the Board of Trade said that it was proposedto hold preliminary discussions in this country with representativesof the Dominions before the international conference on the proposed international Trade Agreement. No dates had yet been fixed, butit seemed likely that these preliminary discussions would begin inthe latter half of May. The Prime Minister said that this wouldnot conflict with the arrangements which he had in mind : he contemplated that the meeting of Dominion Prime Ministers shouldtake place in April or early May.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the Prime Ministers intentionto suggest that a meeting of Dominion Prime ministers should be held in London early in the summer of 1946.World ,Supplies ofCereals.(previous kef erence:CM. (46) 9thConclusions,Minute 8.)WorldWheatSituation.4. The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda on various aspects of the world shortage of cereals : CP. (46) 26 : by the Minister of Food, on the UnitedKingdom wheat-flour position;CP. (46) 31 : by the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries and the Secretary of State for Scotland, on the home produc-tion of wheat and on rations of.animal feeding-stuffs in 1946;CP. (46) 28 : by the Minister of Food, on the world ricesituation;CP. (46) 33 : by the Secretary of State for Burma on theworld rice situation;CP. (46) 30 : by the Secretary of State for India, on food supplies for India.The Minister of Food said that there was a serious world deficit of wheat and rice. The estimates on which allocations to importing countries had been based during his recent discussions in Washing-ton had shown supplies which were 5 million tons below the demand;and he believed that the actual deficit would be even larger, for theestimates of supply were, in his opinion, inflated. In the UnitedStates, for example, farmers were holding on to wheat, there wasdifficulty over both internal transport and shipping, and he doubted whether the target for exports would, in fact, be reached.Later in the discussion the Minister received a telegram from washington which made it clear that, despite a vigorous economycampaign about to be started, United States exports were not likelyto exceed 5% million tons compared with the 6 million tons on whichthe allocations had been based.The allocations, which had involved very severe cuts, had beenmade on the best estimate of needs that could then be drawn up.Those needs, however, might change. The situation in India, forinstance, was now very much more serious than it had been a fewweeks ago. It now appeared that India would require imports ofat least 2 million tons of wheat, rice or millet if many hundreds of thousands of persons were not to be reduced to the starvation level.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he must alsoask for an increase in the allocation of 120,000 tons to Ceylon, whichwouia not be sufficient to provide even a minimum diet.
The Minister of Food emphasised that the problem was, first,to meet the shortage during the next few months and, secondly, toensure sufficient supplies for next year. As regards the next fewmonths, it was particularly important to secure every possibleincrease of supplies by facilitating transport and securing economy in consumption. The greatest single means of reducing the deficitwould be an increase of the extraction rate in the exporting countries, which was at present about 70 per cent. If this were increased to 80 per cent, it might produce an extra 200,000 tons amonth, which would save the situation. The United states secretary for Agriculture had told him that this possibility wasbeing considered.After June 1946 world stocks would be very largely exhaustedand the world would be dependent on next year&apos;s harvest for nextyear&apos;s food. It was, therefore, of the greatest importance toincrease sowings of cereals throughout the world.In discussion the following points weze made : (a) The facts were not properly known. It was of the first importance that they should be made known as soon as possible, sothat the peoples of the world should be aware of the prospects, andthe pressure of public opinion might be brought to bear to secureboth economy of consumption and increase of supplies. TheAssembly of the United Nations Organisation would provide thebest forum in which to launch a campaign of world publicity.(b) The Foreign Secretary thought that, before any statement was made in the Assembly, there should be informal consultations with the other Great Powers. The main emphasis should be laid on the need for increased sowings for next year. If the holders ofsupplies were assured that there was no danger of shortage nextyear, they would be more ready to place on the market the stocksthey now held. In this context it would be easier to stress the needfor economy of consumption in exporting countries.(c) The situation demanded measures as drastic and far-reaching as those taken during the Battle of the Atlantic. It mightbe desirable for the Economic and Social Council of the united nations Organisation to set up a special body to secure that supplies were directed to the countries in which they were most needed. Onthe other hand, it was pointed out that any such special body mightcut across the activities of the Combined Food Board. The position might, perhaps, be met by reviewing the membership of that Board.(d) There was also need for regular publication of statistics,so that the public throughout the world could be kept informed of developments.(e) It would be valuable if the Prime Minister would make a personal approach to the President of the United States and to thePrime Ministers of Australia and Canada. The best method of approach to the Argentine Government would require furtherconsideration.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider the best methodof giving world-wide publicity to the gravity of the cereals situation through the Assembly of the united nations Organisation and to report to the PrimeMinister.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister, in the light of thisreport, would consider making a personal appeal to thePresident of the United States and the Prime ministers of Australia and Canada.The Minister of Food said that the allocation proposed for theUnited Kingdom was 2,300,000 tons against a demand for 2,515,000tons, and actual deliveries might fall short of the allocation by another 100,000 tons. He therefore had to find savings of some315,000 tons. Against this, however, he looked for repayment ofa &quot; loan &quot; of 112,500 tons to the British Zone in Germany. The-5] b 3

He did not recommend bread rationing, although the rationing of flour for cakes and confectionery might be practicableif required later on.He also recommended a food economy campaign, related to theworld food shortage generally. He also proposed propaganda toincrease sowings of spring wheat and of feeding-stuffs, with a bonusof  3 an acre for spring wheat.The following points arose in discussion : -(/) The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster asked that theBritish Zone in Germany should not be pressed to repay the loan of112,500 tons immediately. The cut already imposed on the british zone had been very heavy and there was no margin for any furthereconomy. Fie asked, therefore, that repayment might be suspendedfor the time being.The Minister of Food said that he was prepared to accept thisproposal.(g) There was prolonged discussion of the proposal to increasethe extraction rate to 85 per cent.The Minister of A griculture and Fisheries explained the serious effects which this would have on livestock policy. It would make itimpossible to honour the promise made last April that rations for pigs and poultry would be increased on the 1st May : instead, the ration would have to be reduced to what it was a year ago. Thiswould mean the wholesale slaughter of young, pigs and chicks andwould postpone for eighteen months the supply of more pig-meat and fresh eggs. Throughout the war the Government had. alwayshonoured the promises made to livestock producers : to fail to do sonow might destroy their confidence in livestock policy for the future.It was suggested that an extraction rate of 85 per cent, wouldhave the result that more bread would be wasted and more wouldbe fed to livestock to make up for the shortage of feeding-stuffs.The Minister of Food said that, even when allowance was made forsuch waste, an increase in the extraction rate would produce sub-stantial savings. An increase to 82^ per cent, would not meet theposition.The general feeling of the Cabinet was that, in view of theextreme gravity of the situation, there was no alternative but toincrease the extraction rate to 85 per cent., despite the serious consequences that this would have on feeding-stuffs policy and inother directions.(Ji) There was general agreement that there should be a vigorouscampaign for food economy, with its primary emphasis on economy of bread. The facts should be brought home to the public, so thatthey should understand the reasons for the present situation, whichwas due to circumstances outside the control of the Government.Housewives were finding the existing restrictions on food-stuffssufficiently irksome, and they could not be expected to accept stillfurther restrictions unless the facts and the reasons were clearly stated to them. As part of this economy campaign, steps should betaken to secure that bread was not served with main meals atrestaurants and hotels.The Lord President should supervise the preparation andco-ordination of this publicity campaign.(i) The Secretary of State for Scotland and The Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries opposed the suggestion for a bonus of 3 per acre for all spring sowings of wheat. They considered this to be undesirable in principle as conflicting with the general price policy for agriculture, and they also doubted whether it would achieve its object. They would prefer to rely on a strong appeal for increased sowings of cereals, either wheat or coarse grains.
The Minister of Food said that he did not wish to press his proposal for an acreage payment if the object they all had in viewcould be achieved by other means.The view of the Cabinet was that reliance should be placed onan appeal for increased sowings, but that this should be directedprimarily to increased sowing of wheat; at any rate in England andWales.The Cabinet (3) Agreed that the extraction rate for flour should be raisedby stages to 85 per cent., as proposed in paragraph 7of CP. (46) 26.(4) Agreed that a vigorous publicity campaign should be instituted for food economy, with special reference tobread, and for increased sowings of cereals; and invited the Lord President to consider means of preparing andco-ordinating this campaign.The Secretary of State for India said that the situation inIndia was becoming increasingly grave, owing to widespreadfailure of crops due to a tidal wave in Madras and prolongeddrought in Madras, Bombay, Mysore and the Punjab. There were insufficient stocks in the country to meet the short-fall and therewas no possibility of economy by reducing rations, which were already very low. It was, therefore, necessary for India to askfor an import of at least 2 million tons of rice, wheat or milletduring 1946 if famine of a dimension and intensity greater thanthe Bengal famine of 1943 were to be. avoided. In the circumstancesof political crisis which were approaching, such a famine wouldbe bound to lead to disorders and might remove the last hope ofan orderly solution of the Indian problem. Of the total amount required, India asked for at least 600,000 tons of wheat in thefirst four months of the year and for considerable quantities office. At present only 400,000 tons of wheat were in sight and very little rice. The Government of India thought it necessaryto ask that the whole allocation to India should be reviewed andfor this purpose they were proposing to send a delegation to London,and possibly afterwards to Washington, led by the Indian FoodMember.The Cabinet-(5) Agreed that there was a strong case for increased alloca-tions of cereals to India, and that the proposed delega-tion to this country should be welcomed and givenassistance in presenting India&apos;s case in Washington.The Cabinet next considered the memoranda (CP. (46) 28 and33) on world supplies of rice. These showed that the best hopeof meeting immediate deficiencies lay in increasing supplies fromSiam and Burma.The following were the main points made in discussion : (j) The Minister of Food said that Siam was believed to havean accumulated surplus from previous crops Of 1 - 5 million tons.Past failure to procure substantial quantities from Siam had, inhis opinion, been due to the producers&apos; lack of confidence in thelocal currency, which had been increased by our insistence of Siam&apos;ssupplying us with rice free of charge. He now recommended thatour claim for free rice from Siam should be modified. He proposedthat the Combined Rice Commission should assess how much rice,both from accumulated stocks and from the current crop, wassurplus to Siam&apos;s domestic needs; and that, in the light of thatassessment, a target figure should be fixed for export during 1946.Rice delivered to us during 1946 up to or exceeding that target figure should be bought in sterling, or in the currencies of the receiving countries, at prices to be fixed by agreement between the combined Rice Commission and the Government of Siam; and anyshort-fall from the target figure should be delivered free of cost
in 1947. If this scheme were adopted, we should not be abandoningour claim to free rice but merely- postponing it until 1947. he understood that this scheme had the approval of our local repre-sentatives in Siam.The Foreign Secretary and The Chancellor of the exchequer said that they were prepared to accept this proposal, on the under-standing that our claim to free rice was not abandoned but was merely postponed.(k) The Minister of Food said that the procurement of ricein Siam would also be facilitated if larger supplies of consumer goods could be made available for sale in Siam.The President of the Board of Trade informed the cabinet of the special measures which had already been taken to make available supplies of consumer goods for export to Siam and toestablish a consortium of trading companies to handle the shipmentand distribution of these goods. Further action was at the momentdelayed because no arrangements had been made in Siam to promote the placing of definite orders or to handle the retail sale.The Foreign Secretary said that his representative in Bangkokhad suggested that the Rice Unit in Siam might take delivery ofthese consumer goods and use them for the purpose of buying ricedirect from the producers. He would like to have an opportunityof discussing this suggestion with the Minister of Food.(I) As regards Burma, The Minister of Food said that he had asked the Governor to allow an additional 400,000 tons of rice tobe exported during the first quarter of 1946 on the understandingthat, if it subsequently became clear that the yield from the currentcrop would be insufficient to meet Burma&apos;s own needs, he shouldbe entitled to claim the refund after the 1st July of the amount (upto the amount exported in 1946) required to make good the deficiency. The Governor of Burma had, however, replied that themost he could offer was a further 55,000 tons; and he had stipulated that if it became necessary for Burma to claim the refund of anypart of this amount in the second half of the year, this claim shouldbe a first charge on rice exports from Siam. The Minister of Foodsaid that it would be impossible to concede this claim for absolute priority, since no one could foresee what the world rice situation might be in the second half of the year. He believed that Burma&apos;sreluctance to export more rice was due to a fear of local faminewhich did not take sufficient account of the even more serious situa-tion in other parts of Asia.The Secretary of Slate for Burma said that he had thoughtthat Burma might be pressed to supply 25,000 tons without condi-tions and the remaining 30,000 tons on condition that it would be refunded if it was needed to meet Burma&apos;s domestic needs in thesecond half of the year. He pointed out that the Government of burma were not holding this rice under their own control, and were unlikely to be able to procure it without giving some assurance that rice would be made available if needed to meet famine condi-tions in the autumn.The general view of the Cabinet was that the Governor of burma must.be pressed to improve upon his latest offer; and thatit would be impossible to give any absolute guarantee of replace-ment in the second half of 1946.The Cabinet (6) Agreed that our claim for free rice from Siam should be modified on the lines proposed in paragraph 5 of cp. (46)28; and invited the Minister of Food toarrange, after consultation with the Foreign secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, for the necessaryauthority to be conveyed to the Combined Rice Com-mission.
(7) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would discuss with&quot;the Minister of Food and the President of the Boardof Trade means for expediting the supply and distribu-tion of consumer goods to Siam in order to facilitate the procurement of rice.(8) Invited the Secretary of State for Burma to represent to theGovernment of Burma the urgent need to increase theexport of rice from Burma above the 55,000 tons nowoffered; and took note that the matter might be furtherpursued by the special Commissioner who was shortly tobe appointed to supervise British interests in South-east asia.In the course of the Cabinets discussion the suggestion wasmade that special machinery was required to keep under constant review the problems arising from the prospective world shortageof food. As the discussion had shown, the statistical estimates were not always reliable, and new demands were constantly arisingwhich called for rapid changes of plan. In these circumstances itwas not enough to rely on allocations made by the Combined food board for half-yearly periods. The situation demanded more flexible machinery and greater scope for improvisation. several departments of the United Kingdom Government were directly affected, and others had contributions to make. It seemed desirablethat the Prime Minister should hold a regular series of meetings,at frequent intervals, with the Ministers primarily concerned. ThisMinisterial body might be served by a Committee of senior officials.It would give directions, as necessary, to the Committee which wasto be appointed, under the Lord Presidents chairmanship, to super-vise Government publicity regarding the food situation and the foodeconomy campaign. It would also focus our relations with anyAnglo-American machinery which, as suggested earlier in the dis-cussion, might be established to keep the world food situation under constant review.The Cabinet-(9) Invited the Prime Minister to consider what special machinery should be established to supervise, under theCabinet, action by United Kingdom Departments to meetcurrent difficulties arising from the world shortage offood.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Food (CP. (46) 27) proposing that, in allocating thetonnage available for the United Kingdom import programme, first priority should be given during the next three months to the ship-ment of the essential food supplies listed in his memorandum.The Minister of War Transport asked that Ministers should notconsider this proposal until they had before them a full picture ofthe shipping position as a whole. This information could be madeavailable in a few days&apos; time.Meanwhile, he suggested that urgent representations should bemade to the Canadian Government about the effect on our shippingprogrammes of the condition which required us to forego any partof our monthly allocation of Canadian wheat which we could notship during the month. This condition tended to force us either toforfeit some part of our allocation or to resort to an uneconomicaluse of shipping. Representations to this effect had already beenmade to the Canadians, but he suggested that an approach should now be made to the Prime Minister of Canada.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that as a result of theproposed review of our shipping position as a whole, it might befound expedient to reopen the question of using ships which weresurplus to United States requirements, either by purchasing them or by arranging for them to be manned by British or, if necessary,Polish or Greek seamen.
The Cabinet-(1) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for ageneral review of the shipping position, including theshipping required for essential food imports for theUnited Kingdom over the next three months, to be heldin the first instance by a special meeting of the ministers primarily concerned.(2) Invited the Minister of War Transport, in consultationwith the Minister of Food, to prepare and submit to thePrime Minister the draft of a message to the PrimeMinister of Canada regarding the effect on our shippingprogrammes of the condition requiring us to forego anypart of our monthly allocation of Canadian wheat whichcould not be shipped during the month.agricultural wages.(previous references:CM. (46)2ndConclusions,Minute 9; andL.P. (46) 3rdMeeting,Minute 3.)6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries (CP. (46) 29) reporting the conclusionsof the Lord Presidents Committee on the situation resulting fromthe rejection of a recent application by the agricultural workers&apos;Unions for an increase in the national minimum wage.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that the lord presidents Committee had endorsed his view that the Governmentshould not seek to interfere in any way with this decision of theAgricultural Wages Board. They had also agreed that the Board&apos;decision did not justify the removal of the labour controls nowapplicable to agriculture. They had invited him and the Ministerof Labour to encourage both sides of the industry to enter into discussions with a view to formulating a system of graded wage rates which would give appropriate recognition of special skill and experience.The Minister of Labour said that, while it would be inexpedientfor the Government to intervene, there was no reason why his department should not, in the exercise of their conciliationfunctions, take the initiative in calling the two sides of the industrytogether to discuss the proposal for a system of graded wage rates.He recommended that his Department should take this initiative.The Prime Minister said that five Members of Parliamentrepresenting the Labour Party Committee on Agriculture had askedleave to discuss with him the situation arising from the rejection of this wages claim. He thought it would be preferable that theseMembers should be received by the Agriculture Ministers and theMinister of Labour.The Cabinet-(1) Endorsed the conclusions of the Lord Presidents Com-mittee, as summarised above.(2) Agreed that the Ministry of Labour should take theinitiative in calling together the two sides of the industry for discussions with a view to formulating a system ofgraded wage rates reflecting special skill and experience.Cabinet Office, S.WA.31st January, 1946.
