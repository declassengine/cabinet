1. The Prime Minister said that on the previous day he had had a long consultation with the Foreign Secretary about the stage reached in the discussions at the Council of Foreign Ministers inParis.Towards the end of the previous week there had been indica-tions that the earlier deadlock might be resolved. The soviet delegation appeared to have withdrawn their claim for the trustee-ship of Tripolitania, and seemed to be ready to accept the french proposal that the Colonies should be handed back to Italy in due course. The Foreign Secretary had, therefore, thought it wise toassert a claim to Cyrenaica, especially in view of our pledge to theSenussi that they should not be put back under Italian rule. So faras concerned the Italian colonies, the way might now be open forfurther constructive discussion. The two main questions on whicha deadlock was still likely were the future of Trieste and the basis for summoning the Peace Conference. The Soviet Delegation were strongly supporting the Yugoslav claim to Trieste; and theForeign Secretary considered that this claim should be resisted, bothon general political and economic grounds, and also because it wouldbe difficult to persuade an Italian Government to accept a peace treaty providing for the cession of Trieste to Yugoslavia. On thesecond point, the Soviet Delegation were likely to insist on theirnarrow interpretation of the Moscow decision, which would preventthe Peace Conference being held until the Council of foreign ministers had reached final agreement on the draft Treaties.Acceptance of this interpretation would not only delay the holding of the Conference, but would imply that its purpose was merely to endorse agreements already reached, by the Governments repre-sented on the Council of Foreign Ministers. It would not, therefore,be welcomed by Governments, including the Dominion Governments,which were not represented on the Council. At the same time, theForeign Secretary was reluctant to see this second meeting of theCouncil break down, as had the first in London, on a point ofprocedure particularly as on this occasion the Soviet delegation were on firm ground on a strict and literal interpretation of the moscow decision. The Foreign Secretary therefore proposed toproceed on the basis that, if the Paris meeting was to break clown,it should break down on the question of Trieste rather than on thebasis for convening the Peace Conference. In the further dis-cussions on Trieste he proposed to indicate that we were willing toagree to the partition of Venezia Giulia on the basis either of theproposals of the French Delegation or of the United States membersof the Boundary Commission. If the French Delegation suggestedputting Trieste under some form of international regime and theSoviet Delegation were willing to consider such a solution, he would,suggest that the matter should be referred for consideration by the deputies.Discussion showed that the Cabinet attached the greatest importance to avoiding the acceptance of an interpretation of the moscow decision which would prevent the Peace Conference from being held until final agreement had been reached on all points bythe Council of Foreign Ministers. The issue here involved was whether the nations which had made a substantial contribution tothe victory should be enabled to play an effective part in the negotia-tion of the Peace Treaties. This was an issue on which DominionGovernments held strong views and were entitled to the support ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government. It was, in fact, a point of principlerather than procedure; and, if the present meeting of the Councilbroke down on this issue, it could not reasonably be said that it had again failed to reach agreement on a minor point of procedure.It was also the view of the Cabinet that it would not be expedient to allow the present meeting to break down because ofBritish insistence that Italy should retain the sovereignty of Trieste.There was, after all, some substance in the Yugoslav claim, and atan earlier stage at least one of the Dominion Governments hadfavoured that claim.  So long as suitable safeguards were applied to1-5] b 2
secure the free passage of international trade through Trieste to!Central and South-East Europe, it need not be a matter of primary!concern to us whether sovereignty over Trieste was exercised by Italy!or by Yugoslavia. There was in fact a strong case for putting the!port and the city of Trieste on an international basis.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Prime Minister to communicate to the Foreign!Secretary, for his guidance in the further discussions injParis, the views expressed by the Cabinet on the relative!importance of the two main issues still outstanding, vizithe future of Trieste and the arrangements for the Iconvening of a Peace Conference, the Cabinet&apos;s broadIconclusion being that, while they would prefer a solution!under which the port and city of Trieste would be put!on. an international basis, they did not attach over-!riding importance to the rejection of the Yugoslav claim!to Trieste : on the other hand, they did regard it asjessential that His Majesty&apos;s Government should not Iacquiesce in a decision which implied that the main!belligerent Powers not represented on the Council ofForeign Ministers would be denied an opportunity forplaying an effective part in the negotiation of the peace treaties.The Prime Minister said that the United States Secretary ofState had expressed disappointment at our reception of his proposalfor a Four-Power Treaty providing for the disarmament and de militaires-tarisation of Germany. As the draft treaty had been communicatedto us in the strictest confidence, the Foreign Secretary had beentaken by surprise when the United States Secretary of State referredto it without warning at the Council of Foreign Ministers. to remedy this situation, the Foreign Secretary had suggested that anearly announcement might be made in Parliament which would showthat we welcomed this proposal of the United States Government.The Cabinet (2) Took note that the Prime Minister would make a statement,in reply to a Question in the House of Commons on the16th May, welcoming the proposal of the United StatesGovernment for a Four-Power Treaty for the disarma-ment and demilitarisation of Germany.Manchuria. The United States Secretary of State intended to suggest thatChina should be invited to send a representative to the meeting ofthe Council of Foreign Ministers in Paris, as he wished to raise questions about Manchuria and, under the Moscow decision, these could not be considered by the Council unless China were repre-sented. The United States Government were concerned, inparticular, to call in question the extent to which the Soviet autbori-ties were removing plant and equipment from Manchuria as booty.The Foreign Secretary had reported that the Soviet Delegationappeared to regard it as a matter of principle that the Peace treaty with Italy should include provision for reparations, since similar provision had been made in the other Treaties with ex-enemysatellite States in Europe.The Foreign Secretary proposed to maintain the line that thepayment of reparations by Italy must not be allowed to take priority over payments in compensation for relief.supplied by Allied Govern-ments to Italy.The Cabinet-(3) Took note of this account of the proceedings at the meetingof the Council of Foreign Ministers in Paris.Germany:United StatesDraft Treaty.(previous reference:CM.

Germany. 2.   The Prime Minister said that it had been represented to(Previous        him by the Foreign Secretary that much harm was being done by reference:       articles in the United States Press suggesting that in the BritishO.M.(46)43rd   and United States zones of Germany full effect was not being givenConclusions,     to  the  demilitarisation  clauses  of  the Armistice.    From his minute 1.)      conversations in Paris the Foieign Secretary had derived theimpression that the United States Government might themselvesbe doubtful whether we were giving full effect to these clauses inthe British Zone. He had therefore suggested that a special mission should be sent out, consisting of representatives of the Chiefs ofStaff, to make an investigation in the British Zone and submit areport to the Prime Minister.The Cabinet Invited the Prime Minister to arrange for a specialmission of investigation to be sent to report, as a matterof urgency, on the extent to which the demilitarisationclauses of the Armistice were being carried out in theBritish Zone of Germany.Egypt. 3.   The Prime Minister said that according to reports which(Previous had been received by the Foreign Secretary there was some dangerReference: of a revolutionary movement in Egypt which, while it was notCM.

To avert this situation, it was minute l.) important that British troops should be withdrawn from Cairo as quickly as possible.The Cabinet &apos;Took note that the Prime Minister would represent to theChiefs of Staff, and to our local representatives in Egypt,the urgent necessity for reducing as quickly as possiblethe numbers of British troops in Cairo.United StatesRequest forBases in the pacific.(previous reference:CM.(46)42ndConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Prime Minister said that the Foreign Secretary had reported that the United States Government were disappointed at the reception of their request for bases in the Pacific. As a result, they now seemed disposed to transfer the centre of their Pacific strategyfurther north, where they could rely on bases in their own territory orin territory under their control. Even though this might not be their final decision on the strategic issue, it seemed clear that they werenot for the present prepared to continue discussions with HisMajesty&apos;s Governments about military bases in the Pacific. TheForeign Secretary recommended that this question should be allowedto lapse for the moment.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s views.Palestine.Report ofthe Anglo-american committee.(previous reference:CM. (46) 44thConclusions,Minute 10.)5. The Prime Minister said that he had now discussed withthe Foreign Secretary the- message from President Trumanregarding the next steps to be taken by the two Governments on thereport of the Anglo-American Committee on Palestine. TheForeign Secretary had also had a preliminary discussion with theUnited States Secretary of State.The Prime Minister now proposed to reply to the Presidentsmessage on the following lines. To start consultations with arabs and Jews at this moment would prejudice the Egyptian negotiations and might cause an uproar in the Middle East. It would be well that these consultations should be deferred for a few days; inany event it would be difficult to complete them within a fortnight.At some stage, preferably before the consultations with Jews and arabs, experts of the United Kingdom and United States Govern-ments should examine the financial and military implications of[32061-5] b 3
Immigration.(previous reference:CM. (46) 1stConclusions,Minute 3.)carrying, out the Committee&apos;s recommendations. After the consultations with Jews and Arabs there should be a conference ofall interested parties, including Jewish and Arab representatives.The Prime Minister said that he also proposed to see theBritish members of the Anglo-American Committee and to discuss their report with them.The Cabinet-(1) Took note with approval of the lines on which the PrimeMinister proposed to reply to President Truman&apos;message.The Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the Cabinetthat he had received information that the s.s. Smyrna had sailed from Constanza, carrying at least 1,200 &quot; illegal immigrants &quot; to palestine. The permitted immigration was at present at the rateof 1,500 a month; but the balance of the quota for the month ending the 15th May and most of that for the subsequent month wouldbe filled by the Jews who were shortly to arrive in Palestine fromSpezia. &apos; A definite promise of immigration certificates had beengiven to these, and it would be necessary to give them preferenceover the party from Constanza. It would not therefore be possibleto allow all of the passengers on the s.s. Smyrna to enter Palestine asimmigrants within the permitted monthly quota and the balance would have to be detained until the 15th June, when they could be released as immigrants under the June-July quota.In discussion the view was expressed that it was very desirableto avoid any measure which would attract undue publicity at themoment.The Cabinet (2) Took note with approval of the course of action proposedby the Secretary of State for the Colonies.Sarawak.(previous reference:CM. (46)29thConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The Secretary of State for the Colonies recalled that therehad been pressure in Parliament that the Government shouldsatisfy themselves by independent enquiry that the cession of sarawak to His Majesty would be in accordance with the wishes of the people of the country. It had therefore been arranged thatLieutenant-Colonel Bees-Williams, M.P., and Captain Gammans,M.P., should visit Sarawak and make an independent enquiry.Their report had now been received. They considered that, while a minority would oppose cession, the great majority of the people were either positively in favour of it or were prepared to acceptthe Rajah&apos;s judgment. They therefore recommended, that thereshculd be no postponement of the arrangements to complete the cession.The Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for the&apos; Colonies to informRajah Brooke that the cession of his territory would be acceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government if the StateCouncils of Sarawak decided in favour of cession.India.constitutional position.(previous reference:CM. (46) 44thConclusions,Minute 6.)7. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that, since theconference at Simla had not been able to reach agreement, theCabinet Mission to India proposed to issue a statement within thecourse of the next few days.As soon as the draft of this statement was available, a special meeting of the Cabinet would be held to consider it.
45CM. 45 (46).    -202South-WestAfrica..(previous reference:CM. (46) 37thConclusions,Minute 3.)8. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that hehad discussed with Field-Marshal Smuts and his advisers the SouthAfrican proposal to seek the incorporation of South-West africa in the Union. Field-Marshal Smuts would be glad to have an assurance that in putting his proposal to the United Nations hewould have the support of the United Kingdom and of some at least of the Dominions.The Secretary of State recalled that after the last war theGovernments of the United Kingdom, Australia and New zealand had favoured the incorporation of this territory in the Union, butit had been placed under mandate because President Wilson hadbeen opposed in principle to the annexation of ex-enemy territory.The mandate provided, however, that it should be administered asan integral part of the Union. The native administration in theterritory had. not been subject to the criticism directed against thenative policy within the Union itself. A large part of the territorywas reserved for the natives, and councils of chiefs had beenestablished which were working satisfactorily. The Union Govern-ment had recently sought to obtain the views of the natives on theproposal to incorporate the territory in the Union. The Flerrerotribe opposed it, &quot;but most of the rest of the natives appeared to favour it. Of the European population, two-thirds were citizens of the Union.There had been opposition to the proposal from the neigh-bouring Protectorate of Bechuanaland; and Tshekedi, ParamountChief of the Bamangwato tribe, was intending to come to thiscountry to make representations against it, chiefly on the groundthat it would set a precedent for the subsequent incorporation inthe Union of Buchuanaland and the other South African high commission territories.The Secretary of State said that, despite this opposition, it seemed to him that the balance of the arguments was in favourof incorporation. There was the further consideration that our support of Field-Marshal Smuts in this matter would strengthenhis hand against the secessionists in South Africa, whose activities were causing him considerable difficulty. The Secretary of Statetherefore recommended that Field-Marshal Smuts should be told that the United Kingdom Government would support his applica-tion to the United jVations and would also be glad to arrange forhirn to discuss his proposal at a meeting of Dominion PrimeMinisters.The Secretary of State for the Colonies, while he admitted theforce of the arguments adduced by the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs, thought that there were also strong reasons whythe United Kingdom Government should not commit themselves tosupport this proposal. There was much concern not only inBechuanaland and the other High Commission territories butthroughout Africa, against the native policy of the Union Govern-ment, and there was likely to be strong opposition to any measure which would give the Union a greater control over the welfare of africans. Nor would this opposition be confined to Africa. Therewas considerable feeling on the subject in this country, in some ofthe Dominions and elsewhere. South Africa would have to obtain a two-thirds majority in the United Nations Assembly and mightnot succeed in obtaining it. India might well object to the proposal,on account of her troubles with South Africa. There were alsoindications that the Soviet Government would oppose it.The Secretary of State therefore recommended that the UnitedKingdom. Government should not commit themselves to support theproposal, at least until United Kingdom Ministers had discussed the matter further with Field-Marshal Smuts and possibly also withthe other Dominion Ministers now in London.The Minister of State said that the South African Governmenthad had difficulties with the Herreros in the early days of their administration of the territory. The action they &quot;had then takenhad occasioned much adverse comment, and when it became known that the Herreros were opposing the policy now proposed, this
would no doubt influence public opinion against it. The foreign secretary thought that the case against the proposal was very strong, and it was his view that the United Kingdom Governmentshould not commit themselves at this stage to support it.In discussion it was recalled that when the matter had lastbeen before the Cabinet it had been considered that it would be reasonable to support the incorporation of South-West Africa, inthe Union if the consent of the native as well as the Europeaninhabitants had been sought and obtained by methods agreeable tothe United Nations. The view of the Cabinet was that this decision should be maintained. If Field-Marshal Smuts wished to ascertain the views of the United Kingdom Government before the matter was discussed at a meeting of Dominion Prime Ministers, he couldbe told that this was the line which this Government would take at such a meeting.The Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs toinform Field-Marshal Smuts that the United KingdomGovernment would support the incorporation of South-West Africa in the Union if the consent of the native aswell as the European inhabitants had been sought and obtained by methods agreeable to the United Nations.Financial 9,   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Loan Agree-Agreement ment had now been approved by the United States Senate.

Xhe Cabinet-Took note of the Chancellors statement.Divorce. 10.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord(Previous Chancellor (CP. (46) 191) covering a report by the Committee on reference: Reform of Legal Procedure recommending that a departmentalCM. (45)34th committee should be appointed to enquire into the costs and delaysConclusions, involved in divorce proceedings and into certain other aspects of minute 2.) divorce procedure.The Lord, Chancellor explained that the Committee had considered three separate schemes for the reform of the administra-tion of the divorce law, submitted respectively by the President ofthe Divorce Division, the Legal and Judicial Group of the Parlia-mentary Labour Party and the Haldane Committee. They were unable to recommend the adoption of any one of these schemes, andthey were satisfied that before any action was taken there should bean enquiry by a departmental committee. The terms of reference of this committee should be narrowly drawn in order to restrict itin the main to matters of procedure, though the scope of the enquiry should be wide enough to cover the provision of machinery forreconciliation, in view of the stress laid on this point in the schemes submitted by the President of the Divorce Division and the legal and Judicial Group of the Parliamentary Labour Party. Themembers of the Committee should be preponderantly legal andexpert.Points in discussion were :  (a) For the purposes in mind a departmental committee wouldbe preferable to a Royal Commission. The committee shoulddeliberate and hear evidence in private, though the minutes ofevidence might be published after the enquiry had been completed.
47CM. 45 (46)-.(&amp;) The Lord Chancellor might consider whether the draftterms of reference given in paragraph 8 (i) of CP. (46) 191 shouldnot be revised to bring out more clearly that the committee wouldbe concerned primarily with reforms designed to expedite andcheapen the procedure, and also that it was within their competenceto consider whether the jurisdiction should be exercised by the HighCourt or by the County Court.(c) The proposed membership of the committee should be slightly enlarged in order to include more women. It would alsobe desirable to include one or two solicitors among the lawyersappointed to the committee.The Cabinet-Subject to the points noted in paragraphs (b) and (c) above,invited the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with the HomeSecretary, to arrange for the appointment of a depart-mental committee, on the lines proposed in CP. (46) 191,to enquire into the costs and delays involved in divorceproceedings and into certain other aspects of divorceprocedure.Cabinet Of/ice, S.W. 1,V3th May., 1946.
