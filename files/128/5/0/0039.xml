Palestine.Report of theAnglo-american committee.(previous reference:CM. (46) 38thConclusions,Minute 1.)The Prime Minister recalled that at their meeting on the29th April the Cabinet had agreed that the announcement to bemade on the publication of the Report of the Anglo-american committee on Palestine should be confined to a statement thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government were in consultation with the UnitedStates Government about the report. President Truman had,however, issued a statement welcoming the report and expressing,in particular, the hope that the transfer of the 100,000 Jews to palestine would be accomplished with the greatest despatch. Inthese circumstances it seemed necessary that there should be made,on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government, a somewhat fuller state-men t than had previously been contemplated. This should, inparticular, stress the practical difficulties of absorbing largenumbers of Jewish immigrants into Palestine in a short time : itshould make it clear that a large influx of Jewish immigrants couldnot be accepted unless the illegal organisations had first beendisbanded and disarmed : and it should raise directly the question to what extent the mandatory Power could rely on the activecollaboration of the United States Government in giving effect tothe policy recommended in the report. The Prime Minister saidthat he had taken the opportunity of mentioning this matter to dominion Ministers at their meeting earlier that day, and they had agreed that it would now be expedient that a fuller statement onthese lines should be made. He read out to the Cabinet a draft ofthe statement which he proposed to make.In discussion it was asked whether it would be expedient to appear to question, in a public statement, the extent to which wecould rely on the collaboration of the United States Governmentin this matter. Might it not be preferable to limit the public announcement, as previously proposed, to a statement that we werein consultation with the United States Government, and to pressupon that Government privately our arguments in favour of theiractive participation in implementing the policy recommended inthe report?The Cabinet considered that, in view of the declaration already made by President Truman, it was essential that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should at once give some indication of their attitude. towards the report and should, in particular, draw public attentionto the difficulties of implementing some of its recommendations.Further points in discussion were : (a) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed theCabinet of the preliminary appreciation received from the local commanders-in-Chief regarding the likely reactions to the reportin Palestine and the reinforcements which wrould be required todeal with the situation which would arise if it were announcedthat the policy recommended in the report was to be put into effect.The local Commanders had stressed the need for disarming anddisbanding the illegal Jewish organisations and had expressed theview that it would be necessary, as a first step, to arrest the leaders.The Chiefs of Staff had asked the local Commanders to furnish more detailed information on the military aspects of the problem.(6) It was most important that the Mufti should not return to palestine at this juncture. The Cabinet were informed that hewas now in Paris and that the French Government had recentlybeen asked to take special care to ensure that he did not leaveFrance. It was the view of the Cabinet that this was a matterof such importance that the Foreign Secretary should! take it uppersonally with M. Bidault in Paris, and the Minister of Stateundertook to send a message to this effect to the Foreign Secretary.The Cabinet then considered in detail the terms of theannouncement which the Prime Minister proposed to make in theHouse of Commons that afternoon. Various suggestions were madefor amendment of the draft; and the Prime Minister undertook to revise the draft in the light of the points raised in the cabinets discussion.
The Cabinets(1) Agreed that, in view of the declaration made by president truman, it was expedient that a public statement shouldbe made that day expressing the preliminary views ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government on the Report of the Anglo-American Committee on Palestine.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would make such astatement in the House of Commons that afternoon, inthe terms of the draft which he had read to the Cabinet,amended to meet the suggestions made in the course ofthe discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,1** May, 1946.
