Greece. 1.   The Foreign Secretary said that the elections in Greece had(Previous been held without serious disorder.   Preliminary reports indicatedDeference: that there had been a fairly large poll in spite of the decision ofC.M.(46)27th the leaders of the E.A.M. party to advise their supporters to abstainConclusions, from voting.   If that advice had not been given, the parties of the minute 2.) Left might have obtained a fair number of seats and a government might have been formed which would be broadly representative.The Cabinet were agreed that events had fully justified theForeign Secretary&apos;s determination to withstand the pressure forfurther postponement of these elections.The Home Secretary recalled that at their meeting on the22nd November, 1945, the Cabinet had agreed that it was important that the King of the Hellenes should not leave thiscountry with a view to returning to Greece. Was it still necessarythat the King of Greece should remain in this country ? TheForeign Secretary said that he was satisfied that the King of greece would not now seek to leave this country without first consulting the Foreign Office.Dutch 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that  Dr.  van Mook wasBast Indies.     returning to Holland for consultation with the Netherlands Govern-(Previous       ment, and Sir Archibald Clark Kerr would be returning to LondonEeference:       at the same time.   There were indications that, if His Majesty&apos;sCM. (46) 5th    Government used their influence, a satisfactory settlement mightConclusions,     now be reached over the issues outstanding between the Nether-Minute 2.)      lands Government and the Indonesian leaders.  An early settlementof the situation in the Dutch East Indies would have a steadyingeffect on the constitutional discussions which we were ourselvesconducting in Malaya and in India.   In these circumstances theForeign Secretary thought it would be expedient if the PrimeMinister and he could meet members of the Netherlands Govern-ment, when they had received Dr. van Mook&apos;s report, to discuss with them the situation which had been reached in the negotiations.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement; and authorised him to inform the Dutch Ambassador inLondon that the Prime Minister and he would be preparedto meet members of the Netherlands Government at theappropriate stage to discuss with them the prospects of reaching a settlement in the Dutch East Indies.Egypt.(previous reference:CM. (46)25thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Foreign Secretary recalled that he had previously proposed that the negotiations for the revision of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty should be conducted by His Majesty&apos;s ambassador in Cairo. The Egyptian Government had, however, appointed astrong delegation to negotiate on their behalf; and, on furtherreflection, he now considered that our Delegation for the discussions in Cairo should be headed by a Cabinet Minister. Tie would himselfretain control of the negotiations and would be the nominal headof the British Delegation. He must, however, himself remain inLondon; and it would be advantageous if another Minister could take charge of the discussions in Cairo. As defence questions wouldfigure so j)rominently in the discussions, he would prefer that oneof the Service Ministers should be selected for this task, and hesuggested that the Secretary of State for Air might be invited toundertake it.er-The  Prime  Minister endorsed  this  suggestion;   and  theSecretary of State for Air said that he would be willing to undtake this duty, if the Cabinet so desired.[31633-5] B 2
The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Secretary of State for Air should take Icharge of the British Delegation which was to 1negotiate in Cairo the revision of the Anglo-Egyptiail 1Treaty;(2) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to choose the appropriate time for announcing this decision.South-east asia.Supply ofCereals,CM. (46) 16thConclusions,Minute 2;and 27thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Foreign Secretary drew attention to a telegram (No. 61dated the 30th March) from the Special Commissioner in South-east asia reporting the results of the preliminary conference which hehad held at Singapore on the supply of cereals over the next threemonths to countries in South-East Asia. This disclosed a veryserious situation, and a meeting of the Departments directly con-cerned should be convened without delay to work out a plan for providing supplies and shipping to meet the immediate needs ofthese countries over the next few months.The Prime Minister undertook to arrange for such a meeting tobe held.british armies ofOccupationin Ex-enemy countries.5. The Lord President said that a Parliamentary question was to be addressed that day to the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster by Mr. Rhys Davies, M.P., asking if he would publish a white Paper on the activities of British troops occupying ex-enemy territories &quot; so that the people of this country might know whatwas being done in their name.&quot; The Chancellor of the Duchy had consulted him:, as Leader of the House, about the reply which he was proposing to give. He had intended to say that a White Paperoutlining the policies carried out by the British element of theControl Commission for Germany would be completed shortly, anda similar paper on Austria would follow later. The Lord president had thought that a promise to present White Papers on these subjects should not be given without the knowledge of the Cabinet.He also pointed out that the presentation of such White Paperswould make it impossible for him to continue to resist the demands which were already being made for facilities to debate in the Houseof Commons the political situation in Germany.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that any proposal to publish White Papersdescribing the policies of the British element of theControl Commissions in Germany and in Austria mustbe considered by the Cabinet before any undertaking wasgiven that such White Papers would be published.(2) Invited the Lord President to inform the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster that, in replying to Mr. RhysDavies&apos; Question that day, he should confine himself topromising consideration of the suggestion made.Sarawak.(previous reference:CM. (46) 28thConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Cabinet resumed their discussion on the future of sarawak. In addition to the memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies (CP. (46) 118) they now had before them a further memorandum by the Lord Chancellor (CP. (46) 134) on the legalaspects of the matter.The Lord Chancellor said that, as the present Rajah of Sarawakhad no sons, the next in succession under the wills of the first and second Rajahs were his brother, Captain Bertram Brooke and thelatter&apos;s son, Mr. Anthony Brooke. The present Rajah had, how-ever, instituted a new Constitution in 1941 and it was argued thatthe Councils then appointed had power to override the wills.Captain Bertram Brooke would be prepared to abide by the decisionof the Councils if he were allowed to visit Sarawak to present his
case to them, accompanied either by Mr. Pollard, a former memberof the Sarawak Administration, or by his son. If, however, he wasnot allowed to visit Sarawak, he was not likely to be content to accepta decision unfavourable to him. It would then be represented that by sharp practice we had robbed him of his succession; and there was likely to be public controversy which would be embarrassing to HisMajesty&apos;s Government. It would be inexpedient to follow a course which might leave Captain Brooke or his son with a grievance whichwould be exploited publicly.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that, after con-suiting the Prime Minister, he had seen Rajah Brooke on the30th March. The Rajah had then agreed that, if it was the wishof His Majesty&apos;s Government, he would allow Captain BertramBrooke and Mr. Pollard to visit Sarawak, though he would objectstrongly to Mr. Anthony Brooke visiting the territory. It had sinceappeared that, if Captain Bertram Brooke were allowed to visitSarawak, the Raj ah&apos;s Secretary, Mr. MacBryan (who had greatinfluence over the Rajah) would resign his appointment; but theRajah had intimated that he would, nevertheless, stand by his decision.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that arrangements should be made for CaptainBertram Brooke to visit Sarawak to present his case tothe State Councils, on the understanding that he agreedto abide by their decision regarding the cession of theterritory to His Majesty.The Secretary of State for the Colonies reminded the cabinet of the suggestion that the Treaty of Cession should be made subjectto ratification by Parliament. The preliminary view of the cabinet at their previous discussion had been that there would be political disadvantages in this course.The Cabinet (2) Agreed that it was not desirable that the Treaty of Cessionshould be made subject to ratification by Parliament.7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP. (46) 123) covering the Report of the SelectCommittee appointed to consider the expenses incurred by Membersof Parliament in connection with their Parliamentary and officialduties.The Chancellor of the Exchequer summarised the Committee&apos;srecommendations and the comments which he had made on each inhis memorandum. The Report seemed to have been well receivedby the Press and by Members in ail parts of the House. He under-stood that the Opposition would support the Committee&apos;s recom-mendations. He did not expect that their adoption would giverise to any serious criticism in the country. Subject, therefore, toverification that the official support of the Opposition would be forth-coming, he suggested that the Government should announce at anearly date that they accepted the Committee&apos;s recommendations andshould proceed to give effect to them.Discussion turned mainly on the proposal that the salaries ofMembers should be increased to  1,000 a year, of which  500 shouldbe treated as a tax-free expense allowance.Some Ministers doubted the wisdom of giving a flat-rateallowance to all Members alike and said they would prefer to seesome extension of the system by which an individual Member claimedtax exemption for the expenses which he had actually incurred.It was urged that a flat-rate expense allowance would createanomalies. The expenses of Members representing country consti-constituencies were necessarily larger than those of London Members;and it would be difficult to justify an expense allowance at a uniform!-5 I b 3
rate. Further, if half of the total remuneration of a Membertook the form of a tax-free allowance Members of Parliament wouldbe put in a favourable position compared with the average citizen.If a Member could claim tax exemption only in respect of expensesproved to have been necessarily incurred in the discharge of hisordinary citizen who could claim exemption on the same basis. TheCabinet were also informed that there was some feeling among members of the Opposition that it might be preferable to proceed on the existing basis of exempting from tax the expenses actuallyincurred by individual Members.Other Ministers argued that, as a matter of administration, itwould be far more convenient to adopt a flat-rate allowance for all members. Further, it was a fairly common practice for commercialfirms to give a tax-free expense allowance in addition to a salary,and the general public were by now familiar with this&apos; practice.Finally, it was unreasonable to require a Member of Parliament to argue with the Inland Revenue authorities whether a given scale of expenditure was appropriate to his position as a Member; andit would be preferable to avoid such individual arguments bygranting the same flat-rate allowance to all Members.The Lord President said that it seemed to him undesirablein principle that Members of the legislature, who determined thelevel of taxation, should themselves be exempt from paying tax ona substantial part of their remuneration as Members of Parliament.He would have preferred to see a continuance of the existing system by which individual Members claimed tax exemption in respect of expenses actually incurred by them. Alternatively, the automaticallowance of  100 for expenses might have been increased to  300.If the tax-free allowance were now fixed at  500 for all Members,he feared that Members for country constituencies would sub-sequently establish a claim that their expenses were generally higherthan those of other Members and would on this ground press foran even higher rate of expense allowance to be granted to them.The Foreign Secretary said that it was unfortunate that theCommittee&apos;s recommendation on this point had taken the form of recommending a salary of  1,000 a year, of which  500 would betreated as a tax-free expense allowance. The inclusion of theexpense allowance within the total salary might have dangerousrepercussions on industrial and commercial remuneration. If thesubstance of the recommendation was to be adopted, would it notbe preferable to express the tax-free expense allowance as somethingadditional to the salary, e.g., to add to the existing salary of  600a tax-free expense allowance of  400 ? The Chancellor of theExchequer said that he would see no objection to a somewhat different presentation of the Governments proposals in order tomeet the Foreign Secretary&apos;s point.Discussion then turned on the question whether the tax-freeexpense allowance of  500 a year should be enjoyed by cabinet ministers receiving salaries of  5,000 a year or more. The positionof these Ministers had been explicitly excluded from the terms ofreference of the Select Committee. It was arguable that the seministers should receive the same allowance for expenses as otherMembers of Parliament. It was pointed out that, if the tax-freeexpense allowance were granted to Junior Ministers and not to ministers of Cabinet rank, the net remuneration of the former wouldbe raised to a level not substantially lower than that of the latter.There was, however, general agreement that the Government shouldnot propose that Ministers receiving salaries of  5,000 a year ormore should be granted the tax-free expense allowance proposed forother Members.Other points raised in the course of the discussion were :  (a) The Select Committee had recommended that the govern-ment should review the salaries of Ministers receiving less than 5,000 a year and of the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of Waysarliamentarysame position as the
and Means. The Chancellor, while raising no objection to thisrecommendation, had suggested that the proposed review might betaken in hand at a later stage.The Prime Minister said that, if the consent of the Oppositioncould be secured, he would be in favour of dealing with these salaries in the amending legislation which would have to be introduced tofacilitate the payment of a tax-free expense allowance to the holders of these offices.(p) The Select Committee had recommended that the rate of subsistence allowance granted to Members when travelling on thebusiness of the House should be increased.It was suggested that increased allowances should be payable to Ministers in respect of expenses necessarily incurred in travellingon official business. The existing rates of allowances were rarelyadequate to cover the expenses necessarily incurred by Ministers onsuch official journeys.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this situation couldbe remedied by administrative action. If Ministers would com-municate with him when they found that the authorised allowances were insufficient to cover their actual expenditure, he would instruct the Treasury to go into the point with the Department concerned and see what should be done to put matters right.After further discussion, the Cabinet (1) Agreed to accept the substance of the recommendations made in the Report of the Select Committee on Members&apos;Expenses, subject to the reservations made by theChancellor of the Exchequer in his memorandum cp. (46) 123.(2) Appointed a Committee consisting of Chancellor of the Exchequer (Chairman).Home SecretaryChief whip to consider, in the light of the Cabinefs discussion, in what form the substance of these proposals could best be presented to Parliament and to the public.8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Food (CP. (46) 127) covering a revised draft of a white paper on the World Food Shortage. An earlier draft had beenconsidered by a meeting of Ministers on World Food Supplies on the26th March, and the revised draft took account of criticisms then made. It was proposed that the White Paper should be published on the following day, so as to be in the hands of Members of Parlia-ment before the Debate on the 4th April.The Cabinet considered the draft paragraph by paragraph and various suggestions for minor amendments were approved.The Cabinet-Authorised the Minister of Food to present to parliamentary White Paper in the terms of the draft annexed to cp. (46) 127, subject to the minor amendments approved in the discussion.9. The Cabinet had before them a joint memorandum by theLord President and the Postmaster-General (CP. (46) 128) on there organisation of the B.B.C. Home Services.The Lord President said that, as it was desired to continue touse two medium wavelengths for the European service and at thesame time to release wavelengths for a third programme intendedto serve the educated listener, it would be necessary to cut down thenumber of regional programmes. If separate regions were retained for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the choice lay betweenproviding for three or for two English regions.    Whichever
alternative was adopted, there would be considerable criticism buton balance, the Postmaster-General and he recommended the plaijfor three English regions which was favoured by. the B.B.C. TheCabinet should also know that, when the programme intended toserve the educated listener was introduced, there were likely to becomplaints from listeners who were outside its radius. Some ofthese could be avoided if the date for bringing the new programmeinto operation could be deferred until a new high mast atBrookman&apos;s Park was available, and it was therefore proposed thatthe introduction of the new programme and the reorganisation ofthe Home Services should be deferred until the 1st October, 1946,when it was hoped that the new mast would be available.The Cabinet-(1) Took note that the reorganisation of the B.B.C. HomeServices was likely to give rise to considerable criticism,(2) Agreed that the number of English regions should bereduced to three by the merging of the Midland aridWest of England regions.(3) Agreed that the introduction of the new programme for theeducation listener and the reorganisation of the HomeServices should be deferred until the new high mast atBrookman&apos;s Park was available and that the B.B.C.should be authorised to announce that they planned tointroduce the new programme on the 1st October, 1946.GovernmentPublicityService.(previous reference:CM. (46) 17thConclusions,Minute 4.)Future of theSocial Survey.10. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord President(OP. (46) 125) covering a report on the future of the Social Surveyby the Official Committee on Government Information Services.The Lord President said that the Official Committee, after consulting the Departments mainly concerned, had reached theconclusion that a service of the kind provided by the Social Surveyshould continue. The organisation and establishment of the social survey should, however, be reviewed and such staff as it might befound desirable to retain should become civil servants and beattached for the present to the Central Office of Information.Departments would be expected as a general rule to use the central office of Information for Social Survey work, but would be entitledto make other arrangements through the Central Office of Informa-tion if they could show that this was justified in any particular case,In discussion, several Ministers expressed doubts about the expediency of retaining a Government organisation for social surveywork. They considered that the results produced by the war-timeSocial Survey had added little to the information already availablein the Departments; and they doubted whether it would be wise tosaddle the Central Office of Information, at the outset of its career,with responsibility for an organisation which was so vulnerable to political criticism. Would it not be enough to rely on commercialagencies to carry out such survey work as was necessary ? It wasalso pointed out that, while the expenditure on the Social Surveymight be less than  60,000 a year, the Treasury had been asked to sanction expenditure of  132,000 by the Ministry of Food and of 35,000 by the Board of Trade on similar work in the coming year.Before a decision was taken to retain a Government organisation ,forthis research work, there should be some enquiry into the reasons why such large sums were to be expended on surveys carried out byother agencies.Other Ministers urged that for the purpose of economic planning it was desirable to have a Government organisation whichcould collect information about the tastes and needs of consumersand producers to supplement the purely statistical information which would be obtained by Departments and by the central statistical Office.   It was also maintained that the Social Survey
had, in fact, done useful work, that the work of commercial agenciesin this field was not always reliable, and that to allow each Depart-ment to organise its own surveys would lead to wasteful expenditure.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord President, in the light of the discussion,to give further consideration to the proposal to continue theSocial Survey as a Government agency, and thereafter tosubmit revised proposals to the Cabinet.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,1st April, 1946.
