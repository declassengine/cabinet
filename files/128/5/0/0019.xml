Parliament. 1.   The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the business business in which it was proposed to take in the House of Commons during thethe House of    following week.Commons. On the 4th and 5th March there would be a debate on theDefence White Paper. The Prime Minister would move &apos;: That this house approves the Statement relating to Defence (Cmd. 6743).&apos;-The First Lord of the Admiralty would reply to the debate. Thethird Government speaker would be one of the other service ministers, or the Minister of Supply, according to the course ofthe debate.On the 6th March there would be a general debate on housing in connection with the Second Reading of the Housing (Financialand Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. The Minister of Health andhis Parliamentary Secretary would speak on behalf of the Govern-ment. As this was to be a general debate, it might be preferable that the Minister should speak last; and he was invited to discuss this point further with the Prime Minister and the Lord President.On the 7th March, when the Navy Estimates would be taken,the First Lord of the Admiralty would open and the Civil Lordwould reply to the debate.The Second Reading of the Straits Settlement (Repeal) bill would be taken on the 8th March; and it was hoped that theremaining stages of this Bill might be taken during the following week.2. The Cabinet had before them (i) a joint memorandum bythe Minister of Education and the Secretary of State for Scotland(CP. (46) 74) recommending that the rate of Exchequer grant towards the running costs of providing school dinners should be100 per cent, from August 1946;.and (ii) a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (46) 75) proposing that theexisting arrangements, under which the rate of grant varied from70 per cent, to 95 per cent, according to the area, should remain inforce until 1948, when it was estimated that it would&apos; be possible toprovide school dinners free of charge; and that the new grant system to be introduced at that date should be considered in the light ofwider developments in the relations between central and localfinance.The Minister of Education said that when the Social services committee (S.S. (45) 7th Meeting, Minute 1) were considering thedate at which the payment of family allowances should begin, she had warned the Committee that, even with the most whole-hearted-operation of the local education authorities, it would not bepossible until 1948 to expand the school meals service to a sufficientextent to enable free dinners to be given^as benefits in kind underthe family allowances scheme. There was, therefore, a risk that theGovernment would be pressed to make a cash payment to those for whom&apos; this benefit in kind could not be provided during the interim period; and, to avoid this, it was of great practical importance thatthe expansion of the school meals service should proceed as quickly as possible. There was no doubt that local authorities had inter-preted the statements made on behalf of the Government (whichwere set out in Appendix A to CP. (46) 74) as meaning that theExchequer would bear the whole cost of school dinners when they became a part of the family allowances scheme, and it was theircontention that the Exchequer should also bear the cost of expanding the service from its present level to a target which would never havebeen contemplated but for the proposal to make free meals a partof that scheme. Convinced as they were that the Government would ultimately have to concede their claim for a 100 per cent, grant, thelocal authorities were not at present making adequate progress withthe expansion of the service, and the plan to bring free meals intoforce in 1948 was being jeopardised. She had no power to compellocal education authorities to provide a school meals service exceptfor children whose parents were unable to pay, or willing to pay,
for the meals, and she could not therefore apply sanctions to authori-ties who were unwilling to undertake the required expansion of theservice. It had been suggested that the payment of a 100 per cent,grant would lead to extravagance; but the nature of the service was such that it was possible to exercise a strict control over expenditureon food, fuel and staffing, and she had recently arranged for thetightening of this control. While admittedly the better-off authori-ties would benefit most from the proposed concession, she was con-vinced that on practical grounds, and particularly with a view to avoiding the demand for a cash payment in lieu of the provision of benefits in kind, there was an overwhelming case for promising an exchequer grant of 100 per cent, from August 1946.The Secretary of State for Scotland supported the proposal ofthe Minister of Education. The need for a 100 per cent, grant was even greater in Scotland, where there would have to be a very much larger expansion of the service before it would be possible to provideall school dinners free.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while he was anxious to see the necessary expansion of the school meals service,he could not accept the view that in order to secure this expansiona 100 per cent. Exchequer grant should be given in August 1946.If the Cabinet accepted the arguments put forward by the Ministerof Education, they would be placed in the position of having toagree to whatever terms local authorities demanded every time itwas desired to secure the expansion of any service, with the resultthat in time the whole cost of local government services would betransferred to the Exchequer. During the coming financial year he proposed to undertake, in consultation with the Health Ministers,a full investigation into the relations between central and localfinance, which might well result in a decision to discontinue thepayment of block grant to the richer authorities so that all theavailable Exchequer assistance might be concentrated on the poorerauthorities. The Minister&apos;s proposal would cut across any such scheme, since it would be the richer authorities who would benefitmost from the payment of a 100 per cent. Exchequer grant for school meals. As regards the control of expenditure on the school mealsservice, he had understood that, as a result of discussions betweenthe Treasury and the Ministry of Education, there was to have beena thorough costing investigation with a view to working out a grantsystem which would provide a better sanction against extravagance.On all grounds, therefore, it was his view that there should be no commitment to pay a 100 per cent. Exchequer grant from August1946, and that the question of the grant system to be brought intoforce when school dinners were provided free should be reserved for later consideration in the light of wider developments in the rela-tions between central and local finance.In discussion the following arguments were advanced againstthe proposal to promise an Exchequer grant of 100 per cent, from august 1946:-(a) The Coalition Government had intended to leave open thequestion whether some part of the cost of providing benefits in kind should be borne by the rates, and the statements quoted inAppendix A to L.P. (46) 74 reflected this intention. Thus, para-graph 176 of the White Paper on Social Insurance (Cmd. 6550)specifically included school meals within the scope of the financialadjustment between the Exchequer and local rates which would benecessary as a consequence of the new Social Insurance Scheme; andthe statement made by the Home Secretary (Mr. Herbert Morrison)on the 18th February, 1943, had linked the development of the school meals service with the development of the maternity and child welfare scheme, which would obviously continue to be financed inpart from the rates.(b) 100 per cent. Exchequer grants were wrong in principle and it was the duty of Ministers, particularly those responsible forthe control of local authority administration, to support the Chan-cellor of the Exchequer in resisting the constant pressure from local
authorities for the transfer of expenditure from the rates to the -Exchequer.(c) If a 100 per cent. Exchequer grant were promised at thepresent stage, this would prejudice the position of the Treasury inthe forthcoming negotiations on the general relations between central and local finance.(d) There was undoubtedly a temptation to extravagance inthe provision of school meals and, whatever scheme of control weredevised, this would be much increased if the whole cost fell on theExchequer. In these circumstances there might be something to besaid for a system under which the Exchequer would pay the whole cost of the food, leaving other costs such as staff, fuel, &amp;o, to be met by the local authorities.On the other hand, the following points were made in supportof the views expressed by the Minister of Education : (e) Whatever might have been the intention of the coalition government in making the statements quoted in Appendix A to cp. (46) 74, the impression had undoubtedly been given, both tolocal authorities and to the general public, that the wdiole cost ofproviding school meals would be borne by the Exchequer. Inparticular, the statement made by the Minister of Education(Mr. P. A. Butler) on the 3rd November, 1944, warranted thisinference.(/) In view of the rapidly rising cost of the education serviceand the general upward trend of rates, it was extremely unlikelythat when the review of the relationship between central and localfinance was carried out it would be possible to withdraw block grantaltogether, even from the richer authorities. Accordingly, the pay-ment of a 100 per cent, grant from August 1946 towards the school meals service would not prejudice the position of the Exchequer whenthe review came to be made.(g) If a 100 per cent. Exchequer grant were given, it should bepossible to impose on the local authorities further measures offinancial control which would ensure that there was no extravagance.(h) The proposal that the Exchequer should bear only the costof the food, leaving the organisation of the school meals service as a charge on the rates, might tempt some local education authoritiesto economise on this part of the service by imposing&apos;unreasonableduties on the teaching staff.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that it seemed clear that the statements made on behalf of the coalition government had left with the public and the local authorities thegeneral impression that the Exchequer would bear the whole cost ofthese benefits in kind. It seemed to him, however, that a majorityof the Cabinet were doubtful whether the proposal of a 100 per cent.Exchequer grant for the school meals service was, in principle,acceptable. In these circumstances, the best course would be for theChancellor of the Exchequer to hold further consultations with theMinister of Education and the Secretary of State for Scotland, witha viiewT to seeing whether, in the light of the points made in dis-cussion, they were able to agree on proposals possibly on the lines suggested in the last sentence of paragraph (d) above- which would meet the doubts expressed in the Cabinets discussion.The Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider thisquestion again, in consultation with the Minister ofEducation and the Secretary of State for Scotland, asproposed by the Prime Minister.Post-war Fire 3.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Home.Service. Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. (46) 62)reporting the conclusions reached by the Lord Presidents Committee(L.P. (46) 5th Meeting, Minute 3) on the future organisation of the fire Service.
The Home Secretary recalled that, when the National fire service had been established in 1941, a pledge had been given that- after the war the Service would again become a local authorityresponsibility, though not necessarily a responsibility of the sameilocal authorities as were responsible for it before the war. A. national Fire Service was essential in war-time, and even in peace- time it was clearly the most efficient form of organisation; but, inview of the pledge given and as discussions with the local authority associations had made it clear that they would not release the fGovernment from that pledge, he had felt bound to propose that the \Service should be\restored. to local authority control. In the interestsof efficiency, however, he suggested that the Service should normally be administered (in England and Wales) by the councils of countifesand county boroughs, with provision for special arrangements in areas where an organisation on this basis would not be consistent with the requirements of efficiency. He also proposed that his powers of supervision over the administration of the Service shouldbe substantially increased so as to enable him to prescribe standards of Fire Service cover, training and general efficiency, and to ensurethat pay and conditions of service throughout the country were settled on uniform lines and that there were arrangements for a consistent system of promotion and discipline. The local authoritiesdid not contest the need for these powers, but they had indicated that they would expect them to be accompanied by provision for aGovernment grant towards the cost of the Service. No commitmenthad been entered into with regard to grant, but he was satisfied that,unless all idea of control and supervision of the Service was to be abandoned, the introduction of a grant on the lines of that made towards the cost of the police was unavoidable.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that in Scotland therewas a substantial minority of local authorities in favour of con-tinuing the National Fire Service, but in view of the pledge whichhad been given and the proposals which were being made for england and Wales, he proposed that the administration of the-Service in Scotland should be entrusted to the councils of counties and large burghs, who would be organised in eleven areas, within each of which there would be a single operational unit under jointlocal authority administration. It would clearly be impossible tosecure an efficient Service without a grant, and he was inclined tothink that a 50 per cent, grant would be necessary.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he could not agreethat a grant of anything like 50 per cent, should be given to all localauthorities; and he hoped that the Home Secretary and the Secretaryof State for Scotland would agree to defer any announcement aboutthe rate of grant to be paid until it had been possible to considerthe matter in consultation with the general review of the relationsbetween central and local finance.The Lord President said that he regretted that it should benecessary to discontinue the National Fire Service, which had proved to be a most efficient organisation. In view, however, of the pledgewhich had been given and of the extent to which the functions of localauthorities were being reduced in other directions, he supported theproposals for the transfer of the.Service to the control of the majorlocal authorities. There should be provision for the transfer of theService to the State in the event of an emergency; and the HomeSecretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland should have adequate powder to ensure that the local authorities administeredthe Service efficiently. It would not be possible to pass legislationeffecting the transfer in the current Session and there would there-fore be time for further consultations between the Chancellor of theExchequer, the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forScotland on the form and amount of the Government grant.
The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposal that the Fire Service should betransferred to the control of the councils of counties and county boroughs in England and Wales, and of counties and large burghs in Scotland, subject to the provisionsoutlined in paragraph 6 (a) and (b) of CP. (46) 62.(2) Agreed that the Secretary of State should have power to prescribe standards of Fire Service cover, training andgeneral efficiency, and to settle the pay and main con-ditions of service on standard lines, and to secure a reasonably consistent system of promotion and discipline.(3) Invited the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forScotland to consult with the Chancellor of the Exchequerregarding the formula to be used about government grant in any early announcement to the local authority associations of the decisions recorded in (1) and (2) above;and. thereafter to submit proposals to the Cabinetregarding the form and amount of Exchequer grant tobe paid to local authorities towards the cost of the fire service.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (46) 84) reporting the progress made in the financial discussions which were proceeding in Ottawa.The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that the object ofthese discussions was to negotiate a new loan from Canada of1,250 million Canadian dollars, and to reach a settlement aboutthe 1942 loan and various outstanding claims and counter-claims.Our original proposal had been that both the new loan and the outstanding amount of the 1942 loan should be free of interest andrepayable by fifty annual instalments beginning on the 1st December,1951. The Canadians had been unable to accept this proposal, andhad made the following offer : (i) A new credit of 1,250 millionCanadian dollars on the terms proposed for the United States loan(i.e., 2 per cent, interest and repayment in fifty years, starting fromthe end of 1951, with a waiver clause in respect of interest) but without any of the additional conditions attached to the UnitedStates loan; (ii) The 1942 loan to continue as at present for fiveyears; and (iii) Our liability of 425 million Canadian dollars for theAir Training Scheme to be cancelled, and the settlement of other claims and counter-claims to be met by a cash payment.The Prime Minister had discussed this offer on the26th February with the Ministers most directly concerned; and ithad been decided at that meeting that, subject to the views of theCabinet, the Canadian Government should be asked to consider thefollowing alternative proposals : (i) A new credit of 1,750 millionCanadian dollars at 1 per cent, interest, but subject otherwise to thesame financial terms as the proposed United States loan; (ii) the outstanding amount (500 million Canadian dollars) of the 1942 loan to be repaid from the proceeds of this new credit; and (iii) TheAir Training Scheme to be written off, and other claims and counter-claims to be cancelled against a lump sum not exceeding 100 millionCanadian dollars, to be added to the loan or paid in cash.These alternative proposals had been telegraphed to our dele-gation in Ottawa, and a reply had been received that morning(telegram No. 367, dated the 27th February) reporting the resultsof informal soundings which our delegation had taken with canadian Ministers. These had shown that there was no prospectof securing the agreement of the Canadian Government to thesealternative proposals.In these circumstances the Chancellor of the Exchequer advised the Cabinet to accept the offer of the Canadian Government, as setout in paragraph 3 of CP. (46) 84 and summarised above. Theacceptance   would   be   subject   to   the   two   points   noted   in
paragraph 7 of CP. (46) 84, viz. (a) that the obligations 0fHis Majesty&apos;s Government in respect of that portion of the 1942loan still outstanding at the end of the further period of five years were left open for discussion between the two Governments at theend of that period; and (&amp;) that the claims and counter-claims (otherthan those in respect of the Air Training Scheme) would be cancelledagainst a lump sum not exceeding 100 million Canadian dollars,to be added to the loan or paid in cash uur Delegation beingauthorised to raise this figure to 150 million dollars if that proved necessary to reach a settlement.The Chancellor of the Exchequer added that an early settlement with Canada was desirable from the point of view of repercussions on Congress proceedings in respect of the proposed loan from theUnited States. If it could be said in Congress that we had been unable to reach a satisfactory loan settlement with one of our ownDominions, this would prejudice our prospects of obtaining Con-gress approval for the loan from the United States. On the otherhand, the early acceptance of this Canadian offer would probably have a favourable influence on the forthcoming discussions in congress.In discussion there was general support for the view that this offer of the Canadian Government should be accepted. The offer to cancel the whole of our liability of 425 million Canadian dollars for the Air Training Scheme was specially generous. And thiswas not the first contribution which Canada had made to our needs:their earlier gift of 1,000 million dollars should not be overlooked.In accepting this offer, it would be appropriate for us to indicateour gratitude for the ready assistance which Canada had given us.The Cabinet-Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to instruct our delegation in Ottawa to accept the offer of the canadian government set out in paragraph 3 of CP. (46) 84, subjectto the two points noted in paragraph 7 of that memo-randum.Shipping. 5.   The  Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theFuture Use Minister of War Transport (CP. (46) 83) supplying the informationof the Queen for which they had asked at their meeting on the 25th FebruaryElizabeth. about the manner in which the Cunard White Star Company(Previous intended to refit the Queen Elizabeth for civilian passenger traffic.Reference: The Minister of War Transport said that he had seen the cm. (46) 18th   Chairman of the Company and could now assure the Cabinet that conclusions,     there would be no excessive use of labour or materials in reconvertingMinute 8.)      the Queen Elizabeth for civilian traffic.   Over 90 per cent, of thefurniture and equipment for the liner had been completed before sheleft this country in 1940 and had been stored throughout the war.The accommodation for all classes of passenger would be much moresimple than that in the Queen Mary before the war; and the differences between cabin, tourist and third-class accommodation would be such that there would be a large margin for altering thebalance of the accommodation according to the demands of the post-war traffic.  In short, there would be no undue luxury; and most ofthe fittings and furnishings for the vessel were already available and needed only cleaning and replacing.Points in discussion were : (a) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said thatthe High Commissioner for Australia had asked for an assurance that the release of the Queen Elizabeth from trooping service wouldnot have the effect of reducing the shipping available for there patriation of women and children to Australia.The Minister of War Transport said that he had ascertained from the Australian Resident Minister in London that it would meet Australia^ immediate needs if 1,000 civilian passengers left
this country for Australia in the near future. A large proportionof these could be carried in March, and he therefore undertook tojoin with the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs in givingsuitable assurances to the Australian authorities in London before any official announcement was made about the withdrawal of the queen Elizabeth from trooping service.(b) The Secretary of State for India asked for a similarassurance that there would be no consequential reduction in theshipping available to carry civilian passengers from India.The Minister of War Transport said that this problem wouldnot be affected by the withdrawal of the Queen Elizabeth fromtrooping service.(c) The Secretary of State for War and the Secretary of Statefor Air asked to be assured that sufficient shipping would be avail-able to carry through the increased trooping from the East whichwould resuft from the latest reductions in Service strengths andthe proposed reduction in the period of overseas service in the East.The Minister of War Transport said that the withdrawal ofthe Queen Elizabeth from trooping service would not affect his capacity to carry through the trooping programmes already notified to his Department.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Cunard White Star Company could proceedwith their present plans for reconverting the queen elizabeth for civilian passenger traffic after the endof her present voyage;(2) Reaffirmed the view^ expressed at their earlier discussion on the 21st February (CM. (46) 17th Conclusions,Minute 7), that special care should be taken to explain,both to the Services and to the general public, the reasonsfor proceeding at the present time with the reconver-sion of a luxury liner; and invited the Lord President,in consultation with the Minister of War Transport andthe Service Ministers, to settle the form in which thisdecision should be announced.6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Parlia-mentary Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP. (46) 82)reporting the results of the further consideration which had beengiven, in the light of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on the 25th February,to the provisions for mutual aid in the event of a dispute, whichwere contained in Articles 3-5 of the draft of the proposed treaty with Trans-Jordan.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Coloniesexplained that the points raised in the Cabinets earlier discussion had been fully examined by the Colonial Office, in consultationwith the Foreign Office; and, with a view to meeting the criticismsexpressed, the terms of Articles 3, 4 and 5 of the draft Treaty andof Article 1 of the draft Military Convention had been revised soas to correspond more closely to the provisions of the United nations charter. The revised drafts, which incorporated some of the language used in the United Nations Charter, were set out inparagraph 6 of CP. (46) 82. The Foreign Office fully concurred in the terms of these revised drafts.In discussion it was suggested that the revised draft of Article 4of the Treaty might be further improved by omitting the under-taking that each of the high contracting parties would come to the aid of the other, if attacked by a third part)&apos;, as a measure of collective self-defence. The Article would then impose only ageneral obligation on the contracting parties to concert together the necessary measures of defence if either were attacked by a third party.
It was explained that the revised draft of this Article was designed to impose different obligations in two different situations,viz., in the event of an imminent menace of hostilities, the con-tracting parties would concert together the necessary measures ofdefence; but, in the event of an actual attack on one contracting party, the other would be obliged to give immediate military aid.This was not inconsistent with the provisions of the United nations charter, which contemplated local military alliances for mutualself-defence which would be invoked, without prejudice to subse-quent intervention by the Security Council, in the event of an actual attack or an imminent menace of hostilities.The Cabinet (1) Approved the revised drafts of Articles 3-5 of the draft treaty and of Article 1 of the draft Military Conven-tion, as set out in paragraph 6 of CP. (46) 82;(2) Authorised the Secretary of State for the Colonies to proceedwith the negotiations with the Emir Abdulla of Trans-Jordan on the basis of the draft Treaty and MilitaryConvention annexed to CP. (46) 63, subject to the inclu-sion in those drafts of the revised Articles set out inparagraph 6 of CP. (46) 82.7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for the Colonies (CP. (46) 81) reporting the developmentof opposition in Malaya to the policy announced in the White Paper(Cmd. 6724) on &quot;Malayan Union and Singapore,&quot; issued inJanuary 1946.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Coloniesrecalled that, before the publication of the White Paper, the Rulersof the Malay States had agreed to cede to His Majesty full powerand jurisdiction in their States, so as to enable His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to give effect to their policy for the creation of aMalayan Union and the establishment of common citizenship. the rulers were now seeking to go back on this agreement and were asking that an independent mission should visit Malaya to consult the Sultans and people before any final decision was taken onthe proposals for a Malayan Union. Opposition was also beingvoiced by some sections of the Malay people, not so much againstthe conception of a Malayan Union, as against the proposals for common citizenship. The apprehensions of the Malay peopleseemed, however, to be based on a misunderstanding of the pro-posals; for it was not the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto allow the scheme for common citizenship to result in the sub-mergence of the Malays in their own country by reason of thepolitical influence of the Chinese and Indian populations.The Secretary of State for the Colonies was still satisfied thatthe policy outlined in the White Paper was right and should becarried into effect. He had, however, outlined in paragraph 5 (b)of CP. (46) 81 a possible compromise which might be adopted ifthe opposition to the policy of the White Paper were strongly pressed in the forthcoming debate in the House of Commons on theStraits Settlement (Repeal) Bill.It was the view of the Cabinet that any such opposition whichmight develop in Parliament should be resisted.The Cabinet-Agreed that the policy outlined in the White Paper onMalayan Union and Singapore&quot; should be maintained in spite of the opposition which had since developed in malaya.Malaya.future constitution.(previous reference:CM. (46) 4thConclusions,Minute 3.)
8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (46) 80) proposing that a member of His Majesty&apos;s .Government should pay an early visit to Ottawa and Washingtonfor the purpose of urging the Governments of Canada and theUnited States to increase the target acreages to be sown to wheat in North America for the 1946 harvest.The Lord President said that he had submitted this proposalto the Cabinet as the result of a preliminary discussion at ameeting on World Food Supplies which the Prime Minister had held on the 26th February. The prospective world shortage ofwheat was appalling. For the first half of 1946 the gap betweenworld demand and supply for wheat had increased during the past five weeks at the rate of \ million tons weekly, in spite of all themeasures so far put in hand. And the future position was evenmore serious, since the main exporting countries were throwingtheir stocks into this gap at the rate of nearly a million tons amonth. As a result, it was estimated that their exporting capacitynext year would average 660,000 tons a month less than in thecurrent season. It was obvious, in these circumstances, that no effort should be spared to secure the maximum possible increase inthe acreage sown to wheat for the next harvest; and in about five weeks&apos; time it would be too late to influence the spring sowingsin North America. A main obstacle to be overcome was the producers&apos; fear of over-production; and the most effective meansof countering this would be to place long-term contracts for wheatat fixed prices. He therefore proposed the early despatch of aninfluential mission to Canada and the United States, which couldimpress upon Governments and farmers the urgent need for themaximum possible production of wheat over the next few years, andwould have power to conclude the long-term contracts which wouldovercome the farmers&apos; reluctance to risk a collapse of prices dueto over-production.To give full confidence to the producers, it was desirable that india and other countries should also place long-term contracts for wheat; but it would take some time to concert action with theother importing countries and, as time was so short, we shouldbe justified in acting alone in the first instance in order to cover the needs of the United Kingdom.The Prime Minister said that, if the Cabinet favoured thedespatch of such a mission, he would himself consider whether itshould be headed by a Minister.Discussion then turned on the proposal that long-term contracts for wheat should be placed with the main exporting countries.The following were the principal points raised : (a) The Cabinet were informed that the Canadian Governmenthad already been told that we were willing to buy all the canadian wheat we could obtain at a price of $1-55 up to the end of 1947,and a further indication had been given that we would not allow the price to fall below 11 for a period of four years.(b) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he agreed inprinciple that in present circumstances it was right to make long-term contracts for the purchase of imported wheat at fixed prices;and he suggested, that the Minister of Food should now open negotiations with the Australian Government on the lines of the conversations which he had already held with the Canadians.Australia was a natural source of supply for India; and India couldpay for Australian wheat out of her accumulated sterling balances.He would, however, be reluctant to accept any long-termcommitment to buy United States wheat. The price was higherthan in Canada, and it would be extremely difficult for us to find the dollars required. The latter difficulty would be as great ifthe wheat were destined for India, for we should have to providethe dollar exchange.(c) The Minister of Food referred to the possibility of securingincreased production of wheat in the Argentine.   The difficulty
tihere was that the current prices for maize and rye were higher than for wheat; and it would be necessary to change the price relations ifa greater incentive to grow wheat was to be provided.There was a general agreement that, with a view to safe-guarding wheat imports for British Commonwealth countries,the first step should be to conclude long-term contracts with canada and Australia. It was, however, recognised that, so loneras there was a world shortage of wheat and allocations were madeby the Combined Food Board, there would be strong pressure fromother claimants on supplies earmarked for British commonwealth countries by such long-term contracts with British Dominions; and,in order to reduce that pressure, it would be desirable to concert with other importing countries action to secure increased produc-tion for export from the United States. The method of approach to this second problem, including the proposal to send a british mission to the United States, required further consideration.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Food to explore  at once theGovernment.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange forfurther discussion, at an early meeting of Ministers, ofthe methods of securing increased production of wheat in the other main exporting countries, including the specific proposals put forward in CP.
