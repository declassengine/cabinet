(46) 43rdConclusions,Minute 1.)[3226&apos;3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (46) 218) on the cost of british administration in Germany.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he felt it was his duty to bring to the notice of his colleagues the very heavy cost tothe British Exchequer of the occupation and administration of theBritish Zone of Germany. The cost of the military occupation wasabout  100 million a year. According to the latest estimates, 91 million would be spent during 1946 on essential imports into germany and  10 million on civil administration. Against this there might be receipts of  49 million from exports, though he him-self doubted whether the figure would be so high. Only  2 millionbad been received since the end of the war in Europe, partly becausebills had so far been presented only for about one-third of the goodsexported. Under the Potsdam Agreement we should have been receiving food from the other zones and a share of the proceeds ofother exports from the Russian Zone to countries outside Germany;but nothing had been forthcoming from these sources. On the otherhand, we were dismantling and preparing for delivery to russians reparations industrial equipment in the British Zone. We hadnot as yet taken any industrial equipment for ourselves.We were in urgent need of timber, but as yet we had securedno substantial quantity from Germany, although there wereabundant supplies in the British Zone, both in the Harz Mountainsand near Hamburg.There should also be room for economy in the staff of the control commission, which employed 1,053 persons in London and 22,700 inGermany.We could not continue to bear this heavy expenditure. Weshould seek relief by reducing the strength of the Army of Occupa-tion and of the Control Commission, and by speeding up payment2] b 2
for exports, the delivery of timber and reparations procedure. Hesuggested that the Cabinet should agree in principle that payments from the Exchequer in aid of the British Zone should cease at theend of the financial year 1947-48.*- &quot;&quot;The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that the heavycost of imports and of civil administration in Germany was duefundamentally to difficulties arising out of the Potsdam Agreement.If we had regard only to the interests of the British Zone, we should allow all the coal produced there to be used in the zone for at least some months so as to restore its industrial economy. At present,however, we were exporting large quantities of coal, in accordancewith allocations made by the European Coal Organisation.As regards the presentation of bills for exports, with Treasuryconcurrence no bills had been sent out until April 1946, in default of inter-Allied agreement as to the currency in which paymentshould be made. The task of the Control Commission was difficult and complex; and he thought that, having regard to the difficulties,their work was not unsatisfactory. His staff in London were seriously overworked. As regards staff in Germany, maximumnumbers had recently been determined with the approval of theTreasury. The Commission carried on its budget large numbers ofstaff working for other Departments such as the British IntelligenceObjectives Sub-Committee, the North German Timber Control andthe Investigations Branch of the Finance Division of the Treasury.He agreed with the Chancellor&apos;s suggestion for the maximumtransfer of administration to Germany and the four regional commissioners recently appointed had been specially instructed topress on with that policy.Timber exports were now increasing, and it was expected thatthe target for the year of 700,000 tons would be reached. Therehad been difficulty in obtaining labour, supervisory staff and machinery. Vehicles had required reconditioning and port equip-ment had needed repair. The Timber Control, which had a british staff of little more than 300 in Germany, were now employing about100,000 Germans and a number of Baits had also been selected, fromthe camps for displaced persons, for employment in timber-felling.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that at the invitation ofthe Prime Minister he proposed to circulate to the Cabinet a reporton his recent visit to Germany. He gave the Cabinet a summaryof the contents of that report. He had been particularly impressed by the urgent need for using in the British Zone more of the coal which it produced. Almost every problem there resolved itself intothe need for more coal. He believed that, despite the political diffi-culties and the pressure of the French, it would prove necessaryto declare a moratorium on exports of coal.The Foreign Secretary reminded the Cabinet that it had alwaysbeen assumed that we should get nothing out of the British Zone ofGermany during the first year of occupation. While he appreciated the difficulties to which the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister of Fuel and Power had referred, there were most weightyarguments against taking the measures which would be necessaryto make the British Zone self-supporting. As matters stood atpresent, this would mean a complete break with Russia; and thatwas a major decision with most far-reaching implications. If the potsdam Agreement had to be cast aside, he would prefer that russia should take the initiative in doing so.Coal exports from Germany had been urgently required by france and other Allied countries in Western Europe; and it hadbeen sound policy to give priority to the restoration of their economic life.We might be driven to a major change of policy towards germany; but much would depend on the course of the negotiations at the resumed session of the Council of Foreign Ministers in Paris.He felt strongly that it would not be wise to embark upon any newcourse until the result of these negotiations was known. Mean-while, however, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster might
Germany. 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordDespatch of Privy Seal (CP. (46) 216) reporting the results of his consultationsFamilies to with the Ministers concerned on the proposals previously submittedB.A.O.R. to the Cabinet in CP. (46) 147 for allowing Servicemen and civilians(Previous serving in Germany to be joined by their wives and children.Reference: The Prime Minister first referred to the announcement, whichCM. (46) 42nd had been made in Germany on the 4th June and reported in theConclusions, British Press on the following day, to the effect that a scheme on minute 2.) these lines was awaiting the approval of the Cabinet. This was thesecond occasion on which a premature announcement about thisscheme had been made by the British authorities in Germany, andhe would like to know who had authorised this secondannouncement.The Secretary of State for War said that he understood thatthe announcement had been made because a good deal of unofficialinformation about the scheme was in circulation and it had been thought expedient to make it clear that, even if the scheme were introduced, it could not take effect for some time to come. he undertook, however, to make further enquiries and to submit a written report on the matter to the Prime Minister.The Cabinet then discussed the recommendation made in cp. (46) 216 that the Service Ministers and the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster should be authorised to make the necessary preparations for the scheme outlined in CP. (46) 147, and to announce that that scheme had been approved in principle, on theunderstanding that the movement of families would not begin until they were satisfied that conditions in Germany were sufficientlysettled to justify bringing the scheme into operation.The Minister of Education said that she doubted whether itwould be expedient to send children of school age to Germany; but,if the scheme were to go forward, it was essential that the children should receive proper education. This would be costly in money and would call for the transfer of a considerable number of teacherswell consider the implications for the administration of the British        238Zone if it were decided (a) to depart altogether from the PotsdamAgreement, or (b) to observe that Agreement only to the extent that it did not involve a continuing charge on the British Exchequer.The Foreign Secretary also suggested that the terms ofreference of the Overseas Reconstruction Committee should be amended so as to make it responsible for considering, not only major questions of policy, but also problems of administration in theBritish Zones of Germany and Austria. It would help the Chan-cellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in his difficult task if he could have this assistance from his colleagues. The Committee should meet regularly to review the position in the British Zone; it shouldreceive regular progress reports from the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster; and senior officials from Germany might attend itsmeetings when they were in London.In discussion it was agreed that there would be advantage inreorganising the Overseas Reconstruction Committee on these lines.The Ministers in charge of all Departments having continuingconcern with the affairs of the British Zone should be associatedwith the work of the Committee.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed to defer until after the forthcoming meeting ofthe Council of Foreign Ministers final decisions on the broad issues raised by CP. (46) 218.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would take steps to reorganise the Overseas Reconstruction Committee onthe lines suggested in the discussion.(3) Took note that the Minister of Fuel&apos; and Power would circulate to the Cabinet a report on his recent visit toGermany.
from the United Kingdom. The Cabinet were informed that theMinistry of Education had been consulted and had concurred in therecommendation put forward in CP. (46) 216. The Minister ofEducation said that, even so, it was her personal view that theadvantages to be secured by this scheme would not be worth theexpenditure which it would involve.Other Ministers expressed the view that it would be unwise to embark upon the scheme until conditions in Germany were moresettled and the future of the British administration in Germany was more certain. As a result of the discussion reeorded in the preceding minute, it had been agreed that the Overseas reconstruction committee should review the methods of administration in theBritish Zone, and the results of that review might affect the numbersof British personnel to be employed for a substantial further period in Germany. It seemed desirable, therefore, that the Committeeshould also consider, in connection with that review, the scheme putforward in CP. (46) 147 and 216.The Cabinet Invited the Overseas Reconstruction Committee to considerthe recommendations made in CP. (46) 147 and 216.repatriation of SovietCitizens.(previous reference:CM. (46) 38thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (46) 210) proposing a modification of existing policy regarding the repatriation of Soviet citizens.The Foreign Secretary explained that at the Moscow Conferencein October 1944 Mr. Eden had given an undertaking, with theauthority of the War Cabinet, that we would repatriate to the soviet union all Soviet citizens who had fallen into our hands during the advance of the British Armies through enemy-occupied countries;and it had been our practice to repatriate to the Soviet Union allpersons whom we regarded as coming within the terms of there patriation agreement subsequently concluded with the SovietGovernment at Yalta in February 1945. In January 1946, after discussion on the Overseas Reconstruction Committee, it was agreedthat this policy should be reviewed and that, meanwhile,. BritishCommanders in all European theatres should suspend the forciblerepatriation of Soviet citizens who were unwilling to return to theSoviet Union. After consultation with the Departments concerned,the Foreign Secretary now recommended that the policy of HisMajesty&apos;s Government should be brought into line with thatfollowed by the United States Government, as laid down in the directive annexed to CP. (46) 210. This would mean that we should in future apply the principle of compulsory repatriation only to suchSoviet citizens as were captured in German uniforms, or were members of the Soviet Armed Forces on or after the 22nd June, 1941,and were not subsequently discharged therefrom, or could be shown to have rendered aid and comfort to the enemy.In discussion the following points were raised : (a) Could not an exception be made in favour of Soviet citizens who had worked in the German Todt organisation %The Foreign Secretary said that he would be reluctant to make such an exception, which would add to the numbers of displaced persons to be maintained in the British Zone.(b) Mr. Eden&apos;s original undertaking had been given on behalfof the British Commonwealth as a whole. It would therefore bedesirable to verify that Dominion Governments saw no objectionto the new policy now proposed.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that he doubted whether any of the Dominion Governments were nowdirectly concerned with this matter, but he would be glad if he could have a little more time to verify that none of them need be furtherconsulted.
(c) The Foreign Secretary said that if his recommendations were approved, he would inform the Soviet Government before thenew policy was put into operation.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed in principle that the policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment regarding the repatriation of Soviet citizensshould be modified in the sense recommended in cp. (46) 210;(2) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to arrange for the SovietGovernment to be informed to this effect, as soon as hehad heard from the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs that no further consultation with DominionGovernments was required.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,Qth June, 1946.
