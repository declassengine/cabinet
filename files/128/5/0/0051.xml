The Foreign Secretary said that, as requested at theCabinet&apos;s meeting on the 20th May, he had submitted to the PrimeMinister a report about the directive adopted by the Allied control council in Berlin regarding the liquidation of German militarywar memorials and museums. While he recognised the strength ofthe feeling which had been expressed on this point in the House ofLords, he must point out that this directive embodied a quadri-partite decision reached by all the four occupying Powers and itcould not be modified unilaterally by His Majesty&apos;s government alone.

There was generalagreement with this view.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, for theBritish representatives on the Allied Control Council inBerlin to raise this matter at an early meeting of theCouncil with a view to securing a clearer definition of thescope of the memorials to be covered by this directive.3.

The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the business -which it was proposed to take in the House of Commons in thefollowing week.On the 27th and the 28th May there would be a debate on aGovernment Motion on the future of the Iron and Steel Industry.It was agreed that the Minister of Supply should open the debate;and that the Government spokesmen on the second day should bethe Lord President and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Third Reading of the National Insurance Bill would betaken on the 29th May.On the 30th May, in addition to other business, there would bea debate on a Government Motion relating to Members&apos; Salaries and expenses.

The Foreign Secretary said that, as requested at the cabinet&apos;s meeting on the 20th May, he had submitted to the PrimeMinister a report about the directive adopted by the Allied control council in Berlin regarding the liquidation of German militarywar memorials and museums. While he recognised the strength ofthe feeling which had been expressed on this point in the House ofLords, he must point out that this directive embodied a quadri-partite decision reached by all the four occupying Powers and itcould not be modified unilaterally by His Majesty&apos;s government alone. The directive did, however, give a certain discretion to ZoneCommanders, and he would expect to find that it was being administered with a reasonable latitude in the British Zone.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster confirmed that in theBritish Zone the directive was not being interpreted as requiring the destruction of village war memorials.The Prime Minister said that, even so, it was difficult to defendthis directive against criticisms of the kind which had been putforward in the recent debate in the House of Lords; and he con-sidered that our representatives in Germany should be instructedto take the matter up on the Allied Control Council with a viewto securing a redefinition of the type of Nazi memorial which shouldbe destroyed in pursuance of the general objective of suppressingthe Nazi and militarist traditions in Germany. There was generalagreement with this view.The Cabinet     .Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, for theBritish representatives on the Allied Control Council inBerlin to raise this matter at an early meeting of theCouncil with a view to securing a clearer definition of thescope of the memorials to be covered by this directive.3. The Cabinet had before them a report by the Lord president on his recent mission to the United States and Canada (CP. (46) 202)and the draft of a statement which he proposed to make that after-noon in the House of Commons (CP. (46) 203).The Cabinet took note of the Lord Presidents report and expressed their appreciation of the results which he had achieved in his mission.Discussion then turned on the draft of the statement to bemade in the House of Commons. The suggestion was made thatthis might include figures contrasting our present stocks of wheatwith the probable position in the autumn. It was felt, however,that as the forward estimates were necessarily based on a number[32142-1] b 2
of assumptions, it would be preferable to avoid giving these figures.It was also agreed that it would be inexpedient to give figures of thesupplies promised for the British zone of Germany and for India,since the assurances given on this by the United States Governmenthad still to be endorsed by the Combined Food Board.In further discussion a number of detailed amendments of thedraft statement were suggested and approved.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Lord President to revise the draft statement annexed to CP. (46) 203 to take account of the amend-ments suggested in the discussion; and took note thatthe revised statement would be made in the House ofCommons that afternoon.Germany. The Chancellor of the Ducky of Lancaster said that, althoughthe United States Government had now promised to supply 675,000tons of wheat to the British Zone of Germany, shipments could notbegin to arrive in Germany until the 20th June. The barley and potatoes recently sent to Germany from the United Kingdom wouldenable the administration to carry on for a few more days, but allstocks of wheat and flour in Germany would be exhausted by the2nd June and from then on there would be no bread until wheatarrived from America and there had been time for it to be milledand distributed. In these circumstances he had no alternative butto ask that further diversions should be made from supplies in oron their way to the United Kingdom up to a total of at least100,000 tons of wheat. The amounts so diverted could be replacedout of the shipments promised by the United States.The Minister of Food said that, as the prospects for UnitedKingdom supplies were so uncertain, he could not advise the Cabinetto authorise any further diversions from this country.There was general agreement that any further diversion ofUnited Kingdom supplies must involve serious risks. On the otherhand, it was recognised that the Cabinet must take wider factorsinto account. Unless food was made available in the British zoneto bridge this short gap before the new supplies began to arrivefrom the United States, there would be widespread starvation andj&apos;   &quot; a breakdown of the whole economic machinery of the zone.  Seriousdisorder and rioting were also likely; and our occupying forces might have to be increased, at the cost of retarding the demobilisa-tion scheme. So long as we remained responsible for our zone, wecould not afford a breakdown of the British administration there.And we could not contemplate laying aside this responsibility byreason merely of our difficulty in finding the food supplies requiredto bridge a gap of a few weeks until the end of June, after whichthere was now a good prospect of assured supplies from the UnitedStates.The following points were also made in discussion : (a) This was not the first request that had been made forassistance from United Kingdom resources towards Germany&apos;s food supplies, and the advances made had not been repaid. It waspointed out, however, that this had been due, not to any fault on thepart of the British administration in Germany, but to the fact that exports from supplying countries had fallen short of expectations.There was now a better prospect that the United States would fulfill their latest agreement reached during the Lord Presidents visit to washington.(&amp;) Would not further supplies become available from the\    - American zone of Germany if the rations in the British and american zones were equalised? As the result of the lord presidents visit, the United States Government were now publiclycommitted to this in principle, but the detailed arrangements had still to be worked out between the zone commanders. These discus-sions might be protracted unless the United States Government were invited to impress on their zone commander the need for specialurgency.
81CM. 51 (46)...(c) Were the authorities in the British zone setting their demands too high ? The Cabinet had previously been informed that stocks in the British zone were nearing exhaustion, but no wide-spread breakdown had so far occurred. Was it certain that therewere not still stocks on farms and that the farm population were notliving substantially above the level of the normal ration ?The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that repeatedinvestigations had been made on these points, and he had receivedthe most positive assurances from the responsible authorities inthe British zone that all practicable measures were being taken to collect all the indigenous supplies. He was sure, however, that theadministration would welcome any assistance that could be givento them by experts from, for instance, the Ministry of Agricultureand Fisheries.(d) Both the French and the Americans had criticised our administration of the coalmines in the Ruhr. Might it not be expedient that these and other criticisms should be investigated by independent enquiry?The Minister of Food said that, in spite of the views expressedin the discussion, he could not advise the Cabinet to authorise any-further diversion of wheat from the United Kingdom to Germany.If any such diversion were made, he thought that the cabinet should consider the introduction of bread rationing in this country at: the earliest practicable date.After further discussion The Prime Minister said that it was clear from the discussion that the general sense of the Cabinet wasin favour of sending 75,000 tons of wheat from United Kingdomsupplies to the British zone of Germany, to tide over the short period before shipments began to arrive from the United States.As was customary in matters of such gravity, the responsibility would of course rest with the Government as a whole. It would be understood that the Minister of Food would be empowered to recover this amount from forthcoming United States shipments for germany whenever it became necessary to db so to protect theUnited Kingdom stock position, provided that he should notthereby cause a breakdown of flour distribution in Germany without first referring the matter to the Cabinet.The Cabinet (2) Decided that an advance of 75,000 tons of wheat shouldbe made to the British zone in Germany from stocks atpresent in or destined for the United Kingdom, the advance to be repaid out of the United States ship-ments promised for the British zone.(3) Invited the Minister of Food and the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster to determine when this repaymentshould be made, it being understood that the objectshould be that repayment should be made at the earliest date consistent with avoiding a breakdbwn of flourdistribution in Germany.(4) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theLord President, to consider whether the United StatesGovernment should be asked to impress on their zonecommander the need for urgency in working out detailed arrangements for equalising food rations in the Britishand United States zones.(5) Invited the Minister of Food to submit for considerationby the Cabinet at their meeting on the 27th May his proposals for securing further economies in flour con-sumption in the United Kingdom.The Parliamentary Undersecretary of State for India saidthat the Government of India would be grateful for the efforts which the Lord President had made to secure increased suppliesof wheat for India from the United States; and the supply of1,160,000 tons which had now been promised would constitute a
valuable contribution towards India&apos;s needs in the period up tothe end of September. At the same time, it was his duty to remind the Cabinet that even with this increased supply only about halfof India&apos;s requirements would be met. Further, the shipments from the United States could not be expected to begin to arrive&apos; in&apos;India until the end of July; and it had! already been reportedthat in Madras and Mysore the machinery for distribution wouldbreak down early in June. Food shortages were likely therefore to give rise to serious difficulties in India during the summer.It was vitally important that India should receive the whole of theamount now promised from the United States, and that shipmentsshould begin at the earliest possible date.The Cabinet took note of this statement.Shipping. The Minister of Transport said that, if the United states authorities delivered for shipment the whole of the additional supplies which they had now promised, the programme of wheatshipments from the United States to areas of British responsibility would be increased from 310,000 tons to 830,000 tons. Of theadditional 520,000 tons, he could arrange for all but 220,000 tons to be transported in British ships, in some cases by diversions ofshipping which would involve delay in other programmes. Thisremaining 220,000 tons would have to be carried in ships speciallychartered for the purpose from the United States. He had noreason to believe that he would be unable to charter sufficientships for this purpose; but, if the wheat was to be moved in time,it was essential that he should conclude the chartering arrangementswithout delay.The Cabinet 1(6) Authorised the Minister of Transport to charter additionalshipping from the United States for the purpose oftransporting that proportion of the additional wheat supplies offered by the United States for areas of british responsibility for which British shipping could&apos; not bemade available.Egypt.(previous reference erence:CM. (46) 50thConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs asked whetherthe Foreign Secretary would think it advisable to give to theDominion Ministers, before they left London, some further accountof the progress made in the negotiations for the revision of theAnglo-Egyptian Treaty.The Foreign Secretary said that the situation was changing somuch from day to day that he thought it preferable that he shouldnot make any further statement at this stage to a meeting ofDominion Ministers. He would, however, consider whether it wouldbe expedient for him to take the opportunity of an informal con-versation with Field-Marshal Smuts before his departure from theUnited Kingdom.Publicationof Informa-tion fromCabinetDocuments.5. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Prime Minister(CP. (46) 188) covering a memorandum prepared in the cabinet office on the publication of information from Cabinet documents.This submitted for approval certain guiding principles to determine what use might properly be made by former Ministers in publishedwritings of information obtained by them by virtue of their office in respect of the period of the 1939-45 war and the central themesof defence policy in the years immediately preceding it.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals put forward in the memorandum annexed to CP. (46) 188 and instructed the Secretary ofthe Cabinet to give effect to them.
SelectCommitteeon national expenditure.Publicationof SecretReports.(previous reference:CM. (46) 15thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. At their meeting on the 14th February, the Cabinet had agreed to postpone a decision on the publication of the secretreports of the Select Committee on National Expenditure untilMr. Churchill had returned to the United Kingdom.The Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (46) 190) proposing that the report on tank pro-duction, dated the 9th March, 1944, should now be published.The Lord President pointed out that on the 2nd May, when hehad been questioned about the Motion proposing that all memorandaaddressed by the Select Committee to the Prime Minister shouldbe laid on the table of the House of Commons, Mr. Churchill had stated that he had no objection to the publication of anything whichthe Government did not consider to be detrimental to the interests or security of the nation. The Lord President had also received aletter, a copy of which was annexed to CP. (46) 190, from theMinister of Town and Country Planning, who had been a memberof the Select Committee, suggesting that there could be no justifica-tion for withholding the reports from the House. He had againreviewed the arguments advanced at the Cabinets meeting on the14th February and had come to the conclusion that the right course was to publish the report on tank production. Any pressure to publish the other reports could, he thought, be resisted on the groundthat there was insufficient public interest to justify their publica-tion; but the Government should be prepared, if necessary, to agreeto the publication of all these reports save that on Lignt Alloys.Refusal to publish the latter report could be justified on grounds ofpublic interest.The Cabinet-Agreed that, subject to further consultation with theMinister of Supply, the Lord President should now arrangefor the publication of the Report of the Select Committeeon National Expenditure of the 9th March, 1944, on tank production, together with the Coalition Governmentsreply.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,23rd May, 1946.
