london airport(Heathrow).(previous reference erence:W.M.(44)48thConclusions,Minute 5.)1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs (CP. (46) 4) reporting the conclusionsof the Civil Aviation Committee on the proposals of the Ministerof Civil Aviation for the establishment at Heathrow of the maininternational terminal airport for the United Kingdom.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that after considering a report by an interdepartmental committee of officials(Annex A to CP. (46) 4) the Civil Aviation Committee had agreedthat the site at Heathrow should be developed on the lines proposedby the Minister of Civil Aviation. In particular, they were satisfiedthat there was a case for a triple three-directional runway system,and that with this in view an area of about 1,600 acres should be acquired on the north of the Bath Road, in addition to the largerarea south of that road. They also recommend the acquisition ofpart of the Cranford Park Estate lying between the easternboundary of the proposed airport and Heston Aerodrome : if furtherconsideration of the lay-out showed that this land was not needed for the airport, it could be surrendered. It would also be necessaryto acquire some part of the sludge disposal works near Stanwell.A hybrid Bill would be required, to authorise the acquisition of theland needed for the airport.To ensure the safety of aircraft leaving or approaching the air-port, building development in the vicinity would have to be speciallycontrolled and the Southall gas holder would have to be removed.A new road would have to be constructed connecting the proposedsouthern Slough-Maidenhead by-pass with the Great West Roadat Brentford. It was thought that surface rail access need not beprovided until some experience of the operation of the airport had&apos;been gained, but it was proposed that a scheme should be preparedfor extending the Underground Railway from Hounslow WestStation to the airport.The estimated cost of acquiring the land and carrying out theworks of construction was  25 - 67 millions, and if to this was added the cost of road and underground railway access and of navigationalaids, the all-in cost was likely to amount to about  30 millions. Theconstructional costs had been based on present prices, on the assump-tion that the most up-to-date and economical methods were used,but it had not been possible for the Committee to make any indepen-dent check of the estimates submitted to them and it would bedesirable that the Treasury and the Ministry of Civil Aviationshould exercise a close scrutiny over the costs. The Civil aviation committee had been unable to arrive at any reliable estimate ofthe revenue to be derived from the airport, but they considered that,at the best, it would not do more than cover running costs.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while he acceptedthe need for providing an international airport at Heathrow, he was concerned at the very large expenditure involved. He was not satisfied that a case had been made out for acquiring at this stageany of the additional land north of the Bath Road; and he strongly urged that this part of the scheme should be postponed. He alsohoped that it would be possible to reduce substantially the present estimates of construction costs when specifications of the worksinvolved were drawn up in greater detail, and. for this purpose he asked that the Treasury should be kept in close touch&quot; with the detailed working out of the scheme.Discussion first turned on the question whether, in view of the weather conditions in the Heathrow area and the extent to which thecreation of an international airport would involve the loss of housing accommodation and of valuable agricultural land, it would not be preferable to select an alternative site further out of London. Itwas pointed out that there were strong arguments in favour of sitingthe terminal airport as near as possible to the centre of London.Over fifty sites in the neighbourhood of London had been surveyedand the Ministry of Civil Aviation had no doubt that Heathrowwas the only site within easy reach of London which fulfilled all
the necessary requirements.  Very large sums had already been spent      .on work at Heathrow. &quot; X 3Discussion then turned on the question whether the area north of the Bath Road should be acquired immediately. It was urged,on the one hand, that this part of the scheme would not be developeduntil 1950; and that, in view of the projected legislation for thecontrol of land use and the acquisition of land, there was no reasonto suppose that the cost of acquiring this land would be substantially greater at a later stage than it would be now. It was also suggestedthat, by rearranging the lay-out and removing the terminal buildingsfrom the centre of the site, it might be possible to fit into the areasouth of the Bath Roact all three of the groups of three-directionalrunways. As regards the Cranford Park Estate, it was pointed outthat the Minister of Civil Aviation had not asked that this land should be included in the area required for the airport.On the other hand, it was contended that all previous experience had shown the advisability of acquiring an ample area of land inorder to allow for unforeseen developments. In the opinion of theMinistry of Town and Country Planning, the most economical and satisfactory means of securing that the area north of the Bath Roadwas not developed in a manner which would prejudice the subsequentextension of the airport in that direction was to purchase the areaoutright rather than seek to restrict its development by planningpontrol. It was also urged that, unless the area, north of the BathRoad were acquired forthwith, it would be impossible to plansatisfactorily the development of the main roads in this neighbour-hood. While the Cranford Park area was not required for the airport, it lay between two large of land which would be under public ownership; and from the point of view of good estate manage-ment it was desirable that this narrow strip of land should bebrought under the control of the owner of the two adjacent areas.There would be no difficulty in putting it to profitable use. Asregards the suggestion that all nine runways might be provided in the area south of the Bath Road, it was explained that therewas substantial advantage in placing the terminal buildings inthe centre of the airport; and that, even if this were not done, itwas extremely doubtful whether all the necessary runways could befitted into the area south of the road.Other points in discussion were :  (a) The Minister of Health stressed the importance of main-taining strict control of the constructional costs, from the point ofview of preventing undue competition with house-building in theneighbourhood.(b) The Minister of Civil Aviation said that the constructionof the London airport at Heathrow would not, so far as could before seen, make it unnecessary to use Northholt for civil traffic.(c) The Cabinet were informed that the Minister of Town and country Planning supported the proposals of the Minister of CivilAviation on planning grounds. It was important, however, that the planning authorities concerned should be given early information about the scheme, so that they might adjust the plans which theywere preparing.(d) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was proposedto meet the cost of the scheme out of revenue.It was suggested that the Treasury should consider the alterna-tive of meeting this capital expenditure by loan, and thus spreading the annual charge over a longer period.(e) The Lord Privy Seal pointed out that the proceedings onthe proposed hybrid Bill for the acquisition of land were likely tobe protracted, and emphasised the importance of introducing theBill at a very early date if it was to be passed during the current session.[31201-4]
The Minister of Civil Aviation would have to be prepared togive much closer estimates of the cost involved when the Bill came before Parliament.The Cabinet-(1) Gave general approval to the proposals set out in CP. (46) 4for the development of the London Airport at Heathrow.(2) Authorised the Minister of Civil Aviation to prepare ahybrid Bill for the acquisition of the necessary land,including the land north of the Bath Road and the partof the Cranford Park Estate between the easternboundary of the airport and Heston Aerodrome.(3) Asked the Civil Aviation Committee to examine further the details of the scheme and, in particular, to consider what steps might be taken to reduce the costs of construction.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider further whether the cost of this scheme should be met by loan orout of re venue.2. The Cabinet had before them a note (CP. (46) 6) submittedby the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs as acting Chairmanof the Colonial Affairs Committee, covering a memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies regarding the future of the territories now held under United Kingdom mandate.The main recommendations in the memorandum were : (i) that (a) the African mandated territories (Tanganyika,Togoland and Cameroons) should be placed under trusteeship, provided that satisfactory trusteeship agreements can be negotiated; (b) steps should be takento recognise the independent status of Trans Jordan; and((?) action in regard to Palestine should be deferred pending the report of the Anglo-American Commission;(ii) that Tanganyika, Togoland and Cameroons should not be designated as strategic areas;(iii) that the draft Trusteeship Agreement reproduced in annex III to the memorandum should be approved as abasis for international negotiation for the Africanmandated territories and should be circulated to dominion Governments forthwith;(iv) that this draft should be sent for observations to theBelgian Government in respect of Tanganyika and tothe French Government in respect of Cameroons andTogoland, with copies for information to the other &apos;&apos; BigFive &quot; members, and to the Secretary-General of theUnited Nations Organisation;(v) that the Union of South Africa should also be regarded asdirectly concerned in the future of our mandated territories in Africa and should also receive a copy ofthe draft for its observations;(vi) that an appropriate statement should be made at theearliest suitable moment at the&apos; forthcoming session ofthe General Assembly of the United Nations;(vii) that a similar statement of policy should be made inParliament as soon as it reassembled.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that theseproposals had been carefully considered by the Colonial AffairsCommittee and had their full support.Points in discussion were : 1(a) Would a decision to recognise the independent status ofTransjordan have repercussions on the Anglo-American enquiry on Palestine ? The Foreign Secretary said that this point had beenconsidered, but the conclusion had been reached that it wasInternationalTrusteeship.Territoriesheld underUnitedKingdomMandate.(previous reference:CM. (45) 64thConclusions,Minute 4.)
impossible to defer action in regard to Transjordan until thePalestine enquiry bad been completed.(b) The Cabinet were informed that the proposal thatTanganyika should not be designated a strategic area did notconform to the views expressed by the South African Government.It was felt, however, that they. had not fully appreciated the implications of the matter and a full explanation of the position had already been prepared for transmission to them.(c) As regards recommendation (vi), -the Foreign Secretarypointed out that if he made the proposed statement within thenext few days in his speech at the General Assembly of the united nations, the French Government would not by that time havereached any decision as to the placing of French Cameroons andTogoland under trusteeship. The statement might, therefore, causethem some embarrassment. He had seen M. Bidault, who appre-ciated the urgency of the matter, but feared that he would be unableto obtain a decision from his Government within the next few days.The Secretary of State was strongly of the view that, despite possibleembarrassment to the French, the British statement should be madeas soon as possible so as to keep the initiative in this matter. Therewas general agreement with this view.(d) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs asked that thedraft of the statement to be made by the Foreign Secretary should,if possible, be communicated to Dominion Governments beforehand.The Cabinet- (1) Approved the recommendations in the memorandum as summarised at (i) to (vii) above.(2) Asked the Foreign Secretary to arrange that, if possible, thedraft of his proposed statement was seen by DominionGovernments before it was made.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum (CP. (46) 9)submitted by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs as actingChairman of the Colonial Affairs Committee, covering a draft white paper containing a statement of policy regarding the future con-stitution of the Malaya Union and the Colony of Singapore.It was proposed that the White Paper should be presented assoon as Parliament reassembled so as to be available when the straits settlements (Repeal) Bill was taken. The^ draft White Paperamplified a statement alreadv made in the House of Commons onthe 10th October, 1945.In discussion, the Prime Minister suggested that the referenceto a Governor-General in the final paragraph of the White paper should be either elaborated, so as to give some indication of his duties and responsibilities, or omitted altogether.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to amplifyparagraph 13 of the draft White Paper on the lines suggested and to settle the terms of the revised para-graph in consultation with the Prime Minister.(2) Subject to this amendment, approved the terms of the draft white Paper annexed to CP. (46) 9, and authorised theSecretary of State for the Colonies to present it toParliament at the earliest opportunity.4 The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Fuel and Power (CP. (46) 5) recommending that military labour should be made available for employment in gas works inLondon if there were further severe weather during the coming winter. To obtain full value from military labour so employed, itwas desirable that soldiers posted to the gas works should remainthere until the end of February, and also that they should be
available to work at night as well as by day. The gas undertakings in London were being asked how many soldiers they would need fordealing with such a crisis, and steps were being taken to obtainTrade Union consent to this employment of military labour.The Secretary of State for War said that he agreed in principle with the proposals made in the memorandum. As regards the details,he could not guarantee that the same men would be availablethroughout the period: the requirements of the demobilisationscheme would inevitably lead to some changes of posting : he agreed,however, that changes should be avoided so.far as practicable. Hewas also doubtful whether the best results would be obtained ifmilitary labour were used extensively on night work.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Fuel and Power, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for War, to arrange for military labour to be made available for employment in Londongas works to the extent necessary to maintain the supplyof gas in any emergency due to exceptionally severe weatherduring the coming winter.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,10th January, 1946.
