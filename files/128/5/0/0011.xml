Greece. 1.   The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet of the line(Previous which the Soviet Delegation were taking in the discussions on GreeceReferences: in the Security Council.

(46) 7th of Foreign Ministers, the Soviet Government were pressing their conclusions, claims to Tripolitania and were even indicating some interest in minute 2.)      Eritrea.  They seemed to be seeking to take advantage of the presentsituation   to   extend   their   influence   on   both   sides   of   theMediterranean.It was possible that M. Vyshinsky might ask the security council to pass a resolution calling for the withdrawal of Britishtroops from Greece. The Foreign Secretary said that he wouldresist such a resolution, and he doubted whether it would be carried.He had, however, been considering whether he should volunteer thesuggestion that some Government which had no interest in this dispute e.g., the United States, one of the South American Republicanism-lics or Norway should make an independent enquiry into conditionsin Greece. He would not put forward this suggestion until theSecurity Council had repudiated the imputations which were nowbeing made against British policy in Greece; and he would not doso without first ascertaining that the Greek Government had noobjection. He felt, however, that such an enquiry would serve todispel any remaining doubts about British actions in Greece; andit would also serve as a useful precedent if we wished at any, timeto suggest independent enquiries into conditions in countries subjectto the influence of other Great Powers.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the course which the foreign secretary proposed to follow in further discussions onGreece in the Security Council.Syria and 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that it now seemed likely thatthe Lebanon, the Government of the Lebanon would be unwilling to agree that(Previous any French troops should be retained in their territory; and it was reference: possible that the Levant States would refer to the Security CouncilCM. (45) 62nd the whole question of the withdrawal of French and British troopsConclusions,     from Syria and the Lebanon.Minute 4.) The Foreign Secretary had seen M. Bidault, the French ForeignMinister, and had made it clear that, in his view, British and french troops would have to be withdrawn from the Lebanon as well asfrom Syria. M. Bidault was obviously reluctant to contemplate the withdrawal of French troops from the Lebanon, and askedwhether he could count on British support for a French applicationfor bases in the Lebanon. The Foreign Secretary had said that hewas not prepared to enter into any understandings about futureapplications for military bases.An awkward situation might well arise in this matter. For,while we were willing to withdraw British troops from the Lebanon,neither the French nor the Lebanese would wish to see Britishtroops withdrawn before the French troops were withdrawn. Inthese circumstances the Foreign Secretary proposed to take noinitiative in the matter, but to say, if pressed, that we should be content to accept the decision of the Security Council.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the line which the foreign secretary proposed to take if this matter were brought before the Security Council.
Egypt.commercial and PoliticalTreaties.(previous reference:CM. (46) 7thConclusions,Minute 5.)8. The Foreign Secretary drew attention to a report by-Reuters according to which the Prime Minister of Egypt had saidthat his Government were not prepared to discuss commercialquestions with the United Kingdom unless the United StatesGovernment were represented in the discussions. The EgyptianAmbassador in London had hastened to inform him that there wasno truth in this report and that it should be disregarded. TheForeign Secretary said that he was taking the matter up withReuters.The suggestion had also been made that the agreement on civilaviation should not be negotiated separately from the proposedPolitical Treaty. The Egyptian Ambassador had been advised toinform his Government that we were anxious to conclude the civilaviation agreement without delay and were not prepared to let. thiswait upon the discussions about the Political Treaty.In discussion, it was pointed out that the early conclusion ofsatisfactory Treaties with Egypt, both political and commercial,would assist us in strengthening our influence throughout the middle east. The Foreign Secretary said that from this point of view itwas important that the Treaties should be negotiated with a strongEgyptian Government, so that we might be confident that theywould be ratified by the Egyptian Parliament and would stand fora substantial period without revision. He had reason to hope thata more representative Government might shortly be brought into power in Egypt.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statements.Spain. 4.   The Foreign Secretary said that he was maintaining strong pressure on General Franco, through His Majesty&apos;s ambassador at Madrid, with a view to bringing about a change in the politicalregime in Spain. At the same time, he had instructed His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Lisbon to maintain a strictly neutral attitudetowards the Monarchist and Republican leaders who had now arrived in Portugal for discussions with General Franco or hisrepresentatives. Though we had made it abundantly clear that we wished to see the end of the Franco regime, it was important thatwe should not appear to favour either of the alternatives whichconfronted the Spanish people. There was no clear indicationwhether majority opinion in Spain would favour a Monarchist ora Republican solution; but there was some reason to think that many people in Spain would now prefer a Republican regime ifthey were satisfied that it could be secured without civil war.In this connection the Foreign Secretary said that he would shortly be submitting to the Cabinet a memorandum about an agree-ment, made on behalf of the War Cabinet in 1940, by which we had undertaken not to employ in Spain any representatives of theBritish Council who were not Roman Catholics. There werepresumably good, reasons for concluding this agreement at the time,but it was for consideration whether it should not now be renounced.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Parliament. 5.   The Lord President said that the House of Commons wouldDebate on wish before long to hold a debate on Foreign Affairs. It would beForeign helpful if, before the debate, the Foreign Secretary would addressAffairs. a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party, so that government supporters might be more fully informed of the reasons underlyingcertain aspects of our foreign policy.
The Foreign Secretary said that he would be willing to addresssuch a meeting. He hoped, however, that it would be possible to postpone the debate in the House of Commons until after the departure from London of&apos; the delegates to the First general assembly of the United Nations Organisation.The Lord President said that he would do his best to delay the debate, as suggested by the Foreign Secretary.6. The Foreign Secretary said that the Overseas Reconstruc-tion Committee had been considering a difficult situation whichhad arisen in the quadripartite discussions in Berlin about thefuture level of industrial production in Germany. The figuresproposed by the British representative had been scaled downsubstantially in these discussions, and there was a serious risk that german production would be reduced to a level which would impose a continuing charge on the British tax-payer in respect of essential imports into the British zone. The Foreign Secretary had therefore proposed to the United States Government a new approach to this problem, which would distinguish between measures required forthe short-term or reparations stage and those to be imposed undera plan for long-term control of the level of industrial productionin Germany. The views of the United States Government on this new formula had now been received.The Prime Minister said that this raised issues of far-reachingimportance which ought to be considered by the Cabinet.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to submit to them the recom-mendations of the Overseas Reconstruction Committee forresolving the difficulties which had arisen in the quadri-partite discussions in Berlin about the future level ofindustrial production in Germany.Germany.Level ofIndustrialProduction.(previous references:CM. (45) 31stConclusions,Minute 5; andO.R.G.(46)2ndConclusions,Minute 3.)Austria. 7.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum (CP. (46) 34),Revision of submitted by the Foreign Secretary as Chairman of the OverseasAllied Control Reconstruction Committee, regarding the future scope of AlliedAgreement. control in Austria.The Foreign Secretary said that, as there was now a freelyelected Government in Austria, the extent of Allied control shouldbe modified; and the Overseas Reconstruction Committee recom-mended that the British representative on the Allied control council in Vienna should take the initiative in proposing a new agreement in the terms of the draft annexed to CP. (46) 34.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that it was unlikely that the ether occupying Powers would accept all theproposals contained in this draft Agreement. He wished, therefore,to be authorised to inform our representative on the Council thathe would be prepared to consider reasonable modifications requiredto meet points raised in the negotiations.   This was agreed to.The Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster toauthorise the British representative on the Allied control council in Vienna to put forward for discussion by theCouncil proposals &quot;for a new Control Agreement forAustria in the terms of the draft annexed to CP. (46) 34.
The Cabinet had before them : a memorandum by the Minister of Civil Aviation(CP. (46) 37) on the question whether the UnitedKingdom Delegation to the Anglo-American Conferenceon Civil Aviation at Bermuda should be authorised to sign the draft agreement which had emerged from these discussions; anda memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(CP. (46)39) supporting the view that the UnitedKingdom Delegation should be authorised to sign theagreement.The Minister of Civil Aviation explained that the original purpose of these discussions at Bermuda had been to explore apossible basis for a bilateral agreement with a view to subsequent negotiations on the Ministerial plane. Soon after the discussionsbegan, however, it became clear that the United States delegation were aiming at reaching a final agreement at Bermuda, and pressure to conclude an agreement had been exerted by reference to the effect which the outcome of the discussions must have on the debate in congress on the Anglo-American loan. From the point of view ofcivil aviation, he could not recommend his colleagues to accept thedraft agreement reproduced in Appendix IV to CP. (46) 37. this draft represented a fundamental departure from the policy whichhad hitherto been common ground among Commonwealth countries,it was likely to place B.O.A.C. in an unfavourable position, and theprinciples laid down in it to meet the point of view of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would not be enforceable in practice. In particular,the United States Government had at present no power to regulaterates; and, although the United States Delegation had promised that their Government would seek to obtain these powers, there wasno guarantee that Congress would be willing to grant them. Again,the United States Government had no power to regulate the capacity which a given operator could place on a route; and this seriouslyundermined the conditions on which it was proposed to grant FifthFreedom rights. If the principles of the Agreement were violatedwe could only protest ex post facto or denounce the Agreement.Nevertheless, if the Cabinet felt that the signing of the agreement was of vital importance from the point of view of our general relations with the United States and the consideration of the loanagreement by Congress, he was willing that our Delegation shouldbe authorised to sign.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was satisfied thatthe immediate signature of the Agreement would have a powerfuleffect on the consideration of the loan agreement by Congress, andfor this reason he would urge the Cabinet to authorise the UnitedKingdom Delegation to sign. Even from the point of view of civilaviation, however, it seemed clear to him that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment were not likely to secure anything better than the draftrecommended by the United Kingdom Delegation. While it mightbe true&apos; that the United States Government had not all the powersnecessary to enforce the agreement, it should be remembered that article 6 of the draft gave His Majesty&apos;s Government freedom to withhold or revoke the exercise of the rights conferred by the agree-nient in the event of failure to fulfil the conditions under whichthese rights were granted, and that under Article 13 it was opento His Majesty&apos;s Government to give notice to terminate the agree-ment at the end of a year.The Foreign Secretary said that, while he agreed that the draft agreement was not entirely satisfactory and would be difficult todefend in Parliament, he saw no hope of obtaining better terms;and, in view of the weakness of our position, due to the delays inthe production of suitable British civil aircraft, there seemed to beno alternative but to-accept this draft. For some time we had tried,through our diplomatic representatives abroad, to dissuade foreign government from granting Fifth Freedom rights to the UnitedCivil Aviation.BermudaConference.(i)(ii)
States, but it had become increasingly difficult to take this linewhen we had no inducements to offer to these Governments, and if&quot;an agreement were concluded in the fprm proposed we should haveto abandon this policy.The President of the Board of Trade said that he was opposedto acceptance of the draft agreement and thought it would be better to rely, at any rate for the present, on individual agreements withthe United States operators. His main objection was to the grantof Fifth Freedom rights, which was inconsistent with our agree-ments with the Dominions and with the line which we had taken with foreign Governments. Moreover, this agreement would enablethe United States operators to build up a position in this country from which it would be virtually impossible to dislodge them. TheUnited States Delegation had refused to accept the proposal madeby the Minister of Civil Aviation in his telegram of the22nd January (No. 13 Calib) that there should be no &quot; change ofgauge,&quot; with the result that it would be possible for United Statesoperators to compete directly with our European services by runningfleets of smaller aircraft operating to the continent of Europe fromthe airports at which their trans-Atlantic aircraft landed in thiscountry.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that weshould have great difficulty in defending this agreement to theDominion Governments. He also drew attention to the request ofthe United States Delegation for a provision in the agreementbinding His Majesty&apos;s Government to use their good offices to persuade Canada and Newfoundland to make satisfactory civilaviation agreements with the United States. It would clearly beimpossible to include any such provision in the agreement. At most,we could only offer a verbal assurance that we would do our best tofacilitate agreements with Canada and Newfoundland.The Prime Minister said that earlier in the day he had receiveda message from the United States Ambassador to the effect that thePresident was most anxious that the agreement should be signed.There was no doubt that, from the point of view of the loan debate in Congress, it was desirable that an agreement should be concluded with the United States Government. At the same time, it wouldbe very difficult to defend in Parliament an agreement on the linesof the draft in Appendix IV to CP. (48) 37, and it was essentialthat, before the Cabinet reached a final decision, they should under-stand clearly what was involved in the grant of Fifth Freedomrights, with particular reference to the refusal of the United StatesGovernment to agree to the principle of &quot; no change of gauge.&apos;&apos;The proposal that Flis Majesty&apos;s Government should use their good offices to persuade the Canadian and Newfoundland Governments toreach agreements with the United States Government also required further consideration. He accordingly proposed that the CivilAviation Committee, with the addition of the Chancellor of theExchequer, should examine these points and any other doubtfulpoints arising from the draft, with a view to the submission of anearly report to the Cabinet.The Cabinet Invited the Civil Aviation Committee, with the Chancellorof the Exchequer, to review the matter in the light of theCabinet&apos;s discussion and to submit an early report-to theCabinet.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,4:th February, 1946.
