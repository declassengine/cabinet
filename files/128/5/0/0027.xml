2. The Foreign Secretary said that he had continued to.insist that there should be no postponement of the date previouslyfixed for the holding of elections in Greece. As suggested at the cabinets meeting on the 18th March, he had issued a full state-ment explaining the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in thismatter and summarising the action taken to ensure that theelections could be held under conditions allowing the free expression of political opinion. All his official information indicated thatthe conditions for the holding of the elections were as favourablenow as they were likely to be for some time to come.There were indications that the balance of world opinion was now inclining towards support of the policy adopted by HisMajesty&apos;s Government in this matter. It would be helpful if some public approval of this policy could be voiced by government supporters. The Prime Minister asked that members of theCabinet should make a point of attending the meeting of theParliamentary Labour Party on the 27th March at which theForeign Secretary would be speaking on this question.Greece.(previous reference:CM. (46) 25thConclusions,Minute 7.)United StatesRequest forBases.(previous reference:CM. (46) 7thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to reports thatthe Soviet Government might challenge in the Security council the action of the United States Government in seeking to securemilitary bases in Iceland. What would our attitude be if thisquestion were raised in the Security Council?The Foreign Secretary said that at an earlier stage he had suggested to the United States Government that they should contentthemselves for the time being with seeking a year&apos;s renewal of theexisting lease of their bases in Iceland, and thus avoid prejudgingthe principle that fresh arrangements for military bases should now,as a general rule, be made within the framework of the securityprovisions of the United Nations Charter. The United StatesGovernment were, however, subject to considerable pressure fromtheir military staffs, and they had been unwilling to make a purely temporary arrangement on the lines which he had suggested.His own view was that it would be sufficient if an agreement were reached by which these bases in Iceland could be used for civilaviation purposes by all countries operating air services across the atlantic. He had made the same suggestion in respect of the bases in the Azores: but the United States Government were nowproposing they should have exclusive rights to one of those bases.He doubted whether the Portuguese Government would accept such a proposal. But an arrangement by which the United states had exclusive rights in one of the two bases in the Azores, and[31633-3] b 2Persia. 1.   The Foreign Secretary said that, on the eve of the Security(Previous        Council&apos;s meeting,  the  Soviet  Government had  broadcast  anDeference:      announcement that the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Persia0,3(1.(46)25th   had begun and could be completed in five to six weeks if nothingConclusions,     unforeseen occurred.   This might imply a change of policy on thejlinute 3.)      part of the Soviet Government there had been a later report that soviet troops were also withdrawing from Manchuria.    On theother hand, the phrase &quot; if nothing unforeseen occurred &quot; left theSoviet Government with ample opportunity subsequently to qualifythis promise of early withdrawal; and the announcement might havebeen made with a view to gaining time in which to press their demands on the Persian Government.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he had sent to the&apos;Foreign Secretary, as requested at the Cabinets meeting on the&apos;18th March, a report on the suggestion that oil companies operating in Persian Azerbaijan might be able to draw oil awray from the1&apos;Russian oilfields at Baku. He had also sent a copy of this reportto the Prime Minister, who would no doubt consider whether itshould be circulated to the Cabinet.
Great Britain had similar rights in the other, would be regarded with suspicion by the Soviet Government. Generally, the policywhich the United States Government had been following irf respectof military bases seemed likely to provoke the Soviet Governmentto take similar unilateral action with a view to securing bases inislands belonging to Denmark and Norway.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.World Food 4,   The Minister of Food made a preliminary report on hisSupplies. discussions in Washington regarding the allocations of wheat and(Previous        rice for the current period.reference: The Combined Food Board had been faced with a very difficult.0.M.(46)2lst task. The stated wheat requirements of importing countries for conclusions.) the six months ending on the 30th June amounted to someyisit of 21 million tons, against which supplies of only 13 million tonsMinister of were available, including the 500,000 tons promised by Russia to food to France and also a quantity of coarse grains which could be usedUnited States. for human consumption. The stated requirements of rice were,100,000 tons for the second quarter of the year against estimated!supplies of only 547,000 tons, and even this figure assumed an exportfrom Siam which might not be realised.Under the wheat allocations which the United States and canadian Governments had agreed to take as a working basis forthe present, the United Kingdom would receive in full the allo-cation for which he had asked. India would receive 1,400,000 tonsof wheat, which represented a large increase on their previous allo-cation, though it fell far short of their latest demands. The IndianFood Delegation were not content with this and would raise thematter at a meeting of the London Food Council on the following day.The rice allocation to India was only 150,000 tons. This was less than they had asked for, though they had agreed to reduce their stated requirement from 500,000 to 200,000 tons. OtherLondon Food Council countries would receive enough to meet theirminimum requirements if in the event supplies from Siam reachedthe total assumed.As regards future years, the Minister thought there was little hope of a substantial increase of the wheat acreage in the UnitedStates for the coming harvest. They were planning for an addi-tional one million acres under wheat, one million acres under maize,and one million acres under soya beans. They were afraid thatany further increase would lead to dust-bowl conditions. Simi-larly, he saw no prospect of a substantial increase in Canada. TheCanadian Minister of Agriculture had protested strongly againstoutside interference with Canada&apos;s agricultural policy.The oils and fats position had also been discussed in washington. The United States authorities were disposed i-0think that, before they were asked to assist, we ought to do more to help ourselves. They had suggested that the possibilities of export from West Africa, Sumatra and New Guinea might befurther explored. The Minister doubted whether there was muchto be gained from this and thought that some temporary reductionin the United Kingdom ration would be inevitable. The decisionof the Government of India to prohibit the export of ground-nutswas preventing them from fulfilling their contracts; and he pro-posed to discuss with the Indian Food Delegation whether theycould not permit some export.The United States Government were doing their best to secureeconomies in food consumption. They hoped to reduce bread con-sumption by 40 per cent, and consumption of oils and fats by20 per cent. There was no hope of their reintroducing rationing,since the whole of their organisation for rationing had, been dis-&apos;    banded.
The following points were made on the Ministers state-ment : (a) It was suggested that to bring pressure to bear on Indiato export ground-nuts at a time when India was threatened withfamine would have most unfortunate political implications.The Minister of Food said that he was advised that the extentto which Indians could use ground-nuts as a foodstuff to replacecereals was limited. He would, however, bear the political pointin mind in his further discussions with the Indian Delegation.(&amp;) The Minister of Food had suggested sending a specialMission to the Argentine. Ministers had discussed this questionduring his absence in Washington; and it had been proposed that,in the first instance, further enquiries should be made by ourCharge d&apos;Affaires in the Argentine. The Minister of Food was invited to ascertain from the Foreign Secretary how this now stood.Discussion then turned to the question of a debate in Parlia-ment.The Lord President said that he thought there would be pressure to hold a debate in the following week or, at the latest&quot;,the week after. A White Paper was now in preparation and, if itwas at all possible, it would be well for this to be published somedays before the debate. The draft of the White Paper was comingbefore a meeting of Ministers on Food Supplies on the following morning. It was agreed that a decision as to the date of the debate could be deferred until after that meeting. A broadcast talk might also be desirable, but that should not be given until after the debate in Parliament.The Cabinet Took note of this preliminary report by the Ministerof Food, and invited the Prime Minister to arrange fora more detailed consideration of the position at a meetingof Ministers on World Food Supplies.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theForeign Secretary (CP. (46) 119) regarding the use of the veto inthe Security Council.The Foreign Secretary said that he had now had an oppor-tunity to review the procedural difficulties which had arisen duringthe First General Assembly of the United Nations Organisation.He was satisfied that only a limited improvement could be made without amendment of the United Nations Charter.   This&apos; wouldrequire the agreement of all the five permanent members of theSecurity Council; and he felt sure that to propose such an amend-ment at the present time would do more harm than good to thefuture of the United Nations Organisation.   The situation might,however, be improved by the adoption of an additional rule ofprocedure supplementing Article 34 of the Charter by definingwhat constituted a &quot; dispute&quot; as distinct from a    situation.&quot;   Itwould also be helpful if a State desiring to bring a dispute or a situation before the Council were required to furnish a full written statement of its case at the outset.   Draft rules giving effect tothese two suggestions were set out in the Annex to the memoran-dum.   He proposed, subject to the Cabinet&apos;s views, to instruct ourPermanent Representative on the Security Council to propose these additional rules, after discussing them with his United Statescolleague on the Council.The Lord Chancellor said that he doubted whether the draftrules set out in the Annex to CP. (46) 119 would fully secure the objects which the Foreign Secretary had in view. Chapter VI ofthe Charter dealt with both &quot; disputes &quot; and &quot; situations &quot;; and what seemed to be required was a rule of procedure which would
distinguish between these matters coming under Chapter VI and!circumstances constituting a threat to international peace within!the meaning of Chapter VII.The Foreign Secretary said that, if the Cabinet approved the objects which he had in view, it would be convenient if his legal advisers could discuss with the Lord Chancellor how the proposed new rules of procedure could best be drawn to secure those objects.Since his memorandum was circulated, he had received notice of anumber of procedural points which the Soviet Government were proposing to raise. He would be glad if the Lord Chancellor could take these into account at the same time.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed in principle that an attempt should be made tosecure amendment of the rules of procedure of theSecurity Council on the general lines suggested in cp. (46) 119.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor to discuss with the foreign secretary&apos;s legal advisers how the draft rules annexed to CP. (46) 119- could best be adapted to secure the objects set out in that memorandum; and to take intoaccount the proposals which were to be put forward bythe Soviet Government for amendment of the existingrules.(3) Authorised the Foreign Secretary, after considering theresults of the discussions to be held under conclusion (2)above, to instruct our Permanent Representative on theSecurity Council to put forward, after consulting hisUnited States colleague, proposals for amendment of theCouncil&apos;s rules of procedure designed to secure the objects set out in CP. (46) 119.VictoryCelebrations.(previous reference:CM. (46) 15thConclusions,Minute 8.)HotelCharges.6. Reference was made to the possibility that hotels, &amp;c, inLondon might make excessive charges for accommodation during theperiod of the Victory celebrations. Was there any power to controlsuch charges?The Cabinet-Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the official committee on Victory Celebrations to consider what action could be taken to prevent hotels, &amp;c, in London from making excessive charges for accommodation during theperiod of the Victory celebrations.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,25 March, 1946.
