World wheat supplies.(previous reference:CM. (46) 43rdConclusions,Minute 2.)The Cabinet had before them telegrams from the Lord President(Nos. 3232 and 3233 of the 17th May) reporting the results of his mission to Washington on the world wheat situation.The Lord President reported that in the period May-September1946 there was bound to be a critical shortage of grain, and the account could be balanced only by imposing drastic cuts on thedemands of the importing countries. He was, however, satisfiedthat the United States authorities were at last showing a realdetermination to increase their exports of bread grains and wereaccepting a substantial amount of inconvenience and dislocationfor this purpose. In particular, they had now made the adjustment which we had been pressing upon them in the price relation between bread grains and animal feeding-stuffs; and it was expectedthat a sharp reduction in the feeding of cereals to animals would follow. The United States authorities were, however, expecting theUnited Kingdom to make some further contribution towards theworld&apos;s needs; and, while they were prepared to defend a high degree of special treatment for the United Kingdom and did not press for any further cuts in our levels of food consumption, they felt unable to accept a situation in which the stocks of wheat and flour in the United Kingdom would continue to be considerably higher than in any other importing country or indeed, by theircontention, than in the United States. The discussions in washington had shown that the Americans would not accept any settlement involving a reduction of less than 200,000 tons in. theprogramme of wheat imports into the United Kingdom. The lord president had argued that, if our import programme were reducedby that amount, it would be necessary to introduce further economies in consumption in this country; and on this point he had receivedassurances from the United States authorities that, if we accepted this cut and met it partly by measures other than stock reduction,they would not on this account make any &quot;further attack on the levelof wheat stocks in this country.In these circumstances the Lord President asked the Cabinet toauthorise him to accept a reduction of 200,000 tons in the pro-gramme of wheat imports into the United Kingdom up to the30th September, 1946, on the basis that the United States Govern-ment would agree to wheat allocations for that period of 675,000tons for the British Zone of Germany and 1,200,000 tons for Indiaand would, in addition, adhere to their earlier promises to repayour loan of 200,000 tons of wheat and to supply the amount by whichwheat shipments from Canada to the United Kingdom fell short ofthe amount promised for the month of July.In discussion it was stressed that the requirements of the UnitedKingdom and the British Zone of Germany could not be wholly met without the help of the United States. It was thus entirely within their power to force on us the decision which they now asked usto take voluntarily. If we accepted the proposal now made, weshould, in exchange for our sacrifice, have an assurance of support from the United States Government for the despatch of 675,000tons to Germany, which was the quantity required to maintain thepresent ration level until September, and 1,200,000 tons to India,which at least went some way towards meeting her requirements.If, on the other hand, we rejected the proposal, should we be in anybetter position ? We should not be any better off ourselves, in that atleast the same sacrifice would be imposed on us; we should have no assurance that supplies would be forthcoming for the British zone of Germany or for India; and, in addition, we should have forfeitedthe goodwill and support of the United States.Ministers agreed that the matter could not be considered solelyfrom the point of view of the United kingdom&apos;s  own needs. Wecould not avoid our responsibilities either for India or for theBritish Zone of Germany. As regards Germany, though it was truethat others could be blamed if there were-starvation in the british zone, the practical responsibility for the consequences would fall onthe United Kingdom and we should be forced to take some steps to mitigate the situation.
The Minister of Food emphasised that any further reduction .in the quantities of wheat available to us during the coming months would cause grave difficulties. Even on the most optimistic assump-&quot;tions, our stocks at the end of September would fall far below thefigures which had hitherto been regarded as a reasonable minimum.They would almost certainly be insufficient to make it possible tokeep all the mills in this country in full production. If, therefore,the Lord Presidents recommendations were accepted, he would feel bound to advise that further economies should be introduced forth-with to offset the reduction in our imports.It was agreed that the precise nature of further economies couldbe considered at a later meeting, at which Ministers could also have before them a report on the effectiveness of the various measures of economy already taken.Discussion then turned on the minimum level of stocks withwhich we could in fact carry on in an emergency. The followingpoints were made : (a) The minimum figure previously accepted by Ministers had assumed the continuance of normal working. In a temporary crisisit should be possible to manage with less. The mills themselvescarried only a small part of the stocks, the greater part being at the ports. Would it not be possible, by co-ordination of effort and closeorganisation of internal transport, to ensure that the mills continuedworking, even when the total stock was much lower than at present ?(6) Moreover, there were stocks which were not included in thetotal of stocks controlled by the Ministry of Food. Thus, it was saidthat there were still substantial stocks on farms. The Minister ofAgriculture had evidence that some farmers were now findingdifficulty in selling their wheat. It might be that the reduced pro-duction of flour for special purposes, such as biscuits, had caused a reduction in the demand for soft wheat and that millers were reluctant to take larger quantities of it for flour for bread. It wasagreed that this matter should be explored forthwith and that means should be devised for drawing off all remaining supplies of wheat from the farms.(c) The stocks of flour held by bakers were understood to amount to some 130,000 tons. During a short emergency would it not be possible for bakers to run on a smaller stock ?(d) Again, would it not be possible by special efforts toincrease the quantity of home-produced wheat from the new cropwhich came on to the market in August and September ? Thiswould? serve to increase stocks during the most critical period.The Cabinets conclusions were as follows : (1) The Prime Minister should inform the Lord president that the Cabinet accepted the recommendations madein his telegrams 3232 and 3233 of the 17th May, viz.,that the wheat allocation for the United kingdom during the period up to the 30th September, 1946,should be reduced by 200,000 tons, in return for allocia-tions of 675,000 tons for the British Zone of Germanyand 1,200,000 tons for India over the same period, andfor renewed assurances that the United States wouldrepay our earlier loan of 200,000 tons of wheat andwould also supply the amount by which Canadian wheatshipments to the United Kingdom fell short of theamount promised for July 1946;(2) The Agriculture Ministers,&apos; in consultation with theMinister of Food, should take immediate steps to drawoff all remaining stocks of wheat from farms in theUnited Kingdom, and should report to the Cabinet themeasures taken for this purpose and- the amounts likelyto be secured;(3) The Minister of Food should institute forthwith an enquiry designed to establish the lowest level which itwould be possible to accept, in an emergency, as the&quot; minimum werking stock &quot; of wheat in the United
Kingdom; and should concert with the other Depart-ments concerned measures to mitigate the effects ondistribution, &amp;c, of operating on a low level of wheatstocks;(4) The Agriculture Ministers should arrange for the earlythreshing of a substantial proportion of this year&apos;sharvest in the United Kingdom, in order to ensure thatthe maximum supplies of home-grown wheat wouldbecome available for consumption in the early autumn;(5) The Minister of Transport should verify, and report tothe Cabinet, that shipping could be provided to importall the wheat destined for the United Kingdom, underthe latest programme, in the period up to the30th September, 1946;(6) The Minister of Food should submit to the Cabinet anearly report on the effects of the various measures already taken to secure economy in the consumption of bread;(7) The Prime Minister should arrange for Ministers toconsider, at a meeting during the following week,what further economies could be made in the con-sumption of cereals in the United Kingdom to meet thislatest reduction of 200,000 tons in the programme ofwheat imports into this country.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,17th May, 1946.
