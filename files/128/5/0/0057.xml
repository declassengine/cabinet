Anglo-EgyptianNegotiations.(previous reference:CM. (46) 52ndConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (46) 219) on the negotiations for a revision of theAnglo-Egyptian Treaty.The Foreign Secretary said that this memorandum had beenprepared after discussion with the Secretary of State for Air andnis advisers who had returned from Cairo. It was clear that theEgyptian Delegation would not agree to embody in a new Treatyclauses giving us the right on a threat, or actual outbreak, of war to send troops into the country or to have military facilities ofthe type given by the 1936 Treaty. Nor would they be ready toinclude the alternative provisions which we desired regarding themaintenance of installations and facilities in time of peace. Theirattitude was that we could obtain the substance of our requirementsthrough the medium of staff conversations and agreements betweenthe military authorities. It was now for the Cabinet to considerwhether or not we should be prepared to accept something on theselines. He realised the dangers of acceptance. At the same time,he felt that in practice the implementation of any defence schemeshort of the peacetime occupation of the country by our forces(which we had agreed must come to an end) was dependent on egyptian goodwill. He had therefore attempted, in Articles 4, 5and 6 of the draft Treaty annexed to his memorandum, to providefor consultation on defence matters through the medium of a joint defence Board on the analogy of the United States-Canada defence board. A protocol would be attached to the Treaty providing forthe terms of the evacuation and Articles III and IV of the draft ofthis protocol, which was also attached to his memorandum, providedfor the evacuation to be co-ordinated with the plans for the future to be drawn up by the military Staffs.The Foreign Secretary said that his draft Treaty was anadaptation of an earlier draft to which Sidky Pasha had personallyagreed, and he thought that the proposal now introduced for aJoint Defence Board might also appeal to the Egyptians. Whilethe first reaction of the delegation had been unfavourable, the king had been attracted by it. On the one hand it would carry with it no implication of inferiority and, on the other hand, it wouldgive Egypt an assurance regardng her own defence.In drafting these Articles he had had it in mind that Egyptmight herself be associated under the Covenant of the Arab Leaguewith other Arab States in a regional security organisation and thatour association with her in a Joint Defence Board might open the way to association with that regional organisation. He had also had it in mind that agreement on these lines might form a useful precedent in the negotiation of a Treaty with India.The Secretary of State for Air said that, having discussedmatters fully with every member of the Egyptian delegation, withthe King and with many prominent Egyptians, he had no doubtwhatsoever that the Egyptians were unanimously of the opinionthat the new Treaty could not include provisions which wouldappear to place Egypt in a position of inferiority. They were,however, perfectly ready to consider any proposal for a treaty between equals.The Secretary of State pointed out that the 1936 Treaty onlyentitled us to keep forces in Egypt for the defence of the Canal.During the war we had enjoyed facilities far in excess of these and we still maintained in the country a large headquartersorganisation and air bases for long-range attack. He understoodthat we now had some 200,000 troops* in the country, in additionto 100,000 prisoners of war. We could not pretend that the existingTreaty entitled us to all the facilities we now enjoyed and wecould not expect to obtain recognition of them in the present nego-tiations. The only argument we could use to persuade the Egyptiansto cede them to us in the Treaty was that we enjoyed them atthe moment and would not willingly give them up.   The Cabinet* See later comments on this figure by the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff in CM. (46) 58th Conclusions.
must realise that the alternative to a Treaty on the lines nowproposed would be an Egypt united in hostility to us and supportedby the Arab world.The very large number of British troops at present stationed in the centre of Cairo and Alexandria was, understandably, a constant irritant to the Egyptian public; and it was of the greatest importance that, without waiting for the result of the negotia-tions, as many as possible of these troops should be moved as soonas possible either out of the country or to some place where theywould be less conspicuous. It should be possible in a matter ofa few weeks to hand back to the Egyptians buildings in the centre of Cairo at present occupied by us, for instance, the Citadel, andthe more than could be made of any such gesture the better.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the Chiefsof Staff had not yet had time to consider the Foreign Secretary&apos;draft as fully as they would wish. When the proposal had beenmade that we should agree to evacuate Egypt, the Chiefs of staff had understood that we had hoped to obtain complete freedom toreturn in an apprehended emergency. It now appeared, however,that we were not to obtain even this. He felt that we had embarked on a slippery slope of concessions. Our first concession, designedto secure the goodwill of the Egyptian negotiators, had not been successful. It was now suggested that we should make a second.Was there any assurance that it would be successful either ? Hecould not but remember the analogy of the Irish ports.In his view, the proposals for a Joint Defence Board gave usno firm assurance. The Board could only &quot; advise and recommend &quot;action to the two Governments. It might well be that the advice of the Egyptian members of the Board would carry little weightwith their Government. Moreover, any agreements made wouldnot be published, and there would be nothing to prevent a future government from refusing to implement them.Finally, he emphasised that in the conditions of modern war itwas more than ever important for defence purposes to be readywith our defence preparations before the outbreak of war. Article 5of the draft Treaty gave us no guarantee that those essentialpreparations could be made.The discussion which followed turned mainly on the questionwhether it would be practicable to persuade the Egyptian Govern-ment to accept Treaty provisions which laid on them specific-obligations to give us military facilities on a threat, or actualoutbreak, of war. There was general agreement that it would be advantageous if specific provisions on these lines could be includedin the Treaty. Ministers felt, however, that the question now a tissue was, not what we should like to see included in the Treaty,but what we could persuade the Egyptian Government to accept.And all concerned in the negotiations at Cairo were satisfied thatthere was no practical possibility of persuading the egyptian government to accept a Treaty containing provisions on the linesof Article 7 of the Treaty of 1936. There was indeed good reason why the Egyptian Government, from their point of view, shouldbe unwilling to accept such a provision. Their acceptance of these obligations would mean that, by our own action, we could at anytime involve them in war. Our self-governing Dominions would not accept such a position: they insisted on reserving an independentright to decide whether they would join in any war in which theUnited Kingdom became involved. Yet they had all the commonties implied bv membership of the British Commonwealth. why should Egypt,&quot;which was an independent State, accept obligations which were not undertaken by the Governments of the british dominions ?As against this it was suggested that, though Egypt was anindependent State, her defence interests were the same as ours, andit was her geographical position rather than any Treaty obligationwhich would implicate her in any war in which we were involved.It was pointed out, however, that these arguments could be appliedto Holland and Belgium; but it was not contended that on this[32264-3] B 2
account the Governments of those countries should accept treaty obligations giving us military facilities in their territory for thedefence of British interests.It was further argued that, if we stood out for specific treaty provisions authorising the maintenance in Egypt of the military facilities which the Chiefs of Staff now had in mind, we should beasking for more than had been guaranteed to us by the terms of the1936 Treaty. We had in fact established larger installations, and maintained more troops, in Egypt than was justified by the letter ofthat Treaty. The facilities which we had secured in Egypt hadbeen gained by the goodwill of the Egyptian Government and wentfar beyond the specific obligations assumed by them under the Treatyof 1936. To this extent past experience suggested that it was prefer-able to rely on good relations with Egypt rather than the precisewords of a Treaty provision.It was also to be remembered that the Treaty of 1936 had been negotiated when Egypt lay under the threat of Mussolini&apos;simperialism. That threat had now passed; and, as the Treaty itselfcontemplated revision after ten years, it was natural that the egyptians should expect us to be willing to negotiate a new treaty which involved them in lighter obligations. The fact was that wecould not expect now to negotiate a new Treaty which laid uponthe Egyptian Government the same obligations as those which theyhad been willing to assume in 1936. If we decided to take our standon the terms of the 1936 Treaty, we could not expect to secure,without the goodwill of the Egyptian Government, the same military facilities which we had been able to secure in the past. And if weattempted to maintain our position in Egypt by force, it was to beassumed that the resulting situation would be brought to the noticeof the Security Council. It was in these circumstances that ouradvisers in Cairo suggested that we should refrain from pressingour demand for specific Treaty provisions about military facilities and should rely on the goodwill which we should thus win to secureby informal arrangements the assurance we needed that military facilities would be accorded to us in Egypt on a threat, or actualoutbreak, of war.At the same time, it was recognised that it would be desirable,if possible, to strengthen the provisions of Articles 4, 5 and 6 ofthe new draft Treaty. Thus, it might be possible to strengthen the drafting of Article 4 so as to secure a greater measure of assurance that the recommendations and advice of the Joint Defence board would be accepted and implemented by the two Governments.The Foreign Secretary said that he was not committed to the wording of the present draft and would be glad to consider any amendments which could be devised for this purpose.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs suggested that itmight be useful to study the precise terms of the agreement betweenthe United States and Canada for the setting up of their defence board.The Lord Chancellor suggested that the Egyptian government might perhaps be willing to accept a provision to the effect that inthe event of a. threat, or actual outbreak, of war the egyptian government should notify His Majesty&apos;s Government and the latter should be under an obligation to come to their assistance.Points in further discussion were : *(a) The Foreign Secretary recommended that we should beready to bear the cost of building the temporary accommodation weshould need in the Canal zone. Under the 1936 Treaty the egyptian government should already have built this accommodation, but this had not been done and he did not think it would serve any useful purpose to endeavour to persuade them to pay for it now.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed with this view. Atthe same time, he reminded the Cabinet that Egypt was the secondlargest holder of sterling balances, about which there would haveto be negotiations later on.   We should not, therefore, be unduly

The Prime Minister read to the Cabinet telegrams from theCabinet Mission (Index 64 and 65) indicating that Congress mightshortly ask for a statement which they could make public about thestatus of the interim Government.The Mission pointed out that Congress would be entitled to publish the letter on this subject which the Viceroy had addressedto Azad on the 30th May; and, as it was inexpedient to embark upon the publication of correspondence which had passed duringthe course of the negotiations, they thought it preferable that congress, if they pressed their request, should be provided with astatement suitable for publication by Azad. They therefore proposed that, if the point were pressed, Azad should be authorisedto publish a statement by the Viceroy in the following terms : -&quot; During the interim period the constitutional positioncannot be changed; but His Majesty&apos;s Government have assuredme that they will treat the new interim Government with thesame close consultation and consideration as a dominion government.His Majesty&apos;s Government will give to the indian government the greatest possible freedom in the exercise ofthe day-to-day administration of the country, and it is my intention faithfully to carry out this undertaking.I am quite clear that it is the spirit in which the Govern-ment is worked which will prove to be of much greater importance than any formal document and guarantees. I haveno doubt that if the Ministers are prepared to trust me we shallbe able to co-operate in a manner which will give India a sense of freedom from external control and will prepare for complete freedom as soon as the new Constitution is made.&quot;The Cabinet agreed that no objection could be taken to thepublication of a statement in these terms.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would inform theCabinet Mission that, if need arose, Azad might beauthorised to make a statement in the terms set out above.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,6th June, 1946.generous in these negotiations, but should endeavour to ensure thatthe Egyptians paid a fair price for installations and equipment which were to be handed over to them.(b) Articles I and II of the draft protocol contemplated thatspecific dates would be prescribed for the various stages of thewithdrawal of British troops from Egypt. What were the dateswhich were to be inserted in these two articles ?The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that it wouldprobably be possible to complete the first stage of the evacuationwithin about a year, particularly if an early decision could be taken as to the future site of the Middle East headquarters.The Foreign Secretary said that the Egyptian Government werenot likely to be content with so long a delay. We should, in his view, aim to have completed this stage at the latest by March 1947.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary and the Chiefs of Staff toconsider what amendments could be made in the new draft Treaty and protocol annexed to CP. (46) 219 witha view to meeting the points which had been raised inthe discussion.(2) Agreed to resume their consideration of the foreign secretary&apos;s memorandum at a further meeting on thefollowing day.
