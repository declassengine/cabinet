The Foreign Secretary said that the Prime Minister of persia had announced that all Soviet troops had been withdrawnfrom Azerbaijan. The Security Council would now have to considerwhether the Persian question could be removed from their agenda.The Council were in an awkward position in view of the refusal ofthe Soviet Government to make any report or answer any enquiry on this question. The Foreign Secretary had considered what attitude our representative on the Council should take, and had come to the conclusion that the right course was for him to leavethe initiative with the United States representative.A difficult situation was also developing in South Persia, wherethe Tudeh Party were inciting the workers in the oil plants atAbadan to violence against British employees of the Anglo-persian oil Company. Arrangements had been made to send to Abadan a labour Attache from the British Embassy at Cairo and a special representative of the Oil Company. It might, however, be necessaryto ask the Persian Government for specific assurances regarding theprotection of the Company&apos;s property; and, if those assurances werenot forthcoming, the Cabinet would have to consider what further action could be taken to protect British interests in this area.The Foreign Secretary reported to the Cabinet the result of therecent elections in Czechoslovakia. In Bohemia and Moravia the communists had secured 42 per cent, of the votes cast, and had obtained a substantial lead over any of the other Parties. InSlovakia, where the Communists had polled 33 per cent, 62 per cent,of the votes had been cast for the Democrats, who represented the catholic element. Throughout the country the Social Democratshad obtained only a small poll.The Cabinet were informed of further communications betweenthe Prime Minister and President Truman regarding the arrange-ments for conducting an expert study, on behalf of the twoGovernments, of issues arising from the report of the Anglo-American Committee on Palestine. The Prime Minister had communicated to President Truman his suggestions for subjects tobe examined by experts nominated by the two Governments.President Truman&apos;s reply was now awaited.The Foreign Secretary said that serious friction had arisen between the French in Siam and the Siamese Government. We had urged the French to adopt a more conciliatory attitude, but they hadbeen unwilling to do so and it was possible that the Siamese Govern-ment might now bring the matter before the Security Council.The Cabinet were informed that the Defence Committee had now directed the Chiefs of Staff to expedite the completion of plans for the removal of British Headquarters staffs from Cairo.The Foreign Secetary said that a difficult stage had been reached in the negotiations for the revision of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty.He had thought it expedient to ask the United States Governmentto impress upon the Egyptians the importance of an early and satis-factory settlement of these issues; and he hoped that the UnitedStates representative in Cairo would shortly be instructed to make representations in this sense both to the King of Egypt and to SidkiPasha. Meanwhile, the situation was to be debated in the EgyptianParliament; and he also understood that at their forthcoming meeting the representatives of the Arab States intended to discuss,not only the report of the Anglo-American Committee on Palestine,but also the general strategic position in the Middle East. In thesecircumstances, it seemed expedient that the negotiations in Cairoshould be suspended for a time; and the Prime Minister therefore proposed to recall the Secretary of State for Air for consultationsin London later in the week.2. The Foreign Secretary said that it had been customary to publish as White Papers reports on the proceedings of the Leagueof Nations and it had been suggested that the same practice shouldbe adopted in respect of the proceedings of the United Nations.His own view was that it would be more satisfactory if such reports were published as Stationery Office Publications.   Publication, in[32142-2]b 2
this form would ensure that they were available to all who were interested in&apos;-them, without provoking demands for Debates inParliament.The Cabinet-Endorsed the Foreign Secretary&apos;s suggestion that reportsof the proceedings of the United Nations should be pub-lished  in  the  United  Kingdom  as  Stationery  OfficePublications.Man-Power.Gall-Up tothe Forces ih1947 and 1948.(previous reference:CM. (46) 50thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. At their meeting on the 20th May the Cabinet had invited the Man-Power Committee to prepare a draft White Paper setting out the arrangements for call-up to the Forces in 1947 and 1948,and to consider what relaxation of the call-up of apprentices mightbe made in 1947.The Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by theForeign Secretary (OP. (46) 206) covering the draft of a white paper and proposing a revised scheme for the call-up of apprenticesin 1947 and in subsequent years, under which deferment would belimited to those apprentices whose employers had entered into adefinite obligation to give them a satisfactory course of training.The Cabinet first discussed the text of the draft White Paper.The following amendments were suggested : -(a) In paragraph 2 the responsibilities of the United kingdom as a leading member of the United Nations should be mentioned,and the words &quot;ex-enemy countries&quot; should be substituted for&quot; Germany, Austria and Japan.&quot;(p) The penultimate sentence of paragraph 2 should be amended so as not to exclude the possibility that the unforeseendevelopments referred to might lead to a reduction in the size ofthe Forces required in 1947 and 1948.(c) A phrase should be inserted in paragraph 3 to indicatethat the ultimate aim of His Majesty&apos;s Government was to main-tain adequate Forces at a stable level.(d) A brief explanation of the current arrangements for the deferment of apprentices should be added at the beginning ofparagraph 9.Other points in discussion were :  (e) The White Paper should be presented by the Minister ofLabour on Thursday, the 30th May.(/) There would probably be a demand for a Debate on theWhite Paper. One course would be to discuss it on a Supply Day,which might conveniently be the first day after the Whitsun Recess.Other possibilities were for the Government to set aside a day fora Motion approving the proposals in the White Paper, or to arrange that the proposals could be discussed in the Foreign Affairs debate in the following week. It was agreed that the statement announcing the publication of the White Paper should leave the way open forthis last course, and that with this in view the Minister of labour should agree the text of his statement with the Lord president and the Foreign Secretary.(g) The Minister of Labour and the Service Ministers should hold a Press conference on the White Paper with Lobby corres-coorespondents and industrial correspondents on the 30th May at noon.The Cabinet^(1) Approved the revised scheme for the deferment of apprentices in 1947 and subsequent years, set out inparagraph 2 of CP. (46) 206.(2) Subject to the amendments indicated at (a) to (d) above,approved the draft White Paper on the arrangementsfor call-up to the Forces in 1947 and 1948.(3) Invited the Minister of Labour and National Service tomake arrangements on the lines indicated at (e) to (g)for the presentation of the White Paper.
4. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said thatTshekedi, head of the Bamangwato tribe of the bechuanaland protectorate, had asked for facilities to come to this country tomake representations against the South African proposal that south-West Africa should be incorporated in the Union. His tribewas separated from South-West Africa by 400 miles of desert andwas not therefore directly affected; but it was understood that he wished to secure, in return for the withdrawal of his objections,a promise of a railway from Bechuanaland to Walvis Bay. Hehad friends in this country who were supporting his application;but Field-Marshal Smuts, who had been informed, took very strongexception to the suggestion that Tshekedi should come to thiscountry for this purpose. Such a visit would, in his view, causemuch trouble in South Africa and might well raise there the veryquestion of the incorporation in the Union of the South AfricanHigh Commission territories which Tshekedi was most anxious toavoid.After discussion, the Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs toarrange for the United Kingdom High Commissioner inSouth Africa to see Tshekedi, to warn him that his proposed visit to this country might well precipitatequestions which he was anxious to avoid, and to endeavourto dissuade him from pursuing his proposal.5. The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to a statement made on the 24th May by a spokesman of the State Department in washington to the effect that the terms of the agreement reachedduring the Lord Presidents recent visit had not been in the formindicated by the Lord President in the House of Commons on the23rd May.The Lord President said that there had evidently been a misunderstanding: an explanation was being sought by the british embassy in Washington and he hoped that it would be satisfactorilycleared up. He wished to avoid making any further statement inthe House of Commons until he could give an explanation whichwould not be challenged by the United States authorities. his agreement with Mr. Clayton and Mr. Clinton Anderson had been completely firm, though it might be that officials of certain UnitedStates Departments might not have been anxious to carry out theletter of that agreement. Moreover, he had heard that 17,000 tonsof wheat and 8,500 tons of maize were being programmed for shipment in May from the United States to the British zone ofGermany; and this indicated that prompt administrative action was being taken in pursuance of the agreement.The Lord President said that he would like to take this oppor-tunity to place on record his appreciation of the co-operation whichhe had from the Minister of Food during his mission, and also hisgratitude for the expert assistance of the officials of the Ministriesof Food and Agriculture who had accompanied him to washington and of the staff of the British Embassy there.The Cabinet then considered a memorandum by the Minister ofFood (CP. (46) 209) setting out, in the light of the results of theLord Presidents mission, the supply position for wheat and flourfor the United Kingdom up to the 31st October. They also had before them a joint memorandum (CP. (46) 200) by the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries and the Secretary of State for Scotlandregarding supplies of home-grown wheat during this period.The Minister of Food said that it was not possible to indicatewith any certainty what the United Kingdom stock position wouldbe during the autumn because the calculations involved so manyelements of doubt. The principal doubt was the level of shipments from the United States.   The undertakings which they had given
might well involve them in sending to this country in the coming months a very large proportion of their total shipments of wheat,and they might well find that there were both political and physicaldifficulties in so doing. Moreover, world requirements, even as nowscaled down, were still 700,000 tons in excess of probable supplies and it was to be expected that the United Kingdom would be askedto bear her share of this short-fall. Finally, there was also an element of doubt about the amount of home-grown wheat that wouldbe forthcoming immediately after the harvest. The revised estimateof 420,000 tons put forward by the Minister of Agriculture was dependent on favourable weather. It was also to be rememberedthat the more home-grown wheat was brought forward early in thenew season, the less there would be later on in the year whensupplies would still be short. There would probably not be, as in normal years, substantial quantities of wheat in stock on the easternseaboard of Canada from which exports could be drawn when the eastward movement of wheat across Canada was stopped by thefreezing of the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence.On the most optimistic assumption, stocks in the autumn would reach a low point of 648,000 tons; and the Minister of Food himselfestimated that they would fall to about 440,000 tons. These figures were below the minimum which could be safely accepted. He had recently arranged for an independent examination to be made of ourstock requirements, and the conclusion reached was that a minimumstock should be maintained of 1\ weeks&apos; usage, equivalent on thebasis of present consumption to 810,000 tons. The minimum figurepreviously accepted by the Cabinet was 775,000 tons which, atpresent levels of consumption, could be reduced to 700,000 tons. Byexceptional measures it might be possible to carry on for a short period on a smaller quantity. This possibility was being urgentlyexamined, but the economy secured by this means would not bridge the gap between the minimum working stock figure and the figure to which stocks were likely to fall by the autumn.In these circumstances he thought it essential that he should puthimself in a position to control the consumption of flour by intro-ducing a scheme for rationing bread and flour. He had already goneas far as he could in preparing such a scheme without consultingoutside interests and if he was to proceed further he must nowconsult the bakery trade and the Trade Union Congress. An outline of the scheme was contained in Appendix III to CP. (46) 209.Bread coupons would be exchangeable for ordinary points coupons,and this would give a useful measure of elasticity.In the discussion which followed there was general recognition that, despite the objections to bread rationing, the future was souncertain that it would be rash not to take steps which would give full control over the situation.The following points were made :  (a) There should be a very close examination of the &apos;&apos; pipeline &apos;&apos;for flour supplies to see whether some reduction of stocks could bemade, even at the cost of an uneconomic use of transport.(&amp;) It would be easier to present the present position to thepublic if figures could be given. While it would not be advisable to publish stock figures, it would be useful to publish the quantitiesthat were to be sent to India and the British zone of Germany as theresult of the Lord Presidents mission.(c) The introduction of the rationing scheme would involve theemployment of some 5,000 additional staff. The Treasury should consider whether some of these could be found by transfer fromother control schemes which were being relaxed.(d) The prospect for the next harvest in Canada and theUkraine was now reported to be less favourable than had previously been thought. It would be wise, therefore, to proceed on theassumption that the situation would remain difficult throughoutnext year. It would be useful to discuss with the Canadian Govern-ment alternative means of shipping wheat during the months wheninland waterways were frozen.
6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Transport (CP. (46) 205) reporting the detailedincreases which he proposed to make in railway charges in pursuanceof the Cabinet&apos;s decision of the 16th May.In this memorandum the Minister pointed out that the 10 percent, increase in freight rates which the Cabinet had authorisedon the 16th May would mean increasing those rates to 26fper cent, above pre-war levels. Such a percentage would createadministrative difficulties, and would also give the impression ofbeing a closely calculated figure. For both reasons he proposed to substitute a round figmre of 25 per cent, over pre-war levels, though this would produce over a full year a yield  1 million less thanthat authorised by the Cabinet.In the annex to his memorandum the Minister submitted forapproval draft terms of reference inviting his consultative com-mittee to report what further adjustments of railway charges, andof the road and rail fares of the London Passenger Transport Board,were necessary to bring them into line with the post-war levelof costs.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was preparedto accept the modified proposals in CP. (46) 205, even though theywould produce a smaller yield than the increases authorised by the cabinets decision of the 16th May.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Transport to announce inParliament at an early date the increases in railway charges and in the fares of the Green Line bus routes ofthe London Passenger Transport Board set out in para-graph 2 of CP. (46) 205;(2) Approved the draft terms of reference to the consultative committee set out in the appendix to CP. (46) 205.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,27th May, 1946.railway charges.(previous reference:CM. (46)48thConclusions,Minute 3.)The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Food to proceed with his prepara-ations for introducing the rationing scheme outlined in Appendix III to CP. (46) 209; and authorised himto discuss the details of the scheme with the bakery tradeand the Trade Union Congress.United The Cabinet then considered a joint memorandum by the kingdom:       Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Secretary of StateRations of      for Scotland (CP. (46) 201) on rations of animal feeding-stuffs.Feeding- Minister of Agriculture said that, with the Cabinetsstuffa. authority, the recent increase in the extraction rate had been presented to the farming community as a temporary measure whichwould be reviewed in the autumn. Livestock production must, how-ever, be planned in advance and he now felt that the prospects forthe winter were so uncertain that it would be well to announce atonce reduced ration scales for the period up to the 30th April, 1947.Three alternative scales had been worked out on three assumptions about the quantity of feeding-stuffs that would be available, and he asked for authority to announce ration scales based on the worst of these assumptions.In a preliminary discussion of this proposal it was generally agreed that it would be preferable to proceed on the basis of thesecond of the three alternative assumptions stated in CP. (46) 201.It was also agreed that any announcement about ration scales for animal feeding-stuffs should not be linked with the decision tointroduce bread rationing.The Cabinet (2) Agreed to defer until their next meeting further discussionof the proposals made in CP. (46) 201.
