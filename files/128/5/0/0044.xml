parliament. 1.   The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the business business in which it was proposed to take in the House of Commons in thethe House of   following week.Commons. The Rep0rfc Stage of the Coal Industry Nationalisation bill would be taken on the 13th, 14th and 15th May.The Second Reading of the Finance Bill would be taken on the16th May.On the 17th May there would be Second Reading debates onthe Railways (Valuation for Rating) Bill and the LicensingPlanning (Temporary Provisions) Bill.Parliament.Payment ofRailwayFares of peers.(previous reference:CM. (46) 42ndConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The Cabinet were informed that, from the soundings whichhad now been taken, it seemed unlikely that serious objection wouldbe raised in the House of Commons to the proposal (CP. (46) 144)for payment of the railway fares of Peers attending the House ofLords.It would be convenient if this proposal could be announcedsimultaneously in both Houses of Parliament; and it was desirablethat the timing of the announcement should be related to the furtherproceedings on the Governments proposals regarding the salaries and expenses of Members of the House of Commons.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, toarrange for effect to be given to the proposal in cp. (46) 144 regarding payment of the railway fares of peers attending the House of Lords;(2) Agreed that this decision should be announced at a fairlyearly date; and asked the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs to consult with the Chancellor of theExchequer regarding the timing of a simultaneousannouncement in both Houses of Parliament.Parliament.Expenses ofMembers.(previous reference:CM. (46) 38thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs recalled that,in the course of the Cabinets discussion on the 29th April, he had raised the question whether some increases could not be made in the salaries payable to those members of His Majesty&apos;s Household whoperformed Parliamentary duties in the House of Lords.The Cabinet &apos;Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to settle thismatter in consultation with the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs.Parliament.Appointmentof Membersof Parliamentto Board ofTradeWorkingParties.(previous reference:CM. (45)28thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (46) 187) on the question whether Members ofParliament should serve on Board of Trade working parties as representatives of Trade Unions or employers&apos; organisations.The Lord President said that, as shown by the minutes annexed to CP. (46) 187, the President of the Board of Trade felt that itwas undesirable to appoint Members of Parliament as members ofthese working parties because (i) this would tend to introduce apolitical atmosphere into this work; (ii) it was inexpedient that amember of such a working party should be able to disclose theirproceedings in any debate in Parliament on their report; and(iii) service on a working party could not easily be combined withthe effective discharge of Parliamentary duties.
His own view, as Leader of the House of Commons, was that although the Government should not themselves appoint Members ofParliament to these working parties, they need not object to the nomination of a Member of Parliament as the representative of a trade Union or an employers&apos; organisation. Apart from thegeneral objections to limiting the choice of representatives, he feltthat to bar Members of Parliament from this duty was inconsistent with the policy of encouraging Trade Unions to allow their officials to become Members of Parliament without relinquishing their active participation in Trade Union work. As regards the first of theparticular objections raised by the President of the Board of Tradethere was no doubt about the political views of a Trade Union leader&apos;whether or not he was a Member of Parliament. As regards thesecond, it should not be difficult to ensure that a Member ofParliament who had served on a working party would not abuse hisposition when the report came before Parliament. As regards thethird, it seemed to him to be desirable that Members of parliament should undertake other forms of public service, within reasonable limits, and it was best to leave it to Members themselves to decide whether the acceptance of any particular job was compatible withthe efficient discharge of their Parliamentary duties.The Parliamentary Secretary, Board of Trade, said that service on Board of Trade working parties was on a different footing fromordinary Trade Union work. It would be difficult to avoid thefeeling that a Member of Parliament would have an unfair advan-tage over his fellow members on a working party in parliamentary discussion of their report. And, as much of the work of the working parties took place outside London, membership of them was likelyto lead to a greater interference with the discharge of parliamentary duties than membership of bodies whose work was carried on inLondon.In further discussion there was general support for the view expressed by the Lord President.The Cabinet-Agreed that no objection need be taken to the nomination of Members of Parliament by Trade Unions or employers&apos;organisations for service on Board of Trade working parties.Expenses ofMembers ofLocalAuthoritiesand Bodiesto be Estab-lished underthe national health service.(previous reference:CM. (46)22ndConclusions,Minute 7.)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandumMinister (CP. (46) 166) about the payment of by the Primeallowances fortravelling, subsistence and loss of remunerative time to membersof local authorities and members of the new bodies to be established under the National Health Service.The Prime Minister invited the Cabinet to consider whetherthe Government should themselves formulate proposals for the pay-ment of expenses of members of local authorities or whether a preliminary enquiry should first be made into the whole matter byan independent committee composed of persons outside the Govern-ment. The question of payment for loss of remunerative time to members of the new bodies to be set up under the National health service was separable from the general issue and ought to be decided in time to enable any necessary amendment to be made in theNational Health Service Bill. He proposed that this narrower issueshould be remitted at once to a group of officials, under Treasurychairmanship.The Minister of Health said that it would be necessary to make some statement of the Government&apos;s attitude towards the widerquestion at the Labour Party Conference in June. He himselfsupported the proposal for an enquiry by an independent committee.This enquiry should take account of the changes in the functions oflocal authorities which would result from the Government&apos;s domestic policy.  He considered that any allowances paid to members of local
authorities should be borne wholly by the rates, and he hoped thatit would not be thought necessary to pay travelling expenses and subsistence allowances for attendance at meetings of county borough,borough or urban district councils. Any necessary provision for thepayment of allowances to local authority members could be includedin the Block Grant Bill, which was to be introduced in the 1946-47Session.The Minister also supported the proposal for an urgent enquiry into the question of allowances for members of the new bodies tobe set up under the National Health Service. He thought that someamendment of the National Health Service Bill on this point was inevitable, and he contemplated that power might be taken to dealwith the matter by regulations.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that he accepted theproposals made by the Prime Minister. Some amendment of theScottish law would in any event be needed since he was proposing to make additional use of joint committees, service on which was not covered by the present provision for the payment of allowances for loss of remunerative time to members of Scottish county councils.It would also be necessary, so far as concerned Scotland, to acceptthe principle of payment for loss of remunerative time for service on the new bodies to be set up under the National Health Service.Other points in discussion were : (a) The Lord President said that, while he would regret anystep that might impair the tradition of voluntary public service,he agreed that the growth of local government made it inevitable that some additional provision should be made for payment of allowances to members of local authorities. He hoped, however,that adequate steps would be taken to prevent abuse.(b) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it should be made clear in the terms of reference of the proposed independent committee that no part of the cost would be borne by the Exchequer.(c) The Minister of A griculture and Fisheries pointed out that,if the principle of payment for loss of remunerative time were accepted for county councils and rural district councils, it wouldbe difficult to resist its extension to County Agricultural ExecutiveCommittees.The Lord Chancellor said that such a concession would alsostrengthen the case for making similar payments to Justices of thePeace.(d) The Minister of Labour stressed the importance of avoidingpayments on a fee basis to members of bodies established under theNational Health Service.The Cabinet  (1) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Ministerof Health, in consultation with the Chancellor of theExchequer, to arrange for the appointment of anindependent committee to enquire into the question ofthe payment of allowances for attendance at meetings oflocal authorities.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for theappointment of a committee of officials, under Treasurychairmanship, to consider as a matter of urgency thequestion of payment for loss of remunerative time to members of the new bodies to be established under theNational Health Service.
India.constitutional position.(previous reference:C.M.(46)33rdConclusions,Minute 8.)6. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of the stage&apos;!which the Cabinet Mission to India had reached in their discussions!The proceedings at Simla were now moving towards a climax 1and it might become necessary for the Cabinet to take important!decisions during the course of the next few days. Members of the!Cabinet should, therefore, hold themselves in readiness to attend!a meeting at short notice.PeaceConference.(previous reference:CM. (46) 1stConclusions,Minute 1.)7.   The Prime Minister recalled that at the Moscow Conference!it had been agreed that, when the Council of Foreign Ministers!had completed the preparation of draft treaties of peace with the!ex-enemy satellite States in Europe, they should submit these drafts jfor consideration by ia Peace Conference attended by twenty-one of Ithe belligerent States, and that this conference should assemble onjthe 1st May, 1946.   That date had already passed, and Govern-ments not represented  on the  Council of  Foreign  Ministers,!particularly the Dominion Governments, were showing impatience!at the delay in convening the Conference.   The Soviet Government!were seeking to interpret the Moscow decision as meaning that thePeace Conference could not be convened until the Council of foreign ministers had reached final agreement on the terms of the drafttreaties;   but this interpretation was challenged by the otherGovernments represented on the Council and the Foreign Secretary,in particular, had argued that it was not the purpose of the!proposed Peace Conference merely to endorse agreements already jreached by the Council of Foreign Ministers.Little progress was now being made at the current meeting ofthe Council in Paris on the major points of disagreement stilloustanding on these draft treaties; and at the Councils meetingthe previous day the United States Secretary of State had proposed(i) that the Deputies should prepare draft treaties on the basis ofexisting decisions and of such further agreements as they could reach, and should also submit a report on the points of disagreementstill outstanding; and (ii) that the Peace Conference should nowbe summoned to meet in Paris on the 15th June, 1946. The first ofthese proposals had been adopted and the Deputies had been askedto prepare a report on the existing state of the work for considera-tion by the Council that day. The second proposal had been deferred for further consideration.The Foreign Secretary (in his telegram No. 115 of the 8th May) Ihad asked if he could have the authority of the Cabinet to support Iin principle the plan put forward by the United States Secretaryof State; and also to insist that the Council of Foreign Ministers Ishould not adopt an interpretation of the Moscow decision which1would prevent the Peace Conference being held until final agreement had been reached on all points by the Council.The Cabinet Agreed that the Foreign Secretary should be authorised to resist an interpretation of the Moscow decision whichwould prevent the Peace Conference being held untilfinal agreement had been reached in the Council of foreign ministers on the draft treaties of peace with ex-enemysatellite States in Europe; and that he should be authorisedto support in principle the proposal of the United states secretary of State that the Peace Conference should be convened for an appropriate date in June 1946 to consider such drafts as the Council had been able to prepare bythat time.
8. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (46) 189) regarding the procedure for international discussions about the establishment of an International trade organisation.The Lord President recalled that in December 1945 the UnitedStates Government had made proposals (set out in Cmd. 6709) foran International Conference on Trade and Employment. They had then proposed that there should first be a preliminary meeting ofthirteen &quot; drafting countries &quot; in March or April of 1946. Thismeeting had had to be postponed, and they did not now wish it tobe held before March 1947. It could not well take place before thedecision of Congress on the Financial Agreement was known.Thereafter there was bound to be a further delay before the UnitedStates Government could undertake the discussion of tariff items which would be an essential part of the work of the meeting since they were bound to give 90 days&apos; public notice of all items on whichtariff reductions would be considered, and they did not wish to do this on the eve of the November elections.Meanwhile, the Economic and Social Council had adopted theUnited States proposal for an international conference, and had set up a Preparatory Committee to prepare for it. The countries on the Preparatoiy Committee were the same as the &quot; draftingcountries &quot; suggested by the United States, with three additions.This Preparatory Committee wrould work parallel with the meetingof &quot; drafting countries,&quot; but it was contemplated that it would not,as they would, engage in detailed bargaining for the reduction of tariffs and preferences.The United States Government were anxious that discussion ofthese questions should not be wholly postponed until they were ready to discuss tariff items next March. They had therefore proposed that we and they should endeavour to arrange for thePreparatory Committee to meet in New York from the 1st July tothe 15th August to begin work on a general exploratory basis, thatthis meeting should appoint a drafting sub-committee to draw upbetween the 15th August and the 15th October a, detailed draft ofa charter for the International Trade Organisation, and that asecond meeting of the Preparatory Committee should be held inMarch 1947 to consider the draft charter. This meeting wouldcoincide with the meeting of the &quot; drafting countries.&quot;The Lord President recommended that the meeting of&quot; drafting countries &quot; should be postponed until next March, butfor a variety of reasons he did not favour acceptance of the UnitedStates&apos; proposals as they stood. In particular, we should not beready for a meeting of the Preparatory Committee by the 1st July,as we might not then know whether Congress had approved theFinancial Agreement, and we should not have been able to holdpreliminary discussions with the Dominions. Moreover, he saw-strong objection to the proposal that the Preparatory Committeeshould appoint a drafting sub-committee.Equally, he thought there were strong arguments againstrejecting the American proposals completely. He therefore suggested that we should agree to the meeting of the preparatory committee but should propose that it be held in October and not inJuly, and in Europe and not in the United States. He also recom-mended that we should strongly resist the proposal that thePreparatory Committee should appoint a sub-committee to draw up a detailed charter.The following points were made in discussion : (a)^ The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the fate of theFinancial Agreement must profoundly influence our commercial policy^ While it might still be that on a long view a general reduction of trade barriers would be in our best interests, on &quot;a shortview we should certainly have to restrict our imports severely andit would be some time before we could consider relaxing cur controls.
It was, therefore, essential that we should not undertake any com-commitments for the reduction of trade barriers until the fate of theloan was known.(b) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that itwas important that there should be a preliminary meeting withrepresentatives of the Dominions before international discussionsbegan. The Dominions were ready to send representatives to ameeting in July and he would like to tell them very soon that thismeeting would take place.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that it would alsobe necessary to take into account the interests of the Colonial Empireand India. The Colonies were much concerned about the future ofImperial preference and there were also questions about grouppurchase on which it was desirable to work out a Commonwealthview.(c) Delay would have the advantage that the Peace conference would already have been opened, and the contentious issues of com-mercial policy might be kept out of the discussions on the peace treaties.On the other hand, there was a risk that European countries might begin to reimpose the trade barriers which had existed before1939.   This should, if possible, be prevented.id) Tariff policy must be brought to the forefront of these inter-national discussions. The United States Government seemedreluctant to recognise that, if they were to be paid for their exports and the credits they were ready to give, they would have to review their tariff policy.(e) It was agreed that, when questions of commercial policy were being discussed on the Economic and Social Council, respon-sibility for the negotiations would rest, so far as concerned HisMajesty&apos;s Government, with the main economic Departments.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the reply to the United States Governmentshould be on the lines indicated in CP. (46) 189.(2) Asked the Lord President to consult with the Chancellorof the Exchequer with a view to strengthening that partof the reply which was summarised in sub-paragraphs(D) and (E) of paragraph 7 of CP. (46) 189.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, inconsultation with the Departments concerned, to proceedwith arrangements for a preliminary meeting of empire countries.Financial 9.   The Prime Minister asked whether preparations had beenAgreement made to enable the Cabinet to consider at once the implications on with the United Kingdom policy if the Financial Agreement with the UnitedUnited States. States was rejected by Congress.(Previous 27^ Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this question was reference: now being fu\\y studied by officials and he would be ready to placeO.M.(45)59th a scheme before the Cabinet as soon as the decision of Congress was conclusions.) known.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that theMinisters from Australia and New Zealand now in this country had assured him that, if the Financial Agreement were rejected, wecould rely on every assistance from these two Dominions.The Cabinet Took note of the position.
37CM. 44 (46;.10. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that he hadreceived a telegram from President Truman setting out the steps which be proposed to take to enable his Government to decide theirpolicy on the report of the Anglo-American Committee on Palestine.He proposed that his Government should now initiate the consulta-tions with Jews and Arabs to which both Governments were committed. He intended to ask the Jewish Agency, the variousArab States and a number of Jewish and Arab organisations tosubmit their comments on the Report within two weeks. The UnitedStates Government wouid then consult His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand would proceed to determine their attitude towards the report as a whole and to issue a public statement as to the extent to whichthey were prepared to accept it as the basis for their Palestinepolicy. The President wished to know whether His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would take concurrent action.It was the view of the Cabinet that these proposals were to- be welcomed as a further admission by the United States Governmentof some share of responsibility in the Palestine problem. It was true that the President did not mention the possibility of financial or military assistance, and it was suggested that some mentionmight be made of this in replying to his message. The general viewof the Cabinet was, however, that it would be a mistake to makeany reference to this at the present stage.The Prime Minister said that he would like to have the viewsof the Foreign Secretary before he sent a definite answer to president Truman&apos;s message. He had sent him the text of the presidents message and he hoped to have an opportunity of discussing it with him at the end of the week. Meanwhile, he would arrange to see the United States Ambassador and would send thePresident an interim reply.11. At their meeting on the 8th April the Cabinet had agreedto continue the publicity campaign designed to bring home to thepublic the facts of the economic and man-power situation.The Minister of Health asked whether it was necessary that members of the Cabinet should continue to address meetings in con-nection with this campaign. He himself doubted whetherMinisterial speeches on this subject were producing any usefulresuit; and he was sure that, in view of the very heavy claims ontheir time, Ministers were being asked to take on too manyspeaking engagements at the present time.The Lord President said that his information suggested that up to now these meetings had produced useful results. He hadreceived specially favourable reports on the meeting which theMinister of Health had addressed in South Wales. At the sametime, he recognised that members of the Cabinet were carrying a&apos;heavy burden; and it might be wise to refrain from asking cabinet ministers to address further meetings of this kind after thecompletion of the series already arranged. Thereafter, the cam-paign might be continued mainly on the basis of printed publicity.The Minister of Labour agreed with the views expressed by theLord President.The suggestion was made that greater use might be made, inthis campaign, of the services of Private Members supporting theGovernment. Though they could not take the place of Ministers,it would be useful if they could be invited to make speeches on thissubject.The Cabinet Took note that the Lord President would review, in thelight of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion, the arrangements forGovernment speakers at future meetings organised in con-nection with the prosperity campaign.Office, S.W. 1,May, 1046.
