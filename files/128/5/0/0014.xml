1. The Foreign Secretary made a report to the Cabinet on thediscussions&apos; in the Security Council about the situation in the dutch east Indies, The Council had met three times during the week-end,but had been unable to reach agreement on the proposal of theUkrainian Delegation that a Commission should be sent out to theDutch East Indies to investigate the situation on the spot and make an independent report to the Council. No suggestion had been madein the discussion that international peace and security wasendangered by the presence of British troops in the Dutch east indies; and M. Vyshinsky had made it clear in his speech that hewas not asking for the British troops to be withdrawn. It had thusappeared that the sole object of sending out a Commission wouldbe to enquire into the conduct of the British troops in Indonesia.Nothing had been said to substantiate the imputations against our troops; and the Foreign Secretary had felt obliged to resist theproposal for the appointment of a Commission;In his final speech on the previous day, Dr. van Kleffens, theDutch representative on the Council, had said that he would not oppose the appointment of a Commission, provided that its enquiry was restricted to the conduct of British troops in Indonesia.Dr. van Kleffens&apos; reason for making this distinction was,presumably, that the Netherlands Government could not agree toan independent enquiry into matters within Dutch sovereignty; butthe Foreign Secretary thought it unreasonable that, having acceptedour military assistance in Indonesia, the Netherlands Governmentshould agree to an enquiry into the conduct of our troops which theywere not prepared to accept in relation to their own. He proposedto make it clear to Dr. van Kleffens that the Dutch Governmentcould not expect to enjoy our continued assistance in Indonesia ifthey dissociated themselves in this way from our difficulties on theSecurity Council.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in full agreementwith the line which the Foreign Secretary had taken in these discussions on the Security Council, and endorsed his view that he must continue to resist the appointment of an independent Commis-sion to enquire into the conduct of British troops in the dutch east Indies.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of the line which the foreign secretary was adopting in the discussions on the security council about the situation in the Dutch East Indies.2. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that, in agree-ment with the Ministers directly concerned, and with the approvalof the Prime Minister, he had decided to appoint a Special Commis-sioner in South-East Asia to advise His Majesty&apos;s Government onproblems affecting the conduct of foreign affairs which might arise in the area comprising Ceylon, Burma, Siam (pending the resump-tion of normal diplomatic relations with that country), Indo-China,Malaya and the Dutch East Indies. The Special commissioner would be responsible to the Foreign Secretary, and his appointmentwould in no way affect the position or responsibilities of governors of British territories or British Service Commanders within thearea. He would give guidance to the Supreme Allied Commander,South-East Asia, on matters relating to foreign Affairs and on non-military matters arising in foreign territories within thatCommand.The need for a single high-ranking British representative to watch British interests throughout the whole of this area had beenillustrated by recent difficulties over the supply of rice in South-East Asia. It was now urgently necessary that the Special Commis-sioner should be appointed and should take up his duties withoutdelay.The Foreign Secretary said that he had decided to appoint tothis post Lord Killearn, now His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to Egypt.7-2J b 2
The Cabinet-Took note with approval of the Foreign SecretaryYstatement.India. 3.   The Prime Minister recalled that at their meeting on theConstitutional 22nd January the Cabinet had agreed that a Mission of threePosition. Ministers of Cabinet rank should be sent to India, to arrive there(Previous about the middle of March, to conduct the forthcoming negotiationsReference: on the constitutional problem. He now proposed that this MissionCM. (46)7th should be composed of the Secretary of State for India, theConclusions, President of the Board of Trade and the First Lord of the minute 1.) Admiralty. He proposed that this should be announced in Parlia-ment on the 19th February.The Cabinet endorsed the Prime Ministers proposals.In discussion, reference was made to the possibility that theinclusion of the President of the Board of Trade in this Missionwould be criticised on the ground that, at a time when our industrial and economic problems at home were of such urgency and importance, we could not afford to send abroad the Minister incharge of the Board of Trade. It might be expedient to anticipatesuch criticism by including in the announcement about the Missionsome statement about the arrangements for supervising the work ofthese Ministers&apos; Departments while they were away. It was sug-gested that the Lord President might take charge of the Board ofTrade during the Presidents absence.The Secretary of State for India said that he had received atelegram from the Viceroy welcoming the decision to send out a- Mission of senior Ministers, but asking that he should be informed,before this was announced, what view the Government took of his proposals for handling the situation. The Secretary of State saidthat he did not consider this to be a reasonable request and hopedthat he would be able to persuade the Viceroy to withdraw it.The Cabinet i(1) Approved the Prime Minister&apos;s proposal that the Secretaryof State for India, the President of the Board of Tradeand the First Lord of the Admiralty should go out toIndia to conduct the forthcoming negotiations on theconstitutional problem;(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for thisdecision to be announced in both Houses of parliament on Tuesday, 19th February.Import 4.   The Cabinet had before themProgrammesfor 1946.(i)&apos; a memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP.(46) 53) covering a report by the Balance of PaymentsWorking Party on the Departmental import programmes for 1946; and(ii) a note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (46) 58)covering a memorandum by Lord Keynes dealing withthe effect on the balance of payments of political andmilitary expenditure overseas.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the report annexed to CP. (46) 53 showed that our overseas income from all sources in1946 was likely to be about  700 millions. The import programmesput forward by Departments amounted to  1,126 millions, to whichthere fell to be added  400 millions for overseas military andpolitical expenditure, leaving a deficit of more than  800 millions inthe balance of payments. Even if we got the American loan,together with a further loan from Canada, we could not possiblyface such a deficit, and he proposed that the Departmental pro-grammes should be reduced from  1,126 millions to  1,075 millions.Until the American loan had been ratified by Congress it would be unwise to take firm decisions on the 1946 programmes as a whole,
and for the present he asked for approval only for those relating tothe first half of the year, which amounted to a total of  515 millions.&quot;The cuts proposed in the 1946 import programmes would still leave a deficit of  770 millions. This deficit must be reduced and,unless there was a drastic and rapid cut in our overseas military andpolitical expenditure, there was no alternative to cutting food imports and reducing employment through restrictions on the import of machinery and raw materials. He had asked Lord Keynes to statefrankly the facts of our overseas deficit and their implications for future policy, and the results were set out in the Annex to cp. (46) 58. While he was not committed to all the details given or the recommendations made by Lord Keynes, he thought that the broad conclusions were unmistakable and called for urgent action.We could not afford to go on giving financial assistance to countrieslike France and Holland, who in gold and dollar balances were in amuch better position than we ourselves. Nor was it right that weshould remain entirely responsible for dollar supplies for the british zone in Germany. Again, it seemed most desirable that we should reduce our expenditure in Egypt and take every possible step to hasten the disbanding of the Polish Army. He did not ask theCabinet to take a decision on these matters forthwith, but urged thatthe seriousness of the position should be appreciated and that urgentsteps should be taken to remedy it.The Lord President supported the proposal of the Chancellorof the Exchequer that there should be an urgent examination of themeans of reducing our overseas expenditure as a whole. Theproblem was not confined to dollar expenditure and it seemed desir-able that, just as action had been taken to meet the internaldifficulties, such as the shortage of man-power, revealed in theEconomic Survey (CP. (46) 32), so similar measures should betaken, possibly by the appointment of a Committee of Ministers, toconsider and recommend to the Cabinet means of reducing the overseas deficit.The Foreign Secretary said that he doubted whether enoughwas being done to ease our difficulties by a policy of improvisation.Was our shipping being managed in such a way as to reduce to aminimum the strain on our dollar resources ? Could we not addvariety to our diet by increasing our imports of dried fruits fromthe Mediterranean 1 Was sufficient priority being given to the con-version of refrigerated tonnage, and was every opportunity taken of using, for civilian purposes, refrigerated tonnage still under thecontrol of the Admiralty ? Unless all the Departments concernedworked together from day to clay by every means in their power, he did not see how any solution could be found.In reply to a suggestion that some contribution should be madeby the Dutch towards our expenditure in Indonesia, he said that,before any such approach was made to the Netherlands Govern-ment, it would be necessary to consider very carefully its effects onour foreign policy. The views of the Chiefs of Staff should also beobtained.The President of the Board of Trade said that the estimate of receipts amounting to  700 millions in 1946 assumed that the exist-ing ratio for. the division of supplies between exports and home consumption was maintained. There was no difficulty in obtainingorders for exports at the present time, but there was a real danger that we should fail to reach our export target because of the shortageof coal for industrial purposes. Thus, there had already been cutsin industrial coal supplies in the North-West Which would affect theproduction of textiles both for export and for home consumption.He also suggested that it might be well worth while to spend a fewmore millions on increased imports of food if, as was stated, an ease-ment in the food position would lead to the production of more goods for export. He hoped that any retrenchment of overseas expenditure would still allow a certain amount of expenditure on trade credits,which were essential if we were to secure overseas markets for our exports in future years.
The Minister of Food pointed out that the cut in the Depart-mental programmes proposed by the Chancellor of the exchequer would mean that, with one or two minor exceptions, he would be unable to make any easement in the food situation. Unless people were given more variety in their diet there would be a feeling of discontent and frustration, and industrial output would sufferseriously. He accordingly urged that the provisional figure for food imports in 1946 should be raised from  540 millions to  560 millions.He was doing everything possible to obtain food supplies fromEuropean countries and from the Dominions, but it must be realised that, if we were to obtain increased supplies from the Dominions, wemust be prepared to give them long-term contracts.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs pointed out that itwas unreasonable to expect the Dominions to increase their exportsto this country unless we were prepared to give them a guarantee ofa market for some years in advance.In further discussion, there was general support for the viewthat there should be some easements of the food situation proposed under the revised import programmes set out in CP. (46) 53.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that itwas clearly necessary that everything possible should be done toreduce the size of the overseas deficit. The Defence Committee hadalready considered the possibility of reducing overseas military expenditure; and the memorandum by Lord Keynes, which theChancellor of the Exchequer had circulated under cover of cp. (46) 58, would be considered by the Defence Committee with aview to their making recommendations to the Cabinet on this aspect of the matter. The Cabinet should realise, however, that the presentsituation in areas like India, Indonesia and Palestine made itimpossible to contemplate any immediate withdrawal of Britishtroops. On the other hand, subject to the points made by the foreign secretary, consideration might be given to obtaining some recom-pense from the Dutch and the French for the services which we wererendering to them, and the possibility of obtaining aid from Canadatowards the problem of supplying the British zone in germany should be explored. He would consult with the Chancellor of theExchequer with a view to deciding how these matters might best be handled.With regard to the food import programme, the general sense of the Cabinet seemed to be in favour of providing some additionalvariety of diet, even at the cost of adding to the immediate deficit,and he suggested that the Cabinet should approve an addition of 10 millions to the Ministry of Food programme for the first halfof 1946, on the understanding that there &quot;would be a corresponding reduction in the provisional figure for the second half of 1946.This figure would, of course, come up again for review once theposition with regard to the American loan was clear.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that in order to provide additional variety of dietthe Ministry of Food import programme for the first half of 1946 should be increased from  271 millions to 281 millions, and that, pending a further review ofthe provisional import programmes fox the second halfof 1946, the Ministry of Food programme for this period should be reduced from  269 millions to  259 millions.(2) Subject to (1), approved the Departmental import pro-grammes for the first six months of 1946 as set out inparagraph 26 of the Annex to CP. (46) 53.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would consider, in con-sultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, how theproblem of reducing the deficit in the balance of pay-ments might best be handled.
5.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, following the^preliminary discussion in Cabinet on the 7th February, he had con-suited with the Minister of Food on the extent to which we could continue to import dried eggs from the United States in 1946.The Minister of Food had wished to import in 1946 a total supply of 24,000 tons of dried eggs (domestic pack), 9,000 tons inthe first half-year and 15,000 tons in the second half-year. Whenthe matter came before Cabinet on the 7th February the Chan-cellor had been prepared to authorise the import of 9,000 tons inthe first half-year and 9,000 tons in the second half-year. after discussion with the Minister of Food he was now prepared to agree,on two conditions, to a total of 21,000 tons, of which 9,000 tons would be imported in the first half-year and 12,000 tons in thesecond half-year. The first condition was that, if Congress failedto ratify the proposed Loan Agreement, food imports (whether ofdried eggs or otherwise) would have to be reduced by an amountequivalent to this additional 3,000 tons of dried eggs. The secondcondition was that the Minister of Food should in any event reduce,by the dollar equivalent of this additional 3,000 tons of dried eggs,his supplementary programme of food imports designed to providegreater variety in the diet.After discussion, the Cabinet Agreed that, on the two conditions stated by the Chancellorof the Exchequer, the total import of dried eggs (domesticpack) in 1946 should be 21,000 tons, of which 9,000 tons would be imported in the first half-year.6. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs recalled that&apos;at their meeting on the 7th February the Cabinet had agreed that,if the position with regard to change of gauge could be safeguardedon the lines suggested by the Civil Aviation Committee, the UnitedKingdom delegation should be authorised to sign the Air TransportAgreement. In accordance with this decision the United kingdom delegation had proposed the inclusion in the agreement of a clauseon the lines set out in paragraph 3 of CP. (46) 44. The UnitedStates delegation had suggested an alternative version, which hadbeen considered by the Civil Aviation Committee at a meeting onthe 9th February. The Committee were generally satisfied withthe counter-proposal of the United States delegation but had suggested certain amendments to it. These amendments had been substantially accepted by the United States delegation and theCivil Aviation -Committee recommended that the Cabinet should now authorise the signature of the Air Transport Agreement.With regard to the heads of agreement relating to leased bases,the United States Government had now agreed to drop their request that we should undertake to use our good offices to persuade New-foundland and Canada to agree to American airfield requirements in Newfoundland and Labrador. They had also abandoned theproposal that the agreement should stipulate that all civil aircraftusing the bases should obtain their supplies from the United states military authorities and had proposed that this matter should bedealt with by separate negotiations. There still remained, however,a number of other outstanding points on which the Civil aviation committee were not satisfied, and in these circumstances they had considered a compromise solution proposed by the United kingdom delegation under which the heads of agreement should merely beinitialled ad referendum. They had reached the conclusion thatthis solution would be acceptable, with the reservation that the document initialled was intended to be subject to a formal contract which would deal with any outstanding points, more particularly the important points aiusing on Articles III, VIII and XL Afurther telegram had now been received which substantiallyaccepted the reservation proposed, although it omitted any referenceto Article III.
The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he must insist on the inclusion of a reference to Article III in the reservation.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the United Kingdom delegation should beauthorised to sign the Air Transport Agreement.(2) Agreed that the heads of agreement relating to leased basesshould be initialled ad referendum, subject to a reserva-tion on the lines suggested, which should include a specific reference to Article III.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,&apos; .
