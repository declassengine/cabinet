Egypt.(previous reference:CM. (46) 37thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Prime Minister said that the discussions at themeeting of Foreign Ministers in Paris were narrowing down to the strategic position in the Mediterranean, and the Foreign secretary had reported that it would be helpful to him in these discussionsif it could now be publicly declared that it was the policy of HisMajesty&apos;s Government to withdraw all British troops from Egypt.At their meeting on the 24th April the Cabinet had agreed that), atthe outset of the formal negotiations for the revision of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, the British Delegation should make the offer of complete evacuation, but they were to make it clear that it wouldtake five years to complete the withdrawal of all troops. This offerhad been communicated to the Egyptian Delegation, and it was known that they would seek in negotiation to secure agreement tocomplete the evacuation in a shorter time. The British delgation had, therefore, reported to the Foreign Secretary that, while therewould be no objection to announcing that it was our policy to with-draw from Egypt, the Egyptian Government would be strongly opposed to our stating publicly at this stage that the evacuationwould not be completed for five years. The British Delegationthemselves deprecated any public reference to the five-year period,since this would cause such consternation in Egypt as to prejudice the chances of negotiating a satisfactory agreement. they therefore suggested that an announcement should be made in thefollowing terms :  &quot; It is the considered policy of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom to consolidate their alliance with egypt as one between two equal nations having interests in common. In pursuance of this policy negotiations have begun. in an atmosphere of cordiality and goodwill. The Govern-ment of the United Kingdom have proposed to withdraw all british naval, military and air forces from Egyptian territory,and to settle in negotiation the stages and date of completionof this withdrawal and the arrangements to be made by theEgyptian Government to make possible mutual assistance intime of war or imminent threat of war in accordance with the alliance.&quot;Sidki Pasha had agreed that an announcement in these terms mightbe made by the British Delegation as having his full concurrence.The Foreign Secretary had said that, from the point of view ofhis discussions in Paris, it would be convenient if authority couldbe given for this announcement to be made that day.In discussion the view was expressed that we should not behurried into making a declaration of our intention to evacuate from egypt, before we had any assurance that the Egyptian Govern-ment would agree upon a reasonable period for the completion ofthe evacuation or would accord the facilities which we desired for bringing British troops back into Egypt on a threat or actual out-break of war. Dominion Ministers had been anxious that in thecourse of the negotiations we should secure satisfactory facilitiesfor military bases in time of war. Was it not likely that our negotiating position would be impaired if at the outset we made apublic declaration containing an unqualified offer of completeevacuation ?The point was also made that the recent agreement between theSoviet and Persian Governments regarding the exploitation of the oilfields in Northern Persia might be found to threaten the securityof our oil concessions in Central Persia which were of vital import-ance to us. This increased the importance of maintaining ourposition in the Middle East; and it seemed hazardous to make an unqualified offer of withdrawal from Egypt until we had securedan alternative location for military bases in the Middle East whichwould safeguard our oil supplies.On the other side, it was pointed out that the Cabinet hadalready agreed that it would be impracticable for us to seek tomaintain our existing position in Egypt by the use of force.   In
present circumstances we could only secure military facilities thereby agreement with the Egyptian Government. The issue, there-fore, resolved into one of tactics should we secure a more favour-able atmosphere in which to negotiate a satisfactory agreement if at the outset we made a public offer of complete evacuation&apos;? TheBritish Delegation in Egypt had always advised that such a declaration-tion would create an atmosphere in which it would be easier forthem to negotiate a satisfactory agreement, both on the period within Avhich the evacuation should be completed, and also on thedefence obligations to be accepted by Egypt; and they had onlyabandoned the idea of a public declaration because of the Cabinetsearlier insistence that the period of five years should also be mentioned. The concluding phrases of the announcement nowproposed would make it clear that we had still to settle in negotia-tion the stages and the date of completion of the withdrawal andthe arrangements to be made by the Egyptian Government tofacilitate mutual assistance on a threat or actual outbreak of war.It was the view of the Cabinet that the balance of advantage lay on the side of making a public announcement in the terms proposed by the British Delegation in Cairo.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of State to arrange for the british delegation in Cairo to be authorised to make animmediate public announcement, in the terms set out above, declaring that the United Kingdom Governmenthad offered to withdraw all British troops from egypt and to settle in negotiation the stages and date of completion of this withdrawal and the arrangements tobe made by the Egyptian Government to facilitatemutual assistance on a threat, or actual outbreak, of war.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would informDominion Ministers at their meeting later that day ofthe circumstances in which His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthad authorised this announcement.2. The Prime Minister said that the Foreign Secretary had asked the Cabinet to reconsider their decision that they must reject the request of the United States Secretary of State for the cession of the island of Tarawa to the United States. The foreign secretary was convinced, from the conversations which he had had with Mr. Byrnes in Paris, that the time was ripe to make such a gesture to the United States; and, if there were constitutional difficulties about ceding Tarawa, he would like to offer a lease in perpetuity. In either event the United States would be preparedto give us full landing rights; and a concession regarding thissingle island should not prejudice any general negotiations aboutbases in the Pacific. The island meant little to us but much to theUnited States; and a concession here might have an appreciableeffect on important negotiations now proceeding between thiscountry and the United States. Though the Cabinet had thoughtthat this gesture would have little effect en Congress proceedings onthe Loan, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington took the opposite view on this point.Discussion showed that, in spite of the views expressed by theForeign Secretary and His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington,the Cabinet were still of opinion that it would be inadvisable to accede to this request for the cession of Tarawa. In the previous discussion the point had been made that it would be wrong to cedethe island without taking any steps to ascertain the views of its3,000 inhabitants. It was now pointed out that cession would affect,not only the 3,000 inhabitants of Tarawa, but the 30,000inhabitants of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands, of whichTarawa wras the administrative centre.   A further considerationUnited StatesRequest forBases in the pacific.Request forCession ofTarawa.(previous reference:C.M.(46)41stConclusions,Minute 1.)
21CM. 42 (46).    189was that a sudden unilateral decision to cede this.island to theUnited States might be regarded with suspicion by the SovietGovernment. It was clear from the discussion at the meeting ofDominion Ministers on the 3rd May that a decision by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to cede this island to the United States would be strongly resented by the Governments of Australia and NewZealand.There was considerable force in these objections to the proposal and in the other objections which had been raised in the cabinet&apos;s earlier discussion. The only argument in favour of the proposal was that it would be a gesture which would be well received by publicopinion in the United States and might have a favourable effect onthe Congress proceedings on the Loan. Public sentiment in theUnited States should be equally gratified by a decision to dedicatesome part of the island, without change of sovereignty, as a memorial to the United States Marines. As regards the attitudeof Congress towards the Loan, it was the view of the Cabinet that a last-minute offer to cede this island might well produce the oppositeeffect to that which Mr. Byrnes had in mind.The Cabinet-Reaffirmed their decision that they must reject the proposal that His Majesty&apos;s Government should cede the island ofTarawa to the United States.Germany.Work ofControlCommissionin british zone.(previous reference:CM. (46) 41stConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Minister&apos; of State said that the Foreign Office had nowbeen able to examine the draft of the White Paper which theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster had wished to publish onthe administration of the British Zone in Germany. Some passages in the draft would need careful consideration and it would in any event have been impossible to settle the terms of the draft in timefor it to be published before the debate in the House of commons on the 10th May. The draft contained, however, a good deal ofinformation which might usefully be made public and could not be embodied in Ministerial speeches in the debate. In these circum-stances the Foreign Office thought that there might be advantages in publishing the White Paper at a later stage after the debate hadtaken place.The Lord President said that he would like to consider thisproposal after the draft had been made available to Ministersgenerally. Presentation of a White Paper might provoke a demandfor a further debate.The Cabinet-Agreed that no undertaking should be given to publish a White Paper on the work of the Control Commission inGermany until a draft of such a White Paper had beenconsidered by the Cabinet.Germany. 4.   The  Cabinet  considered  a  joint  memorandum  by  theDespatch of Secretary of State for War, the Secretary of State for Air, the families to Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the ParliamentaryB.A.O.R. Secretary to the Admiralty (CP. (46) 147) proposing that officersand men of the three Services and members of the staff of theControl Commission serving in North-West Europe should beallowed to have their wives and families with them. The main features of the scheme proposed were set out in Annex A to CP.(46) 147 and an estimate of the cost was given in Annex B.The Secretary of State for War said that some such schemewas required in order to maintain the morale of our Forces inGermany, particularly as similar arrangements had already beenmade for the benefit of the United States and Russian troops inGermany.   His colleagues and he felt that it would be unwise to
start any movement of families at the present time when, owing tothe food situation, there was grave distress among the civil popula-tion of Germany and a possibility of disorder; but they hoped thatthe Cabinet would approve the scheme in principle so that thenecessary preparations might be made. Since the memorandum had been circulated, he had been informed that only about 4,400Army wives were likely to take advantage of the scheme : it was thought that wives of other ranks would hesitate to accept the offer of transfer to Germany because of the fear that, during their absence, they would lose possession of the accommodation which they now occupied in this country.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that the recruiting of staff for the Control Commission would continue tobe hampered if no provision were made for wives and families togo out to Germany. The Commander-in-Chief in Germany was pressing for the scheme to be put into operation forthwith, but hisown view was that it should be deferred for a month or two. It was,however, important that the Departments concerned should beauthorised to proceed with their preparations, including the recruit-ment of from 150 to 300 teachers.In discussion it was suggested that a preferable course wouldbe to give more frequent leave to officers and men stationed in North-West Europe and to allow their wives to pay short visits to Germany.Particular objection was taken to the proposal to send children toGermany. If, as seemed likely, the children Avould be widelyscattered, a large number of teachers would be required at a timewhen there was a serious shortage of teachers in the UnitedKingdom. The removal of families from this country to germany for long periods would also create difficult housing problems in thiscountry, since local authorities could not afford to leave housesempty and would nevertheless hesitate to requisition housesbelonging to the wives of serving soldiers.The Cabinet Invited the Lord President, in consultation with theService Ministers, the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster, the Minister of Education, the Minister ofHealth, and the Secretary of State for Scotland, to review the proposals set put in CP. (46) 147 in the light of thepoints raised in discussion and to submit revised proposals to the Cabinet.Parliament.Payment ofRailway Faresof Peers.(previous reference:W.M.(44)25thConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs (CP. (46) 144) proposing that, subjectto suitable safeguards, Peers regularly attending the House of Lordsor its appointed Committees should be enabled to recover the railwayfares which they incurred in travelling to London for this purpose.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that sincethe General Election he had received continual representations fromPeers of all parties to the effect that in present circumstances several members of the House who desired to attend could do so onlyinfrequently because of the travelling expenses involved. Since theHouse of Lords was part of the constitutional machinery andperformed a useful function in revising legislation, it did not seemunreasonable that this concession should be made, particularly as ithad now been agreed that there should be an increase in the salaries of Members of the House of Commons. After consultation withthe officers of the House, he was satisfied that it would be possibleto devise satisfactory safeguards to prevent abuse; and the conces-sion would be restricted to Peers who attended at least 25 per cent,of the meetings of the House.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, although he had hitherto opposed this proposal, he would not press his oppositionif the general view of the Cabinet was in favour of it.
19023 CM. 42 (46).Discussion showed that the general sense of the Cabinet was infavour of adopting a scheme on the lines proposed in CP. (46) 144.It was felt, however, that before a final decision was taken on thismatter it might be desirable to take some soundings among Membersof the House of Commons.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord President, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs, to arrange to takesoundings as to the attitude of Members of the House ofCommons towards any proposal to pay the railway faresof Peers.8. The Cabinet had before them a joint memorandum by theLord President and the Minister of Labour (CP. (46) 179)submitting revised proposals for the constitution of a national industrial Conference.The Lord President said that these proposals had been formu-lated in consultation with officials of the Departments primarily concerned and had been shown to the Foreign Secretary, who had made no comments on them.The Minister of Labour would take the initiative in establishing the Conference and would be generally responsible for its organisa-tion. Other Ministers would, however, attend from&apos; time to time,and officials might also join in more detailed discussions. Tofacilitate full discussion of confidential information, the conference should be a small and authoritative body. Steps should be takento associate with it representatives of the boards of socialised industries, the local authorities as employers, and the co-operative societies, but he hoped that it would be possible to do this throughthe British Employers&apos; Confederation. He agreed that, in the firstinstance, it would be inadvisable to bring in the Federation ofBritish Industries though, if production questions arose, it mightbe necessary to bring them into the discussions either directly or through the National Production Advisory Committee for Industry.If the proposals were approved, it might be wise to make an informalapproach in the first instance to the acting General Secretary of theTrades Union Congress and the Secretary of the British Employers&apos;Confederation before official letters of invitation were sent out.The Minister of Labour commended these proposals to hiscolleagues. While it would be unwise to make any sudden change,it was clear that as time went on the existing methods of wageregulation would have to be adapted to the changing economicbackground, and in order to secure this it was important that theGovernment should have a channel through which the necessaryguidance could be given to both sides of industry. After the pre-liminary informal approach suggested by the Lord President, hewould propose to discuss the scheme with his Joint consultative committee before submitting it to the National Joint AdvisoryCouncil.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while he was generally in favour of these proposals, he thought that Ministersought to consider carefully in what form the information containedin the Economic Survey should be imparted to the Conference. TheFederation of British Industries might be aggrieved if informationwithheld from them were given to the bodies constituting theConference.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that, while he did not wish to reopen the issues considered at the Cabinefs earlier discussion, he still doubted whether the Government could dealadequately with the problem of wages policy by establishing a
National Industrial Conference.   He believed that, if the Govern-]ment were to operate successfully a policy of full employment, theywould have to face more directly the problems of wages policy andthe direction of labour.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals in CP. (46) 179 for the constitu-tion of a National Industrial Conference and invited the!Minister  of  Labour,   in  consultation  with  the  Lord!President,   to   proceed   with   the   arrangements   for!establishing the Conference.Parliament.legislative programme for the 1946-47Session.(previous reference:C.M.(46)33rdConclusions,Minute 2.)7. The Lord President recalled that in his memorandum!(CP. (46) 143) about major Bills for the 1946-47 Session, whichhad been approved by the Cabinet on the 11th April, he had drawnspecial attention to the confidential nature of his proposals, whichin part anticipated the content of The King&apos;s Speech on the Openingof Parliament at the beginning of the new Session. Although ithad been agreed in principle that the Bills listed in CP. (46) 143should form the main element in the 1946-47 Legislative Pro-gramme, it was most important that Ministers should avoid making Iany rjromises about the introduction of these Bills in advance ofThe King&apos;s Speech. Indeed, if the Legislative Programme was tobe planned properly, it was essential that Ministers should refrain from making any promises as to future legislation without firstobtaining express authority to do so from the Cabinet or the Legis-lation Committee. He hoped that this point would be borne in mindby all Ministers.The Cabinet endorsed the view expressed by the Lord President.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,6th May, 1946.
