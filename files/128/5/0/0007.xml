India.constitutional position.(previous reference:C.M.(45)56thConclusions,Minute 3.)1. The Prime Minister invited the Cabinet to consider theprocedure for the forthcoming Constitutional discussions in India.As soon as the last results of the provincial elections hadbeen announced (in April) steps would have to be taken to forma constitution-making body to determine the new constitution forIndia. At some point within the next few months it would alsobe necessary for the Viceroy&apos;s Executive Council to be re-formed,so as to make it fully representative of the various political parties in India. . The Viceroy had put forward a plan under which hewould initiate discussions in two stages. He would start discus-sions about the re-formation of his Executive Council as soon asthe results of the Punjab elections were known, in the latter partof February. Discussions about the constitution-making body wouldbe deferred until April. The India and Burma Committee had considered these proposals and had reached the conclusion that this procedure would have two considerable disadvantages. First, toconnect the opening of any discussions with the result of the punjab elections would inevitably throw the Pakistan issue intothe limelight. Secondly, the Committee felt that it would not, infact, be possible to keep discussion of the two issues in watertightcompartments, as Indian politicians would want to know theproposals of His Majesty&apos;s Government for the composition of theconstitution-making body before they accepted any proposals forthe reform of the Executive Council.These negotiations would be of great importance and com-complexity, and it was open to question whether it was fair to theViceroy to leave their conduct solely in his hands. He would haveto refer constantly to the Cabinet for guidance on major questions,and this would necessarily limit his freedom in negotiation. More-over, in the Prime Ministers view, it would be preferable that negotiations about the future constitution of India should not beundertaken by the person responsible for the daily government ofIndia under its present constitution.The India and Burma Committee had therefore reached theconclusion that it would be wise to send a Mission from thiscountry for the purpose of the negotiations. They thought thatthe members of the Mission should be of Cabinet rank, in orderto avoid embarrassment to the Viceroy. The Mission could consisteither of one person or of several. A single member of the cabinet would, however, be in a very isolated position : he too would con-stantly have to refer home for guidance : the responsibility of thetask would be great and it would hardly be fair to impose it on asingle individual.The Committee had therefore decided to recommend to theCabinet that three Ministers of Cabinet rank (including theSecretary of State for India) should go to India, to arrive thereabout the middle of March, to undertake these negotiations. Itwould be difficult to spare responsible Ministers for this task butthe issues involved were so important to the future of India, and,indeed, of the British Commonwealth, that the Committee believedthat the course they proposed was fully justified. Before theMission left, the Cabinet should lay down the broad framework within which they should operate, but within these limits theyshould be given full liberty during the negotiations. If the cabinet approved the proposal in principle, immediate steps would be takento draw up a draft directive for the Mission, which would besubmitted for consideration by the Cabinet.In order that His Majesty&apos;s Government might retain theinitiative, it was proposed that the intention to send out this special Mission should be announced in February, preferably beforethe results of the Punjab elections were known.In discussion the following points were raised : (a) The Secretary of State for India said that, if he were togo out to India for this purpose, he would welcome the presence of[31356-2] B 2
other Ministers on the Mission. He would hesitate to shoulder thewhole responsibility alone.(b) There was general agreement that, if such a Mission wereto be sent, it should consist of three Ministers of Cabinet rank.(c) It could be argued that by sending out a team of Ministersnow the last diplomatic card would have been played. Might it not be better to keep this in reserve, leaving the negotiations tothe Viceroy at the outset and sending out a Ministerial Mission only if the negotiations broke down?The general view was that all possible steps must be takento ensure that these negotiations did not fail. If there were a breakdown, it would be almost impossible to retrieve the position.Thus, the balance of advantage lay on the side of entrusting thenegotiations to a Ministerial Mission from the outset.(d) If the negotiations failed, the consequences would be veryserious. Civil disobedience might start as passive disobedience but would not stop at that. The Indian Army, while not likely tomutiny, might be unwilling to intervene to maintain order andthere might be a complete breakdown of the administration. Thenumber of European officers in the administration was now verysmall.(e) The Viceroy had a high reputation in India, particularly among the Army. It was most important not to give the impres-sion to the public, still less to the Viceroy himself, that he was beingby-passed and the negotiations conducted over his head. Moreover,it had, in fact, been announced in the last statement of policy thathe would be involved in the negotiations and he had been givingmuch thought to the subject during recent months. From all these points of view there would be considerable advantage in his beingassociated with the proposed Mission.On the other hand, the view was expressed that, if the Viceroywere associated with the negotiations, he would become a target for attack by Indian politicians. There was, therefore, something to besaid for his remaining outside the negotiations so that in the eventof a breakdown his popularity with the Indian public, and particu-larly with the Indian Army, would be undiminished.There was general agreement that the balance of advantage layin associating the Viceroy with the Mission in the negotiations.(/) It might be represented in India that the MinisterialMission was to take part in the negotiations in order to restrain theViceroy from concessions acceptable to Indians which he might otherwise have been ready to make. To prevent such an impressionbeing created, was it possible to give beforehand some evidence thatthe Government approached these negotiations in a liberal spirit ?It was difficult to suggest any practical measures which could usefully be taken to this end. The possibility of appointing Indiansas Provincial Governors was mentioned, and the Cabinet were informed that this was being kept well in mind.(g) Should the Ministers forming the Mission take with thempersons expert in trade union matters or in social or economic affairs,who would be able to make many useful contacts with indian leaders ?It was suggested that the Ministers appointed might keep thispoint in mind in selecting personal assistants to accompany them toIndia.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that a Mission of three Ministers ofCabinet rank should be sent to India, to arrive about themiddle of March, to conduct the forthcoming negotia-tions on the constitutional problem.(2) Agreed that the Viceroy should be associated with this mission in the negotiations.(3) Decided that an announcement about this Mission shouldbe made at an appropriate date in February.
(4) Took note that the Secretary of State for India would arrange for the draft of a directive to the Mission to beprepared forthwith, for consideration in the firstinstance by the India and Burma Committee, and there-after by the Cabinet.2. The Foreign Secretary reported that the Soviet delegation to the First General Assembly of the United Nations organisation had asked that the Security Council should consider the situationin Greece, and the Ukrainian Delegation had simultaneously asked that the Council should consider the situation in Indonesia. Thesemoves were doubtless prompted by the request of the Persian Govern-ment that the Security Council should investigate their difficulties with the Soviet Government in North Persia. The next move of theSoviet Delegation might be to suggest that none of these issuesshould be considered by the Security Council. The Foreign secretary said that he would resist any manoeuvre to secure by this means thatthe Persian issue was not considered by the Security Council. Ifthere were a general desire that the problems of Greece andIndonesia should be discussed by the Security Council, he, for his part, would not wish to oppose it.Our policy towards Greece had been fully explained inParliament, and he was prepared, if necessary, to make a full and frank statement on it to the Security Council.In Indonesia the position was more complex. This was not amatter for His Majesty&apos;s Government alone. Our troops were thereto accept the Japanese surrender as agents of the Supreme allied commander. Other Governments were involved and would haveto be consulted. They might take the view that it was inappropriate for the Security Council to consider a situation arising directly from measures taken to accept the surrender of Japanese forces.The Foreign Secretary said that, after he had consulted the otherGovernments concerned, he would confer with the Prime Ministerregarding the attitude to be taken towards the Ukrainian proposal.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of the general line which theForeign Secretary proposed to follow in this matter.3. The Foreign Secretary said that he had previously dis-cussed with his colleagues in the Defence Committee a request madeto him by the United States Secretary of State (Mr. Byrnes) forassistance in securing American requirements for military bases.This matter was of very close concern, not only to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom, but also to the Governmentsof Australia and New Zealand. Of the Pacific Islands in whichthe United States wished to establish military bases, one was underAustralian mandate, and another under New Zealand mandate; and several others were in the area of the Pacific which was of specialstrategic interest to Australia and New Zealand.The Foreign Secretary said that he and the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs had that morning held a meeting withMr. Byrnes and representatives of Dominion Governments now inLondon, at which it had been agreed that an Anglo-American Corn-mission should meet immediately after the end of the First general assembly of the United Nations Organisation to discuss the needsof the United States for military bases in islands under british control in the Pacific. This Commission would consist of both military and political representatives of the United States, theUnited Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. The Governmentsof Canada and South x\frica had indicated that they did not desireto participate in the work of the Commission.
The Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs to proceed with detailed arrange-ments for the holding of an Anglo-American Commission,on the lines indicated by the Foreign Secretary, to discussthe United States proposals for the establishment of mili-tary bases in certain islands in the Pacific now under british control.Poland. 4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ForeignPolish Armed Secretary (CP. (46) 13) outlining his proposals for the dispersal of forces under the Polish Armed Forces now under British command. They alsoBritish considered memoranda by the Chiefs of Staff (CP. (46) 18) and the command. Secretary of State for Air (CP.

(45)54th Forces had throughout been one of great difficulty. Large numbersConclusions, of these Poles bad been reluctant to return to Poland; and it was minute 4.) likely that, despite all our efforts, a substantial number would inthe end decline to return. These men had fought gallantly and wellduring the war, and it was most important that we should not beungenerous in our treatment of them. At the same time, the main-tenance of these substantial Polish Forces under arms was a source of increasing political embarrassment to us in our relations withthe Soviet Union and with Poland. It was also undesirable thatthe Poles should form so large a proportion of the Allied Forcesin Italy. Finally, the maintenance of these troops was extremelyexpensive, the present cost to the Exchequer being about  2^ million a month.In these circumstances our first aim must be to persuade as many as possible of these men to return to Poland. For this purposehe was obtaining from the Polish Government a precise statementof the conditions that would be offered to them on return; and he contemplated that this information should be included in a state-ment of our policy in respect of the future of the Polish armed forces, which would be drawn up for communication to all polish troops under British command. This statement must also includeinformation, which at this stage should be definitely discouraging,about the prospects for those not desiring to return to Poland.Before any such statement was issued, however, the first step was toexplain the position fully and frankly to General Anders and otherPolish leaders, who were at present using their great influence withtheir troops to prevent men from returning to Poland. He proposedthat these leaders should be brought to this country and be seen bythe Prime Minister and himself. It would probably be necessary toprevent them from returning thereafter to Italy.But, when every effort had been made on these lines, it mightwell be found that as many as 100,000 of these Poles were unwilling to return to Poland. These would probably be declared by thePolish Government to have forfeited their Polish citizenship. Itwas not necessary to decide in detail at this stage how these men should then be dispersed; but it should be recognised now that weshould be under a moral obligation to deal generously with them,even though it were not thought possible to grant them british nationality to the extent implied in the statement made by thelate Prime Minister on the 27th February, 1945 (quoted in Annex Ito CP. (46) 13). He was anxious that his colleagues should be aware of the position and should agree that the obligation must beaccepted. He hoped that it might be possible to absorb some ofthese Poles in this country, either in the Services or in civil employ-ment, and to arrange for others to be sent to other parts of theBritish Commonwealth. At a later stage he would discuss thesequestions in detail with the Ministers concerned.
Points made in discussion, were : (a) The Home Secretary said that he had no legal power to&quot;prevent General Anders from leaving this country.It was suggested that, without the exercise of any civil powers,military measures could be taken to secure that, as a soldier under british command, he did not return to Italy.(b) It would be possible to absorb a number of Poles into theRoyal Air Force. The Secretary of State for War said that it shouldalso be possible to absorb some into the Army.(c) The Home Secretary said that in view of their past experience the Home Office would be unwilling to accept, for thepurposes of applications for British naturalisation by members ofthe Polish Forces, certificates of character given by Polish officers.Supplementary evidence of character would have to be obtained.(d) The view was expressed that at the appropriate stage theDominion Governments, particularly Australia and New Zealand,should be strongly pressed to assist in the settlement of this difficult matter. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that hehad not yet felt free to raise this matter directly with them; butthe only Dominion which had so far shown any readiness to acceptimmigrants was Australia.(e) It might be an added inducement if men returning to poland received the same demobilisation benefits as were given toBritish soldiers. The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to look into this point.(/) The Minister of Labour asked that, if a committee were appointed to consider the treatment of Poles who refused to returnto Poland, the Ministry of Labour should be represented on it.(g) It was agreed that the political difficulties of sending thesemen to Poland from Italy by land outweighed the practical diffi-culties of sending them by sea. It was recognised that, if substan-tial numbers had to be sent by sea, this might involve some modi-fication of existing programmes of passenger shipping, both militaryand civil.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to proceed in this matter on the general lines indicated in C.P. (46) 13.(2) Took note of the points raised in discussion.5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (46) 17) outlining the policy and procedure to befollowed in negotiating a revision of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of1936. The Egyptian Government had presented in December lasttheir expected demand for revision of the Treaty and for the with-drawal of British troops from Egypt in time of peace. It was recommended that a reply should be sent, in the terms of the draftset out in Annex B to the memorandum, agreeing in general terms to a review of the present arrangements. Preliminary conversa-tions would be conducted in Cairo by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador,with the Service Commanders acting as his technical advisers; andthe instructions to be given to the Ambassador were outlined in annex C to the memorandum.The Foreign Secretary said that the new Treaty, thoughbilateral in character, should be so drafted as to fit into a regionaldefence system for the Middle East as a whole. The articles ofthe existing Treaty, which established the alliance and provided forextended facilities for our armed forces in time of war, were auto-miatically renewable in any revision of the Treaty; and this wouldbe taken as a point of departure in the discussion. It was essentialthat we should press for facilities to maintain British land and airforces in Egypt in time of peace, in order that we might be in aposition to give effective and speedy assistance in an emergency.
It was, however, his aim to move away from the idea of british forces of occupation in Egypt towards a conception of joint Anglo-Egyptian measures of defence. This should enable us to makeextensive use of Egyptian man-power in workshops and ancillary services, and thus to bring about a much-needed reduction in thescale of our military expenditure in this area.It was likely that we should be asked to recognise sole Egyptiansovereignty over the Sudan. This was very largely a point of prestige with the Egyptians. It could not, in his view, be conceded :we must continue to refuse to abandon our responsibilities towardsthe Sudanese peoples.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the Chiefsof Staff had been consulted by the Foreign Office in the preparationof the proposals put forward in CP. (46) 17, and they had nofurther comment to make.The President of the Board of Trade said that preparations were now being made for the conclusion of an Anglo-EgyptianCommercial Treaty. An awkward situation would arise if the com-mercial articles of the existing Treaty ceased to be operative beforethe new Commercial Treaty had been concluded. He therefore asked^ that the Board of Trade should be kept in touch with theprogress of the discussions on the main Treaty. The foreign secretary said that he would arrange for this to be done.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to reply to the egyptian government in the terms of the draft set out in Annex Bto CP. (46) 17.(2) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to instruct His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Cairo to open discussions with theEgyptian. Government on the lines of the instructionsset&apos;out in Annex C to CP. (46) 17.Housing 6.   The Minister of Health said that he had recently asked theAccommoda- Service Ministers to review their procedure for de-requisitioningtion. &apos; so as to expedite the release of accommodation suitable for housing,Release of       especially in the London area.   There were, however, other Depart-Eequisitioned   ments which still exercised requisitioning powers; and he wonderedPremises.        whether it might not be made a rule that no Department should infuture requisition housing accommodation without reference to theMinistry of Health or, in Scotland, the Department of Health forScotland.In discussion, the question was raised whether it was still necessary to maintain the war-time rule that, before requisitionedpremises were released by any Government Department, otherDepartments should be given an opportunity to ask that the premisesshould be allocated for their use.The Cabinet-Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for an enquiry to be made into the existing machinery for con-trolling requisitioning and de-requisitioning of premisesby Government Departments, with special reference to theneed for increasing as rapidly as possible the amount of accommodation available for housingCabinet Office, S.W.1.22nd January, 1946
