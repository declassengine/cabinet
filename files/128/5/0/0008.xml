Parliament. 1.   The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the business business in which it was proposed to take in the House of Commons during thethe House of    following week.Commons. The Second Reading and Financial Resolution of the CoalIndustry Nationalisation Bill would be taken on the 29th ^ and30th January. The Second Reading would be moved by the Ministerof Fuel and Power, and it was proposed that other government speakers during the two-days debate should be the Lord President,the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Parliamentary Secretaryto the Ministry of Fuel and Power. A Law Officer should be avail-able to speak during the debate in case it should become necessaryfor an authoritative legal opinion to be given on behalf of theGovernment on any of the complex legal issues raised by the Bill.In view of the large number of Front Bench speakers who wouldbe taking part in the debate, it was proposed to give a further two hours&apos; time on the first day : on the second day the Standing order would be suspended only for the purpose of securing the passageof the Financial Resolution.The Second Reading of the A cquisilion of Land (A uthorisationProcedure) Bill would be taken on the 31st January. The SecondReading would be moved by the Minister of Health, and the Minis-ter of Town and Country Planning would reply to the debate. other ministers departmentally interested in the Bill should be in atten-dance during the debate.The Report Stage and Third Reading of the Water (Scotland)Bill would be taken on the 28th January. The Secretary of Statefor Scotland said that, during his recent illness, this Bill had beenunder the. charge of one of the Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State for Scotland.&apos; He would like to take this opportunity of expressing his appreciation of the zeal and efficiencywith which his Under-Secretaries had carried on the work of theScottish Departments during his long absence.Business in The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that thethe House of Second Reading of the Straits Settlements Act (Repeal) BUI wouldLords. be taken in the House of Lords on the 29th January.   This Billcontained no provision for the laying before Parliament of theOrders in Council to be made under it; and the absence of sucha provision was likely to be criticised in the House of Lords. Hewould like guidance, before the debate, on the line which he shouldtake in reply to such criticism.The Lord President said that this question was to be discussed at a meeting which he was holding on the following day with theLord Privy Seal, the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and representatives of the Colonial Office.Goal.OpencastWorking inWentworthWoodhousePark.2. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP. (46) 20) about a proposal to extend the workingof opencast coal in Wentworth Woodhouse Park.The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that at their meetingon the 11th January (L.P. (46) 1st Meeting, Minute 2) the lord presidents Committee had been unable to reach agreement on thisproposal and had decided, on the suggestion of the Minister of fuel and Power, that the matter should be referred to theCabinet for decision. The arguments in favour of the proposal ofthe Minister of Fuel and Power were set out in Appendix II to cp. (46) 20, while Appendix III stated the case of the Minister ofToVn and Country Planning against it.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he did not deny thatthe working of opencast coal would affect the amenities of the Park.This, however, was not the only occasion on which opencast workinghad affected amenities, and in view of the gravity of the coal situa-tion he could not afford to neglect any method of securing additional
output. He had already relinquished some 300,000 tons of workablecoal in the Park and had given, assurances that everything possible&apos;would be done to restore any land affected by the proposed workings.If he wex^ to yield to the representations of the Minister of Townand Country Planning, the amount of coal which he would securewould be reduced from 371,000 to 140,000 tons, and it would beuneconomical to work this reduced quantity. His impression thatthe local objections to the proposal had been greatly exaggeratedhad been confirmed by the Minister of Pensions, who represented thedistrict in Parliament.The Minister- of Town and Country Planning said that acceptance of the proposal of the Minister of Fuel and Power wouldinvolve the destruction of one of the half-dozen finest pieces ofplanned landscape in the country. The Park was situated in avery grim industrial area, where it was specially important to pre-serve the amenities of such few open spaces as were available. Inthe time of the Coalition Government an understanding had beenreached that opencast working would be limited to the area southof the Garden : if the workings were now substantially extended, asproposed by the Minister of Fuel and Power, the Government wouldbe open to the criticism that they were prepared to make less effortthan their predecessors to protect the amenities of our country for public enjoyment. Nevertheless, to meet the views of the Ministerof Fuel and Power he was prepared to agree to the extension of operations to part of the Garden site, provided that, with a viewto preserving the beech avenue, the workings did not come within,say, 50 feet of the trees. The effect of this would be that some 50,000to 75,000 tons would be got from this site. He was also preparedto agree to the working of about half of the disputed area in thesouthern part of Temple Hill Plantation, which would yield aJ further 28,000 tons. Thus, the total amount of coal which theMinister of Fuel and Power would get from additional workingsin the Park would be about 240,000 instead of 140,000 tons.Points in discussion were :  (a) The Minister of A griculture and Fisheries said that, afterconsultation with the Chairman of the Forestry Commission, he nolonger wished to object to the destruction of trees which would be involved in the working of the Shire Oaks Wood site.(b) The Chancellor of the Exchequer urged that in reaching adecision the Cabinet should keep it in mind that the Park might% in due course become public property.    He strongly favoured thepublic acquisition of properties such as these.(c) A number of Ministers stressed the importance of pre-serving amenities in mining districts and pointed out that muchof the difficulty of maintaining an adequate labour force in themining industry was due to the unattractive surroundings in whichminers had to live.(d) The Lord President said that the strength of opposition tothe proposal of the Minister of Fuel and Power should not be under-rated. This opposition might be turned against the governments proposals for nationalising the coal industry.The Prime Minister said that the general sense of the cabinet was in favour of accepting the compromise which had been offered inthe course of the discussion by the Minister of Town and country planning.The Cabinet Agreed that the working of opencast coal in WentworthPark should be confined to those sites to which the Ministerof Town and Country Planning had already agreed,together with the additional portions of the Garden sie and the Temple Hill site referred at &quot; A &quot; above.
3. The Cabinet- considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP. (46) 15) proposing that the ban on the pro-motion of conscientious objectors in the Civil Service should be lifted on the 1st July, 1946.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that at their meetingon the 13th September, 1945, the Cabinet had determined other questions about the treatment of conscientious objectors in the CivilService, but had postponed deciding on what date the ban on theirpromotion should be raised. This ban had been imposed in orderthat Civil Servants who were conscientious objectors should not obtain any advantage as compared with colleagues who had joined the Armed Forces. The Chancellor thought it would be needlesslyharsh to maintain the ban until the last Civil Servant had returned from the Forces, and that substantial justice would be done if theban were lifted in the summer of 1946.The Cabinet-Agreed that the existing ban on the promotion of con-scientious objectors in the Civil Service should be raised onthe 1st July, 1946.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,24ih January, 1946.conscientious objectors.(previous reference:C.M.(45)31stConclusions,Minute 1.)
