1. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of the business which it was proposed to take in the House of Commons in theweek after the Easter Recess.The Second Reading of the National Health Service Bill wouldbe taken on the 30th April, 1st and 2nd May. The debate wouldbe completed by 6-30 p.m. on the 2nd May, after which other business would be taken. The Government spokesmen, in order ofspeaking, would be the Minister of Health, his parliamentary secretary and the Lord Privy Seal.On the 3rd May, in Committee of Supply, there would be a debate on Unemployment. The Minister of Labour would reply tothis debate, but the Secretary of State for War should be in attendance as particular reference would be made to unemployment among ex-service men.2.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofFood (CP. (46) 159) on recent developments in the world wheat. situation and their effect on supplies for the United Kingdom.The Minister of Food said that it now seemed clear that UnitedStates exports in the six months ending the 30th June would not reach anything like the quantity estimated to be available whenhe had been in Washington. This short-fall, together with the short-fall which also seemed inevitable from the Argentine, meant that world supplies in the six months to the end of June were not likely to exceed^ 11,500,000 tons compared with the proposedallocations of 13^500,000 tons.The position after the 30th June, though there were manyuncertainties, was also likely to be difficult. It was uncertain how much wheat could be expected from Canada in July, August and september; the Minister had assumed a supply of 175,000 tons ofwheat and 57,000 tons of flour for the United Kingdom, though these figures might be unreliable. With the quantities afloat atthe end of June, this would give us 532,000 tons of wheat during these months; but we required 1,609,000 tons if we were to buildup our stocks at the end of September to the prudent minimum of 900,000 tons of wheat and 400,000 tons of flour. We should,therefore, be short of our needs by 1,077,000 tons. The Ministersaw no prospect of meeting any considerable part of this deficitfrom the Argentine or from the United States. It would, therefore,be prudent to assume that we should have to meet the deficit outof our own resources; and the sooner we began to economise, theless severe the cuts would have to be.The Minister therefore proposed the following measures : (i) The flour extraction rate to be increased to 87-1 per cent, onthe 29th April and to 90 per cent, on the 30th May.(ii) Dilution of the grist with 8 per cent, barley from the6th May.(iii) - A reduction of the order of 25 per cent, in the productionof biscuits and minor cereal products.(iv) No further grain to be made available for distilling.(v) A cut in beer production to 80 per cent, of the pre-war production in terms of standard barrelage.(vi) The introduction of rationing of bread, oatmeal, flour andcake and flour confectionery.Bread rationing could not be introduced before the 15th July.The rationing would have to be severe if it were to meet theremaining deficit. The average consumer might have to be cut downto a consumption of 2\ lbs. a week compared with the presentaverage consumption of 4-J lbs. This was bound to involve a serious loss of productive efficiency.The effect of these measures on animal feeding-stuffs wouldbe little short of disastrous. Although the cessation of whiskv8-3] - B 2
distilling and the reduction in beer output would improve matters,there would still be a deficit of 1,523,000 tons over the next twelvemonths on the amount required to honour the recently reduced ration scales.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that theproposals made by the Minister of Food would involve the cuttingof the feeding-stuffs ration by about 50 per cent, in the summer and by even more in the winter. This would cause a heavy reductionin pigs and poultry and some reduction of milk supplies. these reductions could not quickly be made good, and our supplies offood would be affected for a long time to come. He suggested thatthe general picture presented by the Minister of Food was unnecessarily pessimistic. It was based on assumptions which he would wish to see more fully examined before he could agree to that partof the proposals which affected the supply of feeding-stuffs. Thus,the receipts of home-grown wheat and millable barley in august and September were estimated in the memorandum (page 17) at155,000 tons. He thought that they should be at least 300,000 tonsnet after setting aside 100,000 tons for seed.Discussion followed about the minimum level of wheat stocks.The calculations in the memorandum allowed for a stock of 900,000tons of wheat and barley and 400,000 tons of flour at the end ofSeptember. In normal years this might be prudent, but in thepresent serious emergency could this figure be justified \ substantial reductions in consumption levels were also proposed; and on this account the stocks allowed for would represent a larger numberof weeks&apos; supply.The need for the drastic measures proposed in the memorandumlargely depended on the estimate of supplies from Canada in July.August and September. The memorandum assumed shipments of175,000 tons of wheat and 57,000 tons of flour during these threemonths. In the last two days, however, our representative on the combined Food Board had been given informally by the represen-tative of the Canadian Wheat Board considerably higher figures.Could not the Canadian Government be pressed to give us an officialestimate?   This request should be made to them at a high level.Other points made in discussion were : (a) Bread made from flour, diluted with barley soon went sour.Dilution might not, therefore, in fact secure much economy.(&amp;) If the measures taken reduced the supply of milk to schoolchildren, this would have an immediate effect on their health, whichcould not be countered by increased consumption of bread orpotatoes.(c) The Minister of Food said that stocks on farms in theUnited Kingdom had been estimated at 500,000 tons at the31st March. He hoped to obtain 350,000 tons of these before the31st July. He had no estimate of stocks in the hands of bakers,but they could not at the most exceed 100,000 tons.The general feeling of the Cabinet was that, while they recog-nised the situation to be extremely serious, it would be inexpedient to adopt without fuller consideration the far-reaching measuressuggested in the memorandum. There would be advantage inawaiting the result of the present discussions in Washington.Meanwhile, an attempt should be made to obtain more definite information as to Canadian supplies. It was also suggested thatthe position might be studied in detail by the Ministers immediately concerned, with a view to the preparation of an agreed recommend a-tion to the Cabinet.The Cabinet :-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs andthe Minister of Food to arrange for the position to bpexplained to the Canadian Government and a request
to be made to them to give the firmest possible estimateof the supplies likely to be forthcoming from canadian  the latter part of this year.(2) Agreed to defer a decision on the proposals made by theMinister of Food until the results of the discussions in washington were known and the papers had been furtherstudied by the Ministers directly concerned.Discussion then turned on the question whether any additionalinstructions could be sent to our representative on the combined food Board for the meeting to be held in Washington later that day.The Foreign Secretary recalled that the United states ambassador had indicated to him on the previous day that theUnited States Government would be ready to order millers to set aside 25 per cent, of their supplies for export, provided that the canadians would raise their present &apos;&apos; set-aside &apos;&apos; order from 10 percent, to 25 per cent, and provided that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould make some similar contribution. Following the discussion at the meeting of Ministers on World Food Supplies, he had handedthe Ambassador later in the day a note, a copy of which hecirculated, to the effect that we were willing to make a contributionto immediate shipments but were in the difficulty that we had no assurance as to the amounts that we were due to receive during theremainder of the year. Not only, therefore, must we ask for aguarantee of replacement, but we must also satisfy ourselves so faras we could that wheat would, in fact, be forthcoming (e.g., fromsupplies now held on farms or fed to animals) to implement thatguarantee.He had since had a telegram from Lord Halifax emphasisingthat it was by no means certain that the United States Governmentwould agree to the &quot;set-aside&quot; order. There was considerable opposition to it by political parties and commercial interests. TheForeign Secretary thought it desirable that we should go as far aswe could to encourage the United States Government in theirdifficult decision. He therefore proposed that our representative should be given discretion, if the course of discussions seemed tohim to make it necessary, to increase from 100,000 tons to 200,000tons the amount of wheat which we should agree to divert from united Kingdom stocks or shipments afloat. He should make itclear that no diversion at all could be made except on the conditions laid down at the previous meeting of the Cabinet.After discussion the Cabinet- (3) Agreed that the previous instructions to our representative on the Combined Food Board should be modified on thelines indicated above.(4) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theMinister of Food, to arrange for a telegram to be sentto Washington accordingly.3. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Foreign Secre-tary (CP. (46) 139 and 156) on the future of the Ruhr, the Rhine-land and the Saar.The Foreign Secretary recalled that the agreement reached atthe Berlin Conference regarding the economic treatment ofGermany in the initial control period had included the principlethat during the period of occupation Germany should be treatedas a single economic unit. The French Government, who had not accepted this decision of the Berlin Conference, had subsequentlyproposed that the Ruhr and the Rhineland should be madepolitically independent of Germany. The object of this french proposal was to provide military security against the risk of futureaggression by Germany; but it would do so at the cost of creating a Germany which was not economically viable and an irredentist
problem which might eventually give rise to another nationalistmovement in Germany. In these circumstances he had looked foran alternative solution which, while avoiding the dangers of anyplan involving the political separation of the Ruhr from Germany,would meet the legitimate French demand that Germany should notagain be free to exploit the Ruhr industries for the purpose of launching further aggression in Europe. He had at first favoured the plan outlined in Annex A to GEN. 121/1 (circulated withCP. (46) 156) by which the Ruhr would remain politically a partof Germany, but its industries would be controlled by an inter-national holding company whose function it would be to exploit the resources of the Ruhr for the benefit of Europe as a whole. on further reflection, however, he felt that this plan for internationalownership of the Ruhr industries would encounter serious difficultiesin practice; and he now favoured the modified plan outlined in cp. (46) 139. This envisaged the formation of a new Germanprovince in the area affected by the scheme. The industries, insteadof being brought under international ownership, would be vested in a socialised German corporation, whose relation to the provincial government would be similar to that of the National Coal Board inthis country to His Majesty&apos;s Government. Germany&apos;s obligations in regard to these socialised industries would be specified in thepeace treaties, and an international control organisation would beestablished to supervise the performance of these obligations. Ascheme on these lines, emphasising political rather than industrialcontrol, was likely to be more acceptable to the French; and Germanopinion would certainly prefer to see German industries under german socialised ownership rather than under the ownership of aninternational corporation.The Foreign Secretary said that he would be glad to have theassistance of his colleagues&apos; views on this difficult issue. If they approved the scheme outlined in CP. (46) 139, he would like tohave their authority to put it to the Dominion Ministers at theforthcoming Conference in London and thereafter to maketentative proposals on these lines to the Governments of interestedforeign countries, particularly France, Belgium and Holland.As regards the Rhineland, he proposed to support the french proposal that French, Belgian and Dutch troops should be stationedindefinitely in German territory west of the Rhine, but to resist the proposal that this territory should be detached from Germany.As regards the Saar, he also proposed to support the french proposals that the ownership of the mines should be transferred toFrance, that the territory should be included in the French customs and currency system, that French military forces should be stationedpermanently in the territory, and that the territory itself should betransferred forthwith to French administration pending a final settlement.He also proposed to inform the United States Government thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government welcomed their draft treaty on thedisarmament and demobilisation of Germany (Annex C to GEN.121/1, circulated with CP. (46) 156) and thought that it wouldprovide a most useful basis for further discussion.Discussion turned on the proposals for the future control ofthe Ruhr.The Cabinet agreed that the French plan, involving the politicalseparation of the Ruhr from Germany, must be resisted. opinion was divided on the relative merits of the two alternatives, outlinedrespectively in Annex A to GEN. 121/1, circulated withCP. (46) 156, and in paragraph 5 of CP. (46) 139.In favour of the later plan outlined by the Foreign secretary in CP. (46) 139, the following points were made : (a) An international Board representing a number of national governments was not likely to be a satisfactory instrument for the efficient management of the Ruhr industries. German State owner-ship, subject to suitable international control, was more likely toproduce efficient management.
(b) We should not base our policy on the assumption thatGermany could be held down indefinitely by international control.The better policy was to promote the creation in Germany of anenlightened social democracy under which Germany could beallowed to take her place in the comity of nations. With this inview it would be wiser to leave these industries in Germanownership.(c) Under this scheme the Soviet Government need not be given any greater share in the control over the Ruhr industries than theywere prepared to concede to us in Eastern Germany, e.g., by partici-pation in the international control of the industrial area of Saxony.(d) This scheme faced the fact that Europe was now beingdivided into two spheres of influence; and it would give us anopportunity to prove that we could build up in Western Germany,under a democratic system, an efficient industrial organisation whichchallenged comparison with that which was being created undera different system in Eastern Germany.(e) This scheme, by leaving the ownership of the industries in German hands, was less likely to give rise to a second nationalistmovement based on a sense of grievance and frustration. Therewould be a grave risk of these industries being used for the creationof a war potiential if they were left in the control of a small butpowerful economic group of German nationals; but this risk neednot arise if we took this opportunity of bringing the industries under a socialised system of German ownership.On the other hand, a number of Ministers preferred the schemefor international ownership outlined in Annex A to GEN. 121/1.The main points made in favour of this alternative were : &apos;(/) One of the greatest dangers to the future peace of europe was the possibility that, as the years went by, the victorious powers would become increasingly reluctant to enforce a sufficient degreeof international control to prevent the re-emergence of a war potentialities-tial in Germany. International ownership of the Ruhr industries would afford a guarantee of continuing international control.(g) It would be difficult to find in Germany social democratswho had sufficient knowledge and experience to assume the manage-ment of a national corporation operating the Ruhr industries. Itwas more likely that the management of such a corporation would fall into the hands of industrialists and technicians who were likelyto be sympathetic towards the re-emergence of an extremenationalist movement in Germany..(h) A German corporation might adopt industrial policies which would prejudice our industrial interests. If the ruhr industries were controlled by an international company in which wehad a voice, it would be easier to ensure that their developmentconformed to the best industrial interests of the United Kingdom.(i) A system by which the Ruhr industries were brought under international ownership would assist us to rebuild Prance as a greatindustrial Power, and would also help us to foster the industrialprosperity of Holland and Belgium.lshe Foreign Secretary said that he had been reluctant toabandon his original plan for bringing the Ruhr industries under international ownership. At the same time, he attached consider -able importance to one feature of the new plan, viz., the creationof the proposed new German Province. In the light of the views expressed in the Cabinefs discussion, he now suggested that in theexploratory discussions which he wished to hold with interestedforeign Governments he should tentatively put forward both thealternative plans and should also consider whether, if there were a general preference for a system of international ownership, this could not be combined with the creation of a new German Provincein the Ruhr.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to discuss the future ofthe Ruhr and Western Germany with the Dominion
Ministers visiting London for the forthcoming Con-ference and thereafter with the Governments of interested foreign countries, particularly France,Belgium and Holland, on the following basis : (i) An attempt should first be made to secure agreement in principle to the establishment of a new GermanProvince in the Ruhr. Subject to this, futurecontrol over the Ruhr industries might be securedeither through international ownership, on thelines of the scheme set out in Annex A to GEN.121/1 (CP. (46) 156) or through the creation of ?;a socialised German corporation subject to inter-national control, on the lines indicated in para-graph 5 of CP. (46) 139. The views of theDominion Ministers and foreign governments should be sought on both these alternative schemes,(ii) French, Belgian and Dutch troops should be stationed in German territory west of the Rhinefor an indefinite period, but this territory shouldnot be detached from Germany,(iii) Ownership of the Saar mines should be transferredto France; the Saar territory should be includedin the French customs and currency system;French troops should be stationed permanently inthe Saar; and the territory itself should be trans-ferred forthwith to French administration Jpending a final settlement. The assets so trans- 1ferred should be debited to France on reparationaccount.(2) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to inform the UnitedStates Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government wel-welcomed their draft treaty on the disarmament and demobi-lisation of Germany (Annex C to GEN. 121/1 circulated with CP. (46) 156) and regarded it as a useful basis for further discussion.(3) Took note that the Foreign Secretary was proposing tosubmit to the Cabinet in the near future a further memo-randum on the wider question of policy towards germany as a whole.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,17th April, 1946.
