United StatesRequest forBases in the pacific.Request forCession ofTarawa.(previous reference:CM. (46) 7thConclusions,Minute 3.)1. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that on theprevious afternoon the Foreign Secretary had had a conversationm Paris with the United States Secretary of State about the requestof the United States Government for bases in the Pacific. Duringthe course of this discussion Mr. Byrnes had suggested that, inadvance of further consideration of the general question, the UnitedKingdom Government should make an immediate announcement oftheir readiness to cede to the United States the Island of Tarawain the Gilbert and Ellice Islands. This Island has been the scene of one of the most glorious actions of the United States Marinesduring the war, and its cession to the United States in memoryof that action would make a deep impression on public opinion inthe United States. An immediate announcement that it was to beso ceded by His Majesty&apos;s Government should materially assist theproceedings in Congress on the Loan.The Foreign Secretary had expressed his sympathy withMr. Byrnes&apos;s proposal and had undertaken to submit it at once forthe consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government.In discussion it was pointed out that there were serious objections to adopting this suggestion. Tarawa was the administra-tive centre of the Gilbert Islands and contained 3,000 inhabitantswho were British subjects. It would be contrary to our principles to cede the territory to a foreign State without taking any stepsto ascertain the wishes of the inhabitants. It would be impracticable-able to take a final decision without first consulting the Governmentsof Australia and New Zealand; both these Governments had been strongly opposed to the proposal when it had been mooted earlier;and it was most unlikely that they would agree to it now, in viewof their attitude towards the general question of bases in the Pacific.It would in any event be necessary to take His Majesty&apos;s pleasurebefore a decision to cede a part of British territory was announced.And in general, it was undesirable that any such requests shouldbe considered in isolation; proposals for the cession of british territory ought only to be considered as part of some general schemefor common defence or in accordance with security arrangementsdevised under the procedure of the United Nations.On the argument of expediency, the view was expressed thatit was not to be assumed that a sudden announcement of a decisionto cede Tarawa to the United States would in fact influencefavourably the Congress discussions about the Loan. It was quite possible that such an announcement might have the opposite effect;for it might be represented that the decision had been taken withthis purpose in view, and it would then be regarded as a last-minuteattempt to buy a favourable decision.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while he did not dissent from this view, he would like to consider whether it would be helpful if some more general statement could be made to the effectthat, if the Loan were authorised by Congress, we should find it easier to discuss in a sympathetic way the general question ofaccording facilities to the United States for bases on british territory.The Prime Minister said that he would inform Dominion PrimeMinisters, at their meeting later that day, that this proposal hadbeen put forward by Mr. Byrnes and that the United KingdomGovernment had felt obliged to reject it.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that they must reject the proposal that HisMajesty&apos;s Government should take an immediate decisionto cede the Island of Tarawa to the United States!(2) Invited the Prime Minister to ask the Foreign Secretaryto inform Mr. Byrnes that, while His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment were unable to deal in isolation with his requestin respect of Tarawa, they would be willing, togetherwith the Governments of Australia and New Zealand,to consider this request sympathetically as part of thegeneral problem of bases in the Pacific.
Germany.ffork ofControlCommissionin british zone.(previous reference:CJl. (46) 29thConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The Lord President said that the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster had prepared the draft of a White Paper on theadministration of the British Zone in Germany. This was largely a factual statement recording the work of the Control Commission;and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster thought it would be helpful if he could present it to Parliament in advance of the debate on the work of his Department which was to take place on the10th May. The Lord President asked whether the Cabinet could agree to the publication of this White Paper, sub j ect to scrutiny of the draft by the Foreign Office and the Chiefs of Staff.The Prime Minister recalled that it had been agreed on the1st April that, before any undertaking was given that such a white paper would be published, the matter must be considered by theCabinet; and he did not think that the Cabinet could authorise theChancellor of the Duchy to publish such a White Paper without having first studied the draft.Further discussion showed that it was the general view of theCabinet that it would be preferable not to present any White paper for the purpose of the debate on the 10th May. It would be preferable that this information about the work of the control commission in Germany should be reserved for use by the Chancellorof the Duchy in his speech in the debate.The Cabinet Agreed that it would be inexpedient to publish, before the debate on the 10th May, a White Paper on the work of theControl Commission in Germany.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,3rd May, 1946.
