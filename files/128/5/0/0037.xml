Egypt.(previous reference erence  :CM. (46) 33rdConclusions,Minute 4.)1. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that the british delegation which had gone to Cairo to negotiate the revision of theAnglo-Egyptian Treaty had now exhausted the possibilities ofmaking progress by preliminary talks with the King and SidkyPasha and had reached the point at which they must commit themselves to formal proposals at official meetings with the egyptian delegation. The British Delegation had reported that two courseswere open to them. The first alternative was to put forward fordiscussion the proposals envisaged in their existing instructions,viz., evacuation of British troops from Cairo and Alexandria andremoval of combatant troops from the rest of Egypt. They were satisfied, however, that the Egyptian Delegation would reject theseproposals. Insistence on them was likely to provoke seriousdisorder in Egypt: British troops would have to be used in anattempt to restore order : and the resulting situation was likely tobe brought before the Security Council. The second alternative wasto offer at the outset complete evacuation of all British troops from egypt by a specified date. We should be able to complete theevacuation from Cairo and Alexandria within eighteen months, butit would be physically impossible to withdraw all troops from thewhole of Egypt in less than five years. During that time thesituation might change, and the attitude of the Egyptian Govern-ment and people might become more favourable. The offer of complete evacuation would in itself tend to create an atmospherein which it would be easier to make suitable arrangements tofacilitate the return of British troops to Egyptian territory at atime of apprehended emergency or actual war.The Defence Committee had considered the position earlierthat day and were disposed to favour the adoption of the second alternative.In discussion, emphasis was laid on the importance of securingthe full assent of the Egyptian Government to our estimate that itwould be physically impossible to complete the process of evacuationin less than five years. It was most important to avoid creatingthe impression that we had offered withdrawal merely to gain timeand were delaying the process of evacuation. It was agreed that,from this point of view, it would be helpful if, at the appropriatestage, a public announcement could be made, with the concurrence of the Egyptian Government, which made it clear that they acceptedour estimate of the minimum time required to complete this with-drawal.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to authorise the british delegation in Cairo to offer, at the outset of their formalnegotiations, that all British troops would be evacuated from Egypt within a period of five years.World Food 2.   At their meeting on the 17th April the Cabinet had agreedSupplies. to defer a decision on the proposals made by the Minister of Food(Previous in CP. (46) 159 for economies in the consumption of cereals in the reference: United Kingdom in order that these proposals might be consideredCM. (46) 36th in the light of more precise estimates of the supplies of wheat likelyConclusions, to be forthcoming from Canada in the latter part of 1946 and the minute 2.)      results of the discussions in Washington between our representative on the Combined Food Board and the United States Secretary ofAgriculture,The Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Food (CP. (46) 167), reporting the results of theWashington discussions and covering a copy of a letter from theHigh Commissioner for Canada giving an official estimate of canadian shipments of wheat to the United Kingdom up to the endof September.
The Minister of Food said that in paragraph 2 of CP. (46) 167he had set out the measures which the United States government proposed to take to reduce flour consumption and to make availablefor export increased quantities of wheat and other grains. TheUnited States Government had also accepted the conditions onwhich His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to divert 200,000tons of grain from the United Kingdom during the months ofApril and May, and our representative on tile Combined food board had therefore been instructed to intimate that this diversionwould be made. The destinations to which the 200,000 tons wereto be directed were still under consideration and the proposals underdiscussion in Washington were shown in paragraph 6 of cp. (46) 167. It was now for the Cabinet to decide what adminis-trative measures should be introduced in the United Kingdom to match those adopted by the United States Government. The revised estimates of Canadian shipments to the United Kingdom up to theend of September indicated that the shortfall in Canadian wheatwould be less than he had originally thought. Nevertheless, he was still faced with a deficit against estimated requirements of 600,000tons after August if the United States Government gave us noassistance in August and September, and on this account economies in consumption in the United Kingdom should be introducedwithout delay.The Cabinet first considered what stocks would be available inthe United Kingdom at the end of September. It was suggestedthat if the consumption rate was 418,000 tons a month, if the UnitedStates Government implemented their assurances to meet any short-fall in Canadian shipments in June and July, and if supplies ofhome-grown wheat from the new harvest amounted to 300,000 tonsin August and September, the stocks at the end of September wouldtotal about 796,000 tons. The Minister of Food feared that this low level of stocks would cause difficulties in distribution; but thegeneral feeling was that in the circumstances the Cabinet would bejustified in accepting a stock figure of this order. At the same time,in view of the hypothetical nature of some of the estimates, it was felt that some economies should be introduced at once.The Cabinet then considered the various measures which hadbeen proposed by the Minister of Food for reducing the consumptionof cereals.  The following points were made in discussion : &apos;(a) There was general agreement that, although on medical grounds there would be no objection to an increase in the extraction rate to 90 per cent., the rate should not be increased in view of the resulting deterioration in the keeping qualities of bread and theheavy loss in animal feeding-stuffs. It was agreed that for thesame reasons the possibility of diluting the grist with 8 per cent, of barley should be rejected.(b) In view of the limited choice of foods available at thepresent time, a reduction in the production of biscuits and minorcereals products would bear very hardly on the public, and it wasagreed that no such reduction should be made for the present.(c) The proposal to make no further grain available fordistilling should not be adopted for the present, but beer production should be reduced to 90 per cent, of the pre-war production in termsof standard barrelage.(d) The 2-lb. loaf should be reduced to If lbs. There should beno corresponding reduction in the price of the loaf, and the cost ofliving index figure should be kept down by making compensatingreductions in the prices of other food-stuffs.(e) The restrictions already imposed on the serving of breadwith main meals in restaurants appeared, on such evidence as was available, to have had a considerable effect, but the rule that breadshould not be offered was often evaded. The time had come to prohibit absolutely the serving of bread with main meals.The Prime Minister said that a statement should be made onthe following day indicating the measures which the Government[31888-4] b 2
had decided to adopt. This statement should refer not only to themeasures mentioned in paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) above, but shouldalso indicate what had been done already in the way of raising the extraction rate, and should make comparisons not merely withthe position during the war but with normal pre-war standards.Other points in discussion were : (/) The Foreign Secretary suggested that an enquiry should bemade to establish the level of distributed stocks of wheat and flour.(g) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs pointed outthat m paragraph 6 of CP. (46) 167 it was proposed that, of the200,000 tons made available by diversion from the United Kingdom,up to 10,000 tons should be directed to South Africa.. He felt that,in view of the very difficult situation in South Africa, our repre-sentative on the Combined Food Board should be instructed to press that the amount allocated to South Africa should not fall short of10,000 tons.The Secretary of State for the Colonies urged that the needs of malaya and Hong Kong should also be kept in mind when thebalance of the 200,000 tons was being allocated, and that suppliesamounting to at least 10,000 tons should be directed to these Colonies,Our representative should also stress the extremely serious position in India.(h) The Minister of Food said that he was likely to have a surplus of potatoes in the immediate future and he proposed to try to make an agreement with the Belgian Government underwhich, in return for an export of 40,000 tons of potatoes from theUnited Kingdom to Belgium over a period of eight weeks, theBelgian Government would manufacture from their surplus suppliesof maize the quantity of starch which they had undertaken to supply to us. This would enable us to retain in this country the suppliesof maize which we should otherwise have to had to export to belgium.The Minister of Fuel and Poiuer said that, in view of the urgent need to maintain coal production in Germany, consideration shouldbe given to diverting any surplus supplies of potatoes to the Ruhr,The Foreign Secretary stressed the serious situation in South-East Asia and urged that any supplies of coarse grains which might become available in other countries should be diverted to that arearather than imported into the United Kingdom.(i) The Minister of Food said that he had been informed bjM. van Mook that 50,000 tons of copra could be obtained from theNetherlands East Indies provided that the necessary consumer goods,mainly cotton textiles, could be made available. He proposed to takethe matter up with the Board of Trade.The Foreign Secretary said that in the course of a recent visit to Manchester he had satisfied himself that cotton manufacturers would be ready to conform to any directions given by the government regarding the destinations to which textiles should be exported inorder to alleviate the world food crisis.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that for the present the following measures to]economise wheat should be introduced forthwith-(i) the 2-lb. loaf should be reduced to If lbs. No changein the price of the loaf should be made, and theeffect on the cost of living index should be offset by a decrease in the cost of other food-stuffs;(ii) beer production should be cut to 90 per cent, of thepre-war production in terms of standard barrel(iii) the serving of bread with main meals in restaurant&apos;should be prohibited.
(2) Agreed that a statement should be made on the following day describing the new measures which were being intro-duced, recalling the steps already taken in the UnitedKingdom to meet the world food shortage (e.g., the raising of the extraction rate to 85 per cent.) andshowing how the reduced standards of consumption corn-pared with the United Kingdom pre-war standards; and invited the Minister of Food to submit a draft of this statement to the Prime Minister for his approval.(3) Agreed that the United Kingdom representative on the Com-bined Food Board should be instructed to press for theallocation from the 200,000 tons of wheat made available by the diversion of supplies from the &quot;United Kingdom of(i) 10,000 tons to South Africa;(ii) 10,000 tons to Malaya and Hong Kong; and.(iii) an increase of more than 10,000 tons on the 50,000tons allocated to India,(4) Approved the proposal to make available to the BelgianGovernment surplus supplies of potatoes in the UnitedKingdom in place of exporting maize from the UnitedKingdom to Belgium against the supplies of starch whichwere to be manufactured for the United Kingdom in belgium: and invited the Minister of Food to considerwhether any remaining portion of the surplus of potatoescould not be exported to the British zone of Germany.(5) Took note that the Minister of Food would discuss with theBoard of Trade the proposal made by M. van Mook forthe supply of cotton textile goods to the netherlands east Indies in return for copra.3. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs (CP. (46) 157) and the Secretary ofState for the Colonies (CP. (46) 158) regarding the line to be takenin the forthcoming discussions with Field-Marshal Smuts on trustee-ship issues.On strategic and other grounds Field-Marshal Smuts had takenexception to the policy of the United Kingdom Government for placing their mandated territories in Africa under trusteeship. Wehad done what we could to dispel his misgivings and, though theSouth African Government had not informed us of their acquiescence in our views, they had agreed to our publishing our draft trusteeship agreements, provided that their formal consent was not implied.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs now recommendedthat, while Field-Marshal Smuts was in London, we should make every effort to secure his formal acceptance of our policy. We shouldtell him that we could not go back on our published decision; thatwe felt it impossible to alter the whole character of the draft termsof trusteeship which had been circulated to foreign Governments;and that we thought it important to proceed with the agreementsas soon as possible.The Secretary of State for the Colonies agreed with theseproposals.The Cabinet- &apos;(1) Agreed that Field-Marshal Smuts should be pressed toaccept our draft Trusteeship Agreements for Tan-ganyika, Togoland and the Cameroons.The Cabinet then discussed the attitude to be taken towardsField-Marshal Smuts&apos;s proposal that South-West Africa should begiven a status under which it would be internationally recognised asan integral part of the Union of South Africa.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs thought that therewas a good case for treating South-West Africa differently fromother mandated territories.   It was contiguous with the Union and
formed a convenient unit with it. Moreover, the European popula-tion desired incorporation in the Union, and Field-Marshal Smutshoped also to obtain definite proof of the assent of the native population.The Secretary of State therefore recommended that we should intimate our readiness to support the South African Governmentin principle in their proposed application to the United nations and that we should do what we could to secure the support of other dominion Governments for South Africa&apos;s policy or, at least, their agreement not to oppose it.The Secretary of State for the Colonies, on the other hand, feltthat this course w^ould be unwise.-- At the United Nations assembly the line taken by South Africa had been much criticised, the PrimeMinister of New Zealand being among the critics. There was alsoa considerable body of liberal opinion in this country which was opposed to the South African proposal. Moreover, if we supportedSouth Africa, it would be the more difficult to resist the Frenchdesire to incorporate their mandated territories and we might find that, apart from Belgian Ruanda-Urundi, ours would be the soleterritories in Africa under trusteeship. He suggested, therefore,that we should not do more than agree not to oppose the proposal which wras to be put forward by South Africa.In discussion it was urged that we should find it difficult toavoid taking a definite line in the discussions. The arguments were,however, nicely balanced. There was much force in those alreadyadduced against supporting the South African policy. Moreover,might it not set an undesirable precedent which would encourageother Powers to annex territory \ On the other hand, it was argued that the incorporation of South-West Africa in the Union would not amount to annexation. South Africa would have to argue and proveher case before the United Nations. There might, indeed, be advantage in public discussion of South Africa&apos;s native policy.Would it not be reasonable to support the incorporation of South-West Africa in the Union if the consent of the native as well asthe European inhabitants had been sought and obtained by methodsagreeable to the United Nations ?The Cabinet (2) Agreed that no final decision should be taken on this point for the present, but that Ministers should be guided intheir discussions with Field-Marshal Smuts by the views expressed in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion.4. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that the reportof the Anglo-American Committee on Palestine had been received.A brief summary of it was being circulated to the Cabinet (see cp. (46) 169). At a meeting of the Defence Committee earlier inthe day, preliminary consideration had been given to the recom-mendations made. It would be necessary for the Cabinet to reachearly decisions on these recommendations, as publication of thereport could not be long deferred. It had, therefore, been decidedto appoint a Committee of senior officials to examine the reportin detail, in association with the Chiefs of Staff or their representa-tives, to focus the issues and to submit recommendations to theCabinet with the least possible delay.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,2Ath April, 1946.Palestine.Report of anglo-american committee(previous reference:CM.
