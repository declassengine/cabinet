Persia. 1.   The Minister  of State said  that, since the  Cabinets(Previous        discussion on the 17th June, it had been strongly represented to theEeferenee:      Prime Minister of Persia that we held him responsible for protectingCM. (46) 59th   British lives and property in Persia.   This appeared to have madeConclusions,     some impression on the Prime Minister, who had now arranged for minute 1.)       a responsible officer of the central Government to be stationed in theneighbourhood of the oil-fields at Abadan, so that any complaintsby the workers might be made to him rather than to the Tudeh Party.Although that party had consolidated its position as the spokesmanof the workers in the oil-fields, there was increasing evidence thatthe local tribes were hostile to it.  In general, the situation in SouthPersia seemed to have eased to some extent during the past week.Council of 2.   The Minister of State gave the Cabinet an account of theForeign proceedings at the meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers inMinisters.        Paris.Second Pario The Council had agreed to complete by the 28th June their meeting. present discussions of the peace settlements for Italy and theex-enemy satellite States in Europe; and it should therefore be known during the course of the present week what prospects therewere of early agreement on these Treaties. Now that the council had decided to postpone further discussion of the disposal of theItalian colonies, the two main questions of difficulty were theexaction of reparations from Italy and the future of Trieste. Therewere some indications that the French Delegation might put forward the proposal that the port and city of Trieste should be placed under an international regime; and it seemed possible that the soviet delegation might now be ready to accept such a solution. it remained doubtful whether an Italian Government would sign aTreaty which included such a solution of the Trieste problem. TheSoviet claim to reparations from Italy had now been reduced to 10 million, but it still raised the question of principle whether anyreparations should be taken from current production. If this principle were conceded in respect of Italy, a similar claim mightbe advanced against Germany, where the effect of using current production for purposes of reparations would be much more serious.In discussion, the Secretary of State for the Colonies said that,if as a result of these discussions His Majesty&apos;s Governmentmodified their present policy and demanded any reparations from italy, the claims of Malta should not be overlooked. From a report which had recently been received it seemed likely that the cost ofrehabilitating Malta would exceed by about  10 million the substantial sum of  30 million which had already been paid orpromised for this purpose from the British Exchequer. If theprinciple of exacting reparations from Italy were accepted, it wouldbe equitable that Italy should make a -substantial contribution towards this expenditure in Malta.Palestine. 3.   The Cabinet were given the latest information about the(Previous situation in Palestine. Two of the five kidnapped officers had been reference: released from captivity, but there were as yet no indications that.M.(46)60th the other three would be released. The Prime Minister said that it conclusions, would probably be necessary for him to make some statement in the minute 3.)&apos; House of Commons on the following day about the Palestinesituation.The Cabinet were also informed of the progress of the consulta-tions between British and United States officials on the practical problems involved in transferring 100,000 Jews to Palestine andsettling them there. These consultations might be completed in thecourse of the present week. There was, however, no information about the date of arrival in this country of the main party of UnitedStates officials, who were to discuss the implications of the wholeof the recommendations made in the Report of the Anglo-american committee on Palestine.    It was  important that&quot; the  official[32264-7]b 2
conversations about the Report as a whole should begin withoutfurther delay; and that, meanwhile, the report of the currentconversations on the problem of absorbing 100,000 Jewish immi-grants into Palestine should be made in the form, not of a reportto the two Governments, but of a memorandum for the use of themain conference of officials which was to discuss the Report as awhole.The PHme Minister undertook to arrange for a message to besent to the United States Government urging that the delegation of american officials which was to discuss the Report as a whole should arrive in London with the least possible delay.Polish armed forces underBritishCommand.(previous reference erence:CM. (46) 54thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to a report of a speech made by General Anders in Palestine, in the course of whichhe was alleged to have said that he was still working for anindependent Poland, including Lvov and Vilna. Was it necessarythat General Anders should have been allowed to go to Palestine atthis time ? And could he not be prevented from continuing to make such statements, which were bound to give offence to the Govern-ments of Poland and the Soviet Union ?The Secretary of State for War undertook to make enquiries into this matter and to submit a report to the Prime Minister.UnitedSomalia.(previous reference:CM. (46) 24thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies (CP. (46) 243) commenting on atelegram from the Foreign Secretary (No. 233 of the 20th June)in which he reported that, in the discussions in Paris on the disposalof the Italian Colonies, he had withdrawn his proposal for a UnitedSomalia.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that, while he understood that it might be impossible to press the proposal thatthere should be a United Somalia under British administration, hewas anxious that the idea of a United Somalia should not be droppedaltogether at this stage. From the administrative point of view, itwould provide the most satisfactory solution of the problems of thearea and he hoped that nothing would be done now which wouldentirely rule out further discussion of the idea.There was general agreement that it would not be profitable to pursue the proposal that the whole area should be placed under british administration. This should not mean, however, that aproposal for creating a United Somalia under, say, internationaltrusteeship, might not be raised again later on.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs urged that before we were committed to support international trusteeship we should know more clearly what this implied who would appoint the administrator, to whom he would be responsible and what reports hewould render.The Chancellor of the Exchequer reminded the Cabinet thatthis was a deficit area and that, from the financial point of view,there would be advantages to us in a system under which othercountries would share the cost of administration.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of State to inform the foreign secretary that, while they recognised that there would bedisadvantage in pressing the suggestion of a UnitedSomalia under British administration, the Cabinet assumed that international discussion of the possibility of creating a United Somalia under some other form of administration was postponed and not abandoned and did not desire thematter to be so left that they were precluded from puttingthis possibility forward at some later stage.
Basic English. 6.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Foreign(Previous Secretary (CP. (46) 235) inviting the Cabinet to decide whetherEeference: His Majesty&apos;s Government should continue to give official supportW.M.(44)9th    to the encouragement of Basic English.Conclusions, The Coalition Government had decided in January 1944 to minute 5.) promote the use of Basic English as an auxiliary internationallanguage, not as a means of teaching English; and the primary responsibility for giving effect to this decision was subsequentlyplaced on the Foreign Office and the British Council. Since thennegotiations had been proceeding with Mr. C. K. Ogden, theinventor of the system; and a sum of  23,000 had recently been paid to him in settlement of claims arising out of those negotiations.Mr. Ogden had agreed to surrender his copyright to the Crownwithout further payment, if required to do so before the 30th June.In discussion, there was general agreement that this was aninvention of some potential value, which deserved a measure of official encouragement. In the main, however, Basic English wouldbe valuable, neither for learning ordinary English nor as a vehiclefor international exchanges on political or diplomatic matters, butas a medium of international communication in commerce and related activities. It was therefore inappropriate that the responsi-bility for promoting its use should rest with the Foreign office or the British Council.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that His Majesty&apos;s Government should continue toencourage by official means the use of Basic English;and that for this purpose Mr. Ogden should be requiredto assign to the Crown, subject to existing commitments,his copyright in the Basic English Standardised WordList and System;(2) Decided that the Foreign Office and the British council should be relieved of their existing responsibility for promoting the use of Basic English; and invited theLord President, in consultation with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, to determine by which Department this responsibility should in future be undertaken.coal production.Output,B,ecruitmentand Conditionsof Employ-ment in theCoalminingIndustry.7.   The Cabinet had before them (i) a memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Power(CP. (46) 232) seeking authority to announce at theannual delegate conference of the National Union of mineworkers on the 27th June that the Government had decided in principle that a five-day week should beintroduced in the coal-mining industry as soon aspracticable and that, from August Bank Holiday, 1946,wages should be paid in respect of statutory holidays;(ii) a memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Power(CP. (46) 244) covering a draft of the statement whichhe proposed to make to the conference;(iii) a memorandum by the Minister of Labour (CP. (46) 237)drawing attention to the risk that direct intervention by the Government in the coal-mining industry mightundermine the negotiating machinery in other indus-tries; and(iv) a memorandum by the Lord President (CP. (46) 242)stressing the seriousness of the outlook for coal produc-tion and proposing certain measures to increase thelabour force of the industry.
The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the proposals in cp. (46) 232 had been generally approved by the Lord presidents committee (L.P. (46) 22nd Meeting, Minute 2). In drafting thestatement annexed to CP. (46) 244 he had given effect to theCommittee&apos;s suggestion that the working out of the detailed scheme with the National Union of Mineworkers should be undertaken bythe National Coal Board and not by the Mining Association. Onreflection, however, he saw some objections to the Committee&apos;sfurther suggestion that on the day when he made his announcement to the Union the Lord President should make a correspondingannouncement in the House of Commons. The House might be critical if the announcement were made in the absence of the responsible Minister. And if the Government volunteered a state-ment on this subject, this might strengthen the impression of directintervention by the Government which other Ministers were anxiousto minimise.On the merits of the proposal, he recognised the importanceof ensuring that the introduction of the five-day week would not lead to a loss of output. The Reid Committee had favoured a five-day week, but they had also recommended an eight-hour day,which would require legislation and would not be acceptable tothe Union. He had therefore had to consider other means ofmaintaining output. With this in view he had stipulated that onlymen who worked the full five shifts in a week, or were prevented from doing so by a pit accident, should receive the bonus payment which would be made to prevent a reduction of the weekly wage;and this had been accepted by the Union. He also intended topress for the discontinuance of certain practices which restrictedoutput. Certain sections of the miners were in favour of bringing the five-day week into operation from the autumn of 1946, but he believed that the majority did not expect the new arrangement tobe in force before the 1st January, 1947, and the more responsibleleaders would be content if it were brought into force by may 1947. He had considered the suggestion made at theLord Presidents Committee that the five-day week should beapplied to surface workers in such a way as to give greaterinducement to men to work underground and to avoid stimulatingdemands for similar concessions from agricultural and transportworkers. He felt, however, that any proposal which would requirethe surface worker to work a six-day week or would give him fora five-day week a lower rate of pay than he earned at present would meet with strong objection from the Union. There could, of course,be no guarantee that the adoption of the five-day week and of payment for statutory holidays would increase output, but he believed that if the conditions which he proposed to attach to these concessions were accepted there need be no fall in output and no increase in costs. At the same time the concessions would bringimmediate benefits in improved recruitment and the creation ofa better atmosphere in the industry.The Lord President said that the Board of Trade feared theconsequences on output and costs of the adoption of these proposals.Any further loss of output would be disastrous to industry, andthe high cost of coal was already a heavy handicap to industry.The Lord Presidents Committee had agreed to recommendthat this announcement should be made on behalf of the Govern-ment; but it should be made plain to the National Union of Mine-workers that in future they must deal with the National coal board and that an end must be put to the practice of treating as political issues industrial questions affecting the coal-miningindustry.Other points in discussion were: (a) The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and TheMinister of Labour stressed the importance of minimising the extentto which the Government were directly intervening between thetwo sides of the industry. To this end it was suggested that thewords &quot; see no objection to &quot; should be substituted for the word
&apos;: favour &quot; in the fifth and sixth paragraphs of the draft statement -annexed to CP. (46) 244.(b) There was general agreement that the Government wouldbe exposed to serious criticism if these proposals were announced to the conference of the National Union of Mineworkers withouta simultaneous statement in Parliament. The best course wouldbe for the Minister of Fuel and Power to make a statement in theHouse of Commons, on the lines of the draft annexed to CP. (46)244, on the day before he announced the proposals to the NationalUnion of Mineworkers.(c) Several Ministers urged that, from the point of view bothof the wages position in other industries and of encouraging mento work underground, the benefits to be conferred by the five-day week on surface workers should be limited. In particular, it wassuggested that the application of the five-day week to such workers should be conditional on their agreeing to work an additional dayeach fortnight, should this be necessary, without claiming overtimerates of pay.(d) It was pointed out that the transport of coal both under-ground and on the surface had frequently been a limiting factoron output and that transport difficulties would be aggravated byconcentnating production into five days instead of six. If, there-fore, output was to be maintained, special attention would have tobe given to the working out of improved transport arrangements.(e) The task of explaining the new arrangements to the workers should not be left wholly to the National Union of Mineworkers.Much trouble had arisen through the failure of the miners&apos; repre-sentatives to explain the new wages rates in 1944.(/) The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he wished to insert in his statement a reference to the views of the Reid Com-mittee on the subject of the five-day working week.  This was agreed.(g) It was suggested that the working party under the chair-manship of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of fuel and Power, which was considering the employment of Poles inthe coal-mining industry, should be invited to examine also the suggestions made in CP. (46) 242 for meeting the immediate problem of increasing the labour force of the coal-mining industry.The Cabinet (1) Approved the introduction of a five-day week for the coal-mining industry, on the understanding that satisfactory arrangements would be worked out between the NationalUnion of Mineworkers and the National Coal board with a view to avoiding any reduction in the output ofcoal.(2) Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power to give furtherconsideration to the possibility of requiring surface workers to work a six-day week on occasions when thiswas necessary in order to maintain output.(3) Approved the proposal that the Mining Association andthe National Union of Mineworkers should enter into negotiations with a view to reaching agreement on pay-ment for statutory holidays in time for the first payment to be made for August Bank Holiday, 1946.(4) Agreed that the Minister of Fuel and Power should makea statement in the House of Commons on the 26th Juneon the lines of the draft annexed to CP. (46) 244, subjectto the amendments suggested at (a) and (/) above. &quot;(5) Agreed that the suggestions made in CP. (46) 242 for increasing the labour force of the coal-mining industry should be considered in the first instance by the working party on the employment of Poles in coal mines in theUnited Kingdom.
&quot;World food supplies.Long-termWheatContract with canada.(previous reference:CM. (46) 32ndConclusions.)Food exports from theArgentine.8. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, as a result ofthe negotiations in Ottawa in which the Minister of Food had recently taken part, agreement had now been reached on the termsof a long-term contract for the supply of wheat from Canada tothe United Kingdom and, so far as concerned the Governmentsof Canada and the United Kingdom, the Minister of Food wouldbe able to sign this contract before returning to this country. TheMinister had learned, however, that the United States authorities were apprehensive about the effect which the announcement of sucha contract might have on the discussions in the House of Repre-sentatives about the proposed Loan to the United Kingdom. during a visit to Washington the Minister had taken the opportunity of discussing the matter with Mr. Clayton of the State Department,who had expressed the view that if this contract were challengedin the discussions on the Loan he would not feel able to defend it.In all the circumstances the Minister suggested that, subject tothe views of the Cabinet, he should seek to persuade the canadian government to postpone the signature and announcement of the contract until the Congress discussions on the Loan were finallycompleted. This might involve delaying the conclusion of the con-tract for three weeks.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to inform theMinister of Food that, in the circumstances described in his telegrams, he should ask the Canadian Govern-ment to agree to postpone the signature and announce-ment of this long-term wheat contract until the Congressproceedings on the Loan to the United Kingdom hadbeen completed.In further discussion reference was made to the importance of stimulating exports of cereals and oilseeds from the Argentine.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Minister of Food, in consultation with theForeign Office, to arrange for a report to be submittedto the Cabinet on recent exports of cereals and oilseedsfrom the Argentine and on the steps which had beentaken or could be taken to stimulate exports in thefuture.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,24th June, 1946.
