1. The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the businessa which it was proposed to take in the House of Commons in theof    following week.On the 15th April, on the A rmy Estimates, there would be a debate on future conditions of service in the Army.On the 16th April, on the Air Estimates, the House would discuss the period of service in the Royal Air Force.The Report Stage of the Budget Resolutions would be taken,with other business, on the 17th April.On the 18th April the House would meet at 11 am. and after questions there would be a debate on the Easter Adjournment.In discussion, the Lord President said that the Second reading of the National Health Service Bill would be taken immediatelyafter the Easter Recess. The Report Stage and Third Reading ofthe Coal Industry Nationalisation Bill would be taken soon after easter, so that the preceedings in the House of Lords might beginwithout delay. It was also hoped that an opportunity would befound, soon after the Easter Recess, to take the Second Reading ofthe Hill Farming Bill.2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president (CP.- (46) 143) embodying the Report of a Committeeappointed by the Prime Minister to draw up a list of the majorBills which would form the main element in the GovernmentsLegislative Programme for the 1946-47 Session.The Lord President explained that the Committee&apos;s object hadbeen to select the major Bills for next Session on which preparatory work could be started early in the year. If their Report were nowapproved by the Cabinet, it should be possible to ensure that anumber of major Bills were ready for introduction at the openingof the next Session. The Government would then be able to make good use of the Parliamentary time available for legislation betweenNovember and Easter. Provisional approval of the Committee&apos;slist of major Bills would not prejudice the final content of TheKing&apos;s Speech or the construction, later in the year, of a completelegislative programme for the Session.The Lord President added that, from a preliminary study whichhe had made with the Chief Whip, it seemed that the passage ofthe legislation included in the Committee&apos;s list of major measures would occupy the greater part of the time which Parliament coulddevote to legislation in the coming Session. The current session would be abnormally long, and its extension into the autumn wouldhave the result that the 1946-47 Session would be unusually short.He recommended, however, that the Cabinet should adopt theCommittee&apos;s list and invite the Legislation Committee to keep theposition under review as work proceeded on the preparation of the bills included in that list.The PHme Minister thanked the Committee for the work whichthey had done in formulating an outline of next Session&apos;s pro-gramme of legislation. Their Report was a useful piece of forward planning, which would be of great help to the Government in makingthe best use of the Parliamentary time available for legislation.Points in discussion were : (a) The Minister of Labour asked that it should be borne inmind that it might be necessary to pass in the 1946-47 Sessionlegislation on the subject of military service.(b) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that an EmpireTelecommunications Bill would be required in the 1946-47 Session.The Cable and Wireless Bill which was being introduced in the.present Session was only the first instalment of the legislation required on this subject. The second instalment should be included among the major measures for the 1946-47 Session.1844-4] &quot; b 2
The Cabinet-(1) Agreed in principle that, subject to the addition of an empire Telecommunications Bill, the Bills suggested inparagraph 3 of CP. (46) 143 should form the mainelement in the Governments Legislative Programme forearlier part of the 1946-47 Session.(2) Agreed that during the next six months the preparation ofthese Bills should be a first charge on the time at thedisposal of Parliamentary Counsel after meeting thedemands of the current Session&apos;s legislation.(3) Invited the Legislation Committee to superintend thepreparation of these major Bills for the 1946-47 Session.Parliamentary 3.

The Foreign Secretary said that he had been considering whether the Delegation which was to negotiate the revision of theAnglo-Egyptian Treaty should indicate at the outset of the negotia-tions that His Majesty&apos;s Government were willing to withdrawBritish troops from Egypt. He had come to the conclusion that itwould be expedient, as a matter of tactics, to make this offer at the outset. He had asked the Chiefs of Staff to consider the military implications, and he would not settle the final form of the instruc-tions to the Delegation until he had received their comments. Mean-whileCabinet.he would be glad to have the views of his colleagues in theAfter a short discussion the Cabinet (1) Agreed that, subject to the views of the Chiefs of Staff, itwould be expedient, as a matter of tactics, if any offer byHis Majesty&apos;s Government to withdraw British troops from Egypt were made at the outset of the negotiationsfor the revision of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty;(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs toinform the Governments of the Dominions in due courseof the instructions given to the British Delegation on thispoint.Wages Policy.(previous reference:CM. (46) 24thConclusions,Minute 6.)5.   The Cabinet had before them-(i)memorandum by the Lord President (CP. (46) 130)covering a report by an official working party on wages policy; and(ii) a memorandum by the Foreign Secretary (CP. (46) 148)commenting on the proposals made in CP. (46) 130.The Lord President said that his memorandum summarised theviews expressed by the Lord Presidents Committee when they had considered the report of the official working party (LP. (46)11th Conclusions, Minute 3). There were wide differences ofopinion on the subject of wages policy, ranging from the view thatthe Government should assume direct responsibility for controllingwage levels to the view that all questions of wages should be entirelyleft to be settled between the employers and the workers themselves.
265CM. 33 (46).Account must, however, be taken of new factors such as the socialisa-tion of various industries, the responsibility assumed by the Govern-ment for price-fixing in such industries as agriculture, and the full-employment policy; and it did not follow that the existing machineryfor wage-fixing would be adequate in the future.The Lord Presidents Committee had endorsed the main recom-mendation of the working party that, while the establishedmachinery for voluntary negotiation of wages should continue, aNational Industrial Conference should be set up for the purpose ofacting as a channel of information between the Government and both sides of industry. This new body would not deal with wages in particular industries, but it was hoped that it would carry out a process of education in the basic facts of the current economicsituation, which would indirectly influence wages negotiations inparticular industries so as to ensure that the results did not run counter to the general economic policy of the Government. Thus, itmight be brought home to employers in undermanned industriesthat it was their duty to seek ways of improving conditions of workwhile, on the other hand, Trade Unions in fully-manned industriesmight be encouraged to exercise restraint in pressing for wage increases. The Minister of Labour would be the Minister primarily concerned with the proposed new body, but it seemed desirable that,in view of its concern with general economic questions, theChancellor of the Exchequer, the President of the Board of Tradeand he himself should from time to time attend its meetings. Withreference to the doubts expressed by the Foreign Secretary and theMinister of Labour about the inclusion of the Federation of BritishIndustries in the proposed Conference, the Cabinet should bear inmind that the Conference Avould not be primarily concerned with questions of wage levels but rather with the background of general economic policy. The working party had suggested that the basisof discussion with the National Industrial Conference should be theproposed White Paper on the Economic Plan which the steering committee on Economic Development had had under consideration.He now understood, however, that the Steering Committee had cometo the conclusion that it would be unwise to publish a White paper of this kind before the beginning of 1947. This, however, need not preclude the Government from giving such information as they thought fit to the Conference on a confidential basis.S The Minister of Labour said that, while he agreed that steps should be taken to disseminate general information on economicplans and policies, he hoped that nothing would be done to under-mine the well-established machinery for the voluntary negotiation of wages by organisations of employers and workers. His joint consultative Committee and its parent body, the National joint advisory Council, had proved a valuable channel for the communi-cation of Government views to industry; and he suggested that thefirst step towards setting up the proposed National Industrial Con-ference should be to call together the National Joint AdvisoryCouncil. He was convinced that the inclusion of the Federation ofBritish Industries, which was largely an association of individual firms and was concerned with commerce rather than with produc-tion, would alienate the British Employers&apos; Confederation. He had considered how the Co-operative Movement should be represented on the Conference, and had reached the conclusion that the right course was to encourage them to become affiliated to the british employers&apos; Confederation.The Foreign Secretary said that he was opposed to the estab-lishment of any central authority to discuss problems of wages andconditions of work. This should, in his view, be left entirely to the recognised organisations of employers and workers. Any assump-tion of responsibility for questions of wages by a central body ofthis kind with Government representation would seriously under-mine the authority of the employers&apos; organisations and of theUnions. It might also lead the two sides of industry to jointogether in applying pressure to the Government to meet the cost[31844-4] B 3
of wage increases. Experience during the war had shown that even the existence of provisions for compulsory arbitration hadweakened the sense of responsibility of workers&apos; and employers&apos;organisations. Though he did not dissent from the view that more information should be given to industry about the economic back-ground, it was essential that any new body set up for this purpose should not be regarded as one on which the employers and workers would sit on different sides, but rather as a continuation of theJoint Consultative Committee.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while he recognised the dangers of creating a central wage-fixing body, he favoured theproposal to establish a National Industrial Conference for thepurpose of educating both sides of industry in the general economicbackground and he would welcome opportunities of discussing withany body of this kind such matters as the risk of inflation andfuture taxation policy. Though it was not clear how this should bedone, some way must be found of giving representation on this body to the workers in socialised industries and to the public Boards setup to run these industries.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he doubted whetherthe existing methods of determining wages by piece-meal negotia-tions in individual industries would work satisfactorily in con-ditions of full employment now that the discipline imposed by war conditions had been removed. The Government had decidedto continue the policy of paying subsidies to stabilise the cost ofliving and the natural corollary to this was a co-ordinated wages policy. He did not suggest that the State should fix wages, but itwould be found in practice that the State could not avoid come degree of intervention, as had been demonstrated already in coal-mining and agriculture. Moreover, it was impossible for theGovernment to shirk discussion of general wages policy with therepresentatives of workers and employers with a view to working-out with them general principles wdiich wrould be consistent withthe pursuit of a policy of full employment.The Minister of Health pointed out that the Government had recently been approached1 by the General Council of the TradesUnion Congress on the question of hours of work, which was closelyallied to the question of wages. It seemed to him impossible toavoid some general discussion of wages policy with centralorganisations of workers and employers. In fact, in a number ofindustries and services the existing machinery for joint voluntarynegotiation of wages did not work satisfactorily and the Govern-ment were constantly being compelled to intervene after the harmhad been done. It was the Governments duty to provide full employment not by a policy of public works but by securing a properbalance between the various industries, and an essential element in achieving this was the adjustment of wages. A further point was that there was bound to be interaction between wages policyin socialised industries and in those left to private enterprise. Forall these reasons, he was convinced that a National industrial conference on the lines proposed should be established with government representation which should not be confined to theMinister of Labour.In further discussion, there was general support for the viewthat some organisation on the lines of the proposed national industrial Conference should be established.The Prime Minister said that it was clear that it would beimpossible for the State to assume complete responsibility for wage-fixing. On the other hand, in the new conditions created by the pursuit of a full employment policy and the socialisation ofimportant industries, the Government could not leave the matterentirely to the organisations of workers and employers, particularlyin view of the danger of pressure for wage increases from workersin the sheltered trades. Before a final decision was taken to setup a National Industrial Conference, it seemed desirable that the
Cabinet should have before them a further note showing how theymight meet the difficulties which had been mentioned in thediscussion, including in particular the question of the fixing of wage levels in socialised industries.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord President, in consultation with theMinister of Labour, to revise the proposals made in cp. (46) 130 for the constitution of a National industrial conference in the light of the points which had been raised in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion.agricultural wages.(previous reference:CM. (46) 13thConclusions,Minute 9.)6. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Labour (CP. (46) 145) and by the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries (O.P. (46) 146) on the subject of agricultural wages.The Minister&apos; of Labour recalled that on the 7th February theCabinet had authorised him to invite both sides of the industryto discuss with him a system of graded wage rates. Meetings hadbeen held on the 22nd February and the 2nd April, and in the end the Workers&apos; Unions had accepted the principle of graded wage rates as a matter of long-term policy. They did not, however,regard this as a solution of the immediate problem, and they were reluctant to renew their application for an increase in the minimum wage unless they could see some prospect of a change in the attitudeof the Central Wages Board. On the other hand, the national farmers&apos; Union would assume no responsibility for any increase inthe minimum wage without some assurance of prices. To break the deadlock he proposed that he should call the two sides of theindustry together to resume discussion of the joint statement whichhad been agreed on at the meeting on the 2nd April and, in thecourse of the discussions, should inform the National Farmers&apos; Unionthat, if the Wages Board decided to increase the minimum wage,the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries would be willing to givea decision on prices with the utmost possible speed and to make suchadjustment in prices as was reasonable. A statement of this kind would enable further progress to be made, and he had good hopethat if an increase of 5s. in the minimum wage were awarded thiswould be accepted as satisfactory and would enable him to get agree-ment to the stabilisation of wages in the agricultural industry.The Minister of A griculture and Fisheries said that to give the assurances suggested by the Minister of Labour to the national farmers&apos; Union would undermine the authority of the CentralWages Board. The Government should avoid giving any guarantee of an automatic revision of prices to compensate for wage increases,and he felt that the proper course was to indicate in reply to anarranged Parliamentary Question that it would be appropriate forthe Central Wages Board, in considering any further applicationfor an increase in the minimum wage, to have regard to the presentfood outlook and the continuing need to increase food production athome.In discussion it was pointed out that if either the suggestion made by the Minister of Labour or that made by the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries were adopted the Government would infact be guaranteeing that if the minimum wage was raised therewould be a readjustment of prices. This would be directly contraryto the decision taken by the Cabinet at their meeting on the31st January (CM. (46) 10th Conclusions, Minute 6). Any price increases would inevitably lead to a further increase in the alreadyhigh expenditure on the subsidies stabilising the cost of living, andto a large extent would go to swell the profits of the reasonablyefficient producers who could easily afford to pay higher wageswithout any price adjustment.In these circumstances, it w7as worth considering, beforeagreeing to any price increase, whether the problem could not be
solved by some form of subsidy to the marginal producer, thoughit had not hitherto been possible to evolve a satisfactory scheme forthis. So far as concerned the workers, large numbers were alreadyreceiving more than the minimum wage, and if an increase of 5s.were given in the minimum wage many of these would demand and receive corresponding increases in order to maintain the wagedifferentials. Moreover, workers in other rural industries wouldalso claim wage increases.In all the circumstances it seemed desirable that, for the present,the Government should take no action to suggest to either sideof the industry or to the independent members of the Central wages board that an increase in the minimum wage would be followed byany increase in agricultural prices, but that the Workers&apos; Unionsshould be left to submit a renewed application for an increase inthe minimum wage to the Board on the 23rd April. If in the event the Board granted an increase in the minimum wage, the Govern-ment would then have to consider what part, if any, of this increase should be met by a revision of the existing prices. Meanwhile, no publicity should be given to the fact that many agricultural workers were receiving more than the minimum wage.The Cabinet Agreed, that the Minister of Labour should inform theWorkers&apos; Unions that if they wished to pursue their claim for an increase in the minimum wage they should reneAvtheir application to the Central Wages Board, and that no indication should be given to any of the parties concerned that the GoA^ernment Avere Avilling to consider an increasein agricultural prices to compensate for any increase inAvages that might be awarded!Channel 7.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeIslands. Secretary (CP. (46) 135) recommending the appointment of a Corn-Constitutional mittee of the Privy Council to examine proposals for. constitutionalEeform. reform which had been submitted by the States of Jersey andGuernsey.The Home Secretary said that there Avas evidence of a wide-spread desire among the islanders for a reform of the local con-institutions Avhich would bring them more into line with modernideas and practice. The States had now submitted specific proposalsfor reform which were outlined in his memorandum; and the lieutenant-Governors of both Islands had recommended that theseproposals should be examined by a Committee of the Privy CouncilAvhich would visit the Islands and take evidence, not only fromthe States, but also from various minority groups and from membersof the public Avho wished to express their views.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that a Committee of the Privy Council should beappointed to examine the proposals for constitutional reform which had been submitted by the States of Jerseyand Guernsey;(2) Invited the Home Secretary to consult with the lord president regarding the composition and terms ofreference of the Committee.India.constitutional position.(previous reference erence:CM. (46)28thConclusions,Minute 2.)8. The Prime Minister read to the Cabinet a telegram(Index No. 14) from the Cabinet Mission to India asking for guidance in their forthcoming negotiations with Congress and the muslim League on the Pakistan issue.The telegram recalled that, under their instructions from theCabinet, the &quot;Mission were required to see that any scheme Avhichthey accepted made adequate provision for the defence of Indiaand the adjoining areas. It seemed to the Mission that there were two possible bases of agreement :  (i) a unitary India with a loose
Federation at the centre charged primarily with control of defence and foreign affairs; and (ii) a divided India, in which the two parts would have a treaty of alliance, both offensive and defensive,but nothing in the form of an actual executive centre. The Missionrecognised that, under the second alternative, arrangements for defence could not be very effective. Pakistan would itself be weak and would be strengthened only in so far as it could rely upon itstreaty with Hindustan : there would be no common control offoreign policy, and common action might therefore become difficultor impossible. On the other hand, unless agreement in India couldbe secured, no scheme of defence would be of any value; and theMission considered that the first step towards any effective arrange-ments for defence must be to secure some form of agreement betweenthe two main Parties in India. While, therefore, they would prefer to secure an arrangement on the lines of their first alternative, theysought authority to work for an agreement on the basis of the second alternative if that seemed to afford the only chance of an agreed settlement.Discussion showed that the Cabinet endorsed the views outlined in the telegram from the Cabinet Mission. Although the second alternative would produce a weak defensive position, it would be preferable to secure agreement on this basis than to fail to reach any agreement at all.The Prime Minister said that he proposed to invite the viewsof the Chiefs of Staff before replying to this telegram.The Cabinet Invited the Prime Minister, subject to the views of theChiefs of Staff, to authorise the Cabinet Mission in Indiato seek agreement on the basis of the second alternative setout in their telegram Index No. 14, if they were satisfiedthat there was no other basis on which an agreed settle-ment could be reached.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,Uth April, 1946.
