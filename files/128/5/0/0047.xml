India.constitutional position.(previous reference:CM. (46) 46thConclusions.)The Prime Minister said that after consultation with the LordChancellor, the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and theParliamentary Under-Secretary of State for India, he had sent tothe Cabinet Mission a telegram (Cabin No. 14) asking that anumber of verbal amendments should be made in the draft of their proposed statement, in order to meet the views expressed in theCabinet&apos;s discussion on the 14th May. He had that morningreceived a reply from the Cabinet Mission (subsequently circulated as I.Q. 2) reporting that they had considered his telegram with thegreatest care, in consultation with the Viceroy, but were all strongly of the opinion that it would be inexpedient to incorporate in thestatement some of the amendments which had been suggested. they accepted the suggested addition to paragraph 2 of the draft state-ment, which was designed to make it clear that the statement wasmade with the full approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom. They also accepted the verbal amendments inparagraphs 3 and 17, which were intended to avoid the implication that the Cabinet Mission could themselves bring into being theconstituent assembly and the interim Government. They also accepted the amendments to paragraphs 14 and 23, which had beensuggested in order to meet the Cabinets views about the use of theword &apos;&apos; independence &apos;&apos; in the statement.Two minor changes, in paragraphs 19 (I) and 19 (V), had beensuggested with a view to making the meaning of these passages moreexplicit; but the Cabinet Mission had asked leave not to adoptthese, as they were anxious for practical reasons to avoid making any changes in the text which were not essential.There remained the changes of substance which had beensuggested to meet the views expressed in the Cabinets discussion on (i) the proposed treaty between the United Kingdom Governmentand the new Government of India (paragraph 22 of the draft state-ment); and (ii) the question whether an independent India would,or would not, elect to remain within the British Commonwealth and,in particular, the wording of the final paragraph of the draft state-ment. The Cabinet Mission were reluctant to make the changessuggested under either of these two heads. As regards the referenceto the treaty, they represented that specific reference to defence interests would increase the suspicion that we intended to keepBritish troops in India against the will of the Indian people. Boththe Viceroy and the Commander-in-Chief felt that it would be inexpedient to refer specifically at this stage to defence arrange-ments. As regards the second group of amendments, the cabinet mission felt that if the term &quot;independence&quot; were qualifiedthroughout the statement by the addition of the words &quot; whetherinside or outside the British Commonwealth,&quot; the effect would be to arouse suspicions of our intentions and to assist the more extremeelements in the Congress Party, who would in any event work forthe rejection of these proposals. The Mission felt that the passagesat the beginning and the end of the draft statement made itsufficiently clear that the new India could preserve her independenceeither inside or outside the Commonwealth. And they consideredthat the changes proposed in the final paragraph of the statement,far from making it more acceptable, would provide ammunition for the extremist elements in India.In general, the Mission believed, in the light of their study ofthe political situation in India, that the inclusion in their statementof the amendments to which they had raised these objections would tdestroy any chance of their proposals being accepted; and they feltthis so strongly that they were not prepared to accept the responsi-bility of issuing the statement if it had to incorporate all these amendments. The Viceroy felt that such a statement would prejn-dice, not only the prospect of securing acceptance of the proposals,but also his ability to form an interim Government.The Prime Minister said that in these circumstances he did not feel disposed to press the Cabinet Mission to accept those amend-ments to which they had raised objection.
Discussion showed that the Cabinet were agreed that on these points it would be right to rely on the judgment of the experiencedMinisters forming the Cabinet Mission, who had given long andanxious thought to their proposals and were in the best position to judge how they should be presented to the Indian people If, after considering the views which had been put to them on the Cabinetsbehalf, they still felt so strongly that on these points the statement should stand as originally drafted, it would be inexpedient for theCabinet to press them to modify their attitude. It would, however,be right to remind them of the criticisms which were likely to be expressed in this country on these points.The Prime Minister said that he had now received fromthe Cabinet Mission a draft for the oral announcement which was tobe made in Parliament. Meanwhile, however, he had consulted theOpposition leaders, who had asked that he should read out in theHouse of Commons the full text of the statement which was being issued in India. They had also asked that the announcement shouldbe made on a Motion for the Adjournment, so as to give some furtherscope for comment, though they had assured him that they would do their best to avoid a lengthy debate. The Prime Minister saidthat he proposed to meet the views of the Opposition on both these points.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that in all the circumstances it would be inexpedient to press the Cabinet Mission to incorporate in the state-ment which they were issuing on the following day thoseof the amendments suggested on the Cabinets behalf towhich they took strong objection.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister, in so informing theCabinet Mission, would point out that ambiguities in thestatement would be noted immediately and would have tobe resolved; and that the very tepid reference to thedesirability of India&apos;s remaining in the British Common-wealth would expose the United Kingdom Governmentto heavy attack by their critics.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would make an announce-ment in the House of Commons on the 16th Mayembodying the full text of the statement to be issued inIndia; and that this announcement would be made on a motion for the Adjournment.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,15th May, 1946.
