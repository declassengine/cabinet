Mr. Fraser. 1.   The Prime Minister expressed the Cabinefs pleasure atbeing able to welcome Mr. Fraser on his return to this country.Mr. Fraser thanked the Prime Minister and said that he was glad to have this opportunity of meeting members of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in Cabinet.Chiefs of Staff. The Prime Minister said that he would like to take this opportunity to convey to the Chiefs of Staff the congratulations ofthe Cabinet on the distinctions which had been conferred on themby His Majesty.He also extended a welcome to Sir Arthur Tedder on his firstattendance at Cabinet after his appointment as Chief of the AirStaff.2. The Prime Minister welcomed Field-Marshal Montgomeryto the Cabinet and congratulated him, on the Cabinefs behalf, onthe Viscounty conferred on him by His Majesty. He invited theField-Marshal to give the Cabinet an appreciation of the generalsituation in Germany.Field-Marshal Montgomery said that he would classify theproblems confronting the Control Commission in Germany under two heads the material problems and the human problems. Onthe material side, they faced the risks of widespread starvation anddisease. The existing food ration provided an average daily intake of 1,500 calories per head over the German population as a whole;and this represented the bare minimum required to prevent the spread of starvation and disease. This ration could be honouredif the Control Commission continued to receive the imports of wheat for which they had asked. If wheat imports into the British Zoneceased, the average calorie intake would drop to about 900 a day,which would be the equivalent of one-third of the present level of nutrition of the population in the United Kingdom. This wouldinvolve not only starvation, but disease. Arrangements for handlingepidemics in Germany had now been completed. If, however, aserious epidemic occurred, these arrangements would not preventthe spread of disease to this country. Measures for reducing thatrisk were now under consideration. His conclusion was that weshould win the Battle of the Winter in Germany, provided that imports of wheat into the British Zone were maintained.The human factor had not yet given rise to special difficulty.The 23 million Germans in the British Zone had hitherto beendocile. But we must expect to have some trouble with them before long. In the first place, during the coming year they would begin to see the effects of reparations policy on German industry andwould realise that they would derive little benefit from the recovery of the German economy. Secondly, our economic policy in germany would give rise to widespread unemployment. Thirdly, there were dispersed within our Zone about 3 million former members of theGerman Armed Forces. Fourthly, we had removed from office alarge number of competent Nazis., who now had no useful work todo and would have opportunities for stirring up trouble. this analysis led to two conclusions. First, we must not reduce too far the strength of the British occupational troops in Germany.Secondly, we should avoid undue haste in developing Trades unions and political parties in Germany; the seeds of a healthy develop-ment^had been sown, but it was desirable that they should be allowedto grow naturally and to produce the right type of leaders.The first phase of our occupational duties in Germany was nowover. We were now re-grouping for the next phase. Four maintasks lay ahead.First, the internal organisation of the Control Commissionneeded modification. At present, it was organised in fourteendivisions. This resulted in some lack of co-ordination and the headsof divisions had insufficient time for constructive thinking.   The[31201-2] b 2Germany.Ueview ofSituationin british zone.
Commission was now being re-grouped into a smaller number of sub-Commissions, each under the control of a man who would have more time to travel round the country and to think about his adminis-trative problems.Secondly, military Government must now give way to civil government, in preparation for eventual Government by Germansunder Allied supervision. The next stage of this development wasthe appointment of civilian Regional Commissioners who wouldtake over the powers now exercised by senior military officers. the target date for this was 1st April.Thirdly, it was necessary to produce a change of heart amongthe German people. This must be done through the young people.Arrangements had already been made, with the assistance of theFederation of Boys&apos; Clubs, to send out a team of 25 experts on. youthorganisation to develop work among boys and girls throughout theBritish Zone in Germany.Fourthly, there was need for inter-Allied agreement on theproper level of Germany&apos;s peace-time industry. At the momenttoo much emphasis was laid on the amount to be extracted fromGermany in reparations. A more sensible approach would be toagree on an outline plan for the size and shape of German industryfive years hence : when once that plan was settled, everything super-fluous to it could be removed as reparations.The following were among the main points raised in discussionof Field-Marshal Montgomery&apos;s statement: (a) It was reported that food was more plentiful in the rural areas in Germany. Could more be done to secure that food was brought from the country districts into the towns or, alternatively,that young people were moved from the towns into the countryareas where they would get more to eat ?Field-Marshal Montgomery said that Germans in the country districts certainly lived much better than those in the towns; andhe had found it necessary to control movement into the country districts in order to prevent their becoming overpopulated. Morefood could be brought into the towns if more transport were avail-able. Insufficient transport was one of the greatest obstacles to continue recovery. The main causes were the shortage, and badrepair, of rolling-stock and the lack of petrol. Larger numbers ofGerman vehicles could be brought into use if it were possible to reopen even one of the synthetic oil plants in Germany. Hitherto,this had been precluded by inter-Allied policy for the destruction ofGermany&apos;s war potential. He understood, however, that theRussians had recently reopened one synthetic oil plant in their Zone,as a temporary measure; and he wondered whether the same coursecould not be taken in the British Zone.Similar considerations arose in connection with the closing of ammonia plants. Next year&apos;s harvest in Germany was likely to be small because of the acute shortage of fertilisers; and more fertiliserscould be produced if one or two ammonia plants could be reopened.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that amemorandum was now being submitted to the Allied control council in Berlin proposing that, notwithstanding the long-term policy for the destruction of Germany&apos;s war potential, a limited number of ammonia plants and synthetic oil plants might bereopened, as a temporary measure and under strict Allied control,to relieve the short-term shortage of petrol and fertilisers. there opening of these plants would reduce the amount of German coalavailable for export; but this loss should be only temporary, forincreased food and transport would, in the long run, have the effectof increasing the level of German coal production.(b) Field-Marshal Montgomery had referred to the difficultyof securing agreement on an economic plan for the future of german industry. If inter-Allied agreement could not be reached on thisquestion, would it be possible to frame such a plan for the british zone only?
Field-Marshal Montgomery said that there would be nodifficulty in making such a plan. Unilateral action of this kind would, however, be inconsistent with the existing policy of administering Germany by quadripartite agreement between thefour occupying Powers.(c) Field-Marshal Montgomery said that he did not find amongthe German people any sense of shame for the atrocities of the nazi regime. The average German did not regard himself as having any responsibility for them, but considered them the work solely of the nazis. It was essential to bring about a more complete change ofheart among the German people. But it was difficult to make muchimpression on adults. It was the more important, therefore, toensure that the education of the children was on the right lines.Here good progress was now being made. Satisfactory books and teachers were now generally available. The most likely source of danger lay in the universities. Six had been reopened, each accom-accommodating some 4,000 students, a high proportion of whom wereex-members of the German Armed Forces. There was a risk of a revival of nationalist feeling of an undesirable kind in theseuniversities; and special measures had been taken (to keep the students under observation.id) Field-Marshal Montgomery thought it was desirable toencourage sport among German youth. He had now givenpermission for our Armed Forces to play football matches against german boys&apos; clubs.The Minister of State said that the sports organisations inGermany had done very good work after the last war, but had latercome under. Nazi influence. He offered to put Field-MarshalMontgomery in touch with some of the former leaders of Germansports organisations who were now in this country.(e) Field-Marshal Montgomery said that there might be furthertrouble over displaced persons. Their camps were comfortable, andtoo many of them were refusing either to return to their own country or to work. He was inclined to favour a policy by which everydisplaced person would be required to declare by the 1st April, 1946,whether he was willing to return to his own country. Those whowere not willing to return to their homes should then be requiredto go elsewhere, to the extent that other countries could be persuaded to receive them. Thereafter only those should be maintained inGermany who were willing to work.(/) Reference had been made to the need for seeing that theGerman people got the right type of leaders. Was enough being done to secure the return to Germany of suitable Germans now inthis country?The Cabinet were informed that hitherto it had not been thought advisable to force upon the German people selected leaderswho had been refugees in this country. But a certain number ofthese people were now going back, and there was regular machineryfor ensuring that applications for permission to return wereproperly scrutinised by the Control Commission and by the ControlOffice for Germany and Austria.(g) The visit of the British Trades Union Delegation toGermany had been useful. Their report on their visit had indicated that they were well satisfied with British administration inGermany.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that he would circulate this report to the Cabinet. It was suggested that the reportmight also be made public, possibly in the form of a White Paper.(h) The Foreign Secretary said it would be very helpful ifField-Marshal Montgomery had a confidential talk with editors andother representatives of the Press, in which he could speak franklyof the present situation in Germany and explain the difficulties[31201-2]b 3
confronting the British administration there. The Foreign Officev/ould be ready, in consultation with the Control Office for Germanyand Austria, to make the arrangements for such a Conference.This suggestion was approved.(i) The German people had made good progress in repairingbomb damage so as to provide themselves with weather-proofaccommodation. The suggestion was made that Nazis who hadbeen removed from office might be employed in this repair work : itwould be more satisfactory that they should be given useful work todo than that they should be left in idleness to become a potentialsource of future trouble.(j) Mr. Fraser said that, from the information available in new Zealand, he and his colleagues in the New Zealand Governmenthad formed the impression that the British Zone in Germany wasbeing administered with greater efficiency and understanding thanthe other three Zones. This impression was confirmed by all thathe had heard in the course of the present discussion.The Prime Minister thanked Field-Marshal Montgomery, onbehalf of the Cabinet, for the comprehensive statement which hehad made on the present situation in Germany. The information which he had given had been of very great interest and assistanceto the Cabinet..TheEntrances tothe Baltic.SuggestedInternationalControl.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum on thissubject by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP. (45) 352).The Foreign Secretary said that M. Molotov and M. Stalin had raised with him at Moscow the question of the control of theentrances to the Baltic. He had not been in a position to discuss thequestion fully, but had told M. Molotov that, according to his information, control was at present in the hands of the riparianStates, as it had been for many years, that they provided any services required, and that both merchant vessels and warships of all States,whether neutral or belligerent, had been able to pass freely in and out, both in peace and in war.In subsequent conversation M. Stalin had expressed doubt whether Russian shipping was in fact entitled to free passage. Hehad seemed to be trying to discover what the British reactions wouldbe to a proposal that a Russian base should be established in this area. When, however, the Foreign Secretary had said that HisMajesty&apos;s Government would oppose such an idea, M. Stalin had said that he was not referring to bases at all.In view of probable future developments in regard to the bosphorus, the Foreign Secretary thought it very desirable to giveinternational recognition as soon as possible to the principle of free passage through the entrances to the Baltic. For this purpose hehad in mind declarations by the Governments of the UnitedKingdom, the United States and Russia, and he sought approval to explore this suggestion with Mr. Byrnes during his forthcoming-visit to London and subsequently with the Russians.The First Sea Lord said that the Chiefs of Staff were inagreement with this proposal. The riparian States couldthemselves offer no threat to Russia, Germany was. under controland a threat could therefore come only from the United Kingdom.The Chiefs of Staff thought that the proposed declaration would be useful.After discussion, the Cabinet &apos;(1) Approved the line taken by the Foreign Secretary in his conversations on this subject in Moscow.(2) Authorised him to approach the United States Governmenton the lines proposed in CP. (45) 352.
17CM. 2 (46) .mDisposal 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theof German Minister of War Transport (CP. (45) 350) covering the report ofMerchant the Tripartite Commission which had been appointed by the BerlinFleet. Conference to recommend detailed means of giving effect to the(Previous agreed principle that Germany&apos;s merchant fleet should be dividedReference: equally between the Soviet Union, the United States and the united cm. (45) 14th   Kingdom.Conclusions, The Minister of War Transport explained that the work of the minute 1.) Commission had not been easy, and its conclusion reflected credit on the British members. The report recommended an allocation ofGerman ships which he regarded as generally satisfactory, and he advised that it should be accepted subject to certain reservations.Agreement had not been reached regarding the disposal of the fishing fleet, port facilities and inland water transport. TheRussian Government wished that their disposal should be further discussed by the Commission. The British and American view wasthat it should be dealt with in the same way as the disposal of othercapital goods included in reparations. Agreement had not beenreached regarding compensation for the use of vessels prior todelivery.The Commission made fifteen recommendations, which were setout in full in Section B of their report annexed to CP. (45) 350.The Minister of War Transport considered that reservations wouldbe necessary only in respect of Recommendations 1, 3, 4, 7, 9 and 11.He thought that if the main recommendations, including that for* the allocation of German ships, could be accepted quickly, it would reduce the prospects of argument on other matters.Points made in discussion were : :(a) The First Sea Lord said that the Chiefs of Staff supported the recommendations made by the Minister of War Transport.(b) The Foreign Secretary explained that under the PotsdamProtocol, while the Russians would provide for an allocation to poland out of their share, the allocations to the other maritimeAllies were to be provided out of the British and American shares.This would require subsequent discussion with the United StatesGovernment.(c) The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked, that, in further discussion of the details, the Ministry of War Transport should keep in close touch with the Treasury. It was agreed that thereshould be no commitment to make any payment to Russia untilclaims and counter-claims had been settled, and that the Ministerof War Transport should ensure that our bargaining power overfinancial matters was not weakened by our handing over of ships to Russia.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Governments of the Soviet Union and theUnited States should be informed forthwith that HisMajesty&apos;s Government accepted the division of ships pro-posed in the report of the Tripartite Commission annexed to CP. (45) 350, with the reservation of the points of detailmentioned by the Minister of War Transport in that memorandum.(2) Invited the Minister of War Transport to discuss the termsof the communication find of the reservations with the.Secretary of State fOr Foreign Affairs, the First Lordof the Admiralty and the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster.(3) Asked the Minister of War Transport, in his further dis-cussions, to bear in mind the points noted at (c) above.
5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP. (45) 355) regarding theforthcoming elections in Greece. It had been agreed that an Inter-national Commission should observe the elections. That commission had already paid a preliminary visit to Greece and had drawn upa plan for observing the elections. This was an elaborate plan,involving the employment of a large number of observation teams,the British element of which would have to be drawn from militarysources.The Foreign Secretary said that, in his view, it was essentialto ensure that the Greek elections were efficiently and fairly carriedout and His Majesty&apos;s Government would be justified in incurringtheir share of the expenditure required for this purpose. He there-fore proposed that the Commission&apos;s plan should be accepted. Asregards the system of election, proportional representation was themethod provided for by the existing law in Greece, and it would bea mistake for His Majesty&apos;s Government to attempt to bring about any change in the existing law for the purpose of these elections.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform the United StatesGovernment that His Majesty&apos;s Government were ingeneral agreement with the plan drawn up by the Corn-mission for observing the elections; and to invite theUnited States and French Governments to join in advising the Greek Government to make a firm and final declaration that the elections would be held on the 31st March by asystem of proportional representation.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs (CP. (45) 353) regardingthe amount which assisted migrants to Australia should be expectedto pay towards their passages. The Australian Government had proposed that the amount should be  10, while the United KingdomGovernment had proposed  15. When this matter had been con-sidered by the Cabinet on the 11th October, 1945, the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs had been asked to arrange for theAustralian authorities to join him in discussions with the shipping companies regarding the passage rates that they would charge toassisted migrants. These discussions had now taken place, but theshipping companies were unable at present to commit themselvesto a definite figure.The Cabinet Agreed that the contribution to be made by assistedmigrants towards the cost of their passages to Australiashould be limited to  10, the balance of the cost to be divided equally between the Governments of the UnitedKingdom and Australia.7. The Minister of Health said that he was disturbed at thecurrent shortage of gas in London, which was coinciding with an outbreak of a mild type of influenza. Could anything more be done to relieve the present situation?The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the shortage was dueentirely to difficulty in finding a sufficient supply of unskilled labour for the gas-works. This was an unattractive occupation; andthe difficulty of finding sufficient labour for it had increased sincethe powers of direction ceased to be available.The Minister of Labour said that his Department had just com-pleted a review of the industries, including gas-works, to which itwas proving specially difficult to attract labour.   The results of this
review were now being examined, but it seemed that the difficulty-arose more often from unsatisfactory working conditions than fromlow wage rates. He was, therefore, planning to make special efforts,through labour supply officers and factory inspectors, to secureimproved working conditions in these industries. Meanwhile, hewould certainly consider whether there was any further emergencyaction which could be taken to increase the amount of unskilled labour available for gas-works in the London area.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement made by the Minister of Labour.Man-Power. 8.   The Cabinet were informed that on the 15th December, 1945,Eeleases from the total numbers demobilised from the Armed Forces had reachedthe Forces. &amp; figure within 200,000 of the target of 1-g millions which the(Previous Cabinet had asked the Services to reach before the end of the year.Reference: Releases had been running at the rate of nearly 100,000 a week;CM.

The Minister of A griculture said that an application for theWages. minimum weekly wage for agricultural workers to be increased from 3 10s. Od. to  4 10s. 0d. had been rejected by the Central wages board.This decision would be unpopular with agricultural workers.He asked that Ministers should take special care to avoid making any statement which might seem to imply any intension on the partof the Government to intervene in a matter which had been dealtwith by the constitutional machinery for the settlement of wagesquestions in the agricultural industry.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement.Mr. Will 10.   The Prime Minister said that members of the Cabinet wouldThome, M.P.    have learned with great regret of the death of Mr. Will Thorne, M.P.Mr. Thorne had been an outstanding figure in the Labour movement for a great many years, and had made a valuable contribution tothe work of the Party.The Cabinet warmly endorsed the Prime Ministers tribute toMr: Thorne, and asked the Prime Minister to convey to Mrs. Thornean expression of their sincere sympathy.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,3rd January, 1946.
