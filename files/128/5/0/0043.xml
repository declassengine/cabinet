Germany.(previous reference:CM. (46) 36thConclusions,Minute 3.)World food supplies.wheat supplies forIndia andGermany.(previous reference:C.M.(46)34thConclusions.)1. The Cabinet had a preliminary exchange of views on amemorandum by the Foreign Secretary (CP. (46) 186) on future policy towards Germany.The discussion is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard file of Cabinet Conclusions.2. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of representa-tions which had been made to him by the Minister of Food and theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster regarding the impending-collapse of wheat supplies for India and the British Zone ofGermany. Minutes which these Ministers had addressed to thePrime Minister on this subject had been circulated with W.F.S. (46)106 and 107. An equally serious position in British territories inSouth-East Asia was foreshadowed in a memorandum by the Secre-tary of State for the Colonies (W.F.S. (46) 108).The shipments proposed by the United States Government forIndia and for the British Zone of Germany were far short of theirminimum requirements. Out of a total planned export of 845,000tons of grain in May, the United-States proposed to send to Indiaonly 20,000 tons and to the British Zone of Germany only 20,700tons, as compared with 150,000 tons for Japan and 250,000 tons toU.N.R.R.A. countries.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that theminimum import requirements of the British Zone of Germany, forarrival in the five months from May to September inclusive, were675,000 tons. Towards these requirements no supplies were insight; for the figures assumed delivery of the 20,700 tons whichthe United States were now proposing the ship during May.The Minister of Food said that in his view the proposals now put forward by the United States Government were designed to force some further contribution from the United Kingdom byimplying that we had a special responsibility for supplying these areas. In his judgment, however, no further contribution oughtto be made from United Kingdom stocks. According to his latest estimate stocks of wheat in this country would fall from 806,000tons at the, end of April to 283,000 tons at the end of September;and, even if the most optimistic estimates were realised, stocks atthe end of September could not exceed 719,000 tons, which was belowthe minimum figure hitherto approved by the Cabinet. The stocksof flour would rise, over the same period, from 326,000 tons to361,000 tons. The consumption economies recently introduced inthe United Kingdom had been designed to safeguard our stock position; and he did not consider that any part of the savings thussecured should be made available as a contribution to meet theimmediate needs of other countries. He therefore proposed that our representative on the Combined Food Board should be instructedto press for an increase in the supplies offered by the United states for India and the British Zone of Germany; and to reject anyrequest that might be made for a further contribution from UnitedKingdom resources.The Prime Minister said that, according to the advice receivedfrom our representatives in Washington, there was some risk thatan uncompromising refusal to make at this stage any further contribution from the United Kingdom might harden feeling in theUnited States against giving further assistance to these areas ofBritish responsibility. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington(in his telegram No. 2861 of the 5th May) strongly urged that afurther attempt should be made to reach an agreed solution withthe Americans on the basis of offering some further assistance fromthe United Kingdom (particularly for India and the British zone of Germany) in return for firm1 undertakings of replacement by theUnited States later in the year. Similar advice was given by our representative on the Combined Food Board and in a message(Washington telegram No. 2850 of the 4th May) from a representa-tive of the Control Office for Germany and Austria who was nowin Washington.   Future co-operation with the United States would
certainly be made very much more difficult if, having now main-tained that any further contribution from the United kingdom was out of the question, we were forced at a later stage, when con-fronted with conditions of widespread starvation in the british zone of Germany, to send, at whatever risk to our future position,some supplies from the United Kingdom to Germany.In discussion the view was expressed that the continuingAmerican pressure for a further contribution from the UnitedKingdom was largely due to suspicions on the part of the UnitedStates Administration that we were still maintaining large reservestocks of wheat in this country. It was essential to convince theUnited States Administration that this was no longer the case. Weshould put before them the full facts relating to our stocks and consumption levels, showing how these had been progressively reduced over the past few months and to what straits we should bereduced if in the event our expectations of restoring our positionin the early autumn were falsified. We should also make it clearthat it would be quite impossible for us to supply alone the grainrequirements of the British Zone of Germany; and should explain the degree of starvation to which the British Zone would be reduced in the summer if no further supplies of wheat could be obtainedfrom the United States. We should put clearly before them theeconomic and political consequences of widespread starvation inthe British Zone, as foreseen in a report recently submitted by the deputy Military Governor of the Control Commission. against this background, and in return for the firmest assurances of replace-ment in August and September, it might be justifiable to offer some further contribution by way of diversion of grain shipmentsen route for this country, if by this means the United States couldbe induced to make a much more substantial contribution towardsthe immediate needs of areas of British responsibility. As part ofthe same bargain we should also press for the pooling of food supplies between the three Western zones of Germany; and should ask that India should have the same priority as Japan in the ship-ment of grain against the allocations made to countries in theFar East.In further discussion, it was agreed that this approach shouldbe made to the United States Administration at the highest level;and that for this purpose a senior Minister of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should go out to the United States at once to take thematter up with President Truman and the senior members of his administration.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord President to undertake an immediatemission to the United States to discuss with president truman and the senior members of his administration the means of meeting the wheat requirements of areas ofBritish responsibility, particularly India, the british zone of Germany and British territories in South-east asia.(2) Invited the Lord President to present the case of HisMajesty&apos;s Government on the basis outlined in the cabinets discussion; and authorised him to offer some further contribution by diversion of wheat shipmentsen route for the United Kingdom if, in return, he could secure firm assurances of replacement from the UnitedStates in August and September and a substantiallylarger contribution from the United States towards theimmediate needs of areas of British responsibility.(3) Asked the Minister of State to arrange for president truman to be informed that the Lord. President was proposing to visit Washington within the next few days in order to discuss these questions with the United states administration.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,7th May, 1946.
