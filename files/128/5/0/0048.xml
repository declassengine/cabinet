Germany.(previous reference:CM. (46) 43rdConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Cabinet had before them telegrams from the foreign secretary (Nos. 179, 182 and 185 of the 15th May) regarding memo-randa which had been put before the Council of Foreign ministers by the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Byrnes, proposing anew procedure for discussion of the short-term and long-term problems of Germany.The short-term proposals were concerned with economic problems and arose from the deadlock which had occurred in theControl Council in Berlin over a programme for German imports and exports. The three Western Powers had demanded that, inaccordance with the agreement reached by the Berlin Conference,Germany should be treated as an economic unit for purposes offoreign trade. The Soviet representatives on the Control council had contended that, until the reparations plan had been completed,Germany must be treated for economic purposes on a zonal basis.This had led the United States authorities in Germany to announce that they would suspend the dismantling of reparations plants intheir zone.In his memorandum to the Council of Foreign MinistersMr. Byrnes had stated that the plan for reparation deliveries ofcapital equipment was conditional upon the treatment of germany as an economic unit and had demanded that the following questions should be resolved before the reparations programme was carriedany further : (i) Will the internationalisation of the Ruhr and the Rhine-land be considered and, if these territories are internationalised,will their resources remain part of Germany&apos;s economic structure?(ii) Will the resources left in Germany be made available for germany as a whole, and will resources surplus to immediateGerman needs be made available for export, payment for agreedessential imports for Germany as a whole ranking as a first charge on the proceeds of such exports ?(iii) Can agreed procedures be established, during the next90 days, for sufficient German administrative machinery to enableGermany to be operated as an economic unit ?(iv) Will the existing zonal boundaries be continued only forpurposes of delineating occupation areas and not as artificialbarriers to a reasonably free movement of goods in Germany?(v) Can a tentative agreement be reached, for inclusion in thePeace Treaty, regarding the western boundary of Germany?Mr. Byrnes recommended that each of the Governments repre-sented on the Council of Foreign Ministers should appoint a specialdeputy to work on the problems of Germany; and that these fivequestions should be referred to these special deputies with instruc-tions to report to the Council at its meeting on the 15th June.Mr. Byrnes&apos;s long-term proposals related to a peace settlement with Germany. He proposed that the special deputies should be instructed to study the problems involved and prepare a draft of a proposed peace settlement; that they should make interim reports to the Council on the progress of their work; and that they should aim at enabling the Council to submit a draft Peace Treaty for germany to a Peace Conference to be convened on the12th November, 1946. It was not, in his view, necessary that thereshould at that time be a German Government to accept the settle-ment. It was, however, essential that the Allied Powers shouldbe agreed on the nature of the settlement towards which the allied occupation and administration of Germany should be directed until such time as a German Government could be created to accept that settlement.The Foreign Secretary, in his telegram No. 185, suggested thathe should support the proposal for the appointment of specialdeputies to study the German problem. He also proposed to agreethat the special deputies should study the five questions posed byMr. Byrnes, subject to certain drafting amendments and subject totheir taking last the problems of the Ruhr and the Rhineland,[32062-3]b 2
which in his view should be subordinated to that of Germany asa whole. On the long-term proposals., it was important to avoid a procedure by which the four Powers would present an agreedscheme for acceptance by a Peace Conference, without having giventhe other interested Powers an opportunity of participating in discussion of the scheme. He therefore proposed to suggest thatthe special deputies should aim at submitting the main lines of asettlement to the Council of Foreign Ministers by November 1946and that in the preparation of their scheme they should consult with representatives of the other Governments closely concerned.The Council of Foreign Ministers, after considering the draft, could then submit it to a Peace Conference to be held at a somewhat later date.The Cabinet first considered the short-term proposals forsecuring that Germany was treated for economic purposes as asingle unit. Discussion turned mainly on the question whether,in default of agreement on this point, we should discontinue the dismantling of plant for reparation deliveries. The United states authorities had already announced their intention to suspend the dismantling of reparation plants in their zone, in view of the deadlock which had arisen on the Allied Control Council over theimport-export programme; and our representatives in Berlin had asked whether they should follow the United States lead in thismatter. By the decision of the Berlin Conference, 25 per cent, ofthe plant dismantled was to be sent to the Soviet Union; anddiscontinuance of the dismantling process was our most effectivesanction for persuading the Soviet authorities to accept pro-posals for treating Germany as an economic unit. Moreover,if Germany was not to be treated as an economic unit, it wouldbe even more important to increase exports from our zone in orderto reduce the extent to which the cost of necessary imports wasborne by the British Exchequer. The process of dismantling plantimpaired the prospects of restoring exports to the levels whichwould be required if it eventually proved impossible to secure an effective agreement for treating Germany as an economic unit.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, on the other hand, said thathe would be most reluctant to accept any arrangement which woulddelay the removal of industrial plant from Germany for reparationdelivery to the United Kingdom. Was it necessary to discontinue the whole process of dismantling the plant, merely for the purposeof putting pressure upon the Soviet Government? Would it notbe possible to continue the dismantling programme but to stop the deliveries of plant to Russia?As against this, it was suggested that it would be inexpedientfor us to default on this provision of the Berlin agreement, when our major objective was to secure Soviet compliance with thecomplementary provision of the same agreement that germany should be treated as an economic unit. It was also pointed outthat Mr. Byrnes had stated in his memorandum to the Council ofForeign Ministers that, if the Council agreed to refer his fivequestions for study by special deputies, he would be ready tocontinue the process of allocating and dismantling reparationplants during the interim period until the report of the specialdeputies was submitted to the Council.The general conclusion of the Cabinet on this point was thatthe Foreign Secretary should keep it in mind that, in default ofagreement on the short-term economic position, we must be free to stop dismantling plants in the British Zone for reparationdelivery to the Soviet Union, while retaining all our own rights toreparation deliveries.On the long-term proposals for the preparation of a draft peace settlement for Germany, it was pointed out that the proposals outlined in these telegrams were not inconsistent with the line takenby His Majesty&apos;s Government regarding the convening of a PeaceConference to consider draft Treaties of Peace with the ex-enemysatellite States in Europe. The situation which we had there been anxious to avoid was one in which the other belligerent Powers

The Third Reading of the Coal Industry Nationalisation bill would be taken on the 20th May.The Second Reading of the Cable and Wireless Bill would betaken .on the 21st May.The remaining days of the week would be devoted to the report stage of the National Insurance Bill.The Chief Whip said that the Opposition proposed to ask fora Supply Day on the 21st May, in order that there might be a discussion on Egypt. The Cabinet agreed that this request mustbe resisted, on two grounds. First, it was important that progressshould be made with the Cable and Wireless Bill. Secondly, it was undesirable that the House of Commons should discuss Egyptindependently of the general international situation; and provisional arrangements had already been made for a general debate on foreign affairs to be held during the week beginning the27th May.Business in The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs asked when thethe House of House of Lords might expect to receive the Coal IndustryLords.

The cabinet were informed that these two Bills should be ready for considerationby the House of Lords by the 21st and 28th May respectively.railway charges.(previous reference:CM. (46) 40thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofTransport (CP. (46) 193) submitting revised proposals for increasedrailway charges which had been drawn up in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer.The Minister of Transport said that a revision of the original estimates made by the railway companies showed that, withoutincreased charges, the burden on the Exchequer for the year 1946would be  42-5 millions. He now proposed that the increase in coal rates should be only 8J per cent, of the pre-war rates, whichwould add less than 0 -1 points to the cost of living index. The neteffect of his revised proposals would be to raise ordinary passenger fares and freight rates, other than coal rates, to a level of 33^ percent, over the pre-war level, while coal rates and workmen&apos;s fares and season ticket rates would be brought up to 25 per cent, abovethe pre-war figure. He wished to announce that these increases would take effect from the 1st July and that he was asking a would be invited to a Conference merely for the purpose of 2 Xendorsing drafts which had already been finally agreed by theGovernments represented on the Council of Foreign Ministers. Inthis case, however, it was hot proposed that the Council should reach final agreement on the terms of a peace settlement for germany before it was submitted to a wider Conference.The Cabinet-(1) Endorsed the line which the Foreign Secretary proposed(in his telegram No. 185) to take in the discussion ofMr. Brynes&apos;s proposals for handling the short-term and long-term problems of Germany, on the understandingthat, in default of agreement on the short-term proposals regarding the economic situation in Germany, therewould be nothing to prevent us from ceasing todismantle plant in the British Zone for reparationdelivery to the Soviet Union while retaining all ourown rights to continue reparation deliveries to theUnited Kingdom;(2) Invited the Minister of State to arrange for the foreign secretary to be informed in the sense of Conclusion (1)above.
consultative committee consisting of the three permanent membersof the Railway Rates Tribunal to report what further adjustments of charges would be necessary to bring them into line with thepost-war level of costs.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he supported theproposals, though they would leave a burden of  20 millions onthe Exchequer for the year 1946. He would modify the food sub-subsidies, in consultation with the Minister of Eood, so as to ensurethat the increased charges for the conveyance of food would notcause an increase in the cost of living index.Discussion turned on the question whether on general groundsthis was an opportune time to increase railway charges.In favour of postponing any increase, it was urged that in thepresent state of the commodity market no part of any increase in costs was absorbed by a reduction in profit margins, but was immediately reflected in further price increases. Thus, an increasein railway charges would have an inflationary effect and would cause special difficulties in connexion with the housing programme and the export drive. Moreover, new profit margins would haveto be fixed for some commodities, with the result that the low-costproducer would gain to an even greater extent at the expense ofthe Exchequer. No full investigation had been made into theexpenditure of the railways, on which the claim for an increasein charges was based, though it seemed reasonable to suppose thatwith the fall in railway traffic and the return of railway employeesfrom the Forces, the burden of wages should be lighter. In thesecircumstances, and in view of the considerable revenue which theExchequer had received from the railways during the war, would it not be wiser to continue to meet the deficit from the Exchequeruntil a more plentiful supply of goods was available and a moresearching enquiry had been made into the costs incurred by therailways ? Alternatively, was there not a case for restricting theincrease in freight charges to, say, 10 per cent., an amount whichcould probably be carried by a considerable range of consumer goodswithout any increase of price? Objection was also taken to theproposal to increase passenger fares, particularly workmen&apos;s fares and season ticket rates, since, even if this did not result in an increasein the cost of living index, it was likely to lead to renewed claims for wage increases just at a time when it was hoped that a certain measure of wage stability had been achieved. While it was, ofcourse, desirable that the Government should not be faced with thealternative of increasing charges immediately after the nationalisa-tion of the railways or of starting the British Transport Commissionon a subsidy basis, there would surely be time to put the railwayson a sound basis before the nationalisation scheme came into opera-tion in 1948. Merely from the point of view of preparing fornationalisation, it was not necessary to bring increased charges intoforce at this critical stage in the transition from war to peace.On the other hand, it was claimed that, unless immediate steps were taken to reduce substantially the extent to which the exchequer was subsidising the railways, the Government would find it moreand more difficult to restore the situation and would be in a weakposition to resist similar claims for subsidies from other industries,such as the coal-mining industry. The argument that the Govern-ment could afford to subsidise the railways in the transition periodbecause of the large revenues which the Exchequer had received fromthe railways during the war failed to take account of the fact that!these revenues were due to Government expenditure. The truthwas that railway charges were completely out of line with the general!price level and it was high time that the users of the railways were made to face economic realities. The increases proposed in cp. (46) 193 were far below what was needed to meet the fulldeficit, and before the further necessary increases were made itwould be possible to verify that the estimated rise of 70 per cent]in railway costs was justified and that there was no wasteful use&apos;of man-power by the railways. For the rest, the Ministers con-cerned should exercise their powers of price control in such a way]
as to prevent unjustifiable increases in the prices of such commodities as building materials.After further discussion it was generally agreed that it wouldbe desirable for the present to restrict the increase in freight charges(other than coal rates) to 10 per cent., instead of 16f rds per cent.,of the pre-war level.The Cabinet : (1) Agreed that, subject to the limitation of the increase in freight rates (otlher than coal rates) to 10 per cent, ofthe pre-war level instead of 16frds per cent., the increases in railway charges proposed in CP. (46) 193 should bebrought into operation from the 1st July, 1946.(2) Agreed that the Minister of Transport should ask his con-consultative committee to report what further adjustments of railway charges, and of the road and rail fares of theLondon Passenger Transport Board, were necessary tobring them into line with the post-war level of costs,and invited him to submit to the Cabinet a draft ofthe proposed terms of reference to the consultative committee.(3) Invited the Minister of Transport to investigate the possi-bility of securing a reduction in the present level ofexpenditure by the railways, and in particular toexamine, in consultation with the Minister of Labour,what reductions might be made in the man-poweremployed by the railways.India.constitutional position.(previous reference:CM. (46) 47thConclusions.)4. The Prime Minister read to the Cabinet a telegram (Index38 of the 15th May) which he had received from the cabinet mission to India in reply to his message conveying the Cabinet&apos;approval of the final text of their statement.In this telegram the Mission expressed their appreciation of the cabinet&apos;s decision to allow them to make their statement in theform which they themselves preferred, even though this might increase the criticisms in this country. They felt justified in theirattitude because so much was at stake and the situation in Indiawassuch that no avoidable risk could be taken.As regards defence, the Viceroy and the Commander-in-Chiefbelieved that India would invite our co-operation if we reservedthe point for later discussion. The Cabinet Mission shared thisview, and believed there was a fair chance of securing our objectivesif we refrained from forcing the issue. All the matters to be covered by the proposed Treaty were matters which should be negotiated between two free nations, and we should be well advisednot to seek to press them as conditions of a constitutional settlement.Similar considerations applied to the question of India &apos;sremaining within the British Commonwealth. The less we appearedto insist on this, the more likely it was that an independent india would freely elect to remain a member of the Commonwealth.References to the past benefits of the British rule in India wouldnot help towards this end.As regards representation, the Mission felt that the interestsof the minorities would be much better served by the adoption oftheir proposal for an advisory commission which would examine thewhole question of fundamental rights and the protection of minorities than by including in the constitution-making machinerya few isolated individuals who would make no impression on thesolid ranks of the main political Parties.The Cabinet -Agreed that there was much force in the considerationsoutlined in this telegram from the Cabinet Mission.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,16*A May, 1946.
