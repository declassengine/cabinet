The Cabinet held a preliminary discussion  about theAmendment difficulties which might be encountered in passing Government legis-of Parliament lation through the House of Lords. In the course of this discussionAct. it was pointed out that, if the Government desired to pass legislationamending the Parliament Act, that legislation should be introduced before very long if under the existing provisions of the parliament act it was to be passed during the present Parliament.The Cabinet Invited the Lord Chancellor to consider, and to report tothe Cabinet upon, the question of amending the parliament act.Palestine. 3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secre-(Previous        tary of State for the Colonies (CP. (46) 238) on recent developmentsReference:       in Palestine.  In the last few days there had been an organised seriesCM. (46) 17th   of attacks on bridges over the Jordan, the railway workshops at conclusions,     Haifa had been severely damaged and five British officers had been minute 2.)      kidnapped from the Officers&apos; Club in Tel-Aviv.   Another officer anda nursing sister had now been reported missing.  The High Commis-sioner for Palestine considered that this situation called forvigorous action by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and he urged (i) thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government should refuse to conduct any further discussions on the subject of the admission of 100,600 Jews into palestine until the kidnapped officers had been returned;  and(ii) that he should be authorised to put into effect at whatever time he thought appropriate the full plan drawn up locally against theJewish illegal organisations and the Jewish Agency.The Secretary of State for the Colonies recalled that the cabinet had not so far considered the moment opportune to take extrememeasures against the illegal organisations in Palestine, but therewas no doubt that the situation was becoming more serious. Thepatience of the Administration and the military was being seriouslytried and there was grave risk of the troops taking matters into theirown hands. He felt bound, therefore, to ask the Cabinet to considerthe matter afresh. In his view it was necessary to take very firmaction. He did not, however, advise the acceptance of the HighCommissioner^ first recommendation. Technical discussions withthe Americans had just begun. These were limited to examining the implications of admitting 100,000 immigrants to Palestine, interms of transport, finance and their absorption into the community.We had not decided that this number of immigrants should beadmitted. To break off the negotiations at this stage might imply that this decision had been taken and would also have a veryunfortunate effect in America.[32264-6] b 2
The Secretary of State said that on the previous day he had seen Mr. Ben Gurion, Chairman of the Executive of the jewish agency in Palestine, who had seemed genuinely distressed at thekidnapping of British officers. He had agreed to the publicationof a statement expressing his deep regret, and had also asked fora message to be sent to the Agency in Jerusalem for publicationlocally appealing to the Jewish community to give every possible assistance in freeing the officers. Mr. Ben Gurion had also givenhis categorical assurance that there was no connection between the agency and the Irgun Zwei Leumi or Stern groups. He had notbeen so clear on their relationship with the Hagana, who we had reason to believe were in fact controlled by the Agency.In discussion there was general agreement that it would be a mistake to break off the discussions with the United States officials on the Report of the Anglo-American Committee. On the contrary,it would be advisable to press for the early arrival in this country of the remaining part of the American Delegation.As regards action in Palestine, the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff emphasised that if the existing state of affairscontinued, troops in Palestine might get out of hand. The Chiefsof Staff thought that the time had come when greater freedom ofaction should be given to the High Commissioner and theCommander-in-Chief. The Secretary of State for War spoke insupport of this view.The Prime Minister read to the Cabinet a telegram from theForeign Secretary in Paris. The Foreign Secretary took the viewthat strong action should be taken and emphasised the importanceof enlisting the support of the United States Government for that action. He hoped that they could be informed in advance of thecourse we proposed and persuaded to endorse it. He also suggestedthat a publicity campaign should be undertaken to make clear to public opinion in this country and the United States the reasonsfor our action.Discussion showed that there was general agreement that thesituation called for firm action. We could no longer tolerate aposition in which the authority of Government was set at nought.The following points were also made : (a) While it was the activities of the Jews which had pro-provoked the present situation, it must be remembered that historicallythe illegal organisations had in some part originated as a protec-tion against Arab violence. That violence might recur. There had,indeed, been some indication in the recent declarations of Arableaders that it would do so. It was understood that many Arabs inPalestine at present held arms.(b) The important step at the moment, however, was to break the illegal organisation rather than to compel individuals throughoutthe country to surrender their arms. The wholesale disarming of jews and Arabs might follow later, but it would be a difficultoperation and it was impossible to foresee its implications. Itmight entail a heavy and continuing military commitment.(c) It was only the Jews who had effective illegal organisationsat the moment and action would be taken against them first, butthe Government should make it clear that they were no longerprepared to tolerate the existence of any illegal organisations amongeither community in Palestine. It was important that we should notappear to be discriminating against the Jews in favour of the Arabs.(d) The more extreme elements seemed now to have obtainedcontrol of the Jewish Agency. There was clear evidence that the agency was connected with, the Hagana and it would probably benecessary in suppressing illegal organisations to raid its premises and to arrest some of its members. The complete suppression ofthe Agency as such would, however, be undesirable.(e) The success of the operations proposed would depend largely on the secrecy with which they were prepared. It would,therefore, be undesirable to give any indication beforehand of the
course  proposed.    For this reason, despite the importance of Z t) &amp;securing the continued co-operation of the United States in Pales-tine and the Middle East, it would be undesirable to inform theUnited States Government until very shortly beforehand of theaction which was to be taken.(/) The Secretary of State for War was expecting to be asked,by Private Notice Question in the House of Commons that after-noon, to make a statement about the kidnapping of British officersin Palestine. If this Question could not be postponed, he should say that he had no statement to make at the moment.(g) Reference was anade to the reported arrival of the Muftiof Jerusalem in Cairo which could not fail to have repercussionsthroughout the Middle East. It was reported that the egyptian government proposed that he should be allowed to stay in thecountry on the strict condition that he indulged in no political activities. The Foreign Office were asked to submit a full reporton this, and on the manner in which the Mufti had effected hisescape from France.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the discussions with United States officialsabout the Anglo-American Committee&apos;s Report shouldcontinue.(2) Agreed that the High Commissioner for Palestine shouldbe authorised to take such steps as he considered tobreak up the illegal organisations in Palestine; that forthis purpose the premises of the Jewish Agency mightbe searched and persons connected with it arrested; butthat the Agency as such should not be closed or pro-scribed; and that there should not at this stage be anyattempt to secure the wholesale disarming of indi-viduals, both Jewish and Arab, in Palestine.(3) Agreed that the United States Government should beinformed of the course of action which we proposed totake, but that this should not be done until very shortly before action was, in fact, to be taken.(4) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies and theMinister of State to arrange for consideration to begiven to the publicity measures which would be required.(5) Asked the Minister of State to arrange for a report to besubmitted to the Cabinet on the means by which the mufti had left France and arrived in Egypt and on thecourse of action which might now be taken in respectof him.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,20^ June, 1946.
