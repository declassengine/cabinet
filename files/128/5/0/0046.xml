India. The Cabinet had before them telegrams from the CabinetConstitutional Mission to India (Index 33 and S/24, 26 and 28 of the 13th May)Position. seeking approval of the steps which they proposed to take, now that(Previous        their attempt to secure agreement among the leaders of the mainReference:       Indian Parties had failed, to announce their own proposals forCM. (46) 45th   securing the establishment of a new constitution in India.   these conclusions,     telegrams embodied the text of a statement to be issued in IndiaMinute 7.)&apos;     at 8 p.m. on the 16th May on behalf of the Cabinet Mission andthe Viceroy.   It was contemplated that the text of this statement would be issued simultaneously in the United Kingdom (at 3 - 30 p.m.on the 16th May); and the Mission had undertaken to telegraph thedraft of an oral statement which might be made at the same timein Parliament.The Prime Minister explained the form and arrangement ofthe statement to be issued on behalf of the Cabinet Mission andthe Viceroy, and directed the attention of the Cabinet to the moreimportant passages. He also read to the Cabinet -a note which hehad received from the Secretary of State for India analysing thescheme proposed by the Cabinet Mission so as to distinguish between those parts which had been accepted in the discussions at Simla andthose on which agreement had not been reached. This showed thatin the course of their negotiations the Mission had secured a very substantial measure of assent to the main features of their scheme.Although the Indian Parties had not been prepared to adopt itas an agreed scheme, there was some ground for hoping that theymight accept it if it wrere now put forward on behalf of HisMajesty&apos;s Government.In discussion of the draft statement the following points were raised : (a) Paragraph 22 of the draft contemplated the negotiation ofa treaty providing for certain matters &apos;&apos; arising out of the transferof power.&quot; Would the issue of this statement mark the end ofBritish rule in India ? At what stage should we actually transferour powers and jurisdiction to an Indian Government?The Prime Minister said that a new constitution could not be finally established in India without legislation by the parliament at Westminster, and the enactment of that legislation would &quot;markthe final stage in the transfer of powers. The first step was, how-ever, to secure the appointment of a constituent assembly to workout the details of the proposed new constitution. And, during the interim period, there must be an interim Government which wasin fact representative. The United Kingdom would negotiate withthe constituent assembly the terms of the treaty mentioned in para-graph 22 of the draft statement. But, while the constituent assemblywas carrying out its task and until the final legislation was passedby the Parliament at Westminster, the existing constitution would continue to operate.(b) It was through this treaty that we must seek to secure our strategic interests and to safeguard the rights of European Britishsubjects in India. Paragraph 22 of the draft statement ought tobe amplified and strengthened in order to make this clear. Thus,the proposed treaty might be described as &apos;&apos; providing, in particular,for common defence interests and for all necessary matters arisingout of the transfer of powers.&quot;(c) In dealing with the relation of the Indian states to british india, paragraph 14 of the draft statement said that paramountcycould neither be retained by the British Crown nor transferred tothe new Government.The Lord Chancellor asked whether it was certain that para-mountcy could not be retained if India, though securing her independence, remained within the British Commonwealth.The Prime Minister explained that there would be no sanction for the exercise of this power by the United Kingdom government when United Kingdom troops bad been withdrawn from India; and
it was undesirable that the power should be exercised by the new government of India.(d) The draft statement was, in general, open to the criticism that its use of the word &quot; independence &quot; was ambiguous. In thewords used by the Prime Minister on the 15th March, which werequoted in the first paragraph of the draft statement, &quot; indepen-dence &quot; was used in the sense of independence outside the BritishCommonwealth; and the fact that the statement opened with thisquotation from the Prime Ministers speech on the 15th March made it specially important that the word &apos;&apos; independence &apos;&apos; should notbe used without qualification in the remainder of the statement unless it was intended to imply independence outside the Commonwealth.The wording used in paragraphs 14 and 24 should be reconsideredfrom this point of view, as indeed should the whole statement; andit would probably be expedient to insert, early in paragraph 15,words to make it clear that the proposals for enabling India tosecure her independence did not prejudge the subsequent questionwhether the new independent India would, or would not, elect toremain a member of the British Commonwealth.(e) Paragraph 24 of the draft statement would need special consideration from this point of view. The final sentences, whichintroduced the question whether the new independent India wouldelect to remain a member of the British Commonwealth, did not seemto afford a very suitable ending for the statement. The Cabinetthought it would be preferable to deal with this point by recallingthe Prime Minister&apos;s words of the 15th March, which had beenquoted in paragraph 1 of the statement. They also considered thatthe final paragraph should include an appropriate reference to the record of British rule in India and the long and fruitful associationof the two peoples.(/) The suggestion was made that when the time came for thenew Indian Government to consider whether India should remain a member of the British Commonwealth it would be appropriate toarrange for the holding of a special conference of all the Govern-ments of the Commonwealth, at which India&apos;s representatives coulddiscuss her future, not with the United Kingdom Government alone,but with all the Governments of the Commonwealth.In discussion of the procedure for publishing the announce-ment, it was agreed that it would be desirable that copies of the full text of the announcement should be available, in the form of a white paper, at the time when the oral statement was made in parliament on the 16th May. A similar statement would be made simul-taneously in the House of Lords. It was also agreed that copies ofthe full text of the announcement should be communicated inadvance to the leaders of the Opposition. The Dominions office should arrange for advance copies to be sent by telegraph to dominion Governments and communicated to the dominion ministers now in London.The Cabinet-(1) Approved in principle the draft statement which it was proposed to issue in India on behalf of the cabinet mission and the Viceroy;(2) Approved the arrangements outlined above for the simul-taneous publication of this announcement in London andfor oral statements in both Houses of Parliament;(3) Invited the Prime Minister, in consultation with the LordChancellor, the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State forIndia, to consider the detailed wording of the draft statement, in the light of the Cabinefs discussion, andto communicate to the Cabinet Mission such verbalamendments as were required to give effect to the cabinet&apos;s views.Cabinet Office, S. IF. 1,Uth May, 1946.
