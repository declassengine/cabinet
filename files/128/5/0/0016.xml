Supplies of 1.   The Foreign Secretary recalled that at their meeting onKice from the 31st January the Cabinet had recognised the urgency of siam. extracting the surplus stocks of rice from Siam and had agreed on(Previous        this account that we should postpone our claim to obtain rice from reference:      Siam free of charge.   The Treasury had not, however, felt able toCM. (46)l0th   agree to the methods proposed by the Ministry of Food for obtainingConclusions,     rice from Siam, against payment, in 1946.   The Foreign SecretaryMinute 4.)       said that in his judgment we could not afford to risk the charge that we were holding up the supply of rice which was urgently needed to avert famine in South-East Asia by insisting on obtainingit without payment.  It was specially dangerous to expose ourselves to this charge at a time when we were pressing the United Statesand other food-producing countries to increase their exports of food-stuffs in order to relieve the world shortage of food.   He had,therefore, come to the conclusion that we ought not at this stage topress our claim to free rice from Siam.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was prepared toaccept the proposal of the Foreign Secretary, who had consulted himon the point, on condition that the Exchequer did not bear the costof any part of this Siamese rice which was supplied to India. india was well able to pay for rice supplies out of her accumulated sterling balances.The Secretary of State for the Colonies raised the question of payment for Siamese rice supplied to Ceylon and Malaya. It was explained that countries receiving this rice would be expected to pay for it in the usual way. If Malaya had no resources from whichpayment could be made, that was a matter to be considered as partof the general problem of providing financial assistance towards the rehabilitation of Malaya.The Cabinet-Agreed that in present circumstances our claim to obtainrice from Siam without payment should not be pressed, onthe understanding that countries receiving this rice wouldbe expected to pay for it in the usual way.South-BastAsia.Appointmentof SpecialCommissioner.(previous reference:CM. (46) 14thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that LordKillearn had arrived in London and was assembling his staff witha view to proceeding within the next few days to Singapore to take up his duties as Special Commissioner for South-East Asia. It was most important that Departments which had been asked tocontribute experts to Lord Killearn&apos;s staff should do so forthwith.The Prime Minister said that it was essential that the SpecialCommissioner should collect without delay the staff he required toenable him to carry out his important duties in South-East Asia.He hoped that all Ministers would give the Foreign Secretary their full co-operation and support in this matter. He asked the foreign secretary to refer to him any difficulties which he might find in securing from other Departments the loan of experts required by theSpecial Commissioner.Poland.Polish armed forces underBritishCommand.(previous reference:CM. (46) 7thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet of recent developments in the negotiations for the return to - Poland ofmembers of the Polish Forces now under British command.M. Vyshinsky had forwarded to the Secretary-General of theUnited Nations Organisation, for distribution to the members ofthe Security Council, a memorandum from the Yugoslav Govern-ment alleging that the Polish Army in Italy constituted a threat to peace and order on the Yugoslav-Italian frontier. The foreign secretary said that he would circulate to members of the Security[31507-4]b 2
Council a statement of the true facts, which would rebut this allegation-tion. He also proposed to ask the Yugoslav Government why theyhad not previously thought it necessary to raise this matter with HisMajesty&apos;s Government through the diplomatic channel.It seemed that M. Vyshinsky had circulated this memorandum from the Yugoslav Government without first consulting the repre-sentatives of the Polish Government now in London. Meanwhile,the Polish Government had announced that Polish troops outsidePoland could no longer be regarded as Polish Forces, and that thoseamong them who wished to return to Poland must apply individuallyto Polish Consulates abroad.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff asked whether this announcement affected the decision, taken by the Cabinet on the22nd January, to bring General Anders to this country for consulta-tion. The Foreign Secretary said that, in spite of this announce-ment, he still proposed to handle this matter on the basis approvedby the Cabinet on the 22nd January; and he asked that arrange-ments should be made for General Anders to come to this countryfor consultation at the appropriate moment.Syria and the lebanon.(previous reference:CM. (46) 11thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet of theproceedings in the Security Council regarding the withdrawal ofBritish and French troops from Syria and the Lebanon.The Foreign Secretary said that there had been some disposition to suggest that the negotiations with the Governments of the LevantStates should be confined exclusively to the withdrawal of Britishand French troops. He had found it necessary to resist this, as there were other important questions to be discussed, such as thefuture of the food-collecting organisation and the French schools and missions.After the rejection of draft resolutions proposed by the Mexicanand Egyptian Delegates, the United States Delegate had brought forward a resolution which took note of the statements made beforethe Security Council, expressed its confidence that the foreign troops would be withdrawn as soon as practicable, noted that negotiations to that end would be undertaken without delay and asked that theSecurity Council be informed of the result. This resolution was supported by the prescribed majority of seven votes, but the SovietDelegate had then used his veto to prevent its being formally carried.At that point, as a result of prior consultation between them, theFrench and United Kingdom Delegates had declared that, although this use of the veto had prevented the Security Council fromrecording any formal decision, their Governments would ensure thatthe wishes of the majority of the Council as regards the withdrawalof foreign troops were respected.The Foreign Secretary said that he had thought it would be a useful precedent for the future if the countries concerned declaredthat they would give effect to the views of the majority of theSecurity Council, notwithstanding the use of the veto; and the declarations to this effect which were made by himself andM. Bidault had been well received.The Foreign Secretary said that he presumed that the with-drawal of British troops from the Levant States could now beginwithout delay. He understood that the French would be glad of theloan of some transport to facilitate the withdrawal of their troops.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff confirmed that thewithdrawal of British troops could begin at once, and undertook to explore the possibility of lending transport to the French.
5. In connection with the discussion recorded in the preceding minute, The Foreign Secretary suggested that the procedure of theSecurity Council, as prescribed in the Charter of the United nations organisation, might with advantage be reviewed in the light of theproceedings of the Council during the First General Assembly. Thepoint which he had particularly in mind was the use which had beenmade of the right of veto. Thus, in the discussions about Greece,the Soviet Delegation had brought forward charges against HisMajesty&apos;s Government and had then used their right of veto toprevent the Council from passing a resolution which would havemade it clear that, in the view of the majority of the Council, thecharges were ill-founded. Secondly, the procedure allowed aGovernment to place on the Agenda a question in which it was not itself directly concerned, even though the States directly affectedhad not asked for the question to be discussed; and the initiatingGovernment, if one of the five Great Powers, could then use its vetoto prevent the Council from recording a formal decision. Thirdly,the Cabinet had understood, at the time of the San Francisco Con-ference, that the veto would be used only in relation to proposals foractive intervention on behalf of the United Nations Organisation.It now appeared that the veto would be used for purposes of pro-cedural manoeuvring throughout the discussions on the security council.The Cabinet-Agreed to consider at an early meeting the points whichthe Foreign Secretary had raised about the procedure ofthe Security Council.6. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Prime Ministerand Minister of Defence (CP. (46) 65) covering a summary of theestimates of defence expenditure in the financial year 1946-47, as approved by the Defence Committee, and a draft White Paper on defence policy in 1946.The Prime Minister said that the Defence Committee hadreviewed our defence policy for 1946 with the object of seeing howour commitments could be met with the least possible detriment to continue recovery. As indicated in paragraph 4 of his note, the cuts which had been made involved considerable risks; but, even so,the burden of expenditure was greater than the country could bearfor long. If the Cabinet approved the recommendations of theDefence Committee, the White Paper would be published on the21st February and Votes on Account of the Service Departments aweek later. Thereafter there would be a general debate on Defencefollowed by debates on individual Votes on Account.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was grateful tohis colleagues for their help in securing reductions in the estimates.He realised that if the situation deteriorated it might be necessaryto have supplementary estimates, though he hoped that it would bepossible to avoid this. He pointed out that, even after deductingthose charges which were non-recurring, the annual expenditure was  1,091 millions, which was more than double the sum whichhad been regarded as a reasonable peacetime figure by the coalition government. He was most concerned about the portion of theestimates representing expenditure overseas, which was a heavyadverse item in our balance of payments.Discussion first turned on the question whether our Forces ofoccupation in Germany could not be reduced.It was suggested, on the one hand, that there was a tendency for Commanders to retain an unnecessarily large establishment inthe understandable desire to make their administration as efficientas possible; and that not enough was being done, by giving responsi-bility to democratic leaders among the German people, to prepare-4] B 3
the way for the withdrawal of our Forces, which would be inevitable in the long run. It was also suggested that there was a case for reviewing the inter-Allied agreements regarding the zonal adminis-tration of Germany in the light of experience of the burdens thrown on us by our responsibility for the industrial areas in western germany. In particular, it seemed unreasonable that we should be compelled to incur dollar expenditure both for supplies sent to theBritish Zone and for any exports from the British Zone to thiscountry.On the other hand, it was pointed out that there was evidenceof attempts to revive a Nazi organisation in Germany; and that,as a result of the long period of Nazi domination, there were feweffective democratic leaders who could be used to rebuild the Germanadministration. Moreover, it was impossible to contemplate with-drawing our Forces before the future of the Ruhr and the Rhine-land was settled. With regard to dollar expenditure, it was truethat it had been agreed that all exports from Germany should bepaid for in dollars, but the first charge on these dollars was the costof supplies for Germany.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet should take an early opportunity of discussing the general question of our commitments in connection with the occupation of Germany, and he would con-sider how this matter might best be presented to them. For thepurposes of the estimates, however, he felt that the assumptionsmade by the Defence Committee should be adopted.Other points in discussion were : 1(f) Was any comparison possible between the proportion ofUnited Kingdom man-power and economic resources devoted to the armed Forces and the corresponding proportions in the UnitedStates, the U.S.S.R. and France?The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that, while it was difficultto give precise figures, it was clear that the Soviet Government were seeking to build up a powerful Navy. He himself felt considerable doubt about the assumption in paragraph 4 (a) (iii) of CP. (46) 65that no fleet cajDable of being a menace to our security would existduring the next few years.ip) Although the figure of  1,091 millions was twice what hadbeen contemplated by the Coalition Government as the normal peace-time expenditure on the Forces, it should be borne in mind thatthere had been an increase in the level of prices, and that improvedrates of pay and allowances would be payable from July 1946.Moreover, the rate of expenditure would be falling over the year.The Coalition Government had never expected that a level of defence expenditure of  500 millions a year would be reached within sixteenmonths after the end of the war.(c) The Foreign Secretary said that, while he agreed that the cuts should be based on the assumption that a considerable numberof our commitments would be liquidated in the course of the year,it was most important from the point of view of our foreign policy that we should not now make any statement implying that we shouldsoon be reducing substantially our Forces in Europe. For thisreason he was opposed to any suggestion that the White paper should show in detail the assumed rate of reduction of our Forcesthroughout 1946.(d) The Secretary of State for India said that he accepted the cuts proposed on the understanding that reserves would be availableto deal with any serious situation which might arise in India in thenear future.&quot; &apos;      &apos; . S&quot;(e) The Lord President suggested that steps might be taken tobring our balance of payments difficulties to the attention of Com-manders abroad in order that they might seek by any means in their powers to reduce the expenditure on Forces overseas.
The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that he proposed&quot;to discuss this point at a conference of Commanders which was being held in March; and The Prime Minister said that, in the meantime,he would send a confidential message to Commanders on this subject.(/) The Minister of Education asked whether it would not bepossible to make a statement at a very early date about the period for which new entrants under the National Service Act would becalled up. The present uncertainty made it very difficult for localeducation authorities to make plans for further education and forthe training of teachers.It was explained that the Man-Power Committee would reportto the Cabinet on this point at an early date.After further discussion, in the course of which it was agreed tomake a number of drafting amendments in the draft White Paper,the Cabinet (1) Approved the conclusions of the Defence Committee on defence policy in 1946, as set out in paragraphs 4 and 5of CP. (46) 65.(2) Subj ect to the amendments agreed on in discussion, approved the publication of the draft White Paper annexed to cp. (46) 65.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would send a confidentialmessage to Commanders abroad drawing their attentionto the need for rigorous economy in our overseas military expenditure, in view of our balance of payments difficulties.(4) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange, in con-sultation with the Foreign Secretary, to bring before theCabinet the question of our commitments in connectionwith the occupation of Germany.7. The Prime Minister circulated to the Cabinet the draft ofa statement which he proposed to make on the following dayannouncing the decision that the Secretary of State for India, thePresident of the Board of Trade and the First Lord of theAdmiralty should go out to India to conduct, in association withthe Viceroy, the forthcoming negotiations on the constitutional problem. A similar statement would be made in the House of Lordsby the Secretary of State for India.The Prime Minister said that he proposed to add to this draft a final paragraph explaining the arrangements for supervising thework of these Ministers&apos; Departments while they were away. he himself proposed to look after the Admiralty. The Lord president would take charge of the Board of Trade. The India and BurmaOffices would be in charge of the Parliamentary Under-Secretaryof State, who would refer major questions to the Prime Minister,as necessary.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of the terms of the statements to be made in Parliament on the following day.8. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord President(CP. (46) 54) covering a report by the committee of officialsappointed, in pursuance of the Cabinet&apos;s decision of the 6th Decem-ber, to draw up a detailed plan for a central organisation to handleGovernment publicity.The Lord President said that the report recommended theappointment of two Ministerial committees, with a common Chair-man, to co-ordinate home and overseas publicity respectively. these committees would be served by two corresponding official committees.
The chairman of the Home Information Services Official Committee Iwould be the head of the proposed Central Office of Information IThe Foreign Secretary had proposed that the Parliamentary Under-secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should be chairman of the IOverseas Information Services Committee; and the Lord President I said that, while he would have preferred a Central Office of Informa-1tion chairman, he was agreeable to Mr. McNeil being chairman ia 1view of his personal qualifications and without prejudice to any jfuture appointment. Arrangements would be made for Departmentsnot represented on the committees to send representatives whenevermatters affecting them were under consideration; and copies of thecommittee papers would be sent to all interested Departments.The report of the Official Committee suggested that the central office of Information should be a separate Department with a vote of its own.   The non-departmental Minister who was Chairmanof the Ministerial Committees would be responsible for ensuring that the Office was efficiently managed, while the Estimate for jthe Office would be defended in Parliament by Treasury Ministers, Iwho would also answer any Questions about the staffing of the Office.&apos; IThe Lord President&apos; said that, in his view, it would be essentialto reveal to Parliament which non-departmental Minister was Chair-man of the Ministerial Committees and was responsible generallyfor the efficiency of the Central Office, though this need not entaildivulging the membership of the Ministerial Committees.   Thefunctions of the Central Office were set out in paragraph 50 of thereport.   Departments would be expected to use the services of theOffice except where they considered that any particular task which Iwould normally fall within its scope could be better performed by Ithemselves, in which case they would be free to make proposals to ithat effect. Departmental information divisions should be kept small 1and of good quality.  The heads of these divisions should be brought 1into policy-making discussions and should have access to the IPermanent Head of the Department and, where necessary, to theMinister himself.Points in discussion were : (a) It would be convenient if Ministers who were members ofthe proposed Ministerial Committees could on occasion berepresented at meetings of the Committees by their parliamentary secretaries.(6) The Minister of Education and The Minister of Health 1suggested that they should be represented on the Home information services Ministerial Committee.(c) The Minister of Labour suggested that the Ministry ofLabour should be represented on the Overseas Information ServicesOfficial Committee in view of their responsibilities in connectionwith the International Labour Organisation.(d) The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he hoped that departments would be given reasonable freedom to carry outparticular tasks through their own staff rather than through theCentral Office of Information.(e) It was suggested that there would be criticism in Parlia- Iment of the proposal to incorporate publicity work in foreign 1countries in the Foreign Service. The Foreign Secretary said that 1he would hope to meet this criticism by overhauling the arrange- appointments for publicity abroad and by adopting a flexible scheme which would meet the varying needs in different parts of the world.(/) The Foreign Secretary said that he had given an under- Itaking to consult the British Council before any decision on their future was announced. He was unwilling to do this until a decision Iwas reached on the alternatives set out in paragraphs 32 to 42 Iof the official report, but he hoped that thereafter he would have an Iopportunity of consulting the British Council before any public jannouncement was made.
The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that a Central Office of Information should beestablished, on the lines proposed in the report annexed to CP. (46) 54; and approved the recommendations forthe establishment of Ministerial and Official information services Committees;(2) Approved the proposed expenditure on information services for the year 1946-47, as set out in paragraph 49 of thereport annexed to CP. (46) 54;(3) Agreed to resume at their next meeting discussion of theremaining recommendations in the report.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,18th February, 1946.
