National 1.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinisterHealth of Health (CP. (46) 3) covering the heads of the proposed NationalService.. Health Service Bill.The Minister- of Health said that he wished to enter into had discussions with the main interests concerned on the basis that no concessions could be made on the main principles of his scheme.Within these principles, however, there would be scope for adjust-ment, e.g., on such matters as the composition of the regional hospital Boards or the governing bodies of teaching hospitals, orthe extent to which general practitioners should be permitted to takeprivate patients. The knowledge that a general reconstruction ofthe health services was impending was creating uncertainty andconfusion and it was most important that the Bill should be pub-lished as soon as possible. He would, therefore, like to have authority to begin the drafting of the Bill immediately with a viewto introducing it in March.The following points were raised in discussion : -(a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that the cabinet had invited him on the 20th December to consider with the health ministers the financial implications of these proposals in the generalframework of the financial relations between the Exchequer and thelocal authorities. It had not yet been possible to make much progress with this review, and he regarded it as essential that in the dis-cussions on which the Health Ministers were about to embark theyshould not hold out any hope to local authorities that the proposed transfer of the hospital service would lead to any net reduction inthe rate burden.The Minister of Health said that he accepted the point madeby the Chancellor of the Exchequer.(b) The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that, as theMinister of Health would be accountable to Parliament for theexpenditure incurred by Regional Hospital Boards, each board would have to have an accounting officer responsible to the Ministerof Health.The Minister of Health said that he did not dissent from this,provided that the Boards were left with reasonable freedom withinthe limits of their approved annual budgets. He proposed to institute a system of comparative costing which would, in his view,be one of the most effective ways of checking extravagance. He alsohoped to reduce expenditure materially by developing the centralpurchase of hospital supplies.(c) Under the Minister&apos;s proposals a general practitioner coulddevote himself entirely to private practice, and even general practi-practitioners engaged in the National Service would not be precluded from taking private patients. It was important to ensure thatthis continuance of private practice should not prejudice the successof the national scheme. The whole community would be entitledto treatment under the public service. The aim should, therefore,be to create conditions in which the overwhelming majority wouldtake advantage of those facilities, and to provide the maximumincentive to practitioners to devote themselves wholly to the national health Service. For this reason it would be preferable, in presentingthis new plan to the public, to emphasise its universality and to avoid the phrase, used in paragraph 10 of CP. (46) 3, &quot; for all personswishing to take advantage of it.&quot;- With the same object, it wouldbe helpful if it could be provided that any insured persons whofailed to select a doctor should be allocated not, as at present, among all the general practitioners in the area but to those practitionerswho were practising in co-operation with a group of colleagues ina Health Centre.The Minister of Health said that, while it would, in his view,be impossible to prohibit doctors from devoting themselves whollyto private practice or from taking private patients while engaged(previous reference:CM. (45) 65thConclusions,Minute 3.)
in the National Service, he appreciated the importance of avoiding &quot;any impression that better treatment might be obtained privately-than within the National Service. The remedy was to provide and maintain a very high standard of treatment under the NationalService. He was convinced that, as the Health Centres developed,it would become obvious that with their pooled resources and up-to-date equipment they could provide better treatment than the singleprivate practitioner.(d) It was suggested that it should be made a condition ofemployment of general practitioners in the National Service thatthey should take refresher courses from time to time.(e) Attention was drawn to the need for fixing the remuneration of doctors in the National Service at a level sufficient to attract thebest men in the profession; and also to the need for proper incentives to continued efficiency among doctors remunerated wholly from public funds.The Minister of Health agreed that the remuneration must be such as to attract the right type of man into the public service.On the question of incentives, he pointed out that remunerationwould be only partly by basic salary and partly by a capitation ratefor all the patients on the doctor&apos;s list. Thus, some financial incen-tive would remain, though it was his hope that in time the basicsalary element would become more and more important as grouppractice developed. Doctors would then become subject, as theyhad not been in the past, to the pressure of opinion within theirprofession, and this would operate as an incentive to continuedefficiency. In addition, there would, of course, be the usual adminis-trative controls to prevent a doctor from neglecting his patients.(/) The Minister of Health said that it would be his aim todevelop the maximum flexibility and mobility within the consultantservice in order to ensure that no patients in any part of the country would be denied the best specialist advice and to secure the dissemination of the latest methods of treatment throughout the hospitals.(g) Attention was drawn to the proposals, in paragraph 3 of cp. (46) 3, regarding the composition of Hospital management committees. Was it contemplated that these should always include representatives of the local authorities? In some parts of thecountry there were wide areas in which there were no local authorityhospitals; and it would be unfortunate if in such areas the hospital management Committees included representatives nominated bylocal authorities who had no experience of hospital management,especially if this led to the exclusion from the Committees of people with extensive local experience in the management of voluntary hospitals.The Minister of Health explained that it was not proposed togive every local health authority a right to nominate members ofthese Committees. The composition of each Committee would beconsidered on its merits in the light of the circumstances of each area, and it would certainly be his aim to select people who had thebest practical experience of hospital management.In reply to a further question, the Minister said that it was his intention that Trade Unions should be represented on the regional Hospital Boards.(h) Was it the intention that the industrial medical services,which were highly organised in certain industries such as coal-mining, should be merged into the new National Health Service ?It was explained that this was not intended. When the new service had been established, there would have to be close consulta-tion between the Health Departments and the Departments respon-sible for industrial medical services with a view to ensuring thatthe latter were properly dovetailed into the Health Service, and someadjustments might then have to be made.
The Cabinet-(1) Approved the heads of the National Health Service Bill,as annexed to CP. (46) 3.(2) Authorised the Minister of Health to proceed with thepreparation of the Bill.British 2.   The Foreign Secretary reported that the GuatemalanHonduras.       Government had revived their long-standing claims to BritishDispute with    Honduras.  Various attempts which had been made in the past toGuatemala.      settle this question had failed.   The dispute was of a kind which under Article 36 of the United Nations Charter should be decided by the new International Court of Justice.   Accordingly, with theconcurrence of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, he sought theapproval of the Cabinet to inform the Guatemalan Governmentthat, as soon as the Court was constituted, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would declare that they accepted its jurisdiction in all legaldisputes regarding the boundaries of British Honduras.     He, proposed also to refer to the matter in his speech at the forthcoming meeting of the United Nations Assembly.The Cabinets-Approved the course which the Foreign Secretary proposedto follow in this matter.U.N.R.R.A. 3.   Reference was made to a statement made by Lieut.-Statement by General Sir Frederick Morgan at a recent Press conference inGeneral Germany regarding the problem of Jewish refugees in Europe.morsan- The Foreign Secretary said that this matter was not of directconcern to His Majesty&apos;s Government, as General Morgan was inthe service of U.N.R.R.A. According to his information, however,it had been General Morgan&apos;s intention to make it clear that it wasbeyond the scope of U.N.R.R.A. to deal with the vast and complexproblem of Jewish refugees. Unfortunately he had included in his statement remarks which had been quoted out of their context bythe Press and had caused a storm of comment in America. TheForeign Secretary had taken steps to suggest to the U.N.R.R.A.authorities in Washington that it would be expedient to hold someenquiry with a view to establishing the facts before pressing thesuggestion that General Morgan should resign his appointment. Hewas a good administrator who had done excellent work forU.N.R.R.A. and they could ill afford to lose his services.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,8th January, 1946.
