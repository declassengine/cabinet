2. The Prime Minister said that legislation would have tobe introduced in this country to provide for the development andcontrol of atomic energy. The Bill had been drafted, and its early introduction would strengthen the position of our representative on the Atomic Energy Commission of the United Nations Organisa-tion, and would also assist our negotiations with the United StatesGovernment. The Parliamentary time-table was, however, so con-gested that it was doubtful whether the Bill could pass into law before the end of the present Session. He proposed that the Billshould be introduced and given a Second Reading. If it proved impossible to pass it through all its stages before the end of thepresent Session, it could be re-introduced at the beginning of thenext Session.The Minister of Health said that his Department might haveto promote legislation on the medical aspects of this question.Was it intended that this legislation should also be introduced atan early date ? The Prime Minister-Suggested that the Minister ofHealth might consult with the Minister of Supply on this point.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Atomic Energy Bill should be introduced and read a second time in the House of Commons, eventhough it might not be possible to pass it through all its stages before the end of the present Session.3. The Cabinet considered the Report (CP. (48) 137) of theCommittee appointed, by their decision of the 17th December, 1945,to review the available evidence as to the re-emergence of a Fascistmovement in this country, and to consider the case for amending the existing law with a view to checking the growth of such a movement.The Lord Chancellor said that the Committee had reached thefollowing conclusions :  (i) There was no evidence that a Fascist movement on any considerable scale had emerged, or was likely to emerge, in thiscountry;(ii) There was no need to amend the law to check the growth of such a movement;(iii) The resources available under the existing law weresufficient, if resolutely applied; and the authorities should see thatthose resources were applied in such a way as to remove fromthe police and from the authorities themselves all possible suspicion of . Fascist sympathies;(iv) Any announcements of Government policy on this question,in reply to Parliamentary Questions or otherwise, should be basedon the statement annexed to the Committee&apos;s Report.Points in discussion were :  (a) It was suggested that clear evidence might now be obtain-able to show that in the period between the wars the British Unionof Fascists had derived part of their income from the ItalianGovernment. If so, there was much to be said for making thispublic possibly in reply to a Parliamentary Question. A public statement on this point could be made independently of any general statement of policy about the re-emergence of a Fascist movement inthis country.1. The Chancellor of the Exchequer communicated to theCabinet particulars of the proposals in the forthcoming Budget.In accordance with precedent, details are not recorded in theCabinet Conclusions.
(b) The Prime Minister said that, in his view, it . was unnecessary for the Government to volunteer at the present time a general statement of policy on the lines of the draft annexed to CP. (46) 137 though parts of that draft might be used as abasis for replies to any Parliamentary Questions which might beasked on these matters. There was general agreement with thePrime Minister&apos;s view on this point.The Cabinet-Subject to the point noted in paragraph (6) above, took note with approval of the Report (CP. (46) 137) by theCommittee on Fascism.ProsperityCampaign.(previous reference erence:CM. (46) 13thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Labour (CP. (46) 122) to which was annexed a list of points raised at the conferences held in London with trade union executivesand representatives of employers&apos; organisations as part of the prosperity campaign.The Minister of Labour said that, from experience gained atthe two conferences and at other conferences held in provincialcentres, he was satisfied that it would be expedient to continue the campaign to bring home the facts of the economic and man-power situation to those engaged in industry and to the public generally.In particular, he recommended the publication of a White Paperputting together some of the facts given to the two conferences bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Boardof Trade, together with the man-power figures, and suggested that further statements should be issued periodically showing in sum-mary form what progress had been made.Discussion showed that there was general support for the viewthat the campaign should continue, and that further factual informa-tion should be published as proposed by the Minister. The sugges-tion was made that this might be presented in a more popular formthan a White Paper. On the other hand, it was pointed out thatthe Steering Committee on Economic Development were about tosubmit to Ministers a draft of a White Paper on the economic survey for 1946-47 which would cover much the same ground.In paragraph 3 (iv) of CP. (46) 122 it was suggested that consideration might be given to the possibility of fixing national production targets for various industries. It was the view of theCabinet that it would be dangerous to do this, though individual firms might be encouraged to fix production targets for their ownworkers.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the campaign to bring home the facts of theeconomic and man-power situation should continue andthat the details should be worked out by the committeeof officials appointed by the Cabinet at their meetingon the 7th February to co-ordinate the arrangements forthe original campaign under the general supervision ofthe Lord President.(2) Agreed, subject to consideration of the proposal of the steering Committee on Economic Development for thepublication of a White Paper on the Economic survey for 1946-47, that a suitable selection of the facts givenby the Government spokesmen at the conferences with trade union executives and representatives of employers&apos;organisations should be published in popular form.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,8th April, 1946.
