1. The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the business which it was proposed to take in the House of Commons during&quot;the following week.It had now been agreed that the Second Reading of theNational Insurance Bill should be continued until 6-30 p.m. onthe 11th February. The Lord Privy Seal would reply to the debate.The Second Reading of the Trade Disputes and Trade unions bill would be taken on the 12th and 13th February. The debate would be opened by the Attorney-General. The other government speakers would be the Foreign Secretary, the Minister of Labourand the President of the Board of Trade. The Lord President saidthat he would offer to take the Committee stage on the floor ofthe House, on the ground that the Bill&apos; was of some constitutionalimportance.On the 14th February there would be a general debate on world Food Supplies. It was agreed that this debate should be opened by the Minister of Food and answered by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer.On the 15th February there would be a debate, on a government motion, on Agricultural Policy. The Speaker would be consulted about the terms of the Motion; to ensure that Members should havereasonable latitude in debate and should be able to discuss questionsinvolving future legislation.2. The Prime Minister said that, in the debate on world food supplies on the 14th February, it would be necessary for the Govern-ment to make some further statement on the supply of dried eggsin 1946. Some critics were suggesting that further supplies ofdried eggs should be imported at the expense of tobacco or films.Could the Chancellor of the Exchequer deal with these matters inthe debate ?The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Ministry of Foodhad included in their proposed import programme for 1946 a totalof 24,000 tons of domestic dried eggs from the United States, at a cost of $70 millions. They had obtained Treasury authority at thebeginning of the year to buy 12,000 tons on account; but they had found that 4,000 tons were already available from the pipe-line and this meant that under their existing authority they could notplace fresh orders for more than 8,000 tons. This amount wouldnot be large enough to ensure that the packers in the United Statesmaintained their capacity and there was a risk that, if we subse-quently found that our dollar position enabled us to order more, weshould not be able to obtain it. In these circumstances the Chan-cellor of the Exchequer was now prepared to authorise the Ministryof Food to order on account a further 6,000 tons. This should serve to hold the supply position until we were able to consider our import programmes for 1946 as a whole and possibly until we knew the reactions of Congress to the proposed Loan Agreement.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it would be unwisefor the Cabinet, or Parliament, to discuss in isolation particularsupplies affecting the general question of our balance of payments.Our dollar purchases must be considered as a whole. He was pro-posing to submit to the Cabinet in the following week a paper onour import programmes for 1946 in the light of our prospectivebalance of payments, and he suggested that further discussion ofthe possibility of obtaining increased supplies of dried eggs shouldbe deferred until that paper was available. Meanwhile, be would discuss the matter with the Minister of Food.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consult withthe Minister of Food on the question of supplies of driedeggs in 1946, and to submit a report to the Cabinet forconsideration at their meeting on the 11th February.&apos;-1] * 2
(2) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would alsosubmit, for consideration at the same meeting, a paperreviewing the import programmes for 1946 in the lightof our prospective balance of payments.Man-Powerand economic survey for1956.(previous reference:CM. (45) 58thConclusions,Minute 5.)3.   The Cabinet had before them -(i) a memorandum by the Foreign Secretary (CP. (46) 35)reporting on behalf of the Man-Power Committee onthe man-power position during 1946;(ii) a   memorandum by the Lord President  (CP. (46) 32)covering an Economic Survey for 1946, prepared underthe guidance of the Official Steering Committee onEconomic Development; and(iii) a note by the Lord President (CP. (48) 40) showing how the cuts proposed by the Defence Committee in man-&apos; power in the Services or engaged on production for theServices would affect the economic resources of theUnited Kingdom during 1946.The Lord President said that the Steering Committee had produced a most valuable Economic Survey for 1946. The survey was necessarily on an experimental basis and, until it was projectedfurther into the future, could not form the basis for a long-term economic plan. Arrangements had, however, been made to projectit into 1947 and the possibility of making a survey for a post-transition year, say, 1950, was also being examined.The outstanding fact revealed by the Survey was that, on thebasis of existing policies and programmes, there would be a man-power shortage of 1-3 million at the end of 1946, while for theyear 1946 as a whole Departmental demands would exceed theavailable national income by at least  470 million. Since the survey had been made, the Defence Committee had decided thatfor planning purposes it should be assumed that at the end of 1946Service strengths would not exceed 1,200,000 and the labour forceengaged on production for the Forces would not exceed 650,000.The effect of this on our economic resources was shown in the annex to CP. (46) 40. Owing to the delay in reducing the man-powerengaged on production for the Forces, there would be no reductionin the estimated gap of  470 million between national income andexpenditure unless the man-power cuts could be made early inthe year. Supplementary measures would therefore be required to close the gap. It wrould be difficult to impose further restrictionson civil consumption and, in these circumstances, the most promisingcourse would be to maintain a careful control of public and private investment during 1946.The flow of labour into the distributive trades was likely to involve a relative waste of resources, but, in the absence of extensivelabour controls, it was difficult to see what could be done to curb this tendency.The Lord President said that he had considered whether the survey should be published, but had come to the conclusion that, as this was a first experimental survey and as the Government couldnot accompany it with any statement of their machinery for economic planning, publication would be undesirable. Some state-ment should, however, be made which would indicate in broad terms the nature of the economic problems which the nation had to over-come in 1946. He had arranged for the draft of such a statement to be prepared and he hoped to bring it before the Cabinet in thefollowing week.The President of the Board of Trade drew attention to thestatement in paragraph 26 on page 26 of the Economic Survey tothe effect that it nad been assumed that expenditure on clothingby the end of 1946 would be equivalent to a basic ration of 70coupons.   This was merely a figure showing the requirement put
forward by the Board of Trade, and Ministers should not assume -that supplies of clothing on anything like this scale would in fact,be available by the end of 1946.The Cabinet then considered the measures recommended in cp. (46) 35 for mitigating the effect of the shortage of man-power in 1946.The Foreign Secretary pointed out that in paragraph 7 (i) of cp. (46) 35 the Man-Power Committee had recommended that thereduction in man-power engaged on. production for the Forces tothe figure of 650,000, which had been approved by the DefenceCommittee for planning purposes, should be carried out in the first six months of 1946 instead of being spread over the whole year. on further consideration, he had come to the conclusion that we couldnot afford to have so large a labour force employed on production for the Forces and he suggested the substitution of a target figureof 500,000. A drastic cut in the production of equipment for theForces at the present time might well be to the ultimate advantageof the Forces, since they would be able to re-equip themselves laterwith more up-to-date weapons.The Minister of Supply and of Aircraft Production said thatthe production programmes which were being carried out were those determined by the Defence Committee and were within the agreed man-power allocations. While further reductions could nodoubt be made if the Defence Committee agreed on additional cutsin the programmes, it should be borne in mind that it was essentialto maintain an adequate war potential in each section of production.Although there had been initial delays, good progress was nowbeing made with the production of civil aircraft.The Prime Minister said that he had asked the service ministers to cut clown their demands for new production by drawing more extensively on accumulated stocks.The Secretary of State for War said that the Service Ministersdid not question the principle that all possible use should be madeof existing stocks. It had to be remembered, however, that we were responsible for providing supplies and equipment, not only for ourown Forces, but also for certain Allied Forces such as the polish army.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, in addition to examining the proposal of theMan-Power Committee that the man-power engaged on production for the Forces should be reduced to 650,000by June 1948, the Defence Committee should alsoexamine the possibility of reducing programmes stillfurther so as to conform to a target figure of 500,000,instead of 650,000.^(2) Took note that the Service Ministers would make everyeffort to meet the needs of the Forces from stocks ratherthan from new production, and would submit to thePrime Minister reports showing the extent to which new production orders were arising from commitments tofurnish supplies and equipment to Allied forces.Publicity The Prime Minister drew attention to the proposals in para-Campaign, graphs 7 (ii) and 8 of CP. (46) 35 for an appeal to women and olderworkers to remain at work and an appeal to industry to increase output. It seemed desirable that these appeals should be made afterthe general statement about the economic position of the countryin 1946, which was suggested in paragraph 11 of CP. (46)32, andafter the publication of the revised figures of Service strengths.The proposed campaign might begin with a general broadcast, andit would probably be advisable to consult the Opposition in advance in order to avoid any risk of the broadcast being regarded as apolitical statement. The general arrangements for the campaignmight be co-ordinated by the Lord President, with the assistance ofa small committee of officials.Beduction inMan-PowerEngagedon theProduction ofSupplies andEquipmentfor theForces.
Control of investment.increased efficiency.labour controls.The Minister of Labour said that he had already madepreliminary arrangements for the National Conference of TradeUnion Executives and the Conference of Employers proposed inparagraph 8 of CP. (46) 35. It would be most helpful if the PrimeMinister could see his way to address these conferences. TheMinistry of Labour would also make any necessary arrangementsfor appeals to women and older workers to remain at work. Theseappeals would have to be on a local basis.The Foreign Secretary said that, if the proposed Conference ofTrade Union Executives was to be effective, it was essential thatthe Press should be excluded. There could be separate conferencesat which the Governments proposals could be explained to the Press.The Cabinet-(3) Gave general approval to the proposals for publicity set-out in paragraphs 8 and 7 (i) of GP. (46) 35; , and agreed that an official committee should be appointedto co-ordinate the arrangements for the campaign underthe general.supervision of the Lord President.The Prime Minister drew attention to the suggestion made inparagraph 9 of CP. (46) 32 that during 1946 there should be a careful scrutiny of investment projects, both public and private. it seemed clearly necessary that less essential projects, particularlyin areas of labour shortage, should be postponed; and it seemed desirable that some machinery should be set up for this purpose.The Chancellor of the Exchequer supported this suggestion andstressed the importance of distinguishing between areas of labour shortage, where a minimum of new worlds should be undertaken,and areas of unemployment, where it was desirable that Depart-ments should press on with capital expenditure.The Cabinet-(4) Invited the Lord President to arrange for the OfficialSteering Committee on Economic Development to submit proposals for ensuring that during 1946 less essentialinvestment projects were postponed in areas of labour shortage.The Minister of Fuel and Power asked whether sufficient atten-tion was being paid to.means of increasing productive efficiency in industry. He had already made arrangements for an enquiry into production efficiency in the mining industry, but he suggested thatthe problem should be considered on a wider basis.The President of the Board of Trade explained that one of the primary tasks of the Working Parties which had now been set upfor 15 different industries was to study the methods of increasingthe efficiency of production. He was also developing a productionefficiency service in the Board of Trade, which would be availableto give advice to industrialists.The Minister of supply and of Aircraft Production said that similar action was being taken in the motor manufacturing indusnvand in other branches of the engineering industry.Attention was also drawn to the importance of improving pi-o-duction methods in the food industries and the building materialsindustries.The Cabinet-(5) Agreed that the Ministers concerned should take all possible steps to secure improvements in production methods in industries for which they were responsible.The Minister of Fuel and Power pointed out that in view of thewithdrawal of labour controls it would be increasingly difficult to implement man-power allocations. Thus, as pointed out in para-graph 10 of CP. (46) 32, there might well be a relative waste of resources through the tendency of labour to drift into the distri-butive trades. He also doubted whether we could at present afford to devote so large an amount of man-power to the entertainments
industry. He was concerned about the effect of the Essential WorkOrder on discipline in the coalmining industry and was considering whether it would not be advisable to withdraw the Order in the early summer. Although this might lead to a temporary loss of labour,the ultimate effect on production would probably be good. It would,however, be necessary to retain the guaranteed week.The Minister of Labotir said that it should be borne in mind that a considerable part of the labour force employed on distributionwas engaged in packing and delivering goods; and the Minister ofFood pointed out that, in so far as the delivery of goods could be improved, the present strain on housewives would be relieved.The President of the Board of Trade suggested that the drift oflabour into distribution might have to be prevented by limitingretailers&apos; margins to such an extent as to make it uneconomic forthem to employ the large numbers which were absorbed in distri-butive services before the war.The Minister of Labour referred to the suggestion made inparagraph 7 (iv) of CP. (46) 35 that steps should be taken toincrease the available prisoner of war labour. He had circulated a memorandum (CP. (46) 38) to the Cabinet showing the steps which had been, taken to increase the number of German prisonersof war and he hoped that, as a result of negotiations with the TradeUnions, it would be possible to extend the types of work on whichprisoners of war could be employed.After further discussion, the Cabinet (6) Took note of the interim report of the Man-Power Com-mittee on the man-power position in 1946 and of thememorandum by the Lord President covering theEconomic Survey for 1946 and agreed that action tocarry out the recommendations made in these papersshould proceed on the lines summarised above.4. In connection with the discussion recorded in the preceding minute, attention was drawn to the importance of securing&apos; allpossible economies of man-power in the Civil Service. On the otherhand, it was urged that the work of administration was beingseriously hampered by the lack of adequate staff, particularly inthe junior grades.The Foreign Secretary stressed the importance of improvingconditions of employment in the Civil Service. The level of wages paid to the junior staff (particularly typists) compared unfavourably with wage levels in similar employment outside the Service, and work often had to be carried on in conditions which militatedagainst efficiency. Insufficient attention was given to lighting,amenities, canteens and welfare generally. The result was that,when the Civil Service (Control of Employment) Order was with-drawn, there would be a large exodus of staffs from GovernmentDepartments. He suggested that the Chancellor of exchequer should obtain advice from the Factory Department of the Ministryof Labour on methods of improving conditions of work.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was trying tomeet the needs of Departments who had. to take on additionalresponsibilities by the transfer of staff from the Service and supply departments. With regard to conditions of employment, account must be taken of the difficulties of securing the necessary labour and materials to improve standards of accommodation in GovernmentDepartments. He would be glad, however, to go into the points which had been made in discussion, in consultation with the Ministerof Labour and the Minister of Works.The Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister ofLabour and the Minister of Works to consider means of improving conditions of work in Government Departments.
Timber 5.   The Cabinet considered memoranda by the President of theSupplies. Board of Trade (CP. (46) 41) and the Secretary of State for Scot-land and the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (CP. (46) 47)on the prospects of meeting United Kingdom requirements fortimber in 1946. .The President of the Board of Trade said that, according to thelatest estimates, the total requirements of softwood in 1946 wouldbe 1,305,000 standards, including 655,000 standards for building,and supplies were likely to total 1,280,000 standards. On thesefigures, the prospects were not unsatisfactory; but there were two major uncertainties in the estimates of supplies. First, theyassumed a supply of 250,000 standards from Germany; and it wasearly as yet to he sure that we could build up the organisationrequired to obtain this quantity from Germany m the current year. Secondly, unless the Swedish Government could be assured ofsubstantially increased supplies of coal, they would be obliged to direct their available labour to cutting wood for fuel instead of export. There was little prospect of our being able to send coal from this country to Sweden; and it was, therefore, impracticable to conclude a bi-lateral agreement by which we should get the fullbenefit of any timber which Sweden was enabled to export byreceiving additional coal. We must, therefore, be content with anarrangement for increasing the total export of Swedish timberwhich would increase the pool from which our allocation was drawn.Arrangements had been made for a joint meeting between theEuropean Coal Organisation and the Timber Sub-Committee of theEmergency Economic Committee for Europe to work out a schemefor obtaining increased exports of Swedish timber against increased supplies of coal.The Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Agri-culture said that they were concerned at the statement, in para-graph 7 of CP. (46) 41, that we should continue to fell as muchmining timber as possible in this country, in spite of the inroadswhich this would make on our growing trees. The continued fellingof immature timber for pitprops would damage the home productionof timber for many years to come. They doubted whether sufficientlystrenuous attempts were being made to extract the. maximum supplyof timber from Germany. The President of the Board of Trade saidthat it had hitherto been impossible for the Control Commission,amidst its many other preoccupations, to give full attention to this problem. They were now strengthening their organisation, how-ever, with the assistance of the Director of Timber Production inthis country, and he was satisfied that there would be a substantial improvement after May 1946, in the rate of timber exports fromGermany.Other points made in discussion were : (a) Could timber be obtained from Yugoslavia?The Cabinet were informed that the Yugoslav Government hadbeen invited to send a mission to this country to discuss this possibility.The Foreign Secretary suggested that the President of theBoard of Trade might take the opportunity of discussing thisquestion with M. Kardelj. the Vice-Prime Minister of Yugoslavia,while he was in London for the First General Assembly of theUnited Nations Organisation. The Foreign Secretary had heard that one of our timber firms might be willing to establish sawmills in yugoslavia; and, on general grounds, he would welcome there-opening of trade connections between this country and Yugoslavia.(&amp;) There was also a possibility of obtaining supplies from roumania. There was a good deal of timber there which hadbeen felled to the order of a Swiss firm and was awaiting transport;and attempts were being made to acquire these supplies.(c) For improvement in the long-term prospects we must relymainly on re-opening our pre-war sources of supply from Russia
and Finland. The President of the Board of Trade said thathe had been discussing this possibility with MM. Vyshinsky andSergeev. The first step must be to secure a settlement of our wartrading accounts with the Soviet Government. He had indicated that, if the Soviet Government were prepared to reach a settlement,he would be ready to go to Moscow to clear this matter up. once this was cleared there would be some prospect of obtaining timber supplies from Russia.The Cabinet-Took note of the report by the President of the Board ofTrade on the prospective supplies of timber in 1946.6.   The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda : CP. (46) 36 by the Minister of War Transport, on theprospects of dry cargo shipping tonnage for 1946;CP. (46) 42 by the Minister of War Transport, on our shipping relations with other countries in the early part of1946;CP. (46) 27 by the Minister of Food, on shippingrequirements for the import of food supplies into the UnitedKingdom during the early months of 1946.The Minister1 of War Transport said that, apart from UnitedStates tonnage on bare-boat charter, we were likely to have at our disposal during 1946 15-1 million dead weight tons of effectiveshipping, after deducting 10 per cent, for tonnage awaiting orundergoing repair. Out of this, no less than 4-5 million deadweight tons were allocated for naval and military services, and,after meeting other high priority demands, there would remain only6 - 6 million dead weight tons for United Kingdom imports and exports. Supplemented by small ships and foreign tonnage, thisshould give us an import of 29 million tons in 1946, as against atotal of 35 million tons required by the importing Departments.This position would be eased if we were able to retain for a sub-stantial part of the year the 3 million dead weight tons of United. States shipping which we now had on bare-boat charter. The UnitedStates Administration had not yet, however, obtained from Congresspowers to charter surplus American ships for operation underforeign flags. If we were unable to charter, we might be forcedin the last resort to consider the purchase of some United Statesships. He would, however, be most reluctant to recommend theCabinet to have recourse to any large-scale purchase of surplusships from the United States, partly because of the repercussionswhich this would have on our own shipbuilding programme, andpartly because it would tend to leave us with an even larger pro-portion of obsolescent ships at a time when we should be meetingstrong foreign competition in shipping.The situation disclosed by this review pointed to the need forsecuring every practical economy in the use of our available shipping in 1946. Economies should be sought, in the first instance, throughfurther measures to reduce the average amount of tonnage awaitingor undergoing repair, and through further scrutiny of service requirements for shipping.The Cabinet first considered the question of repairs. Thefollowing suggestions were made in the discussion : i(a) During the Battle of the Atlantic a system had beenadopted by which ships in need of repair had signalled their needs to the United Kingdom port for which they were bound. This had enabled preparations to be made before their arrival; and, wherever possible, repairs had been carried out while the ship was dischargingher cargo. This had secured a considerable saving of time in the turn-round.It was suggested that this system might have been abandonedsince the end of hostilities. If so, it might with advantage bere-introduced.
(b) Good results might be obtained through the establishingof regular means of consultation between the Admiralty and ministry of War Transport and the Dock Managers at the principalports. It was suggested that in the past there had been sometendency to rely exclusively on the shipowners for help in expediting the repair and turn-round of ships.(c) While the shortage of shipping continued, repairs should be restricted to the minimum necessary for efficient operation.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the First Lord of the Admiralty would consult with the Minister of War Transport and theMinister of Labour with a view to reducing the amountof merchant shipping withdrawn from effective servicethroughout the year on account of repairs.The Cabinet next considered the possibility of reducing service requirements for shipping.There was general agreement that, in view of the importanceof carrying through the demobilisation programme, there was little prospect of reducing the numbers of ships allocated to the services for trooping. There should, however, be room for economy in other service uses of shipping. Reference was made, in particular, tothe size of the Fleet Train in the Pacific. The Civil Lord of theAdmiralty said that plans had already been made to reduce thisfrom 314,000 gross registered tons to 195,500 gross registered tonsby June 1946, and that the total amount of merchant shipping to be surrendered by the Admiralty during the year was nearly500,000 tons. It was the general view of the Cabinet that therewas room for still further reduction in the size of the Fleet Train.The Prime Minister said that he had already asked the service ministers to undertake a searching review of their shipping require-ments; and, when their reports were&apos; available, he would arrangefor them to be considered by the Defence Committee.The Cabinet -(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for theDefence Committee to consider at an early meetingmeans of reducing the existing demands of the services for merchant shipping.Import and The President of the Board of Trade said that he feared thereExport might be a shortage of shipping for exports, both overall and forProgrammes, particular destinations. The volume of goods produced for exportwas now beginning to rise sharply; and, in view of the lack of sufficient storage accommodation, a serious situation would arise ifshipment was substantially delayed. He would welcome theestablishment of machinery for regular consultation between his department and the Ministry of War Transport on this matter.The Cabinet (3) Invited the Minister of War Transport to consider, inconsultation with the other Ministers concerned,. what further machinery was required to ensure regular con-sultation between his Department and the Board ofTrade, the Ministry of Supply and the Ministry of Foodregarding the provision of shipping for the UnitedKingdom import and export programmes.service requirements.CivilAviation.BermudaConference.(previous reference:CM. (46) 11thConclusions,Minute 8.)7. At their meeting on the 4th February the Cabinet had invited the Civil Aviation Committee to consider any outstanding points on the draft Air Transport Agreement which had emerged from the Anglo-American civil aviation discussions at Bermuda.The Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs (CP (46) 44) setting outthe conclusions reached by the Civil Aviation Committee.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs recalled that themain difficulty which the Cabinet had felt over accepting the
proposed &quot;Air Transport Agreement was the unwillingness of the -United States Government to accept the principle of &quot;no changeof gauge.&quot; The Committee had been informed that, even if we&quot;agreed to allow change of gauge, the terms of the draft agreement were such as to preclude American operators from running fromthis country a larger number of aircraft than would be necessary toprovide accommodation for passengers brought to this country fromthe United States who wished to proceed to a further destination,though it would, of course, be open to operators to fill up any surplusseats with Fifth Freedom traffic. The Committee had felt, however,that this should be made clear beyond doubt and they had accordingly despatched a telegram to the United Kingdom dele-gation at Bermuda instructing them to press for the insertion inthe Agreement of a clause on the lines set out in paragraph 3 of cp. (46) 44. The Committee recommended that, if the delegation were unable to secure this, the Cabinet should accept the less satis-factory course of embodying the clause in an exchange of letterswhich would be published along Math the Agreement and would form part of the Final Act.The Committee had also considered certain difficulties whichhad arisen in connection with the negotiation of a Leased BasesAgreement with the United States Government. Negotiations forthis Agreement had been proceeding concurrently with the discus-sions on the Air Transport Agreement, and it was the desire of theUnited States Government that the two Agreements should be linkedtogether. They had proposed, however, that the Leased EasesAgreement should include (i) an undertaking that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would use their good offices to persuade newfoundland and Canada to agree to American air-field requirements in New-foundland and Labrador, and (ii) a stipulation that all civil aircraftusing the bases should obtain their supplies from the United states military authorities. Both these proposals were unacceptable, and,with the agreement of the Prime Minister, a telegram had beensent to Lord Halifax asking him to make it plain to the state department that if they were not withdrawn we must press for the separation of the Leased Bases Agreement from the Air TransportAgreement. Since then he had had an opportunity of considering,together with the Secretary of State for the Colonies and theMinister of Civil Aviation, a complete draft of the Leased BasesAgreement, from which it appeared that it contained a number ofother objectionable features; and he had accordingly come to theconclusion that the right course was to inform the State department that it was now clear that a complete separation of the two Agree-ments was unavoidable. He had accordingly sent a further telegram to Lord Halifax in this sense. A meeting of the Civil aviation committee would be held on the following day to consider develop-ments and a further report would thereafter be made to the Cabinet.The President of the Board of Trade suggested that, in view ofthe complicated legal issues involved, the Lord Chancellor should attend any future meetings of the Civil Aviation Committee atwhich the Agreements were being considered.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that, if the position with regard to change of gaugecould be safeguarded on the lines suggested by the CivilAviation Committee, the United Kingdom delegation should be authorised to sign the Air Transport Agree-ment;(2) Endorsed the action taken to inform the United StatesGovernment that the Leased Bases Agreement must be separated from the Air Transport Agreement.

(46) 12th The Chairman had opened the proceedings by suggesting that conclusions.) he himself, with the agreement of the Council, should close the debate by formally declaring that according to the general sense ofthe Council, as expressed in the speeches made, the presence ofBritish troops in Greece did not endanger peace. M. Vyshinskyhad immediately stated that he could not accept this solution. Hehad then proceeded to re-define the attitude of the Soviet Delega-tion. They would not insist on any formal resolution and would agree to a statement by the Chairman. Further, they would not insist that any such statement should mention that the situation in greece constituted a clanger to peace and security, nor would theyinsist on the early withdrawal of the British troops now in Greece.M. Vyshinsky then suggested that the proposed statement by theChairman should take the form of declaring that the security council took note of the declarations made by the Delegates of theSoviet Union, the United Kingdom and Greece, and also took intoaccount 1 the declarations made on behalf of the United States,France, China, Australia, Poland and the Netherlands, and theCouncil declared that the question was closed.The Foreign Secretary said that he had asked for an adjourn-ment in order to consider the exact text of M. Vyshinsky&apos;s proposal;and he had taken advantage of the adjournment, not only to recon-sider the position himself, but also to ascertain the views of theGreek Delegation and of some of the other members of the Council.In the result, he had come to the conclusion that it would be inexpedient to press his original demand and that, having regardto the concessions made in M. Vyshinsky&apos;s speech, he could properlyaccept a declaration by the Chairman in the form finally suggestedby M. Vyshinsky. When the Council&apos;s meeting was resumed, hehad indicated his readiness to accept this formula, and the pro-ceedings had been terminated in this way,.to the general satisfaction of members of the Council.The Prime Minister conveyed to the Foreign Secretary the cabinets congratulations on the skill with which he had handledthis difficult situation.Agricultural 9.   The Minister of Agricuitu-re and Fisheries informed theWages. Cabinet that, after their meeting on the 31st January, letters had(Previous        been sent to the Agricultural Workers&apos; Union, the Farmers&apos; UnionReference:       and the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union suggesting thatCM. (46) 10th   they should meet together to consider the proposal of the Agri-Conclusions,     cultural Wages Board that there should be introduced a system of minute 6.)       graded wage rates for agricultural workers which would giveappropriate recognition to special skill and experience.   these letters had indicated that, if desired, the Ministry of Labour would arrange for one of their conciliation officers to assist in the dis-cussions.   The Farmers&apos; Union had replied that they were willingto consider this proposal if it were understood that the increased costs would be reflected in increased prices.   The agricultural workers&apos; Union had replied that the proposal for graded wage rates had already been considered and rejected by regional con-ferences of the industry.   No reply had yet been received from theTransport and General Workers&apos; Union.   It could be assumed,therefore, that the two sides of the industry were unwilling to cometogether of themselves to discuss this proposal.The Minister said that he had met representatives of the food and Agriculture Committee of the Parliamentary Labour Party,who were dissatisfied with the situation. He and. the Minister ofLabour were to meet the Food and Agriculture Committee that evening; and there were indications that the Committee would press the view that the statements made during the last few clays about
the world shortage of food created a new situation which called for special action in respect of the wages claim of the agricultural workers.There were two alternatives open to the Government. TheMinister of Labour thought that the right course was for him to summon representatives of the three Unions to meet at the Ministryof Labour to discuss the proposal for graded wage rates. The letterspreviously sent to them had assumed that they were willing to meet.It was still open, therefore, for the Minister himself to convene ameeting; and, once they had been brought together, he might beable to prevail upon them to find some solution.Alternatively, the Minister of Agriculture suggested that, ifthe Cabinet considered a more positive approach to be justified, a parliamentary Question might be addressed to him asking whetherit would be appropriate for the Agricultural Wages Board to take account of the world shortage of food as a factor material to anapplication by the agricultural workers for an increase in wages.The Minister suggested that, as the terms of reference of the Boardrequired them to take account of general economic conditions as wellas conditions peculiar to agriculture, he might answer such aQuestion in the affirmative.It was the view of the Cabinet that a statement in parliament on the lines indicated by the Minister of Agriculture would be adirect invitation to the Agricultural Wages Board to grant anincrease in agricultural wages. It would be inexpedient to make such a statement. The right course was to make a further effort toget the two sides of the industry together in search of a solution.The Cabinet-Authorised the Minister of Labour to invite representa-tives of the three Unions to meet with him to consider theproposal of the Agricultural Wages Board for a system ofgraded wage rates.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,7th February, 1946.
