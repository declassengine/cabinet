Eire.Rational 1.   The Cabinet considered a joint memorandum bv the Secre-jnsuranoe. tary of State for Dominion Affairs and the Minister of NationalPayment of Insurance (CP. (46) 108) proposing that arrangements should beUnemployment made to pay unemployment insurance benefit to Eire volunteers whoBenefit to had enlisted in the United Kingdom Forces, and to Eire workersEx-Servicemen who had come to the United Kingdom during the war, if they becameandIndustrial unemployed after their return to Eire-Workers from The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that underthe existing law an Eire volunteer or an Eire worker who becameunemployed after returning to Eire could draw no unemploymentbenefit in respect of the contribution which, had been credited to himor paid by him. In his view, to withhold this benefit from Eirevolunteers was indefensible on merits and would play into the hand of anti-British elements in Eire. The case for paying unemploy-ment benefit to Eire workers seemed to him weaker.The Minister of National Insurance said that, so far as con-cerned Eire volunteers, his proposal was to pay up to 180 days&apos;unemployment benefit. The Government of Eire would act as agents for the payment of the benefit, which would be payable only if theapplicant was able to prove that he could not obtain employment in eire. His proposal regarding the Eire&apos;workers wras that he should pay three-quarters of the workers&apos; own contributions into the Eireunemployment insurance fund, on the understanding that the eire government would contribute an equivalent amount and that themoney thus provided would be used for the benefit of these workers.The Eire Government had pressed the claims of the civilian workersstrongly and had pointed out that, as Eire workers were allowed tocome to the United Kingdom only for limited periods under permitswhich were not renewable if they became unemployed, we had made it virtually impossible for them to claim benefit in the UnitedKingdom.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that these proposals were at variance with the general law, which provided that benefits underthe unemployment insurance scheme should not be payable outsidethe United Kingdom. While be appreciated the need to maintaingood relations with Eire; he saw no justification for the payment ofbenefit to Eire workers, who had received good wages here and badknown when they volunteered, that they would not be entitled to benefit on their return to Eire. He had more sympathy with thosewho had volunteered from Eire for service in the Armed Forces, buthe doubted whether it would be possible to treat the two classesdifferently.The Foreign Secretary said that he was anxious that we shouldnot miss this opportunity to promote closer relations between theUnited Kingdom and Eire. He was satisfied from, his experienceduring the war that the Eire Government, could be relied on to carryout faithfully and efficiently any agreement which might be madewith them. So far as concerned volunteers, he supported theproposal of the Minister of National Insurance that 180 days&apos;-benefit should be payable, but he thought that administrative arrangements should be made under which the payment of benefit would be terminated if the recipient refused a reasonable offer ofsuitable work in the United Kingdom. The position of the civilianworkers was more complicated and it would be desirable to holdfurther discussions between officials of Great Britain, Eire andNorthern Ireland with a view to devising arrangements on a reciprocal basis for the payment of benefit to workers who trans-ferred from one country to the other.In further discussion there was general support for the paymentof unemployment benefit to Eire volunteers on the lines proposed bythe Minister of National Insurance. As regards the civilianworkers, some Ministers urged that in view of the present shortageof man-power the best solution would be to extend the period forwhich these workers were entitled to remain in the United Kingdom[31633-2] b 2
and find work for them here, rather than give them title to thepayment of benefit in Eire. On the other hand, it was argued thatsuch a proposal would be regarded by the Eire Government as anattempt to draw away workers permanently from Eire and that the absorption of large numbers of Eire workers in the United kingdom would, in the long run, give rise to serious social and economic problems here the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would accept thegeneral view of the Cabinet that benefit should be payable to the eire volunteers. As regards the civilian workers, he reserved hisposition pending the results of the discussions suggested by theForeign Secretary.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposal that Eire volunteers who hadenlisted in the United Kingdom Forces should be entitledto payment of unemployment insurance benefit in Eirein respect of any contributions credited to them during their service in the Forces, provided that administrative arrangements were made under which the payment ofbenefit could be terminated if it were possible to offer the recipient suitable employment in the United Kingdom.(2) Invited the Minister of National Insurance, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, theHome Secretary and the Minister of Labour, to arrangefor discussions to be held with officials of the Govern-ments of Eire and Northern Ireland with a view todevising a scheme for the reciprocal payment of unem-ployment benefit to workers who transferred from one country to another. In devising any such scheme regard should&quot; be paid, both to the immediate man-powershortage and also to the long-term problems which might arise if large numbers of Eire workers settledpermanently in the United Kingdom.Parliament. 2.   The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the business business in which it was proposed to take in the House of Commons in thethe House of    following week.Commons. On the 25th March, on the remaining stages of the Consoli-dated Fund Bill, there would be a debate on Housing Components.The Government spokesmen would be the Minister of Works andthe Minister of Supply.On the 28th March, until 7-30 rj.m., there would be a debate on an Opposition Motion about the Liverpool Cotton Market. Itwas agreed that the Government spokesmen in this debate shouldbe the Lord President and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.In his Statement on Business the Lord President would announce that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would open his budget on Tuesday, the 9th April.The Nelson 3.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ChancellorPension. of the Exchequer (CP. (46) 107) proposing legislation to terminate the annuity payable from the Exchequer to the dependants of thebrother of Horatio Nelson.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that a number of similarannuities had been terminated when Mr. Snowden was Chancellorof the Exchequer, and this was now the sole surviving case of apermanent annuity payable from the Exchequer. The presentLord Nelson was 89 years of age and his heir, a brother, was 86.He proposed that the annuity should be terminated upon the death of the present Earl, or of his brother if he survived the longer.As compensation to the family for the loss of the annuity, he proposed that the Trafalgar Estate should be released from the
statutory restrictions imposed on it by the Act of 1806. This wouldrelieve the family of the expense of maintaining the estate, whichthey were not now at liberty to sell, and would enable them to sellit. To terminate the annuity and relieve the estate of the statutoryrestrictions a hybrid Bill would be required.This matter had been raised in the House of Commons by a parliamentary Question by Mr. Wilson Harris, M.P., on the6th November; and the Treasury Solicitor had since been discussing the position with Lord Nelson&apos;s solicitors. The Chancellor of theExchequer said that, if the Cabinet approved his proposals, thesolicitors would be informed that he was intending to deal with thematter on these lines. He would then arrange for the hybrid Billto be prepared and would seek a convenient opportunity of intro-ducing it in the course of the next Session.The Cabinet Approved the proposals outlined in CP. (46) 107 forterminating the Nelson Pension; and authorised theChancellor of the Exchequer to proceed accordingly.4. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs recalled that,at their meeting on the 18th March, the Cabinet had approved theproposal that the necessary powers for the acquisition of land forthe construction of the London Airport at Heathrow should betaken in the Civil Aviation Bill. This Bill was not likely to pass into law until the autumn. Meanwhile the local authorities andother interested parties had inevitably learned something of whatwas involved by the Heathrow project; and it was desirable that an authoritative statement should be made as soon as possible whichwould let them know precisely where they stood. There were, forexample, factories on the fringes of the airport whose owners werethinking of building extensions which they would not in fact beallowed to carry out when the powers under the new Bill had beenobtained. He therefore proposed that an authoritative statement should be made of the Governments plans for developing the london airport at Heathrow. This would, of course, make it clear thatthe acquisition of the necessary powers was dependent on Parlia-menfs endorsement of the proposals in the Civil Aviation Bill.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Civil Aviation to make an early statement of the Government^ intentions regarding thedevelopment of the London Airport at Heathrow.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,21st March, 1946.
