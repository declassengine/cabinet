world supplies ofCereals.(previous reference:CM. (46) 20thConclusions,Minute 4.)The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the Lord Presidentsproposals (CP. (46) 80 and 90) for action designed to impress uponthe Governments of Canada and the United States the need forincreased production of wheat over the next two or three years.The Foreign Secretary said that he had now had an opportunityto review the position as a whole and he had come to the conclusionthat it would be inexpedient for him to make a personal visit to north America to discuss the world food position with the Govern-ments of Canada and the United States. If he went to Washingtonat this stage his visit would, he feared, be misunderstood both here and in the United States. It would be thought that his pur-pose was to make a further appeal for American aid to the countries of the British Commonwealth; and on general grounds he wouldbe most reluctant to do anything at the present stage which might seem to imply our increasing dependence on the United States.He would therefore prefer that our efforts to secure increasedwheat production should be diffused throughout the main exporting countries and not concentrated primarily on the United States.According to his information, the probable world deficit in 1946-47was about 8 million tons. Towards this Australia could make asubstantial contribution : he believed that their present expectation of an exportable surplus of 3 million tons might be raised to 4 or4-! million tons if vigorous action were taken to stimulate pro-duct ion. After the Cabinet&apos;s meeting on the previous day, heand the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs had seen theAustralian Minister Resident in London and had asked himwhether Australia could not plan a substantial increase of wheatacreage over the next three years on the basis of assured minimum prices for specified quantities of exports tapering off in the thirdyear. They had put to him the political considerations mentionedin the Cabinet&apos;s previous discussion, and had invited him toconsider whether Australia could not take advantage of this oppor-tunity to work up a triangular Pacific trade between herself, Indiaand South Africa. The Minister Resident had been impressed bythese possibilities and had undertaken to commend the propositionto the favourable consideration of his Government.Secondly, the Foreign Secretary said that from the next andsucceeding harvests it ought to be possible to extract from theArgentine and Brazil additional supplies of the order of 800,000or 900,000 tons.Thirdly, the estimated deficit of 8 million tons included pro-vision for 3 million tons of wheat to make up a short fall in theworld production of rice. Much more vigorous action could,however, be taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government to increase theproduction of rice. He was not satisfied that all possible steps had yet been taken to increase rice production in India.Could not the rice acreage be increased ? Was it certainthat the prices paid to the producers were such as to providea sufficient incentive to increase production ? Was there not astrong case for guaranteed minimum prices 1 The Government ofIndia should be pressed to tackle these problems with greater vigourand imagination. The same applied to Siam and Burma, wherethere were immense possibilities of increased production over thenext two of three years. Finally, our Colonial authorities shouldbe urged to plan for a larger production of rice and other foods : in malaya, in particular, he believed that substantially more couldbe done.If all these measures were vigorously pursued, it should bepossible to reduce to something of the &quot;order of 3 million tons theadditional demand to be made on wheat production in north america; and an addition of that magnitude might be achieved without seriously upsetting the balance of their agriculture.In conclusion, the Foreign Secretary urged that our handling of this situation should be so arranged as to make it clear that wewere not seeking to lay a disproportionate burden on the UnitedStates, that we were expecting all the grain-producing areas of the
world to make their contribution, and that we were ourselves taking-energetic steps to secure the maximum production of grain in ail&quot;parts of the British Commonwealth and in other countries whoseeconomy we could influence.In discussion there was general agreement with the foreign secretary&apos;s suggestion that everything possible must be done toincrease the production of grain within the British Commonwealth.Particular points raised were :  (a) The extension of rice-growing in India depended largely onirrigation, which could not be provided within the period now underreview. Without irrigation, rice crops would continue to be at themercy of the rains; and, although a larger acreage was planted,increased harvests could not be guaranteed.(b) It was suggested that in both India and Burma increased production of rice might be secured by assuring minimum prices forthe producers. Reference was made, however, to the war-timeexperience in West Africa, where increased prices for palm productshad not resulted in increased production; and it was suggested that prices alone would not influence the producers unless ample suppliesof consumer goods were available.(c) The view was expressed that, if there was to be a real driveto secure increased rice production in Burma, it would be necessarythat the administration in Burma should be strengthened.(d) Canada could make an even larger early contribution thanthe United States, for the bulk of her wheat was spring-sown. TheCanadian Minister of Agriculture was most reluctant to endanger the balance of agriculture and the fertility of the soil by an excessiveproduction of wheat; and it was recognised that, in addition to the assurances on price which had already been given by the Minister ofFood, further steps might have to be taken to overcome the reluctance of the Canadian Government to allow their farmers to grow morewheat in order to meet the exceptional world demand over the next two or three years. The Prime Minister undertook to considerwhether it would be expedient for the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs to pay a special visit to Ottawa in order to impress upon the Canadian Government the importance of their making this contribution to world needs.Discussion then turned on the means of stimulating wheatproduction in the United States.The Lord President said that he fully agreed with the foreign secretary&apos;s suggestion that every effort must be made to secure themaximum production of wheat in British Commonwealth countries.He had himself urged this from the outset; and his own proposalsfor a mission to the United States had been based on the assumptionthat the British Commonwealth would already be making its maximum contribution. He must accept the Foreign Secretary&apos;judgment of the political objections to a personal mission to theUnited States : but, if this were rejected, other means must be found of persuading the United States Government to take effective actionto meet the world&apos;s needs. And there was no time to be lost, for only about four weeks remained if we were to influence the extent of the spring sowings in the United States. He did not think that our approach to the United States need be on the basis of seeking aid forthe British Commonwealth : it was mainly for countries outside theBritish Commonwealth that this additional wheat was needed, andhis suggestion had been that we should take the lead in proposing that those countries should enter into long-term contracts to buy it.It was, therefore, a matter of business, not sentiment; and he had assumed that we should approach the United States Government onthat basis.The Foreign Secretary said that, in his judgment, the right course was to raise this issue with the United States government through His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington. The man whowas best placed to get all the agencies of the United States Govern-ment to work on this problem was Mr. Dean Acheson of the State
Department; and Lord Halifax should be instructed to take thematter up with him forthwith. Supplementary action could thenbe taken, through our Embassy at Washington, to influence publicopinion in the United States, which was not yet fully alive to theneeds of the situation. At a later stage, we might also arrange for for the Food and Agriculture Organisation to discuss the means of meeting the prospective world deficit of wheat over the next fewyears.The Cabinet&apos;s conclusions were as follows :  (1) Vigorous action should be taken to ensure the maximum production of wheat and rice, during the next few years,in all parts of the British Commonwealth and othercountries under British control. Action to this end bythe responsible Departments of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would be co-ordinated through the Prime Minister^periodical meetings on World Food Supplies.(2) The Foreign Secretary should at once instruct His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Washington to raise with the UnitedStates Government, on the lines indicated in the discus-sion, the problem of increasing the wheat acreage in theUnited States over the next few years.(3) The Minister of Food should consider means of ventilating,through the Food and Agriculture Organisation, the needfor increased production of cereals to meet the prospective world shortage over the next few years.(4) A White Paper should be presented to Parliament in thenear future outlining the action taken by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to meet the prospective world shortage offood. The Prime Minister would arrange for a draft ofthe White Paper to be submitted for consideration at anearly meeting of Ministers on World Food Supplies.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,5th March, 1946.
