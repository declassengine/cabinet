1. The Cabinet agreed that the Prime Minister should open the debate on the 15th March on the Cabinet Mission to India.The Lord Privy Seal should be ready to speak in reply to the debate,if any further speech on behalf of the Government was required.The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the business whichit was proposed to take in the House of Commons in the following week.An extra hour would be given for the Second Reading of theHousing (Financial Provisions) (Scotland) Bill on the 19th March.The Bill would then be referred to the Scottish Grand Committee.The public business on the 20th March would be interruptedat 6-15 p.m. so that opposed Private Bills might be taken.On the 21st March, on the Consolidated Fund Bill, the Oppo-sition had asked for a debate on fishery questions. It would be embarrassing to the Government to have such a debate at the present stage, as various questions of policy remained undecided. It was known that some members of the Opposition would prefer to debateforestry questions on this occasion, and that would be more aceept-able to the Government. The Cabinet decided that the opposition leaders should be invited to agree that the debate on the 21st March-should be held on forestry questions.The Cabinet were informed that there was increasing pressure for a debate on the World, Food Situation. This might be arranged for the 25th March, on the remaining stages of the consolidate fund Bill.The Minister of Health asked when it would be possible to takethe Report Stage and Third Reading of the Land Acquisition BUI.It was most desirable that this Bill should be passed into law beforethe Easter&apos; adjournment; and the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs confirmed that the House of Lords would wish to receive theBill from the Commons in time to enable them to give it unhurriedconsideration. The Lord President undertook to do his best toarrange that this Bill reached the House of Lords in time for it tobe passed into law before the Easter adjournment.2. The Cabinet considered! a joint memorandum by the secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs and for the Colonies(CP. (46) 104) regarding the future of the Somali territories.The Foreign Secretary said that it was his view and that ofthe Secretary of State for the Colonies that a United Somalia was highly desirable in the interests both of the Somalis and of our-selves. The artificial division of the country made normal admini-stration difficult and) constructive development, impossible. the somalis in the Ogaden would resist return to Ethiopian rule, and essential grazing grounds for British Somalis lay across the old.Ethiopian border. Some form of trusteeship arrangement would,no doubt be necessary and should extend to the area as a whole.The Foreign Secretary emphasised that be did not seek at themoment final decisions either for a United Somalia or on the exactform of the trusteeship arrangement, which must depend on a broader decision about the future of the Italian colonies generally.At present he only asked for the authority of the Cabinet to explorethese ideas as to the future of the Somalis with the EthiopianForeign Minister, who was now visiting this country. the ethiopian Government might require some inducement to foregotheir claim to the Ogaden area. In that event he proposed to holdout to them the prospect of British support for the transfer of partof Eritrea to Ethiopia. Most of the inhabitants of Eritrea wereclosely related) to those of Ethiopia, and a rationalisation of fron-tiers there was as desirable as in Somalia.It was proposed to keep the United States government informed of our action and of the reasons for it, and to explain the position at the same time to the Dominion Governments.-7] b 2
The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the colonies said that he was in full agreement with the Foreign Secretary&apos;views.Points in discussion were :  (a) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that itwould be wise to give Field Marshal Smuts an opportunity forcomment before final decisions were taken.(b) It would also be necessary for the Cabinet to have beforethem the views of the Chiefs of Staff on the strategic issues involved.(c) The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the Shell Com-pany were proposing to undertake a geological and geophysicalsurvey for oil in British Somaliland. If oil were found there, this might affect the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government about the futureof the area. The Foreign Secretary undertook to keep this pointin mind.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to broach the future ofthe Somali territories with the Ethiopian ForeignMinister on the lines proposed in CP. (46) 104.(2) Agreed that the United States Government should beinformed of this approach.(3) Agreed that the position should also be explained to theSouth African Government and to the Governments ofthe other Dominions.Resident.Persian Gulf. 3.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the ForeignHeadquarters Secretary (CP. (46) 101) and the Secretary of State for india of the (CP. (46) 105) about the location of the headquarters of the PoliticalPolitical Resident in the Persian Gulf.The Foreign Secretary explained that the main function of thePolitical Resident was to supervise the relations of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the Government of India with the British-protectedArab States on the southern side of the Persian Gulf. His head-quarters were, however, at Bushire in Southern Persia, and his statusin Persia was that of a Consul-General. It was anomalous that aBritish officer exercising administrative functions on the Arabianside of the Gulf should live on Persian territory; and in presentcircumstances this situation might at any moment become a focusfor anti-British agitation. He thought, therefore, that it was desir-able to remove this possible cause of trouble before trouble, in fact,occurred.The Secretary of State for India said that the Government ofIndia were opposed to an immediate change, on account of thepractical difficulty and expense of providing alternative accom-modation at the moment. Moreover, the staffing and responsibilityfor all posts in the Persian Gulf would have to be reviewed after the impending constitutional changes in India. He did not himselfdispute the wisdom of moving the Political Residents headquartersfrom Bushire, although his presence there had not so far given riseto any adverse comment in Persia, but he suggested that a changemight be deferred until the practical difficulties could be surmounted.The general view of the Cabinet was that, in view of the extremedelicacy of the situation in Persia, it was desirable, despite theadmitted difficulties, that the Political Resident should cease toexercise his administrative functions from Persian territory as soonas possible.Further points made in discussion were : (a) There could be no objection to the exercise of the properfunctions of a Consul-General at Bushire, and it might be possibleto appoint a separate officer to exercise these functions.(b) The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that the Senior naval officer in the Persian Gulf was in future to have his headquarters
on board a sloop, and his bungalow at Bahrein could be made avail-able for the Political Resident.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulfshould cease forthwith to have his headquarters onPersian territory.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for India to consider, inconsultation with the Foreign Secretary and the FirstLord of the Admiralty, the best means of giving effect tothis decision.4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (46) 98) regarding a suggestion that The Kingmight assign to himself special Arms for use in &quot;Wales.The Lord President said that he had ascertained that HisMajesty had no objection to the suggestion being discussed by ministers. If Ministers desired to pursue it, the appropriate pro-cedure would be to appoint a Committee of the Privy Councilconsisting of the Lord President, the Home Secretary and the earl marshal to discuss the matter and to take the advice of the Heralds.In discussion the view was expressed that, although such a gesture in the field of ceremony might be generally welcome to Welshopinion, it would do nothing to meet the feelings of those who hadbeen pressing for the appointment of a separate Secretary of Statefor Wales. If, therefore, it were decided that such special Armsshould be adopted, it might be preferable to avoid announcing this ata time when the nationalist demand for separate administration wasbeing vigorously expressed. The Cabinet would, in any event, havean opportunity of considering the matter further before anysubmission was made to His Majesty.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord President to arrange for a Committee ofthe Privy Council to be appointed, consisting of himself,the Home Secretary and the Earl Marshal, to consider theproposal for special Arms for use in Wales, and to submit a report to the Cabinet.5. The Minister of Labour said that representatives of the two sides in the dispute at the Ford works at Dagenham had acceptedan invitation to discuss their problems at a meeting to be held in his department on the following day by the Chief Industrial Commis-sioner of the Department. The Trade Union representative hadacted precipitately on the 9th March in declining to address a meet-ing at the works because the management wished to be represented;and it was encouraging that both sides had now agreed to discuss their problems under the chairmanship of the Chief IndustrialCommissioner.The unofficial strike at the Humber works in Coventry stillcontinued; but there had been little response to the strikers&apos; appealthat other engineering workers in Coventry should also suspendwork. The Amalgamated Engineering Union had taken prompt and firm action in advising their members to ignore the invitation of the unofficial strikers; and the present position in Coventry seemedto imply local confidence in the Union and in the normal machineryfor the settlement of industrial disputes.There was no connection between the strike at Coventry andthat at Dagenham.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour.
Wages Policy.(Previous  &apos;Reference:CM. (45) 48thConclusions,Minute 6.)6. In connection with the discussion recorded in the preceding minute, reference was made to the trend of industrial wages. i*the engineering industry demands were being voiced for very hionrates of wages, and if these were conceded the repercussions in otlierindustries would be serious. There was already difficulty jnrecruiting labour for agriculture, because the wage rates comparedso unfavourably with those in most other industries. And wage increases in engineering were likely to provoke further demands from the miners, who were disposed to claim that the level of waogsin coal-mining should be as high as that in any industry. In thecoal-mining industry the situation was complicated by the fact that two men were competing for the leadership of the National Unionof Mine-Workers and each was disposed at the moment to put for-ward irresponsible demands; but there was a large body of.opinion in the Union which was loyal to the present Government, and therewas a good prospect that the men would accept the offer made tothem to join with the National Coal Board, when it had beenappointed, in full and frank discussion of all questions affecting thefuture welfare of the workers in the industry, including wages and1 conditions of employment.Some Ministers suggested that, in order to prevent an upwardspiral in wage rates, it was desirable that the Government shouldformulate and announce a considered wages policy. It should bepossible, without pegging wages by a rigid formula, to establishsome principles which would help to prevent an unregulated spiralmovement. There might be consultation with the Trades UnionCongress, who were already concerned about this problem. Andit might be expedient to appoint a Royal Commission to investigate the wages structure as a whole.The Foreign Secretary said that he would be strongly opposedto any system by which the State attempted to regulate industrialwages. In one sphere in which the State had absolute control,viz., the pay of the Armed Forces, experience during the war had shown him how the Government could be forced to raise rates by political pressure. The Government had been strongly criticisedthroughout the war on the ground that Service pay was too low:yet many men were finding on demobilisation that they had been better off in the Services than they now were in civil life. If theState took a hand in fixing industrial wages, it would become a party to every industrial dispute affecting wages and that wras a situation fraught with grave danger to the Government.It was easy to exaggerate the dangers of an upward spiral ofwages, and easy to over-estimate the value in terms of purchasingpower of the wage increases which had, in fact, taken place. Themain problem at the present time was that of improving wages andconditions in the less well-paid and more unpleasant industries such as brick works, tanning, gas works, &amp;c. The numbers affectedwere, however, relatively small. He estimated that there were only about 600,000 workers in those industries; and, even ifagriculture were added, the total of low-paid workers would not greatly exceed 1 million. If, therefore, improvements were madethroughout the whole of this field, it would not produce a startlingchange in the total wages bill of the country.In his opinion there was no serious risk in allowing wages tocontinue to be settled by the traditional procedure of collective bargaining. He believed that the introduction of undue rigidityin the wages structure would prejudice the continuing develop-ment of industrial efficiency.On the other hand, the view was expressed that it would bedifficult to apply the Governments policy of planning for full employment while leaving industrial wages to be determined,without any guidance from the Government, by the free processof collective bargaining between employers and workers. If wewere to rely on this process, we must at least make sure that theTrades Unions in the lower-paid but essential industries were sufficiently vigorous in seeking; such improvements in wages andconditions as would attract the necessary number of workers to
those industries. In fact, however, there had already been come degree of intervention by the State in the determination of wages in certain industries, particularly where the State was concernedin the determination of prices. The Government had not con-sistently applied the principle of leaving these matters wholly tocollective bargaining; but they had not clearly defined the principlesdetermining the extent and method of Government intervention in these matters. What was needed was that the Governmentshould review their attitude towards wages questions in the lightof the economic policies to which they were committed; and should endeavour to formulate a considered wages policy which could be publicly announced and made the basis of consistent action inrelation to the successive claims for wage increases which were likely to be put forward by different industries.The Lord President agreed that it was important that theGovernment should formulate a policy on this matter. He had arranged some time ago for a working party of officials to considerthe problem, and he expected to receive their report in the nearfuture. Difficult issues were involved, and be would deprecate ahasty decision. He would, however, arrange for the report of theworking party to be presented as soon as possible to the lord presidents Committee who should, after considering it, be able toput forward recommendations to the Cabinet.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord President to arrange for the lord presidents Committee to consider at an early date thequestion of wages policy, and to submit their recommenda-tions to the Cabinet.Vigilantes 7.   The  Home Secretary  said  that a meeting which theAction Vigilantes Action League had tried to hold in the Albert Hall theLeague. previous evening had been cut short by the intervention of a numberAlbert Hall of Communists. He read to the Cabinet a report submitted to himMeeting. by an official of the Home Office who had attended the meeting at his request. This showed that only about 200 supporters of the Leaguehad attended the meeting, and about an equal number of Com-munists had been present. The Communists had prevented the speakers from gaining a hearing, and had in the end taken possessionof the platform and held a meeting of their own. Eventually thePolice had stopped the meeting and cleared the platform. The pro-ceedings had in fact been farcical, and it was clear that theVigilantes Action League was of no political importance.The Home Secretary said that Mr. P. Piratin, M.P., was askinga Question about this meeting in the House of Commons this after-noon. If pressed for information, he proposed to read to the Housiethe report which he had received. This, he thought, would put thematter in its proper perspective.The Cabinet-Took note of the Home Secretary&apos;s statement.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,Uth March, 1946.
