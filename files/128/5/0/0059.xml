The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he was concerned(Previous        about the position in Persia.

He hoped that the vital importance tothe United Kingdom of the Persian oil would be kept prominentlyin mind, and he suggested that the Foreign Secretary might be askedto take up the question of Persia with M. Molotov in Paris.In discussion stress was laid on the importance of ensuring thatBritish firms both in Persia and elsewhere abroad, whose interestsHis Majesty&apos;s Government might be called on to defend, took action with all speed to remedy conditions which might expose them tojustifiable criticism.The Prime Minister said that the importance to the UnitedKingdom of the Persian oil supplies was fully realised by everyoneconcerned. He did not think that it would be desirable to ask theForeign Secretary specially to raise the matter with M. Molotov atthis stage. He hoped that there would be an early opportunity of going into the whole question of the United Kingdom oil interestsin the Middle East.Parliament. 2.   The Lord President said that the Opposition were likely to business in make a strong attack on the Government in the debate on food the House of production on the 18th June. He proposed that the Minister ofCommons.       Agriculture and Fisheries should intervene immediately after thefirst Opposition speaker, and that the Secretary of State forScotland should wind up the debate.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in order to makereasonable progress with the Finance Bill, it would be necessary to sit late on at least one of the two days allotted for the committee stage of the Bill in the current week. He would discuss the arrange-ments with the Chief Whip.India.(PreviousRefierence:CM. (46) 57thConclusions,Minute 2.)3.   The Cabinet had before them : (i) A note by the Additional Secretary (CP.

(46)53rd agreed on with the Lord President and he were asked to say whetherConclusions, the deficit should fall on the United Kingdom, the British Zone of minute 2.) Germany or India.The Lord President said that the United States Governmenthad accepted the obligation to provide supplies to all three countries on the same basis, subject to the relatively minor reduction whichwould have to be made in allocations to all importing countries ifworld supplies were not in fact sufficient to meet those allocations.There should be no question of reductions in supplies to areas forwhich His Majesty&apos;s Government were responsible, unless reductions to other countries were also considered. He thought there mightwell be a case for some reduction in the allocations to countrieswithin the Soviet orbit.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for India saidthat he hoped that there would be no question of putting therequirements of India after those of Germany.In further discussion it was pointed out that, although, so faras they had gone, the June shipments were behind the programme,there was evidence that the United States authorities were doing all they could to increase their exports to a maximum and wouldnot willingly fall short of their undertaking. In these circum-stances it seemed most desirable that the Minister of Food should avoid giving any impression that His Majesty&apos;s Government didnot -consider it vital that the full quantity promised should besupplied to each of the three areas in question.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that if the question of reducing the wheat sup-plies promised to the United Kingdom, the British zone of Germany, or India were raised, the Minister of food should make it clear that His Majesty&apos;s government regarded it as essential that the requirements of all three areas should be met in full.The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to a report in the evening Standard of the 17th June of an alleged statement by aserving officer of the British Army of the Rhine to the effect thatin the Osnabruck district ample supplies of food could be obtained by Germans through the black market and that most Germans had several ration books.The Cabinet (2) Took note that the Secretary of State for War would furnish the Prime Minister with a report on the allegedstatement.north borneo.(previous reference:CM. (46) 23rdConclusions,Minute 8.)5. At their meeting on the 11th March the Cabinet had invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to continue negotiations withthe British North Borneo (Chartered) Company, with a view to securing agreed arbitration terms on the basis proposed by HisMajesty&apos;s Government.The Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies (CP. (46) 228) reporting theresult of the further negotiations.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that the Court of directors of the Company had now accepted the Governments basis for arbitration. If, as he expected, the consent of the shareholderswere obtained at a meeting to be held on the 25th June, he proposedto sign the agreement before the 1st July and to arrange for the
resumption of civil administration on or about the 15th July. he hoped that the Cabinet would authorise him to sign the agree-ment and to make a statement, in reply to a Parliamentary question on the 19th June, briefly summarising the proposals and stating the intention to seek Parliamentary approval of the necessary financial provisions in due course.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that some misunder-standing appeared to have arisen about the amount of compensation which had been mentioned to the Company at an earlier stage inthe negotiations in an attempt to avoid recourse to arbitration. Inhis view, the figure suggested had been based on the assumptionthat the liquid assets of the Company would be transferred to theGovernment. The Company, however, were apparently under theimpression that they were to have been entitled to retain theseliquid assets. He suggested that the Cabinet might agree to leavethis point to be settled between the Treasury and the ColonialOffice.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that he proposed to inform the Australian Government of the latest develop-ments, since they had been responsible for liberating North borneo and had shared in the military administration. He also felt thata statement should be made in the House of Lords at the sametime as the proposed statement by the Secretary of State for theColonies in the House of Commons.The Cabinet i(1) Agreed that the question whether the original figure ofcompensation suggested by the Government to theBritish North Borneo (Chartered) Company had been based on the assumption of the transfer to the Govern-ment of the liquid assets of the Company should bediscussed between the Treasury and the Colonial Office.(2) Subject to (1), authorised the Secretary of State for theColonies to sign on behalf of His Majesty an agreement for the transfer of the Borneo sovereign rights andassets to the Crown in the terms agreed with the Courtof Directors of the Company.(3) Agreed that the Secretary of State for the Colonies shouldmake a statement in the terms of the draft annexed to cp. (46) 228 in reply to a Parliamentary Question onthe 19th June, and that a corresponding statement should be made on the same day in the House of Lords.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,12th June, 1946.
