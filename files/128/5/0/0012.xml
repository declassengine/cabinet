Greece. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet of the latest(Previous developments in the proceedings on the Security Council about the reference: situation in Greece, and asked for the Cabinets guidance on the cm. (46) 11th line which he should take when the discussion was resumed at theConclusions,     Council&apos;s meeting that evening.Minute 1.) At the meeting on the 4th February M. Vyshinsky had proposedthat the Chairman should terminate the proceedings by making adeclaration to the effect that, in view of the assurance given byHis Majesty&apos;s Government that British troops would be withdrawnfrom Greece as soon as possible, the Council was of opinion that thequestion had been exhausted. The Foreign Secretary had made itclear that he could not accept this. After an unsuccessful attempt by the Polish Delegation to find a compromise, the Egyptian Dele-gation had put forward a draft resolution which included thestatement that the presence of British troops in Greece did not constitute a menace to international peace and security.M. Vyshinsky had then argued that since this resolution dealt witha matter of substance it required unanimity among the permanent members of the Council, and he had made it clear that he would not agree to it.. The Foreign Secretary had understood that the Chairmanintended, when the discussion was resumed on the 5th February,to make a declaration to the effect that the Council had heard theviews of the various Delegations, that the general sense of these views was&apos; that the presence of British troops in Greece did not constitute a menace to international peace and security, and that theCouncil, having taken note of the views expressed by the variousDelegations, should regard the matter as closed and pass to the nextbusiness. When the Council met, however, the Chairman had shownhis draft declaration to M. Vyshinsky, who had made it clear thathe regarded it as unacceptable. In these circumstances, the meetingof the Council had been adjourned. Subsequently, Mr. Stettiniushad shown to the Foreign Secretary a revised draft of a declaration by the Chairman which was said to be acceptable to M. Vyshinsky.This contained no statement that the presence of British troops in greece did not constitute a danger to peace; and the foreign secretary felt that, if the statement were made in this form, hewould have to add a declaration to the effect that he regarded it astantamount to exonerating His Majesty&apos;s Government from thecharge which had been brought against them. This, of course, would lead to further argument; and it would be preferable if the Chair-man were to make a declaration in the form of his original draft.There was some reason to believe that the Chairman was himselfcoming round to this view.In discussion, there was general support for the view that itwould be desirable that the Chairman should make a declaration inthe original form proposed, since this would imply that but for theRussian veto the Council would have resolved that the presence ofBritish troops in Greece did not constitute a menace to international peace and security. It would be preferable if the Chairman couldomit the last sentence of the draft, which invited any Delegate whodissented from the declaration to make a statement to that effect.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement and agreedthat a declaration by the Chairman of the Council on thelines of his original draft would afford a solutionacceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government.Cabinet Ojfuee, S.W. 1,6th&apos; February, 1946.
