Greece. 1.   The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to reports of a;(Previous movement by certain Populist deputies in Greece to undermine theliefevenee: position of the Regent.   These reports seemed to be confirmed byC.M.(46)29th the telegram which a number of Populist deputies had sent to theOonclusions, King of Greece on the 12th April, and also by recent messages fromMinute 1.) newspaper correspondents in Greece.The Foreign Secretary said that the latest telegrams from HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador in Athens suggested that this manoeuvre bymembers of the Populist Party might be defeated. He was in close touch with His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador and was watching carefully the developments in Athens.  The position there was still fluid.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Future of theIron and SteelIndustry.(previous reference erence:CM. (46) 30thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (46) 152) reporting the results of the consultations which he had been asked by the Cabinet to make regarding theconstitution and functions of a Control Board to supervise theoperation of the iron and steel industry in the interim period before it was nationalised.The Foreign Secretary said that, as requested, he had discussedthese matters with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the LordChancellor and the Minister of Supply.- They envisaged a smallControl Board, which would include two or three members who wouldin due course qualify for appointment to the National Boardestablished to manage the industry after nationalisation. The mainfunctions of the Board would be to regulate the production, distri-bution, import and export of iron and steel; to ensure that urgentnew development was carried on without delay in the interim period;and to advise the Minister in the working out of detailed proposalsfor the nationalisation of the industry. Existing statutory powers would cover the establishment of the Board, but would not besufficient to enable the Board itself to undertake works of develop-ment. To put the powers of the Board beyond challenge, fresh legislation would be necessary. It was possible, however, that theindustry might be willing to co-operate with the Board in proceeding with major schemes of development in the interim period; and inthat event it would be possible to go forward without the delaywhich even this limited legislation would involve. There would be substantial advantage in proceeding with the co-operation of theindustry; and he therefore recommended that, before any furtherannouncement was made of the Governments intentions, theMinister of Supply should be authorised to discuss with both sides of the industry how far it would be possible to enlist their collabora-tion in operating this plan for development in the interim period.He suggested that the Minister should bring into these consulta-tions, not only the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, but alsothe Transport and General Workers&apos; Union, which had many members in the finishing sections of the iron and steel industry.Discussion showed &quot;that there was general support for thesuggestion that an effort should be made to persuade the industryto work in co-operation with a Control Board during the interim period. This would not only obviate the need for interim legisla-tion : it would also simplify the task of working out in detail thefinal scheme of nationalisation. The tasks of defining which sectionsof the industry were to be taken into public ownership, and ofsolving the difficult problems of severance which would arise, wouldbe substantially easier if the industry itself were co-operating inthe search for a satisfactory solution. There was, moreover, reasonto believe that some of the younger men in the industry would be willing to co-operate; and the industry as a whole would bethe more willing to do so since it could not obtain, without theassistance of the Government, the substantial sums of money required[31888-2]p. 2
for works of major development.   The approach to the industry- must, of course, be made on the basis that the Government hadfinally decided upon a policy of nationalisation.- Discussion then turned on the question whether the proposedconsultations should take place before or after the Governmentsannouncement of their intention to nationalise the industry. Itwas desirable that this announcement should be made before Parlia-ment rose for the Easter Recess; and, apart from this time-factor,prior consultation with the industry might result in premature disclosure of the Governments plans. On the other hand, therewere better prospects of securing the co-operation of both sides of the industry if they were taken into the Governments confidencebefore any public announcement was made. The Cabinets conclu-sion was that the best course would be to open consultations withthe industry at once, but to make an announcement immediatelyafter these consultations had begun. The form of this announce-ment would differ somewhat from the draft annexed to CP. (46) 152,in view of the emphasis which the Cabinet wished to lay on their desire to work in co-operation with the industry during the interim period.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals outlined in CP. (46) 152 regardingthe composition and functions of a Control Board to supervise the operation of the iron and steel industry during the interim period preceding the nationalisation of the industry as a whole.(2) Authorised the Minister of Supply to open discussions onthe following day with both sides of the iron and steelindustry with a view to enlisting their co-operation inthe work of the proposed Control Board during the interim period.(3) Agreed that an announcement of the Governments plans for the nationalisation of the industry, and for control in the interim period, should be made in Parliament onWednesday, the 17th April; and invited the Ministerof Supply to revise the draft announcement annexed to cp. (46) 152 in the light of the Cabinets discussion and of his forthcoming consultations with the industry.Coal.Open-CastWorking inWentworthWoodhousePark.(previous reference:CM. (46)8thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Prime Minister said that some local agitation had developed against the Governments decision to extend the workingof open-cast coal in Wentworth Woodhouse Park; and the owner,Earl Fitzwilliam, was calling on him later in the day to discuss this matter. He was likely to ask whether this coal could not besecured by underground mining, instead of open-cast working.Would this be possible ?The Minister of Fuel and Power said that underground workingwould not be appropriate on this site. It would take two years to get the coal which could be obtained in eight months by open-cast working. It would leave permanent surface undulationsthrough subsidence. It would be difficult to dump the spoil withoutfurther interference with local amenities. And, finally, under-ground miners would be needed : these were not available locally,and one of the main objects of open-cast working was to supplement the output of the underground labour force.- The local agitation against this project had been worked upby a comparatively small number of people and did not, in his view,correctly reflect public opinion in the district. . The scheme approvedby the Cabinet on the 24th January had been a compromise reachedafter giving full weight to the arguments based on considerations of amenity. It would be a sign of weakness on the Governmentspart to abandon or modify that scheme now that the contracts hadbeen let and work was about to begin.   There could be no doubt
of the country&apos;s urgent need of coal. He hoped, therefore, that theCabinet would agree that, in spite of these protests, the scheme should go forward.The Cabinet (1) Reaffirmed their decision of the 24th January, 1946, infavour of a limited extension of the working of open-cast coal in Wentworth Woodhouse Park.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would explain to Earl?       Fitzwilliam the reasons why the Government felt obligedto go forward with this scheme.4.   The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda :- (i) A report by the Chiefs of Staff (D.O. (46) 53) reviewing the supply and demand for personnel shipping formilitary purposes during the period April to September1946;(ii) A memorandum by the Minister of Transport (CP. (46)151) on civil and commercial requirements for passengerships during this period;(iii) Memoranda by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary ofState for India (CP. (46) 132) and the Secretary ofState for the Colonies (CP. (46) 140) on the need forincreased facilities for the transport of civilians to andfrom India and the Colonies respectively.The issues raised in these memoranda had been discussed by theDefence Committee on the 12th April (D.O. (46) 11th Meeting,Minute 1); and the Minister of Transport had then been asked toarrange for the claims of the Civil Departments to be examined inrelation to the shipping programmes of the Services, and to reportto the Cabinet what measure of agreement could be reached as tothe allocation of the shipping available. The Cabinet now had before them (iv) A memorandum by the Minister of  Transport  (CP.(46) 155) covering the report of a meeting of officialsheld in pursuance of this conclusion of the DefenceCommittee.The Minister of Transport said that since 1939 the Services had had first call on the passenger ships available. High priority muststill be given to troop movements required to maintain the approvedrate of demobilisation and approved leave schemes for troopsserving overseas; but Service requirements were now competing with other demands on available passenger shipping, includingdemands directly related to the post-war readjustment of thenational economy. In particular, we must begin to re-establish our shipping earnings, and to provide for the increased transport of civilians, both Government officials and business men. It was,therefore, important that a number of ships now in military service should be released for reconversion for civil traffic, under a phasedprogramme which would make the best use of the labour availablein the shipyards. A balance must be struck between civil andmilitary needs for passenger shipping in the next few months onthe one hand and, on the other, provision for expanded civiltransport in the future and the re-establishment of our shippingearnings, which could only be secured by withdrawing ships forreconversion at the expense of current needs. He therefore invited the Cabinet to approve the recommendations set out in the noteannexed to CP. (46) 155.Other Ministers supported the general contention that increased transport facilities must now be provided for civilpassengers, and that provision must be made for the future expan-sion of our passenger shipping resources even at some cost to current needs.
Discussion then turned on the following specific proposals(a) The Minister of Transport had proposed that the Orionshould be withdrawn forthwith from trooping service forreconversion. The labour force required for the reconversion of thisvessel was waiting to begin work on her at Barrow.The Parliamentary and Financial Secretary, Admiralty, saidthat the Admiralty were anxious that this reconversion should btput in hand at once in order to check the drift of labour from the shipyard.The Director of Movements, War Office, said that thewithdrawal of the Orion from trooping service would delay there patriation of British troops from India, unless the supreme allied Commander, South-East Asia, were required to surrender forthis purpose shipping sufficient to carry 5,000 men from theshipping earmarked for the movement of troops under his command.If he made this surrender, he would still be able to carry out hisplans for the removal of British and Indian troops from theNetherlands East Indies, but there would be some delay in movingIndian troops from Malaya.In discussion, it appeared that the shipping plans of theSupreme Allied Commander, South-East Asia, were based on theassumption that all his troops must be removed from the netherlands east Indies by the 1st October, 1946. The Foreign Secretary saidthat, as a result of the conversations which the Prime Minister andhe had held with representatives of the Netherlands Governmenton the 12th and 13th April, it had now been agreed that the last ofthe British and Indian troops should not be removed until the Dutchtroops were ready to take over, and that they were not likely to beready to do so until at least the middle of November 1946. In thesecircumstances it now became possible to accept a delay in the present plans for the withdrawal of our troops from the Netherlands east indies, and some of the passenger shipping now earmarked for thatpurpose could be transferred for use in the repatriation of Britishtroops from India.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Orion should be released forthwith fromtrooping service; and that shipping sufficient for thetransport of 5,000 men should be transferred, from theshipping earmarked for the withdrawal of British and indian troops from the Netherlands East Indies, for usein the repatriation of British troops from India.(b) The Foreign Secretary said that he was not clear that theprogramme before the Cabinet made sufficient provision for the shipment of Polish troops from Italy. On political grounds it was most important that they should be removed from Italy as soon aspossible; and movement by the overland route had in the pastproved unsatisfactory. He could not accept the suggestion thatthese men could be sent to Tripolitania; for this would cause usacute difficulties, not only with the Senussi, but with the SovietGovernment. The United States Government would wish us tofind means of securing the early dispersal of these Polish forces;and he would be willing, if this would be helpful, to ask them tocontribute to an early settlement of these difficulties by making aspecial loan of United States ships for the movement of these men.The Minister of Transport said that it would be helpful if theForeign Secretary could make such a suggestion to the United StatesGovernment.The Cabinet-(2) Took note that the Foreign Secretary, after discussing withthe Minister of Transport how the desired assistance could best be provided, would ask the United StatesGovernment for a special loan of shipping to facilitate the removal of Polish troops from Italy.
(c) The Parliamentary and Financial Secretary, Admiralty,suggested that the general shortage of passenger shipping might bealleviated by adapting the larger aircraft carriers so that they couldcarry still greater numbers of passengers. He believed that after further conversion, which should not take more than a few weeks,each of these ships could be adapted to carry another 2,000 men.The suggestion was also made that further use might be madeof other ships of the Royal Navy for trooping purposes.The Cabinet-(3) Invited the Prime Minister to arrange for the admiralty to consider what further contribution the Royal Navycould make to meet the current shortage of passengershipping, whether by the adaptation of aircraft carriersor otherwise.After some further discussion, the Cabinet (4) Approved the remaining recommendations in the report annexed to CP. (46) 155.(5) Invited the Minister of Transport to arrange for consulta-tions to be continued with the Departments primarily concerned regarding means of expanding the available supply of passenger shipping.5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofTransport (CP. (46) 149) submitting proposals for the nationalisa-tion of transport.The Minister of Transport said that his proposals were summarised in paragraph 2 of his memorandum.. Their centralfeature was the establishment of a British Transport Commissionto which would be transferred compulsorily the main railways (withtheir ancillary businesses) and the canals now under control. TheCommission would be given powers to acquire road haulage servicesand docks not owned by the railway companies; and, subject to thegeneral directions of the Minister,, it would have the duty of promoting and securing the provision of an adequate and properlyco-ordinated system of transport. Management and operation would be delegated to three executives for (i) railways, (ii) road transport and (iii) docks and inland waterways. The mostcontroversial parts of the scheme were those concerned with theroad haulage industry and with municipal passenger transport. Asregards the road haulage industry, he proposed that the holder ofa C licence should be free to operate within a radius of 40 milesfrom his specified base; but, if he wished to operate beyond thisradius, he would have to make out a case to the Traffic Commissionerfor the grant of special authority to do so. The British transport commission would have a right to be heard in opposition to anysuch application and, in dealing with it, the Traffic Commissionerswould be required to have regard to the considerations set out inthe Appendix to CP. (46) 149. Normally, permission to carry goodsbeyond the 40-mile limit would be granted for a period of years : theapplicant would not have to make a separate application for eachjourney. He would have a right to appeal to the independentTransport Tribunal which would be set up for other purposesconnected with the nationalisation scheme. So far as concerned the holders of A and B licences, paragraphs 13 and 15 of CP. (46) 149outlined two possible modifications of his original proposalsdesigned to give a greater degree of freedom. Of these alternativeshe would prefer that set out in paragraph 15.Discussion turned mainly on the proposals regarding C licences.On the one hand it was urged that there were considerable political disadvantages in the proposal of the Minister of Transport.In practice, the larger firms would probably obtain permission fromthe licensing authority to operate beyond the 40-mile limit, and
to that extent the licensing system would do nothing to protect the State monopoly. It would, however, antagonise a large numberof small traders who carried their own goods and, though theynormally operated within the 40-mile limit, might wish on occasion to go beyond that limit. The proposal might also make it moredifficult to attract firms to the development areas. It would causeparticular difficulties in connection with the transport of perishablegoods, and such things as building materials, for which a nationalised undertaking was unlikely to be able to give a sufficientlyadaptable and speedy service. Uncertainty about the grant of a licence to operate beyond the 40-mile limit would also make itdifficult for industrialists who were planning new undertakings todecide whether to make provision for transport of their own goods.The administration of the scheme would inevitably lead to vexatiousdelays, and it was not clear how it would be possible to preventwidespread evasion of the restrictions. .On the other hand, it was pointed out that to give complete freedom to operate this class of &quot;traffic would endanger the economicsuccess of the whole scheme of nationalisation. Experience had shown that the railways, which were heavily burdened with fixedcharges both for capital and maintenance, could not be operatedsuccessfully if they were exposed to unregulated competition fromroad transport, and the British Transport Commission would be unable to evolve a fully co-ordinated scheme of transport if trafficof the type now operated under C licences were wholly outsideits control. Some large firms might choose to operate their ownvehicles in order to boycott the nationalised road-haulage schemeand it would be difficult to prevent evasion of the requirement thatthey should carry only their own goods. Applications to operatebeyond the 40-mile limit would be decided by the Traffic Commis-sioners, who were a quasi-judicial tribunal, and the considerations to which they would be directed to have regard would ensure thatany applicant who had reasonable grounds for wishing to use hisown vehicles would have no difficulty in securing the necessarypermission. Moreover, once a decision applying to a particulartype of case had been given, other similar cases would be settledautomatically and the administrative difficulties were not likely tobe as great as had been suggested. The Transport and general works&apos; Union and the National Union of Railwaymen were bothstrongly in favour of an even greater degree of restriction than was proposed in CP. (46) 149.In further discussion it was suggested that it would be desirable for the Ministerial Committee on the Socialisation of Industries toconsider whether the proposal with regard to C licences couldnot be adapted in order to meet the criticisms raised in the Gabinefsdiscussion. In particular, the Committee might examine thepossibility of allowing the owner of a single vehicle and certain other classes (e.g., firms employing vehicles for the purpose ofconnecting two or more plants belonging to or associated with thesame factory) to operate beyond the 40-mile limit as of right. TheCommittee should also state more precisely how the work of theBritish Transport Commission would be endangered if the trafficnow operated under C licences were given complete freedom to operate up to any distance, having regard to the fact that it wouldprobably be necessary in practice to give such freedom to most largefirms.Other points in discussion were : (a) The Secretary of State for Scotland pointed out that in the highlands and Islands of Scotland steamer services very largelytook the place of road and rail services. He hoped that the bill would contain sufficiently wide powers to enable these services to be nationalised.The Minister of Transport confirmed that the necessary powers would be included in the Bill.
283CM. 3S (46).Town and country planning.New TownsBill.(b) The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the provision for compensation for staff displaced as a result of this scheme shouldnot be inconsistent with that proposed for the coal-mining industry.(c) The Minister of Works said that, so far as concerned Aand B licences, he favoured the simplified scheme suggested inparagraph 15 of CP. (46) 149.(d) It was agreed that the arrangements for the assignment ofdraftsmen for the preparation of the Bill should be discussed by theLord President, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the lord privy Seal.(e) -The Minister of Transport undertook to include theNational Farmers&apos; Union among the interests to be consulted onhis proposals.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Ministerial Committee on the Socialisation ofIndustries to prepare, in the light of the discussion, areport on the treatment of the traffic operated underC licences under the proposals for the nationalisation of transport.(2) Subject to conclusion (1) and to the point noted inparagraph (d) above, approved the proposals set out in cp. (46) 149 and authorised the Minister of Transport,on the basis of these proposals, to enter into consulta-tion with the various interests concerned and to put inhand the preparation of the necessary legislation.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secre-tary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Town and country planning (CP. (46) 142) covering a draft of the New Towns Bill.The Minister of Toivn and Country Planning explained thatthe draft Bill had been approved by the Lord Presidents Com-mittee at their meeting on the 12th April (L.P. (46) 13th Meeting,Minute 2) subject to further discussions by the Chancellor of theExchequer and himself of the financial provision to be made in theBill. Subject to the Cabinets approval, it was proposed that theLegislation Committee should consider the detailed provisions ofthe draft Bill on the following day, with a view to its being intro-duced before the Easter Recess.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he bad agreed withthe Minister of Town and Country Planning that the limit on theaggregate amount of advances which might be made to defraycapital expenditure should be  50 millions.The Cabinet Gave general approval to the draft of the New: Towns bill and agreed that, subject to any points which might bemade at the meeting of the Legislation Committee on thefollowing day, it should be introduced before the easter recess.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,15th April, 1946.
