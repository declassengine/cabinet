Balkan States.        1.   The Foreign Secretary recalled that it had been agreed&quot; at(Previous       the Moscow Conference that the United Kingdom and United StatesEeference:      Governments would re-establish diplomatic relations with RoumaniaG.M.

A CommissionEoumania.       consisting of Sir Archibald  Clark  Kerr.  Mr.  Harriman andM. Vyshinsky had visited Roumania and made arrangements which,at the time, had seemed satisfactory.   After M. Vyshinsky andMr. Harriman had left the country, however, there had been indi-cations that M. Groza might not in fact carry out the agreedconditions; and the British representative in Bucharest had beenasked for his views on this point.Meanwhile M. Vyshinsky, who was now in London, had asked what our intentions were. He had said that he had no informationsuggesting that M. Groza was unwilling to give effect to the agree-ment reached with the Commission; and had given his assurance thatthe Soviet Government would do their best to see that the agreement was carried out.The Foreign Secretary said that, in all the circumstances, hewas not disposed to withhold recognition of the Roumanian Govern-ment. His intention was that recognition should be . accordedsimultaneously by this country and the United States; and, subjectto the views of the Cabinet, he proposed to make arrangements tothis end with the United States Government.The Cabinet .(1) Endorsed the line of action proposed by the foreign secretary in regard to the recognition of the roumanian government.Bulgaria. The Foreign Secretary recalled that it had also been agreed atthe Moscow Conference that the Soviet Government should tenderadvice to the Bulgarian Government regarding the broadening ofthe basis of that Government. M. Vyshinsky had visited Bulgariafor this purpose, but the Liberal Parties had not been willing toenter the Government on the conditions offered to them.M. Vyshinsky was now suggesting that there was an obligation onthe Americans and ourselves either to bring pressure to bear on theLiberal Parties in Bulgaria to join the Government or to recognise the existing Government as it stood.The Foreign Secretary said that he did not propose to be hurriedin this matter. The situation in Bulgaria was confused, and he had called for a further appreciation from the British representative in Sofia. He had also asked for information about an exchange of views on this subject which had taken place between Mr. Byrnesand M. Vyshinsky before the former left London. He was not,therefore, in a position to make any definite recommendation to theCabinet at the moment.The Cabinet (2) Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement regardingthe recognition of the Bulgarian Government.United 2.

was even possible that this incident might cause the Soviet Govern-ment to reflect that the methods which they had recently applied in bringing pressure to bear on smaller Powers were not alwaysprofitable.The Cabinet- Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum (CP. (46) 24),submitted by the Home Secretary as Chairman of the AirfieldsCommittee, on the land policy to be adopted in regard to surplusrunwayed airfields.The Home Secretary explained that the cost of removing the concrete runways on these airfields would be greater than the valueof the land; and. if the land were returned to the owners, they would receive both the land itself and also its full value in cash. Moreover,most of these airfields consisted of land taken from numerous tenants and owners; and it would be impracticable for them, if left to theirown devices, to restore the land to anything like its original con-dition. The Airfields Committee therefore recommended that theland should, as a rule, be acquired by the State and managed foragricultural purposes as a single entity by the Agriculture Depart-ments. Exceptions would be made in certain cases, for example,(i) where the land had belonged to one or perhaps two owners, who could make good use of it if it were returned to them; and (ii) wherethe land was near a town and it was agreed that it should be usedfor building or industrial development.In discussion the following points were made : (a) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs mentioned an airfield at Borebam, where the whole of the land had been owned bya single individual who was anxious to recover it and put it toprofitable use, but had been unable to secure any decision from theDepartments interested.The Hom,e Secretary undertook to discuss this case with theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs.(b) It was pointed out that, in order to avoid such delays, itwas urgently necessary that a decision should be taken regarding theland policy to be applied in the disposal of surplus airfields. If thepolicy now recommended by the Airfields Committee were approved,progress could be made with the disposal of particular airfieldswhich had already been declared surplus to flying requirements.(c) A technical sub-committee of the Airfields Committee was considering which of the existing airfields must be retained to meetthe flying needs of the Service Departments, the Ministry of aircraft production and the Ministry of Civil Aviation. Their recommen-dations would be considered by the Airfields Committee; but thiscomprehensive review of requirements need not delay the disposalof particular airfields which it was agreed would not be needed for flying purposes., \d) It was for consideration whether there was not a need for aspecial officer to be appointed to expedite the disposal of airfieldsthat were declared surplus. .The Prime Minister undertook to consider the existing machinery for handling this question.(e) Attention was called to the statement made in paragraph 7of CP. (46) 24 that the surfaces of the airfields declared surplusand the flying approaches to them should be kept free from buildings which could not readily be removed in the event of a futureemergency.  There was general agreement that this proposal shouldDisposalof SurplusRunwayedAirfields.
not be accepted without careful consideration by the Airfields Com- 0mittee. Any such requirement would have to be applied with discretion: it should not be allowed to stand in the way of properdevelopment of the surrounding land for civil uses.The Cabinet (1) Approved the policy recommended by the Airfields Com-mittee in paragraphs 3-6 of CP. (46) 24.(2) Agreed that the Lord Chancellor should announce thispolicy in the forthcoming debate in the House of lords on a Motion by Lord Meston.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would review the existing machinery for determining which airfields were surplus to requirements and for ensuring their rapid reconversionto civil uses.Publication 4.   The  Cabinet  considered  a  memorandum by  the  Lordof Statistics.    President (CP. (46) 23) regarding the proposed publication of a monthly summary of the principal economic statistics of the UnitedKingdom.The Lord President said that, ever since the end of the war inEurope, there had been increasing pressure on Departments to resume the regular publication of statistical information. Whenthe Caretaker Government . were in office the Lord presidents committee had decided (i) that individual Departments should aim at publishing as much statistical information as possible, and inaddition (ii) that the Central Statistical Office should publish a monthly Digest which would bring together, in a compact and com-parable form, the principal economic statistics of the United&apos; Kingdom. The decision to publish this monthly Digest had been-affirmed by the Lord Presidents Committee since the present&apos; Government took office (L.P. (46) 1st Meeting, Minute 3); and at thePrime Minister&apos;s request he now submitted to the Cabinet a proof ofthe first volume in this new series.The Lord President said that, although there had been a sub-stantial increase since the end of the war in the amount of statistical information published by Departments, there was undoubtedly room for a Digest which would bring together the principal economicstatistics within, a single cover and would provide the backgroundinformation needed for an informed understanding of the Govern-ments economic policies. He hoped, therefore, that the cabinet would.give final approval to this project. In preparing subsequentvolumes in the series the Central Statistical Office would, of course,continue to work in close consultation with the Departmentsconcerned.Points in discussion were : ,j (a) The Minister of Fuel and Power said that for securityreasons it had not been possible to include in this volume any infor-mation about petroleum products. There might be pressure for theinclusion of such information in later volumes.(b) The Foreign Secretary asked whether the publication at thisstage of the figures of stocks contained in the Digest might not leadforeign Governments to increase their demands for assistancefrom us.It was pointed out that the Digest also included the pre-warfigures, which showed in most cases how much worse off we were now than before the war.(c) Would it be advantageous to include some information oncurrency questions ?
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that a good deal of infor-mation was already included in Tables 105-108; and he doubted whether it would be useful at this stage to add more financialstatistics.(d) Was it necessary to publish so much information on a monthly basis ? Might it not be preferable to issue this compre-hensible volume at quarterly intervals ? It was often unsafe to baseon monthly figures deductions about economic trends.The Lord President said that he would like to have an oppor-tunity of examining the technical and other arguments in favourof monthly, as against quarterly, publication. He suggested thatthe Cabinet might leave it to him to settle this point, in consultationwith the Prime Minister.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposal to publish a Digest of economicstatistics on the lines of the proof annexed to CP. (46) 23.(2) Asked the Prime Minister to decide, on the basis of a reportto be made to him by the Lord President, whether thisDigest should be published at monthly or quarterlyintervals.Administra- 5.   The Cabinet considered a report (CP. (46) 21), submittedtion of by the Lord President as Chairman of the Machinery of Govern-Wales and ment Committee, on a memorandum submitted during the lastMonmouth- Parliament by the Welsh Parliamentary party asking for theshire. appointment of a separate Secretary of State for Wales and monmouthshire.The Lord President said that this request had been consideredby the Machinery of Government Committee in the time of the coalition Government, and Major Lloyd George had then been consulted. The matter had been considered afresh by the Machineryof Government Committee of the present Cabinet, who had consulted the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Minister of health in their personal capacities, as well as the Home Secretary. Thepresent Committee, like its predecessor, had no doubt that the request for a separate Secretary of State should be rejected. The main reasons for their conclusion were summarised in paragraph 2 of cp. (46) 21. They therefore recommended that, when the matter was raised again, there should be a forthright but reasoned state-ment by the Government explaining why the appointment of aseparate Secretary of State for Wales would not be advantageous to the best interests of the Welsh people. If there were a demand that the matter should be debated in Parliament, facilities for sucha debate might have to be given.At the same time the Committee considered that departments should be advised to order their administrative arrangements insuch a way as to satisfy the reasonable national susceptibilities of wales, by devolving administrative work to Regional Offices in wales, and by taking care to appoint Welsh representatives to appropriate Commissions, Committees, &amp;c.Points in discussion were : (a) The Minister of Health said that the demand for a separateSecretary of State for Wales arose partly from those who wishedto see mid-Wales and North Wales achieve a separate identity, andpartly from those concerned with economic conditions in SouthWales. He believed that, if the Governments plans for theeconomic reconstruction of South Wales met with success, this demand would not be pressed.(b) The Prime Minister said that the strongest pressure came from people interested in the economic problems of Wales. But itwas in economic matters that there was the strongest case against
6. At their meeting on the 13th September, 1945, the cabinet had invited the Home Secretary to consider, in consultation with theinterests concerned, the selection of a date on which a National Dayof Remembrance could be celebrated for the wars of 1914-18 and1939-45. The Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by theHome Secretary (CP. (46) 22) reporting the results of his consulta-tions with representatives of the Churches, the British Legion andthe Departments concerned.The Home Secretary said that the representatives of the churches and the British Legion recommended very strongly that national remembrance of the two wars should be celebrated on the sunday before the 11th November (unless the 11th or 12th november was   itself  a   Sunday),   that   this   day   should  be   known   asNationalDay ofRemembrance.(previous reference:CM. (45) 31stConclusions,Minute 2.)separate administration for different parts of Great Britain.  This&quot; O 0consideration seemed to him to be decisive against the appointmentof a separate Secretary of State for Wales.There was general agreement with this view.(c) The Lord Chancellor said that it might help to meetnationalist feeling in Wales if continued use were made of the welsh Reconstruction Advisory Council which had been appointedwhen he was responsible for reconstruction problems in the time ofthe Coalition Government.The Lord President said that this Council had not been doingvery useful work of late, and he had been disposed to make tentativeenquiries with a view to disbanding it. If, however, he found thatits retention would be gratifying to Welsh national feeling he wouldhave no strong objection to its continuing in being.(d) The Secretary of State for Scotland said that, on the basisof his experience in Scotland, he strongly endorsed the recommenda-tion in paragraph 6 of CP. (46) 21 that suitable officials should beappointed to Regional Offices in Wales. Scottish experience had shown that it was most desirable that the official in charge of suchan office should be sufficiently senior to be able to represent direct to his Minister the special problems and difficulties of his Region.He hoped that this point would be borne in mind, not only inrelation to Wales, but also by Ministers exercising jurisdiction inScotland. In view of their experience of similar problems inScotland, the Scottish Office should be brought into consultation inthe preparation of the memorandum mentioned in paragraph 6 of cp. (46)21.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the demand for the appointment of a separateSecretary of State for Wales and Monmouthshire mustbe rejected; and invited the Prime Minister to make a reasoned statement of the Government&apos;s attitude towards this matter when it was next raised in the House ofCommons.(2) Took note that this statement would not propose any alternative arrangements, such as those mentioned inparagraphs 3 and 4 of CP. (46) 21, though furtherconsideration might have to be given to possible alterna-tives in the light of the reaction to the Governmentsstatement.(3) Invited the Machinery of Government Committee to arrangefor a memorandum to be prepared, for circulation to departments, on administrative devolution in Wales and monmouthshire; and agreed that the Scottish office should be brought into consultation in the preparationof this memorandum.
&quot; Remembrance Sunday,&quot; and that the ceremony at the Cenotaphand the two minutes&apos; silence at 11 a.in. should be observed on thatSunday. The interested Departments also favoured the choice ofthe 11th November.At the earlier discussion in Cabinet it had been suggested thata day should be chosen which could also be observed as RemembranceDay in the United States. The Foreign Office had pointed out thatin the United States Armistice Day (11th November) was already a statutory holiday; that legislation would be required if it weredesired to celebrate a day of remembrance in the United States on some other day; and that the United States Government wouldprobably be unwilling to promote such legislation.In these circumstances the Home Secretary had come to theconclusion that there was no alternative but to accept the Sundaybefore the 11th November as the Day of Remembrance for both wars.After a short discussion the Cabinet (1) Agreed that, subject to (2) and (3) below, the HomeSecretary should submit for His Majesty&apos;s pleasure thatthe Sunday before the 11th November (unless the 11th or12th be a Sunday) shall be known as &quot;RemembranceSunday&apos;&apos; and be observed as a National Day ofRemembrance for the wars of 1914-18 and 1939-45, andthat the traditional ceremony at the Cenotaph and thetwo minutes&apos; silence at 11 a.m. shall be observed onthat day.(2) Invited the Home Secretary in the first instance to consult with the leaders of the Opposition and ascertain theirviews on the submission which he was proposing to make to His Majesty.(3) Authorised the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs toinform Dominion Governments, and give them anopportunity of expressing their views, before the submission was made to The King.Demobilisa- 7.   The Cabinet had before  them a memorandum by thetjon- Secretary of State for Air (CP. (46) 25) giving information aboutDemonstra- demonstrations at R.A.F. stations abroad by men aggrieved at thetions at E.A.F. working of the demobilisation scheme.stationsabroad., The Secretary of State for Air said that the trouble had shown itself first at Mauripur, near Karachi, and he had had official reportsof incidents at 11 other stations in India, Ceylon and the middle east. At Mauripur and at eight of the other stations work had been resumed; but the Press had now reported a furtherincident at Seletar, near Singapore. He read out to the Cabinet asignal which he had just received from the Air Commander-in-Chief,South-East Asia.The basic demand of the men was for a general acceleration ofthe demobilisation scheme, but there were particular complaints about the scheme as it affected the R.A.F., e.g., that the rate of release from the R.A.F. was slower than that from the Navy andthe Army, that there were inequalities in the rates of release ofdifferent trade groups, and that men overseas were not releasedconcurrently with men in the same groups at home. In addition, asthe report of the Seletar incident showed, there was discontent aboutthe length of the overseas tour, and criticism of living conditions.Much, though not all, of the trouble had arisen among men ofTransport Command, who were carrying a very heavy burden inconnection with the air-trooping programme and some of whom had had to be retained under the military necessity clause beyond their normal release date.Commanding Officers had been told that it was their responsi-bility to see that all ranks understood how the demobilisation scheme
worked, and the Air Ministry had supplemented the information&quot; o 9already given to Commanding Officers on this subject.    The air marshal Commanding the Base Air Forces in South-East Asia had,however, asked that in order to prevent further, incidents a general statement of Government policy should be made;   and the AirCommander-in-Chief, South-East Asia, in his signal about theSeletar incident, had suggested the issue of a Government statementgiving the reasons for the differences in the rates of release, dealingwith the question of the length of the overseas tour and dispellingthe persistent belief that a shortage of shipping was holding uprelease and repatriation.   The Secretary of State for Air said thathe did not see how any Government statement on demobilisationcould go beyond what had already been announced.    It would however, be helpful if the Prime Minister would answer a private notice Question about the demonstrations, since this would dispelany feeling on the part of the men that their representations were notreaching the highest quarters.   He had sent to the Prime Ministerfor his consideration a draft of the reply which might be made.Points in discussion were : (a) In view of the difficult political situation in India it was important that the disturbances should be brought to an end as soonas possible. Would it be helpful, if the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Air visited the stations in India at whichdisturbances had taken place 1 The general view of the Cabinet was against this proposal on the ground that it would tend to undermine the authority of the local Commanders.(&amp;) Any statements addressed to men in Transport Commandshould stress the assistance which they were giving to the acceleration-tion of demobilisation by undertaking the burden of the air-troopingprogramme.(c) The First Lord of the Admiralty reminded the Cabinet thatit might well be found impossible to implement the proposals for larger releases in 1946 which had recently been made at the DefenceCommittee (D.O. (46) 3rd Meeting, Minute 1) without somedeparture from the principle of release by age and length of service.This point should be considered at once by the Service departments and the Ministry of Labour.The Prime Minister said that he was prepared to make astatement in the House of Commons on the following day, but hewould be glad if, in the light of the Cabinets discussion, theSecretary of State for Air would reconsider the draft which he had prepared. It should, in particular, bring out the extent to whichthe general rate of demobilisation was dependent on.the efforts ofTransport Command, and should also cover the points made by AirCommander-in-Chief, South-East Asia, in his signal about theSeletar incident.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of the Prime Minister&apos;s intentionto make a statement in the House of Commons on thefollowing day about the demonstrations at R.A.F. stationsabroad, and invited the Secretary of State for Air to submit to the Prime Minister a revised draft prepared in the lightof the Cabinets discussion.World wheat supplies.(previous reference:CM. (46) 5thConclusions,Minute 4.)8. The Secretary of State for India called attention to atelegram from the Viceroy (No. 791 dated the 25th January)containing a fresh appreciation of the prospects of food supplies inIndia during 1946. This showed that, owing to losses of crops andfailures in procurement, India&apos;s deficit of food grains would be substantially heavier than had previously been estimated. TheViceroy urged that the whole question of imports to India should
immediately be reopened, despite any allocations already formulated by the Combined Food Board.The Secretary of State for India said that the situation disclosed by this telegram was very grave. He drew attention to itat once, because he understood that the Cabinet would be consideringthe world wheat position later in the week, on the basis of memoranda to be submitted by the Minister of Food.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,28th January, 1946.
