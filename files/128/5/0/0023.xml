Germany.(previous reference:C.M.(46)HthConclusions,Minute 6.)1. The Foreign Secretary said that there were indications thatthe Soviet Government might now be prepared to take a more reason-able view about the future level of industrial production in Germany;and, although some points were still outstanding, it might bepossible to obtain a reparations settlement which would be acceptable to us. He hoped to submit a further report to the Cabinet shortlyon this matter. He had also been giving much thought to the futureof the Ruhr and the Saar, and the general problem of moving towards a peace settlement for Germany; and he proposed that theselarger issues should also be considered by the Cabinet in the nearfuture.Greece.(previous reference:C.M.(40)2ndConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The Foreign Secretary said that left-wing elements in greece were now pressing for the further postponement of theelections and a number of Ministers had resigned on this accountfrom the Greek Government. In this country the demand for post-ponement of the elections had been taken up by the Union of democratic Control, from whom be had received a memorial signed by 70 Labour Members of Parliament.The holding of early elections had been an essential part of our plan for securing a stable Government in Greece, and the dateproposed had been chosen by the Greek Government. Further post-ponement would be interpreted as a sign of weakness on our part,and would also delay the withdrawal of our troops from Greece.The Foreign Secretary therefore considered that this pressure forpostponement of the elections should be resisted; and he proposed toadvise the Greek Prime Minister to adhere to his present pro-gramme, even though this might mean that the E.A.M. wouldabstain from, taking part in the elections.The Cabinet &apos;Endorsed the views expressed, by the Foreign Secretary.Japan: 3.   The Foreign Secretary said that the Soviet authorities hadReparations.     delayed transferring the administrative control of Manchuria to thePrevious Chinese, and were reported to be removing from Manchuria equip-Jieieionce: merit which should come within the terms of any settlement about[CM.(46)22nd the recovery of reparations from Japan. There was a risk that theConclusions,     Soviet  Government,  having  first   removed   from Manchuria  by[iriute 5.) unilateral action the equipment they required, would then demandRemoval of their full share in any inter-Allied agreement for the exaction ofKf[uipmont      reparations from Japan.   At their meeting on the 8th March theI[mm Cabinet had approved proposals for determining the Allied sharesManchuria. in reparations from Japan. In order&apos; to preserve our position inprinciple, the Foreign Secretary had caused a note to be presented to the Soviet Government asking that Japanese equipment in manchuria should be transferred to the charge of a custodian, beforethe Soviet troops were withdrawn, so that it might be brought intoaccount in determining the total amount of equipment available for reparation deliveries by Japan. Although there was reason tobelieve that much of this equipment had in fact been removed, this note would at least put our view on record that in principle this equipment should be regarded as part of the total available fordivision between the Allied Governments.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of the action taken by the foreign secretary in this matter.
Persia.(previous reference:CM. (46)9thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Foreign Secretary reported that he was gravelyconcerned about the position in Persia. The United States Govern,ment had received from their Consul in Tabriz reports that soviet troops were moving in the direction of Tehran. They had sent tothe Soviet Government a strongly-worded note asking for an explanation of these movements, and had asked us to support this approach. We had not received similar reports from our repre.sentatives in Persia, and the Foreign Secretary had not thereforefelt able to take this matter up with the Soviet Government. Hehad, however, instructed our representative in Moscow to enquire gwhen he might expect a reply to his original note about the retentionof Soviet troops in Persia beyond the 2nd March.The United States Government had also asked if we would support them in proposing that the Persian question should again be brought before the Security Council. The Foreign Secretary saidthat, after consulting the Prime Minister, he had promised thissupport.- The Cabinet -Endorsed the atcion taken by the Foreign Secretary.Egypt- 5.   The Foreign Secretary warned  the  Cabinet  that the(Previous       situation in Egypt was still difficult and that there might be seriousReference:      disturbances there that day. - British troops had not been called uponCM. (46) 7th    to deal with the earlier disturbances, but the Egyptian authoritiesConclusions,     might not be able to hold the situation with the civil forces at their minute 5.)      disposal.   He had therefore, after consulting the Prime Minister,caused the British military authorities to be informed that theyshould intervene if that became necessary in order to prevent thesituation from getting out of control; but they should act with greatdiscretion and should allow the civil power to resume control at theearliest possible moment.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of statement.theForeign Secretary^Speech by 6.   The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to suggestionsMr. Churchill which were being made in the United States, Russia and elsewhere,in United that His Majesty&apos;s Government had been consulted in advance and states. had approved Mr. Churchill&apos;s recent speech at Fulton, Missouri.The facts were that the British Information Services in theUnited States had been asked by the White House to help to provideliaison with the Press over the speech and had felt that they couldnot refuse this request. British Information Services had cabledthe text of the speech to the Ministry of Information in advance and it beoame known to Press correspondents here that this hadbeen done. In response to requests from the Press, advance copiesof the speech had been issued here for their use. Advance copieshad not, in fact, been seen by Ministers.The Prime Minister said that he would make it clear, in replyto a Question in the House of Commons that afternoon, that HisMajesty&apos;s Government had no advance knowledge of the contents of Mr. Churchill&apos;s speech.The Foreign Secretary said that in replying to requests forcomments on the speech he proposed to take the line that the speech was made on Mr. Churchill&apos;s own responsibility and that thepolicy of the Government towards Russia was defined in the speech which he (the Foreign Secretary) had made in the House ofCommons on the 21st February.Some discussion followed on the question whether it was right that a Government Department should assist in giving publicity to speeches made by members of the Opposition, or by other persons
when the contents of those speeches were not known to the Govern-ment. Mr. Churchill was, no doubt, in a special position, butevents had shown that even in his case there might be embarrassing-consequences.The Cabinet-Took note that the Prime Minister would consider, inconsultation with the Lord President, whether any furtherdirections should be given to the Ministry of information or its successor regarding the policy to be followed in handling speeches made by persons other than Membersof the Government.Parliament.SelectCommittee onParliamentaryProcedure.7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (46) 97) regarding the evidence to be submitted onbehalf of the Government to the Select Committee on parliamentary procedure.The Lord President said that the Select Committee hadreceived from Sir Gilbert Campion, the Clerk of the House ofCommons, a memorandum putting forward some far-reachingproposals for the reform of Parliamentary procedure; and theSelect Committee had asked for the Governments comments on those proposals. Sir Gilbert Oampion&apos;s memorandum had been examined by the Parliamentary Procedure Sub-Committee of theMachinery of Government Committee, which had already been considering what further evidence might be laid before the SelectCommittee on behalf of the Government. The Sub-Committee&apos;sreport had been considered by a group of Ministers, appointed bythe Prime Minister for that purpose, whose recommendations were set out in CP. (46) 97. They proposed that the Select Committeeshould be advised to reject all save one of Sir Gilbert Campion&apos;sproposals. The reasons for this proposal, and the alternative suggestions to be put before the Select Committee on behalf of theGovernment, were set out in a memorandum reproduced in annex II of CP., (46) 97. The positive suggestions for changesin Parliamentary procedure were summarised in paragraph 2 of cp. (46) 97; and the Cabinet considered those suggestionsseriatim.After discussion, the Cabinet (1) Endorsed the recommendations put forward by the lord president in CP. (46) 97.(2) Authorised the Lord President to present to the SelectCommittee on the Governments behalf the memorandumreproduced in Annex II of CP. (46) 97; and invited the Lord President to give evidence before the SelectCommittee in support of that memorandum.(3) Invited the Lord President to arrange for a further examination to be made of the principles which should govern the use of the Affirmative Resolution procedure.North Borneo.(previous reference erence:W.M.(44)70thConclusions,Minute 3.)8. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by theParliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies(CP. (46) 93) about the negotiations for the transfer to HisMajesty&apos;s Government of the sovereign and administrative rightsof the British North Borneo (Chartered) Company.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he supported theview expressed in CP. (46) 93 that, if this matter went to arbitra-tion, the arbitrator should be confined to determining the appro-priate number of years&apos; purchase of a reasonable net maintainablerevenue. The Company were seeking wider terms of reference forthe arbitrator in order that they might claim compensation on theground that His Majesty&apos;s Government had failed to protect the
Company&apos;s property from invasion by the Japanese. An offer of 2,100,000 had been made to the Company in an attempt to avoidrecourse to arbitration. This sum would enable the directors topay their shareholders at the rate of 13s. per  1 share, whichcompared with an average maximum price of 10s. 2d. for the sixteenyears preceding the Japanese occupation; and no higher figure should be offered. The Company were, however, unwilling to accept this and it seemed unlikely that the financial basis of the transfercould now be settled before the date (1st April) on which the military administration of North Borneo was due to come to an end. He was,however, opposed to the suggestion made in CP. (46) 93 that theCompany should be invited to resume administration of the territoryfrom the 1st April until the financial negotiations w^ere concluded,and he suggested that military administration should continue fora further period, or, alternatively, that the Colonial Office take overthe administration forthwith.The Secretary of State for War said that he understood that about half of the staff of the military administration wereAustralians and that they would be withdrawn on the 1st Aprilunless long-term contracts could be offered to them.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the colonies said that it would be impossible for the Colonial Office to take overthe administration without legislation transferring the sovereignand administrative rights.In further discussion, there was agreement that there shouldbe no increase in the lump-sum offer made to the Company and nochange in the basis of arbitration proposed. There was also general support for the view that the Company should not be allowed to resume administration of the territory pending a financial settlement.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Secretary of State for the Colonies tocontinue negotiations with the British North Borneo(Chartered) Company with a view to securing agreedarbitration terms on the basis proposed by theGovernment.(2) Agreed that the Company should not be invited to resumeadministration of the territory pending settlement of thefinancial basis of the transfer.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in consulta-tion with the Secretaries of State for War and DominionAffairs, to consider means of continuing the military administration of the territory until the financial basisof its transfer to His Majesty&apos;s Government had been settled.Transfer of 9.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the FirstShips to the Lord of the Admiralty (CP. (46) 95) setting out certain proposalsFrench Navy,   for the transfer of warships to the French Navy.The First Lord of the Admiralty explained that it had originally been proposed that the French Government shouldpurchase a British escort carrier, H.M.S. Pretoria Castle, for a sumof about  500,000, which would have been paid in dollars. though this transaction was never completed, a credit of  500,000 had beengranted to the French Navy for the purpose and would remainavailable until the 31st March. He now proposed that the followingoffer should be made to the French Government:  (i) to sell to them for  750,000, or  500,000 if it was clearthat there was no prospect of their being able to offermore, six frigates and seven corvettes which they nowheld on loan from us;
(ii) to transfer to them on loan for an initial period oftwo years a light fleet carrier of the- &quot; C &quot; class on theunderstanding that, if at the end of the period they were still unable to buy the ship outright, the loan might becontinued for a further three years. Alternatively, ifthe French Government pressed for this, the loan mightbe for a maximum period of five years on the under-standing that if at all possible the French should undertake to buy the ship at her depreciated value at theend of that time;(iii) to allow the minesweepers which the French held on loan to remain with them for the duration of mineclearance; and(iv) to accept the return of the other ships which the Frenchheld on loan from us.If the Cabinet approved, the offer would be made to a french naval Mission which would visit this country later in the week. Theproposals would benefit this country financially, would strengthen our relations with the French Navy, and would bring incidentaladvantages to British industry.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was in generalagreement with the proposals. He hoped that it would be possibleto limit to two years the initial period for which the carrier waslent.In discussion it was suggested that further steps should betaken to bring home to the French people the extent to wdiich wrewere helping to rebuild the French Navy.The Cabinet -Approved the offer which the First Lord of the Admiraltyproposed to make to the French Naval Mission, as set outin paragraph 11 of CP. (46) 95; and invited him toconsider what further steps might be taken to bring tothe attention of the French people the assistance which HisMajesty&apos;s Government were giving towards the restorationof the French Navy.Purchase        10.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord PresidentCotton.       (CP. (46) 102) covering a memorandum submitted to the lord presidents Committee by the President of the Board of Trade onthe future arrangements for the purchase of raw cotton.The Lord President said that at their meeting on the 8th March(L.P. (46) 9th Meeting, Minute 2) the Lord Presidents Committeehad accepted the proposal, made by the President of the Boardof Trade, that the system of central bulk purchase of cotton shouldbe continued on a permanent basis with such necessary adaptationsas might be found necessary.The President of the Board of Trade said that the Cotton Con-trol had discharged its tasks very efficiently during the war, and none of the evidence which he had received gave him any reason to doubt the ability of the Control to handle this problem withequal success under peace-time conditions.The Minister of Sup-ply and of Aircraft Production stressed the point, made in paragraph 5 of CP. (46) 102, that it would benecessary to consider the organisation of each commodity market onits merits and that a decision to continue the central bulk purchaseof cotton should not be regarded as pre-judging the future of othercommodity markets.   This was agreed.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the question hadbeen raised whether the announcement of the decision to continuea system of central bulk purchase should be deferred in view ofthe proceedings in Congress in connection with the proposed loan from the United States.   He would like to consult Lord Halifax
Admission ofWomen to theForeignService.on this point but he would try to ascertain his views in time toenable the President of the Board of Trade to make the announce-ment, if it was not to be deferred on the 18th March.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the recommendation of the Lord Presidents&apos;Committee that the system of central bulk purchase ofcotton should be continued with such necessary adapta-tions as might be found to be necessary.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in ^ consultationwith the Foreign Secretary and the President of theBoard of Trade, to ascertain from Lord Halifaxwhether, in view of its possible effect on proceedings in congress in connection with the United States loan, anannouncement of this decision should be postponed forthe present.11. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (46) 70) covering a report by the Committee whichhe had appointed in 1945 to re-examine the question of admittingwomen to the Foreign Service.This report recommended that, on the assumption that a generalmarriage bar would be imposed which the Secretary of State wouldwaive in exceptional circumstances, women should be equallyeligible with men for admission to the Foreign Service. In order,however, to safeguard the Service against a sudden disproportionateinflow of women recruits, it proposed that the numbers recruitedduring the reconstruction period should be limited to a maximum of 10 per cent, of the total admitted from the reconstruction corn-petition. It also recommended that the suitability of women for service in posts hitherto regarded as insalubrious or otherwise of doubtful suitability should be put to an early test and that thereshould be no discrimination in their posting.On this last point the Foreign Secretary said that, while he agreed that no discrimination should be made, he could not agreethat the interests of our effective representation abroad should be subordinated to the need for ascertaining by practical test whetherwomen could serve effectively in any post abroad. This reservation,however, did not imply that, in posting, women would be treated in any way differently from men.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that theprinciples adopted for the Foreign Service would be accepted forthe Dominions Office and the Dominions Service. It was suggestedthat the Secretary of State for the Colonies should consider whetherwomen should be similarly admitted to the Colonial Service.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to announce his acceptance of the recommendations of the report annexed to CP. (46) 70 on the admission of women to the foreign service.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to considerthe possibility of admitting women to the colonial service. ^Tourist Traffic 12.   At their meeting on the 20th November (CM. (45) 54thfrom the Conclusions, Minute 5) the Cahinet had agreed that a CommitteeUnited States, under the Chairmanship of the Secretary of Department of Overseas(Previous Trade should consider whether a practical scheme could be devisedEef erence: to encourage American visitors to come to this country during the cm. (45) 54th   summer of 1946.Conclusions, The Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by the minute 5.) Secretary of Department of Overseas Trade (CP. (46) 66)reporting (i) that it was inadvisable that there should be any government sponsorship of tourist traffic in 1946, in view of the
lack of suitable accommodation and other facilities; but (ii) thatas far as possible Government assistance should be given, where necessary, in an unobtrusive way to those organisations that hadalready planned to accommodate overseas visitors in 1946.The Secretary of the Department of Overseas Trade said that,after a thorough study of the possibilities of providing accommo-dation, the Committee had come to the conclusion that the futureof the tourist trade might be prejudiced if tourists were officiallyencouraged to visit this country in 1946, and that any such officialencouragement would give rise to public criticism, in view of thepresent grave shortage of accommodation. On the other hand, they recommended that every possible effort should be made to stimu-late and encourage visits by foreign tourists in 1947. Action tothis end should be based on the recommendations of the official committee under Treasury Chairmanship, which was now con-sidering a report from the Catering Wages Commission on holidayaccommodation and would be submitting recommendations aboutthe future of the travel associations and the proposal that a single department should be made responsible for sponsoring the hoteland catering industry.. The Minister of Education urged that further consideration should be given to the possibility of accommodating a certainnumber of visitors from the United States in public schools. would it not be possible for the Board of Trade to release the necessarysupplies of crockery and linen and for the domestic staff requiredto be drawn from the Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services?The President of the Board of Trade said that, after meetingthe requirements of hotels and hostels in this country, it wouldbe impossible to spare any linen or crockery for such a scheme in1946.The Foreign Secretary said that, while he reluctantly acceptedthe conclusion that it would be undesirable to encourage visitorsfrom the United States in 1946, he hoped that the preparationof a scheme for 1947 would be pursued energetically. The help of organisations such as the Workers&apos; Travel Association, the HolidayFellowship, the Youth Hostels Association and the National HostelsService Corporation should be enlisted, and the possibility of accommodating visitors in hostels and troopships should be explored.Other points in discussion were:  (a) The possibility should be explored of using living accom-modation built for the Services during the war.(6) It would be greatly to our interest to provide accommo-dation for students from overseas who wished to take post-graduatemedical courses in this country.(c) In reckoning the amount of available accommodation inthis country in 1947, account should be taken of the continuing need to provide accommodation for prisoners of war employed in agri-culture.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that it would be undesirable to give officialencouragement to tourists to visit the United kingdom in 1946.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would consider theappointment of a Ministerial committee to formulateproposals for encouraging the maximum tourist trade tothis country in 1947.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,11th March, 1946.
