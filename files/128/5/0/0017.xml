1.   The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the business-which it was proposed to take in the House of Commons during thefollowing week.On the 25th February the general debate on A griculhire wouldbe concluded; and the Second Reading of the Agricultural Decelop-ment (Ploughing-up of Land) Bill, would be taken. Subject tofurther discussion between the Minister of Agriculture and theSecretary of State for Scotland, it was provisionally agreed that theGovernment speakers on the Bill should be the Secretary of Statefor Scotland and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry ofAgriculture.On the 26th February a start would be made with the committee stage of the Trade Unions and Trade Disputes Bill. It wouldprobably be found necessary to devote a further one or two days tothis at a later stage in the Session.On the 27th and 28th February there would be a debate, in committee of Supply, on the Reallocation of Man-Power andEconomic Affairs. This would afford an opportunity for theGovernment spokesmen to make the general statements about thecountry&apos;s economic position in 1946, which would be the starting point of the publicity campaign discussed by the Cabinet at their meeting on the 7th February (CM. (46) 13th Conclusions, Minute 3).The Prime Minister would speak on the first day of the debate; onthe second day the Lord President would make the opening speech,and the President of the Board of Trade would reply to the debate.On the 1st March it was hoped that, with the agreement of theOpposition, progress would be made with the MiscellaneousFinancial Provisions Bill and a number of other Bills.2.   The Secretary of State for the Colonies brought to the noticeof the Cabinet a telegram (No. 281 of the 19th February) which hehad received from the High Commissioner of Palestine.   The tele-gram (which was read out to the Cabinet) reported a speech madeby Shertok on the 13th February, which could have been made thebasis of a charge of sedition and would in any event have warrantedShertok&apos;s detention under the Defence (Emergency) Regulations,1945.   As the Anglo-American Commission of Enquiry was shortly to arrive in Palestine and as Shertok bad announced in his speech that the Jewish Agency would give evidence before the Commission,the High Commissioner had decided to take no immediate actionagainst Shertok.   He reported, however, that relations with the agency were becoming increasingly difficult.   Their attitude hadencouraged terrorist organisations and, now that they could notdraw back without losing their authority over the Jewish com-munity, they were being forced to even greater lengths of extremism.Though they continued to express their dislike of terrorism, therewas some evidence that they had advance knowledge of most of the terrorist incidents which had taken place, and there were also indi-cations that they had been considering breaking off relations with theGovernment.   There was a widespread belief in Palestine that HisMajesty&apos;s Government would always give way to force: and on this account both the Jewish Agency and the Jewish community generallyseemed disposed to condone terrorism.   The High Commissionerbelieved, however, that neither the Agency nor the Arabs would takeovert action before the Anglo-American Commission had concludedtheir enquiries.The Prime Minister said that the situation described in this telegram was grave; and it was desirable that the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies in his speech in the debate on Palestine which was taking place in the House of Commons that day, should repeat andemphasise the warning already given that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would not be coerced by terrorist threats.Some discussion followed about the probable course of the debate. There was some reason to believe that the Opposition might seek to discuss the problems which had been remitted to the Anglo-American Commission of Enquiry.   It was most undesirable that-5] b 2
these should be discussed in Parliament while the enquiry was proceeding, especially as the enquiry was being made by an Anglo-1American Commission. The Secretary of State for the Colonies fundertook to hold further consultations with Opposition Leaders Iwith a view to dissuading them from raising these issues in the Idebate.Jamaica. 3.   The Secretary of State for the Colonies informed theIndustrial Cabinet of industrial disturbances in Jamaica. About twenty livesDisturbances,   had been lost as a result of the industrial disturbances of the last fewdays, but the position now seemed to be under control.The fundamental cause of the disturbances was the differences which had arisen between the Trade Union Congress and theIndustrial Trade Union, of which Mr. Bustamante, the PrimeMinister of Jamaica, was the leader.GovernmentPublicityService.(previous reference:CM. (46) 16thConclusions.Minute 8.)MinisterialResponsibilityfor the .B.B.C.4. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the note by theLord President (CP. (46) 54) on the future organisation of Govern-ment publicity.The-Lord President said that one of the two questions on whichthe official Committee had been unable to agree was that of Minis-terial responsibility for the B.B.C., It was common ground that responsibility on technical matters should continue to rest with thePostmaster-General. For more general matters, however, includingParliamentary responsibility for the Broadcasting Vote, the choicelay between a non-Departmental Minister (viz., the Chairman of thetwo Ministerial Committees on Information Services) and the Post-master-General. If a non-Departmental Minister were made responsible for the Broadcasting Vote, the bead of the Central Officeof Information would presumably be made the accounting officer and his staff would have to be enlarged for that purpose. The lord president said that, on the whole, he was in favour of placingMinisterial responsibility on the Postmaster-General, on the under-standing that arrangements would be made to bring in the Chairmanof the Ministerial&quot;&quot; Committees on Information Services when matters of general policy arose.The official Committee had recommended that, to the extent that the Government accepted responsibility for the policy behindoverseas broadcasting services, that responsibility should beexercised through the Ministers in charge of overseas Departments.In his view the B.B.C should be independent in the field of overseasbroadcasting, though it should be clearly understood that theywould be expected to maintain the closest possible liaison with the overseas Departments and particularly with the Foreign Office.The Postmaster-General said that he saw no practical difficultyin working an arrangement under which responsibility would reston the Postmaster-General for day-to-day matters, Avith a non-Departmental Minister in reserve to deal with matters of generalpolicy, though great care would be necessary to ensure that this did not lead to confusion in the minds of Parliament and the public.If he were to become responsible for the Broadcasting Vote, it wouldbe necessary to strengthen the accounting staff of the Post Office.The Foreign Secretary said that he did not desire foreignbroadcasting to be controlled by the Foreign Office. He was anxiousto establish the independent status of the B.B.C., particularly since he was relying on the B.B.C. to build up a trustworthy foreign newsservice.In further discussion the view was expressed that, if Parlia-ment were informed that a particular non-Departmental minister would be responsible for questions of general policy connected withthe B.B.C., it would be assumed that the Government was taking a much greater measure of control over the B.B.C. than it had inthe past, many more Parliamentary Questions would be asked about
the B.B.C., and it would be difficult to avoid having these addressedto that Minister. It would be preferable, therefore, to preserve the formal position that Questions on matters of high policy affectingthe B.B.C. should be addressed to the Prime Minister, and thatany other Questions regarding the .B.B.C should continue to beaddressed to the Postmaster-General. The non-departmental minister responsible for the Central Office of Information could then assist in debates about the B.B.C., but would have no respon-sibility for answering Parliamentary Questions, unless on occasionhe replied by arrangement to a Question addressed to the PrimeMinister.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Postmaster-General should be responsible to Parliament for the broadcasting vote, on the under-standing that in debates on questions of general policyhe would have the assistance of the non-departmental minister responsible for the Central Office of Informa-tion, and that Parliamentary Questions would be dealt,with as stated above.The Lord President said that the next question for decision was whether the British Council should be abolished entirely orwhether it should be restricted to educational and cultural activities and subjected to more effective control in its expenditure and administration. If it were decided that the Council should continue,it should in future obtain all its publicity material through theCentral Office of Information and should not carry on activitiesoverlapping with those of the Central Office.The Foreign Secretary said that he had at first been inclined to recommend that the British Council should be replaced by a new government Department, under a Civil Service controller directly responsible to himself, with recruitment and conditions of service on Civil Service lines. He was, however, prepared to accept the compromise set out in paragraphs 32-34 of the Report of the official committee, provided that the continuance of the Council were brought up for review after a period of five years. He believedthat in time it might be possible for the Consular Service to takeover many of the functions now discharged by the British Counciland it might tihen be possible to abolish the Council. Meanwhile, he must be kept fully informed in advance of the policy which theCouncil were pursuing.Points in discussion were :  (a) The Secretary of State for the Colonies agreed that theBritish Council should be continued for a limited period. He hopedthat there would continue to be a separate allocation of its grant-in-aid for work in the Colonies.(b) The Minister of Health stressed the importance of notsubjecting the British Council to rigid Foreign Office control. Thework which it was set up to do could not be carried out by a Govern-ment Department, and if its agents were subordinated to theForeign Office representatives abroad they would be unable to dowork of any value.(c) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs favoured thecontinuance of the Council for a limited period, on the under-standing that it would be restricted to educational and culturalactivities.(d) It was pointed out that, unless it was possible to offercontracts for a period of, say, 3-5 years, the Government could not expect to recruit suitable staff for the British Council.The Cabinet (2) Agreed that the British Council should be continued fora period of 5 years, on the understanding that there[31507-5] B future ofthe british council.
Position ofServiceDepartmentsin Relation tothe CentralOrganisationforGovernmentPublicity.Supply of books on theBritishCommon-wealth.should be a closer scrutiny of its projected activities,that it should no longer have authority to do its own production or procurement work, and that its scopeshould be restricted to educational and cultural workand should not overlap with the Governments Informa-tion Services.The Cabinet next considered a memorandum by the First Lordof the Admiralty (CP. (46) 72) suggesting that the Central Officeof Information should exercise no controlling function in respectof publicity by the Service Departments, but that at least one ofthe Service Departments should be represented on the HomeInformation Services Official Committee.The Prims Minister pointed out that the Cabinet had already approved (CM. (46) 16th Conclusions, Minute 8) the recommenda-tion, made in paragraph 6 of the Report of the official Committeeannexed to CP. (46) 54, that any case in which a Departmentbelieved that particular tasks within the scope of the Central office could be better performed by themselves should be considered onits merits and, if necessary, decided by the appropriate ministerial committee. In these circumstances, the first of the two suggestions made in CP. (46) 72 appeared to be premature. The second of thetwo suggestions would be considered when the time came to appoint the Committee.The Foreign Secretary said that he had been impressed by theextent to which foreign countries and particularly Russia depended for their information about the British Commonwealthon works written in the 19th century, which gave a misleading impression of the principles on which the Commonwealth was now-based. It was urgently necessary to increase the supply of up-to-date works of scholarly quality which would dispel this impression.In discussion there was general support for this view.The Cabinet-(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to ask the overseas information Services Committees, as soon as they were appointed, to consider what steps should be taken toincrease the supply of up-to-date books about the BritishCommonwealth.Political 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordBroadcasting. Privy Seal (CP. (46) 48) to which were annexed (i) an aide-memoire(Previous used by the Lord Privy Seal and the Lord Chancellor in their reference: resumed negotiations with the Chairman and Director-General ofC.M.(45)64th the B.B.C. on the question of political broadcasting and (ii) a copyConclusions, of a letter from the Director-General of the B.B.C. confirming the minute 2.) line taken by the Chairman and himself in the negotiations.The Cabinet-Approved the outcome of the negotiations undertaken bythe Lord Privy Seal and the Lord Chancellor, and agreedthat discussions should now take place with the Opposition.Divorce.ServiceDivorce Cases.(previous reference:C.M.(45)34thConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordChancellor (CP. (46) 56) covering a report on Service divorce casesby the Committee on the Reform of Legal Procedure.The Lord Chancellor said that, under special schemes set upin 1942 for assisting men and women in the Services who wishedto obtain divorces, over 43,000 applications had been made up to theend of 1945, and about 36,000 of these applications had not yet been cleared. The delays arose mainly in connection with the issue of certificates by the Poor Persons Committee of the Law Society and
the preparation of cases by the Services Divorce Department. Itwas, therefore, recommended that the procedure should now besimplified by dispensing with the need for the formal issue of a poorpersons certificate; and also that the Ministers of Works and labour should make special efforts to provide the accommodation and staff required for the expansion of the Services Divorce Department.The Committee also recommend that, as temporary measure, Com-missioners of Assize should be appointed under Section 70 of theJudicature Act of 1925. These measures were proposed with the aim of clearing off the arrears of Service divorce cases within twoyears.The Minister of Labour said that he would do what he could to provide additional staff for the Services Divorce Department, butit must be realised that there was an acute shortage of shorthand-writers and typists. The problem was one which affected the publicservice as a whole and, although he was trying to remedy it by pro-viding courses of training, the basic difficulty was that the publicservice was in competition with private firms who were offeringvery high rates of pay.In discussion, it was recalled that the Chancellor of theExchequer, the Minister of Labour and the Minister of Works hadbeen asked by the Cabinet to consider the question of improving thelevel of wages paid to junior staff in the Civil Service (CM. (46)13th Conclusions, Minute 4). While the Civil Service obviouslycould not offer the same rates as were now being offered by someprivate firms, a modest improvement in the rates paid should be enough to improve recruitment, since many potential recruits wouldbe attracted by the relative security of employment in the CivilService.The Minister of Works said that he might have to resort torequisitioning in order to find premises for the Services DivorceDepartment in the big provincial towns. In London, the claim for accommodation in the neighbourhood of Clements Inn competedwith the needs of other Government Departments. If, however,the Cabinet considered that the claims of the Services DivorceDepartment were equally urgent, he would proceed accordingly.He had already taken steps to provide temporary additional accom-modation for the Divorce Registry in London.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the preparation of Service divorce cases shouldcontinue to be the responsibility of the Services DivorceDepartment of the Law Society and that the procedure should be simplified by dispensing with the formal issueof poor persons certificates by the Poor Persons Com-mittee of the Law Society.(2) Authorised the Minister of Works to provide accom-modation for the Services Divorce Department on thescale indicated in paragraph 10 (a) of the Annex to cp. (46) 56 as a matter of high priority.(3) Invited the Minister of Labour to consider what could bedone to supply the Services Divorce Department withthe requisite staff in London and the provinces.(4) Agreed that the cost of the expanded service of the ServicesDivOrce Department should be met out of public funds.(5) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to expediteconsideration of the question of improved rates of pay for junior staff in the Civil Service.7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofWar Transport (CP. (46) 67) proposing that the Queen Elizabethshould be released from trooping service after the completion of her present voyage, so that she could be reconditioned for the north atlantic passenger service.
The following were the main points raised in discussion ofthis proposal : -(a) The Queen Elizabeth had been used for the repatriation of Canadian troops from this country, but after her present voyagethe flow of this traffic would not be such as to justify her furtheruse in this service. The only Government service on which she could then be employed in the North Atlantic would be the repatriation of the wives and families of Canadian troops; but she could notbe used on this service until April, as New York was the only north american port which she could use during the winter months andthe Canadians were unwilling to handle this traffic through theUnited States. Moreover, shipping had already been allocated forthe movement of Canadian families to the limit of the rate at whichthe Canadian administrative machine could handle them.(b) Could the Queen Elizabeth be used for other troopingmovements ?The Cabinet were informed that she could not pass through the suez Canal and the only ports which she could use in eastern waterswere Trincomalee, Singapore and Sydney. It would be uneconomicto bring troops to these ports for trans-shipment. There would alsobe serious difficulties in bunkering for such a voyage; and, if she were used on such a service, her efficiency would be halved. Theshipping plans already made were adequate to cover the existing programmes of the Services for the repatriation of troops fromthe East.The Secretary of State for War said, that it was intendedshortly to reduce the period of overseas service in the East; andit should be borne in mind that this might have the result ofincreasing the shipping demands for trooping from the East.(c) Attention was drawn to the shortage of passenger shipping for civilian purposes.The drive for increased exports was being hampered by thedifficulty of finding sea passages for people whom British firmswished to send abroad. There was great difficulty in obtainingpassages for civilians to and from India. And there was a largeunsatisfied demand for sea passages to this country from canada and other Dominions.The Minister of War Transport said that the return of the queen Elizabeth to normal passenger traffic in the North Atlanticwould help indirectly to relieve this pressure.(d) The Prime Minister asked what class of traffic the queen elizabeth would carry if she were returned to the North Atlanticservice. It was questionable whether there would be the same scope for luxury traffic as there had been before the war. In any event,was it justifiable to use, in the reconversion of a luxury liner,resources of labour and materials which might be applied to the reconditioning of smaller passenger ships or the construction of cargo liners?There was general support for the view that, if this ship wasto be reconverted for civilian passenger traffic, she should be adapted to carry a larger number of passengers at a lower cost per headthan the Queen Mary had carried before the war.(e) To &quot;what extent would the reconversion of the queen elizabeth compete, in labour and materials, with repair or new construction of smaller vessels ? It was stated in the memorandum that her reconversion would take at least six months. What wasthe total commitment, in terms of skilled men of various trades,and materials of various kinds?There might also be a conflict with the house-building pro-gramme. Carpenters and electricians would presumably be requiredfor this reconversion work; and special efforts were now being madeto withdraw this type of labour from the ship-yards.These points should be fully discussed with the Admiralty andthe Ministry of Labour before a final decision was taken.
Germany. 8.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Home Secre-Proposal to tary (C.P. (46) 51) regarding a proposal that about 10,000 GermanBring German children should be brought to this country by air, for a period ofChildren to six months, under the auspices of an organisation known as thethe United      Children of Europe Air Rescue.Kingdom. This proposal had been examined by a conference of theDepartments concerned; and their objections to the scheme were summarised in paragraph 3 of the memorandum.The Cabinet-Endorsed the. Home Secretary&apos;s recommendation that thisproposal should be rejected; and invited him to communi-cate this decision to Air Vice-Marshal Champion deCrespigny, who had sponsored the scheme.international labour organisation.AmendmentofConstitution.(previous reference:CM. (45)40thConclusions,Minute 2.)9. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Ministerof Labour (CP. (46) 60) covering the draft of a White Paper out-lining the action to be taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government regardingthe Instrument for the amendment of the constitution of the Inter-national Labour Organisation, which had been adopted at theInternational Labour Conference in November, 1945.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Labour to present to Parlia-ment a White Paper in the terms of the draft annexed to CP. (46) 60;(2) Agreed that this and similar Instruments of the Inter-national Labour Organisation should, in future, be rati-fied by an Instrument signed by the Foreign secretary and not, as hitherto, by an Order in Council.India. 10.   The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the CabinetMutiny in that mutiny had occurred in certain vessels of the Royal IndianRoyal Indian Navy at Bombay. The Flag Officer-in-Charge, Royal Indian Navy,Navy. had signalled that ratings had seized the ships and were threateningthe  shore,   and  he  was   asking  urgently  for   reinforcements.H.M.S. Glasgow and two smaller vessels of the Royal Navy were proceeding with all speed to Bombay.It was the view of the Cabinet that, before approval could be 8 &amp;given to the proposal put forward in CP. (46) 67, further informa-tion was needed on the points noted in paragraphs (d) and (e) above.These should be considered in detail by the Lord Presidents Com-mittee. If, in the result, it was decided that the Queen Elizabethshould be reconditioned for passenger traffic in the North Atlantic,the form in which the decision was announced should be very carefully considered. It must be made clear that the release ofthis vessel from trooping service would not prejudice either theprogramme of repatriation to Canada or the movement of Britishtroops from the Far East. And, from the point of view of thegeneral public, a full justification should be given for using ourlimited resources at the present time on the reconditioning of aluxury liner.The Cabinet -Invited the Lord President to arrange for the points noted in paragraphs (d) and (e) above to be considered at an early meeting of the Lord Presidents Committee; and asked that a further report should thereafter be made to theCabinet.
On the information at present available it seemed that dis-tnrbances at R.A.F. Stations in India had been followed by similardemonstrations at Shore Signal Stations of the Royal Indian AirForce and the trouble had now spread to the Royal Indian Navy.The First Lord of the Admiralty undertook to arrange for theFirst Sea Lord to report the latest information about the positionto the Prime Minister before the House of Commons met that after-noon.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,21st February, 1946.
