The Foreign Secretary gave the Cabinet an account of theproceedings at the recent meeting of Foreign Ministers in Moscow.(a) One of the main purposes of the meeting had been to seekmeans of overcoming the deadlock reached at the first meeting ofthe Council of Foreign Ministers in September regarding theprocedure for preparing Peace Treaties with ex-enemy States inEurope. The Russians had insisted that the initial work - of preparing draft Treaties should be undertaken by the Statessignatory to the relevant Armistice Terms; and Mr. Byrnes had repeated the proposal, which he had made at the end of the Londonmeeting, that the drafts so prepared should be submitted fordiscussion at a Conference attended by representatives of the powers which had made a substantial military contribution towards theAllied victory. This proposal had been accepted in principle, andit had been agreed that this Conference should have full rights todiscuss and amend the draft Treaties submitted to them. difficulty had arisen over the list of States to be represented at this Con-ference. The Russians had suggested that, if India were to beinvited, they would have to insist on the inclusion of the three BalticRepublics. After the Cabinefs discussion on the 20th December,the Foreign Secretary had made it clear that he must insist on theinclusion of India and had indicated that he would, if necessary,be prepared to acquiesce in the inclusion of the three BalticRepublics. This had led Mr. Byrnes to represent to the Russiansthat the inclusion of the Baltic Republics would be very embarrassing to the United States; and in the result M. Molotovhad withdrawn both his opposition to the inclusion of India andhis suggestion that the three Baltic Republics should also be invitedto the Conference. The conclusion thus reached on this point hadbeen wholly satisfactory from our point of view.The Foreign Secretary said that he was still awaiting the viewsof the French Government on the new proposals, agreed upon bythe Powers represented at Moscow, for preparing the peace settle-ments with ex-enemy States in Europe.(b) At the outset of the discussions in Moscow it had become clear that there had been much previous consultation between theUnited States and Soviet Governments regarding the means bywhich the Soviet Government might participate in the controlJapan. While there was room for separate representationinterested Commonwealth Governments on the Commission&quot;Washington, there was no prospect of securing that more than one member of the British Commonwealth should be represented on theAllied Council in Tokyo. After the Cabinefs discussion on the20th December the Foreign Secretary had therefore suggested that australia should be a member of this Council, on the understandingthat the Australian member would represent the interests, not only of Australia, but of the United Kingdom, India and New Zealand.The Foreign Secretary added that it seemed doubtful whetherthe Australian people were likely to show so keen an interest in thecontrol of Japan as had been implied by the claims hitherto madeby the Australian Government. Australia seemed to be findingdifficulty in providing her contribution towards the CommonwealthForce for the occupation of Japan.(c) Mr. Byrnes had put forward proposals for establishingKorea as an independent State within a period of five years; and ithad been agreed that there should be submitted to the united nations Organisation proposals for placing the territory meanwhileunder four-Power trusteeship. The Foreign Secretary thought itwould be advantageous if the British Commonwealths share in thistrusteeship were undertaken by Australia.(d) Mr. Byrnes had raised the question of the withdrawal ofRussian troops from Manchuria. It had appeared that it was atthe request of the Chinese that these troops had remained in Man-churia beyond the date originally fixed for their withdrawal, andthe Russians were clearly reluctant to withdraw them until theUnited States troops had been withdrawn from North China.   Theofofin[31201-1]b 2
Balkan States.(previous reference:W.M.(45)27thConclusions,Minute 1.)Persia.(previous reference:CM. (45)38thConclusions,Minute 6.)difficulty arose from the existence of a Communist Government in north China; and it was suggested during the discussions that this might be overcome by arranging for the Chinese Communists to berepresented in Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s Government. The first proposals put forward by the Soviet Government to this end had provided forCommunist representation, not only in the central Government, butthroughout the Government machine. The Foreign Secretary had opposed this; and agreement had eventually been reached on proposals by which the Communists would be represented only inthe central Government.The Foreign Secretary said that he had found it embarrassing to discuss these matters at a meeting at which China was not represented.(e) The Foreign Secretary outlined the earlier history of thedisagreement between the three Great Powers about the recognitionof the existing Governments in Bulgaria and Roumania. For sometime past he had doubted whether it would be practicable to main-tain the uncompromising attitude which the United States Govern-ment had first adopted in this matter at the Berlin Conference. Inhis view, the more practical policy would be to develop our contacts with those countries, by the appointment of Consuls, the establish-ment of air services, and the opening up of commercial relations.He had, therefore, gone to Moscow with the hope of finding meansof resolving the deadlock which had arisen over the question of diplomatic recognition. In these circumstances he &quot;welcomed theagreement reached, whereby the United Kingdom and United states government had undertaken to re-establish diplomatic relationswith Roumania on being satisfied, by the report of a tripartite Corn-mission, that satisfactory steps had been taken to add to the existing government representatives of two of the Liberal parties in roumania. This Commission had already gone to Roumania; andhe had little doubt that they would shortly submit a report whichwould enable His Majesty&apos;s Government to re-establish diplomatic relations with the Roumanian Government.A somewhat similar agreement had been conluded in respect of bulgaria in circumstances which indicated that the Soviet Govern-ment had been anxious to reach agreement with the other great powers on this question.(/) The Foreign Secretary gave the Cabinet an account of a conversation which he had had with Marshal Stalin about thepolicy of the Soviet Government towards Persia. He said that theCabinet should be aware that, under a Treaty concluded in 1921,Russia was entitled in certain circumstances to send troops intoPersia, and he undertook to circulate to the Cabinet furtherinformation about this Treaty. It was also relevant that thePersian Government had never carried into effect the provision inthe Persian Constitution for the establishment of provincialcouncils.As a result of these informal consultations, the Foreign Secre-tary had put forward proposals for the appointment of a tripartiteCommission for Persian questions, based on the fact that whileAllied troops had been stationed in Persia the Persian economy and Governmental organisation had been disturbed and difficulties had arisen between the central Government and the inhabitants ofcertain provinces. It would be the business of this Commission todeal, inter alia, with the question of accelerating as far as possiblethe withdrawal of Allied troops from Persia; and to advise and assist the Persian Government in establishing provincial councils in accordance with the Persian Constitution. Marshal Stalin had at first indicated that these proposals might form the basis of asettlement; but subsequently M. Molotov had said that the SovietGovernment were not prepared to continue discussing the matter on this basis and the discussions had been broken off.The Foreign Secretary said that he had considered very seriously whether he should withhold his final agreement on theother questions on the Agenda until some settlement of the Persianquestion was reached; but he had come to the conclusion that he

(45) 63rdConclusions,Minute 4.)would not be justified in sacrificing the other settlements on this account. He had, therefore, instructed His Majesty&apos;s ambassador at Tehran to put these proposals before the Persian Government;and, if the Persian Government were ready to accept them, hewould re-open the matter with the Soviet and United states government through the diplomatic channel.Meanwhile the Persian Ambassador in London had suggestedthat his Governments difficulties with the Soviet Government mightbe brought before the United Nations Organisation. The foreign secretary doubted whether in present circumstances this would produce satisfactory results, and he was disposed to advise thePersian Government not to bring the matter before the united nations.(g) In the course of informal conversations Marshal stalin had expressed the view that British troops should be withdrawnfrom Greece. The Foreign Secretary had taken the opportunityof explaining British policy in Greece and had made it clear thatwe intended to maintain our troops there until free elections couldbe held and the economic and political situation could be stabilised.(h) The Foreign Secretary said that the proposals originallyput forward by Mr. Byrnes for the establishment of the proposed commission on the Control of Atomic Energy had not includedany provision, on the lines of paragraph 8 of the WashingtonDeclaration, for the work of the Commission to proceed by separatestages. Mr. Byrnes had apparently thought that this part of theWashington Declaration would not be acceptable to the SovietGovernment. The Foreign Secretary had indicated that he couldnot agree to any proposals wnich omitted provisions on the lines ofthis paragraph; and the Soviet Government had agreed that such provisions should be included.The Soviet Government had at first claimed that the wholeof the work of the Commission should be brought under the security council. The Foreign Secretary had opposed this; and had pre-prevailed upon M. Molotov to abandon this claim. As regardspublicity, it had been agreed that the Commission^ reports shouldbe published unless the Security Council decided against publica-tion on security grounds. This meant that every report would bepublished unless there was unanimous agreement on the security council that it should not be published.Other statements made by the Foreign Secretary regarding theproceedings at the Moscow Conference, and points raised in thecourse of the discussion which followed, are recorded in the Secre-tary&apos;s Standard File of Cabinet Conclusions.The Prime Minister thanked the Foreign Secretary for his full account of the Moscow discussions and congratulated him, onbehalf of the Cabinet, on the success of his mission.2. The Prime Minister gave the Cabinet an account of his interview on the 27th December with a delegation from the Nether-lands including the Dutch Prime Minister, his Colonial Ministerand Dr. van Mook.At this meeting there had been a full and frank exchange of views, and the Dutch Ministers had made an excellent impression.Dr. van Mook had also appeared to take a very broad-minded viewof the Indonesian problem.The Dutch Ministers had presented a document containing con-crete proposals for a new Indonesian Constitution on the basis of a federation between the Netherlands and Indonesia. These pro-posals seemed to be very satisfactory. It was the intention that dr. van Mook should return to Batavia early in January to discuss[31201-1]b 3
them with Indonesian leaders; if they accepted the proposals inprinciple, they would be invited to form a delegation to proceed tothe Hague to discuss the plan in detail.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Ministers statement.Palestine.(previous reference erence:CM. (45) 52ndConclusions,Minute 7.)3. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the&apos;Colonies gave the Cabinet the latest information about the series ofterrorist attacks which had taken place on the 27th December on police and military buildings in Jerusalem and Tel-Aviv, in thecourse of which ten policemen and soldiers had been killed and elevenwounded. Intensive searches were being made for individuals concerned in the attacks and for arms. It was, however, the present policy that there should be no general search for arms throughoutPalestine; and the High Commissioner did not recommend that sucha general search should be instituted now, as it would be likely tocreate conditions in which the Anglo-American Commission couldnot carry out its work in Palestine. The High Commissioner had considered whether any intermediate measures could be undertaken,such as the imposition of collective fines; but he had reached theconclusion that such measures were impracticable.The High Commissioner had seen Mr. Ben Gurion andMr. Shertok, the leading members of the Jewish Agency now inPalestine. They had dissociated themselves entirely from the terrorist attacks, but had made it clear that the Agency were unableto assist in preventing such incidents while His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment pursued their present policy; and they had subsequently issued a public statement to this effect. Under the Mandate, it was one ofthe basic conditions of the special status given to the Jewish Agencythat it should co-operate with the Government; and if it was nowunable to co-operate in ensuring the observance of the law, this basiccondition was not being observed. The High Commissionerconsidered that the defiant attitude of the Agency could not be ignored and that retaliatory action should be taken against them.He had it in mind that the Agency&apos;s buildings should be occupiedand that the members of the Executive should be placed under policesupervision.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Coloniesthought that the disadvantages of taking such a course stilloutweighed the advantages. It would throw power into the handsof the extremists, would produce a strong reaction in the UnitedStates and, above all, would make it impossible for the Anglo-American Commission to carry out its work in Palestine.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that, if theCabinet had to decide to take strong measures against the jewish community or the Agency, adequate military forces would beavailable to deal with the situation.In further discussion, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary ofState for the Colonies said that the limit of 75,000 immigrantspermitted under the White Paper of 1939 had virtually beenreached, but the agreement of the Arab States to the continuance of immigration beyond that figure had not yet been obtained.Attention was called to a suggestion made by the High Commissionerthat Jewish support of illegal immigration arose largely from thedesire that Jews from Europe should be able to join their relativesin Palestine. The High Commissioner thought that this might afford an opportunity to make a humanitarian gesture. Certain Ministerssuggested that an approach on these lines might be sympatheticallyreceived by the Arabs.It was the general feeling of the Cabinet that immigrationcould not at this moment cease altogether. While it was right to consult the Arab States and to endeavour to obtain their concurrence
(1)(2)(3)(4)Endorsed the view that at the present juncture there shouldbe no wholesale search for arms throughout Palestine.Agreed that the moment was not opportune to take active measures against the Jewish Agency on the lines suggested by the High Commissioner.Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to expedite his approach to the Arab Governments witha view to obtaining their consent to the continuance forthe present of immigration to Palestine at the rate of1,500 a month, on the understanding that immigrantswould be limited. to those who were near relatives ofpersons already in Palestine.Took note that in the meanwhile immigration at the existingrate should not in fact be stopped.World wheat supplies.(Previous .Reference:CM. (45)61stConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofFood (CP. (45) 348) regarding world wheat supplies.The Minister of A griculture, on behalf of the Minister of Food,said that the position was extremely serious. According to the latest figures, the claims made by importing countries for the first sixmonths of 1946 amounted to approximately 19 million tons of wheator flour (wheat equivalent) while the available supply was estimatedat between 11-7 and 12-3 million tons, leaving a deficiency of about million tons. It was doubtful whether supplies could exceed this estimate. Some of the demands were probably swollen, but even when this was taken into account a large deficiency remained.Further cuts would be inevitable.The Minister of Food had therefore been anxious to bring the seriousness of the situation to the notice of his colleagues and tohave their authority to take the following line during his forth-coming visit to Washington : (i) to make strong representations to the United States Govern-ment to maximise exports by according full priority to the collection and movement of grain from the farm to the seaboard and by taking such steps as may be necessary, e.g., requisitioning from farmers and traders, to ensure a flow of wheat sufficient fully to take up themaximum export capacity of the United States;(ii) to discuss with the United States Government, and to secure their agreement to, the provision to Argentina of sufficient coal,oil fuel and motor tyres, spare parts and road vehicles to enable theArgentine Government to free and export the maximum quantityof grain;(iii) to secure the agreement of the United States and canadian government&apos;s to the proposal that the responsibility of bringing the wheat account into equilibrium shall be borne by the combined food Board.The Minister had set out in Appendix II of his memorandum the kind of adjustment which he felt would be practicable.It was not desired to proceed at the moment with the suggestion in paragraph 15 of the memorandum that the Prime Minister shouldbe invited to appeal to the Prime Minister of Australia for increased exports from Australia. The Minister of Food had alreadyapproached the Australian Government and it was thought prefer-able to await the result of this approach before considering further steps.Points made in discussion were : (a) The Prime Minister said that the Minister of Food had also asked him to send a telegram to the President of the UnitedStates inviting his personal interest in the matter and asking himto ensure the full co-operation of his agricultural, transport and shipping experts.in continued immigration, His Majesty&apos;s Government would in thelast resort have to take their own decision in the matter.After discussion, the Cabinet 
The Minister of A griculture thought that such a telegram wouldbe very valuable; it should emphasise the importance of extractingthe maximum possible amount of wheat from farms in the United-States.(6) The President of the Board of Trade thought that, if allo-cations were to be decided by the Governments of the UnitedKingdom, the United States and Canada, it would be difficult forthe United Kingdom, as the only one of these three countries whichwas an importing country, to put forward proposals involving heavycuts on all other importers, but no substantial reduction in our owndemands. Some further reduction in British consumption wouldhave to be considered, such as increasing the extraction rate to 85per cent.On the other side, it was argued that we in this country hadalready made all the economies that we could properly be asked tomake.The Minister of Agriculture said that stocks of food in thiscountry would, by next June, have fallen below the figure of 700,000tons, recently approved by the Cabinet as a minimum figure, andmight be as low as 550,000 tons. This would make this countryentirely dependent on supplies from overseas for the subsequentthree months until the new harvest.(c) While it was recognised that the Cabinet could not at thisstage examine in detail the figures proposed by the Minister of food in Appendix II of CP. (45) 348, some Ministers considered thatthere would be great difficulty in accepting them as they stood.The Minister of State emphasised that the amounts claimed by certain European countries were the minimum required to avoidstarvation and to reduce the risks of epidemics. The war had socompletely overthrown their internal economy that comparisons with their pre-war requirements could not give a fair measure oftheir present needs.On the other hand, it was argued that some European countries,for instance France, were claiming larger imports of wheat becausethey had failed to maintain a sufficient control over wheat on the farms.The Minister of Health said that his advisers thought that any reduction in the food available in Europe would increase the risk,which was already considerable, of serious epidemics. It might wellbe wise not to make such a cut in supplies for liberated andconquered areas in Europe if by further economy in this country,further encroachment oh stocks, or other means, this could possibly be avoided.(d) The Secretary of State for India said that India might beable to reduce her requirements if (i) the amounts allocated to thecountry arrived within the first three months of the year; and (ii) anadequate quantity of rice was forthcoming from South-East Asia.(e) It was agreed that -the amount still required for Germanyup to the end of June was 1,500,000 tons, and not 660,000 tons as stated in paragraph 12 of the memorandum.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that he was most concerned at the prospect suggested by the Minister of Foodthat the requirements of enemy countries should only be met out ofa contingency reserve after the requirements of other countries hadbeen met. Wheat would represent three-quarters of the total foodavailable in Germany this winter. That total was already very low,and it would be a most serious matter if it had to be further reduced.In his opinion, Germany&apos;s needs should be treated on a par withthose of other countries.(/) The Minister of Wor Transport emphasised that, if wheatwas to arrive during January and February, it was essential that decisions should be taken without delay.
9CM. 1 (46),-The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that it was essential that a further 200,000 tons should be provided for theBritish Zone in Germany during that period and a small additionalamount for Austria.(g) The question was raised whether sufficient publicity hadbeen given to the prospective world shortage of wheat. It wassuggested that the facts should be stated, and an appeal made for world economy, by the Foreign Secretary in his speech at the forth-coming General Assembly of the United Nations Organisation.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Minister of Food should be authorised toproceed on the lines proposed at (i) to (iii) above during his discussions in Washington.(2) Agreed that the Minister of Food should be asked not to commit himself, in these discussions, to the precisefigures to be allocated to individual countries as givenin Appendix II of CP. (45) 348.(3) Invited the Prime Minister to send a telegram to thePresident of the United States on the lines indicated at(a) above.(4) Agreed that, pending consideration of the whole position by the Combined Food Board, the Minister of food should be invited to arrange, in consultation with theMinister of War Transport, for authority to be givento ship instalments of wheat to meet immediate needs in Germany and elsewhere.(5) Agreed that the claims of the British Zone in Germanyand of other enemy countries should rank with those ofother countries for consideration by the Combined food board.(6) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to include in his forthcoming speech to the General Assembly ofthe United Nations Organisation a statement regardingthe world food situation, with special reference to wheat,and an appeal for economy.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,1st January, 1946.
