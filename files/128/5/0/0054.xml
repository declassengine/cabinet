The Cabinet were informed that, since they discussed on the30th May the arrangements for Government speakers in the forth-coming debate on foreign affairs, Mr. Churchill had indicated his intention of speaking at the beginning of the second day&apos;s debate.It was agreed that in these circumstances the Prime Minister should speak immediately after Mr. Churchill on the second day. TheForeign Secretary would open the debate; and the parliamentary under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs would reply at the endof the second day&apos;s debate.The Foreign Secretary said that his task at the meeting of theCouncil of Foreign Ministers and in other international discussions had been made more difficult by the fact that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment had never publicly dissociated themselves from the views expressed by Mr. Churchill in his speech at Fulton, Missouri, on the5th March, 1946. If Mr. Churchill should make similarly provoca-tive statements in his speech in the. forthcoming debate in the Houseof Commons, it would be helpful 4ff it could be made clear that these views were not shared by His Majesty&apos;s Government. The PrimeMinister said that he would keep this point in mind.2. The Foreign Secretary said that, as he had informed theCabinet on the 27th May, he had arranged to send a Labour Attachefrom the British Embassy at Cairo to assist the Anglo-persian oil Company in reviewing labour conditions at their oil plants atAbadan. He had also promoted the despatch to Persia of a Par-liamentary Mission consisting of three Members of Parliament with industrial experience. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company werespending about  !i\ millions at Abadan on the provision of housing and other amenities for their workers; and it was important, on political grounds, that they should pursue a progressive policy inthis matter. As His Majesty&apos;s Government owned the majority ofthe shares in the Company, they could not escape responsibility forthe Company&apos;s policy. The Foreign Secretary hoped that, in anyguidance which they gave to the Government directors, the treasury would not be unduly influenced by financial considerations.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (46) 213) regarding the withdrawal of British troops from Greece and the strength of the Greek Army.The Foreign Secretary said that he was anxious that Britishtroops should not be kept in Greece any longer than was necessary;and, subject to the results of the June meeting of the Council ofForeign Ministers, his present aim was to secure their withdrawal by September, 1946. He was, however, advised that the GreekGovernment could not themselves finance an army of more than50,000 men and that a substantially larger force than this would berequired to balance the armies of Bulgaria and Yugoslavia. Greeceshould not be left with greatly reduced defences until it was clearthat the armies of other Balkan countries would also be reduced.Until then, if British troops were withdrawn from Greece, HisMajesty&apos;s Government should help Greece to maintain her own forces up to the desired level.The Foreign Secretary said that he was not proposing apermanent subsidy for the Greek army. It was difficult to see far ahead, and he thought that at this stage plans could be laid only for 1946. He therefore invited the Cabinet to agree in principlethat we should assist the Greek Government to maintain theminimum forces which they would require to protect their interests,after the withdrawal of the British troops, up to the end of 1946.If this could be agreed in principle details could be worked out in discussion between the Foreign Office, Treasury and Chiefs of Staff.The cost in a full year of maintaining an army of 100,000 would[32142-4]b 2
be of the order of  15 millions. Of this, some  2 millions would berequired for the purchase of food; and the Greek Government mightbe asked to carry this part of the expenditure with their own resources of foreign exchange. Equipment would, however, repre-sent a substantial part of the total cost, and much of this might beprovided from British surplus stocks in Egypt or the UnitedKingdom.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that our man-power plans for the Armed Forces were based on the assumptionthat British troops would be withdrawn from Greece before the endof the year. According to the best information available, the presentstrengths of the Bulgarian and Yugoslav armies were 56,000 and350,000 respectively. If these Armies attacked Greece, after thewithdrawal of British troops, a Greek army of 50,000 men wouldbe quickly overwhelmed, but an army of 100,000 might deter attack and should be able to fight a delaying action until other assistancebecame available. Fairly good progress was being made with thetraining of the Greek army.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was advised thatit would be impossible for Greece to maintain from her own resources an army of 100,000 men. He appreciated, however, thatthe present year was a transition period and on that basis he could agree to the proposal which the Foreign Secretary had devolped in the discussion. The Greek Government had not so far made effective use of our financial assistance to restore their economy;and he thought it should be made clear to them that this further assistance would be limited to the current year.In discussion, it was pointed out that paragraph 9 (2) of cp. (46) 213 implied a more permanent commitment. The foreign secretary said that, on reflection, he was not now proposing any commitment beyond the current year. In particular, he withdrewthe proposal in paragraph 9 (2) of CP. (46) 213 that we should not commit ourselves to wthdrawing British troops from Greece untilthe Greek army was strong enough to defend its frontiers againstYugoslav and Bulgarian aggression; and he agreed that paragraph (3) of his memorandum should be construed as referring only tocommitments in 1946.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that, while he agreed that these proposals should be explained to DominionGovernments, he thought it unlikely that they would secure the unanimous agreement and support of the Dominions.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed in principle that His Majesty&apos;s Government shouldassist the Greek Government to maintain up to the endof 1946 an army sufficient to protect their interests afterthe withdrawal of British troops from Greece.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for the ForeignOffice, Treasury, Chiefs of Staff and Service Depart-ments to consider in detail the means of giving effect tothis decision.Polish armed forces underBritishCommand.(previous reference:CM. (46) 50thConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the specialorder issued by General Anders to the Polish Second Corps in Italyregarding their impending transfer to the United Kingdom.According to news reports this had included the followingstatements : &quot; We shall go from Italian soil through the British Islesand to-morrow along the unknown road to Poland. We shall goto the Poland for which we fought and which no Polish heartcan imagine without Lvov and Vilna. . . . Our marchtowards a free and independent Poland goes on.&quot;
Malaya.future constitution.(previous reference erence:CM. (46) 19thConclusions,Minute 7.)Eubber.5. The Secretary of State for the Colonies informed theCabinet of recent developments in regard to the Constitution of malaya. As they were aware, there had been considerable opposition in Malaya to the proposals contained in the Statementof Policy (Cmd. 6724). Mr. Malcolm MacDonald, the Governor-General of Malaya, who had recently arrived in the country, andSir Edward Gent, Governor of the Malayan Union, had nowsucceeded in arranging meetings with the Malayan Rulers. these meetings had opened successfully. Two of the Sultans had pressed for some change in the arrangements made with Sir HaroldMacMichael whereby they had surrendered jurisdiction to HisMajesty, but the Secretary of State thought that it would benecessary to stand firm on this point. The other matters on whichthe Sultans were concerned were the strength of the centralauthority and the proposal to extend Malayan citizenship.Conversations would continue after a short delay and the Secretaryof State hoped they would lead to a settlement satisfactory to all parties.The Cabinet took note of the position.In connection with the discussion recorded above, attention was drawn to the recent decision of the Lord Presidents committee regarding the price of rubber to be aimed at during the forthcoming negotiations with the United States Government. It was argued that unless prices of tropical products were maintained at a fairlevel it would be difficult to raise standards of living amongproducers. On the other hand, in the particular case of rubber thepossible competition of synthetic rubber had to be taken intoaccount.The Foreign Secretary expressed the view that there might be some concealed subsidy affecting the price of synthetic rubber asdeclared by the Americans, and suggested that attention should begiven to this aspect of the matter in the negotiations for a price fora subsequent period.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,3rd June, 1946.It was pointed out that these statements were likely to give-        234offence to the Governments of Poland and the Soviet Union, andmight increase the difficulties of arranging for the dispersal of thesePolish forces.The Foreign Secretary said that he was considering theposition and was not at present prepared to make any recommenda-tion to the Cabinet.
