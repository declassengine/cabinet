Anglo-EgyptianNegotiations.(previous reference:CM. (46) 57thConclusions,Minute 1.)The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the memorandum the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP. (46) 219) regardingthe negotiations for a revision of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty. they also had before them a report by the Chiefs of Staff (CP. (46) 224)commenting on the proposals in CP. (46) 219.The Chief of the Lmperial General Staff said that the Chiefsof Staff could not regard the proposed Joint Defence Board as anadequate safeguard for our minimum military requirements. Therewas no reason to believe that the Egyptian military representatives on the Board would be competent or would carry any weight withtheir own Government; and, under these new proposals, even morethan under the proposals already put to the Egyptian delegation,it would be a gamble whether the Egyptians would, in fact, give us the facilities that we required. From the military point of view the Chiefs of Staff must therefore advise that the new proposals were unacceptable. The Chiefs of Staff could see no alternative to their previous recommendations and felt that to secure thefacilities which we needed and which, in view of the considerations set out in paragraph 11 of CP. (46) 224, we were entitled to demand,certain fundamental amendments in the draft Treaty attached to cp. (46) 219 would have to be made. In particular the provisionfor the Joint Defence Board should be omitted, we should be giventhe right to enter Egypt in an &quot; apprehended international emer-gency,&quot; as well as in the event of war, and the Treaty should setout the minimum military facilities that we required.The Chiefs of Staff realised that the Cabinet might feel unableto accept these proposals. In that case, they considered that theproposal for a Joint Defence Board could be improved by estab-lishing a Joint Anglo-Egyptian Council on a Ministerial level,advised, if need be, by a Joint Defence Board on the lines proposedby the Foreign Secretary.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff added that there hadbeen a misunderstanding at the previous meeting as to the numberof troops at present in Egypt. The number was, in fact, only about106,000, of which 68,000 were British, including one division in reserve for Palestine. The British troops in the Cairo district hadbeen reduced from 71,000 in August 1945 to 38,000, and a further4,000 were leaving shortly. Considerable reductions in our instal-lations had been made over the last twelve months. He had earlier in the day seen General Paget and impressed on him the urgency of removing our troops from Cairo and Alexandria. General Pagetappreciated the position and had said that it should be possibleto move his headquarters to the Canal zone within nine months,though they would probably have to live in tents for a while.The Foreign Secretary said that it must be remembered thatthe alternative to a new Treaty acceptable to the Egyptians wasnot the retention of our present position in Egypt. The facilitieswe enjoyed at present were far greater than those given by the1936 Treaty; and it was very doubtful how far we could actuallyrely on that Treaty to give us our minimum military requirements in the face of a hostile Egyptian Government. Article 7 of theTreaty must be read in conjunction with the Agreed Minuteattached to it which provided that there should be mutual con-sultation before an emergency arose; and the Law Officers had advised that, though the Treaty might be kept on foot by a refusalon the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government to agree to a revisedTreaty, the provisions of Article 7 would be of little value if, when an emergency arose, the Egyptians were unwilling to implement the spirit of the Treaty. It must also be remembered that in suchcrcumstances any facilities enjoyed under this Treaty would cometo an end in ten years&apos; time. For all. these reasons he did not feelthat the 1936 Treaty provided firm ground on which to stand. Thus,the real choice before the Cabinet lay between a new Treaty freelynegotiated with the Egyptian Government, and the maintenanceof our position in Egypt by force. He did not think that the british people or Parliament would regard the latter alternative as an
acceptable course. On the other hand, he was convinced that theEgyptian Government would not agree to a new Treaty whichspecified the minimum military facilities that we required; nor,for historical reasons, would they accept the proposal that theJoint Defence Board should be supplemented by a Joint Councilon a Ministerial level.In accordance with the Cabinets decision at their meeting onthe previous day, he had considered what amendments might bemade in the draft Treaty annexed to CP. (46) 219 and he nowproposed that in Article 6 the phrase &apos;&apos; the steps which should betaken to enable the armed forces of the two High ContractingParties effectively to resist aggression &apos;&apos; should be amended to read&apos;&apos; the steps which should be taken to enable the armed forces of thetwo High Contracting Parties to be in a position effectively to resistaggression.&quot; The words added implied that preliminary arrange-ments would be made before an emergency arose. He also proposedthat Article 4 should be redrafted on the lines shown in the annex to this Minute. The revised draft emphasised that both countriesshared in the obligation to discharge the common task, and, by providing that the competent military authorities on the joint defence Board might be assisted by such other representatives asthe two Governments might appoint, would enable EgyptianMinisters to be associated with the Board. The fact that theredraft was based on the agreement setting up the United States-Canada Defence Board should commend it to the Egyptian Govern-ment. If we could obtain a Treaty on the lines of that attachedto CP. (46) 219, with the modifications he now suggested, we should,in his view, be in a more satisfactory position than we had ever been under the 1936 Treaty.The Lord Chancellor said that, short of using force, the only alternative to the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposal was to rely on theterms of the 1936 Treaty. Unless we had the goodwill of theEgyptian Government, this Treaty would in effect expire afterten years and even in the period during which it remained in force would not give us what we wanted, since a hostile Egyptian Govern-ment could easily render its provisions nugatory by denying on anyparticular occasion that the situation was such as to justify our intervention. Moreover, though he believed that the point wasa bad one, it was arguable that the 1936 Treaty had lapsed withthe end of the League of Nations.In discussion there was very full realisation of the weightof the arguments advanced by the Chiefs of Staff. In particular,it was appreciated that reliance on the terms of the revisedArticle 4 meant taking a considerable risk at a time when therewas no firm assurance of any other base from which our middle eastern interests could be protected.The Minister of Fuel and, Power emphasised that the oil resources in the Middle East were vital to our security. We couldnot afford to leave them unprotected.The following points were also made : (a) If negotiations were resumed on. the basis of the revisedArticle 4, our negotiators should insist that the functions of theJoint Defence Board should include the co-ordination of measures for mutual defence in the region of the Middle East and not merelyin the territories adjacent to Egypt; and if a firm attitude were adopted in the negotiations, it should be possible to secure this.It was most important that we should not give the Egyptians an impression of weakness, since they would be only too ready to exploit it.(b) Confidence was expressed in the ability of the British staff representatives who would serve on the proposed Joint defence board to ensure that provisions on the lines proposed by the foreign secretary would work satisfactorily.[32264-4] &apos; B 2

(c) Nothing in politics was stable and we should remember that the situation in Egypt would not necessarily always be sounfavourable to us as at the moment. Would it not be possibleduring the period over which the withdrawal of our troops from egypt would be spread to foster by unofficial means a more friendlyattitude towards us ?(d) The withdrawal of troops from the Cairo district wouldmean a considerable loss to the Egyptian business (community.Might it not be advisable to spin out the negotiations in the hopethat the Egyptians would realise what they stood to lose economi-cally by the withdrawal of our troops and so be brought into amore reasonable frame of mind ?In reply it was pointed out that it was now eight months sincethe original request for a revision of the 1936 Treaty had beenmade and that there was every indication that further delay would only serve to make the Egyptian Government more irreconcilable.Further, it was only too likely that any economic distress due tothe withdrawal of our troops from the Cairo district would be attributed to our continuing presence elsewhere in Egypt.(e) The Secretary of State for Air pointed out that Article 5of the avant-projet, which Sidky Pasha hoped the Egyptian Dele-gation would accept, gave good grounds for the belief that asatisfactory basis of agreement could be achieved by the approachrecommended by the Foreign Secretary.(/) It was suggested that if, as the Foreign Secretary had indicated, it was proposed to bring Ministerial representatives intothe Joint Defence Board discussions it would be desirable to substitute the words &quot; together with &quot; for the words &quot;assisted by &quot;in the second sentence of the revised draft of Article 4.Summing up the discussion, The Prime Minister said that theChiefs of Staff had very properly drawn attention to the fact thatthe Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposals did not give us an assurance ofthe facilities which we should require in the event of war or the imminent threat of war. The Cabinet must, however, consider whatwould be the alternative to proceeding with these proposals. it seemed clear that to stand on the 1936 Treaty would not give uswhat we wanted and we should therefore be driven to remain inEgypt forcibly on the ground that only by doing so could wesafeguard our military security. There was no more justification for this than for our claiming that our neighbours on the continent of Europe should grant us bases for our defence. Our oil interestsin the Middle East were indeed important, but our ability to defendthem would only be impaired if we insisted on remaining in Egyptagainst the will of the Egyptian people and so worsened ourrelations with the remainder of the Arab world. For these reasonshe was convinced that the proposals made by the Foreign secretary should be accepted, and it was clear that this was the general viewof the Cabinet.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that the negotiations for the revisionof the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty should be continued onthe general lines proposed by the Foreign Secretary in cp. (46) 219.(2) Agreed that Articles 4 and 6 of the draft Treaty annexed to CP. (46) 219 should be revised on the lines whichhad been suggested by the Foreign Secretary.(3) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would obtain theviews of His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cairo on thedraft Treaty and Protocol as so revised.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,7th June, 1946.
