Egypt. 1.   The Cabinet were informed that the British Minister in-Pisturbances. Cairo had presented to the Egyptian Government a strong note of protest against the failure of the Egyptian authorities to deal firmlywith the recent disorders, in which British lives and property hadbeen endangered. King Farouk had suggested that the terms ofthis note were excessively severe, but our Minister had declined towithdraw it.Spain. 2.   The Prime Minister drew attention to reports of the(Previous        execution in Madrid of certain Spanish Republicans, including some reference:      who had fought in the French Resistance Movement.   Reports had. (46) 11th   also been published of the results of the trial at Alcala of 37 membersConclusions,     of the General Union of Workers, a Spanish Socialist organisation.Minute 4.)      Five of the defendants had been sentenced to 30 years&apos; imprison-ment, three to 20 years, and the remaining twenty-nine to terms of12 and 15 years&apos; imprisonment.   This action by General Franco&apos;sGovernment would give great offence to public opinion in thiscountry and in France.After some general discussion, the Cabinet I took note that the Prime Minister (in the foreign secretary&apos;s absence) would review, in the light of theselatest developments, our recent policy towards Spain andwould consider whether further steps might be taken to expedite a change in the present political regime in Spain.India.Mutiny inRoyal IndianNavy.(previous reference:CM. (46) 17thConclusions,Minute 10.)Disturbancesat MilitaryDetentionCamp,Aldershot.3. The Cabinet were informed that the situation in India had become easier during the week-end. A statement on the disorderswas to be made by the Secretary of State for India in the Houseof Lords on the following day. The Prime Minister said that hewould consider, in the light of the latest information, whether itwould be expedient for him to make a corresponding statement inthe House of Commons.4. The Secretary of State for War made a preliminary reportto the Cabinet on the disturbances at the military detention carnp atAldershot. On the evening of the 23rd February a number of the prisoners had overpowered their guards, released other prisoners and secured control over the centre block of the barracks. They had remained in possession of this part of the building until the24th February, when they surrendered and were removed fromthe barracks. It seemed that the immediate cause of the disturbances had been the arrival of a number of men who had escaped from a detention camp in Northallerton.The Secretary of State for War said that, when he had receiveda full report of the incident, he would decide whether a militaryenquiry or a public enquiry would be the more appropriate.In discussion the suggestion was made that these disturbancesmight be due to the resentment of men who were still serving longsentences of imprisonment for desertion or fraternisation. TheSecretary of State for War said that he had already reviewedoutstanding sentences for desertion and substantial remission hadbeen authorised. His decision in this matter had been well received in the House of Commons, and he doubted whether there was anyjustifiable cause for continuing resentment in these cases. Therewere, however, numbers of men at Aldershot undergoing sentencesfor other serious offences, who might consider themselves entitledto similar concessions. He could not agree that their offences couldbe regarded in the same light, and a public enquiry might have theuseful result of distinguishing between these different types of case.
The Cabinet-Took note of this statement; and invited the Secretary ofState for War to consult with the Prime Minister before deciding what form of enquiry should be held into thesedisturbances.Future of trans-Jordan.(previous reference:CM. (46) 4thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies (CP. (46) 63) covering the draft of a proposed treaty and Military Convention with Trans-Jordan.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the colonies said that the Foreign Secretary&apos;s announcement of our intention to terminate the mandate for Trans-Jordan had been warmly welcomed by the First General Assembly of the United Nations Organisation,and had received the unanimous approval of the trusteeship council. The Emir Abdullah of Trans-Jordan had arrived in thiscountry and negotiations with him were to start within the next day or two. He asked the Cabinet to approve the draft Treaty andMilitary Convention as a basis for these negotiations. In thepreparation of the drafts the Foreign Office, the Chiefs of Staff, theTreasury and the Board of Trade had been consulted. The draft treaty was based on that concluded with Iraq on the termination ofthat mandate. Under these proposals the United Kingdom wouldgive military aid and assistance in defence and, in return, would begranted substantial military rights and facilities. It was intended that a Commercial Treaty should be negotiated later.The special attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the fact thatIbn Saud had announced his intention of reviving his claim to thetown of Ma&apos;an and the port of Aqaba. This was a long-standingclaim which had not been pressed while the mandate was held bythe United Kingdom. The proposed Treaty and Military Conven-tion would oblige us to go to the Emir&apos;s assistance if Ibn Saud wereto press this claim by force; but this was a very unlikely contingencyand, in any case, it was to our interest that the port of Aqaba shouldnot pass into the possession of Ibn Saud.Preliminary points in the discussion were :  (a) The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that the Foreign Office had no comments on the draftsannexed to CP. (46) 63.(b) The total amount of our assistance to Trans-Jordan at thepresent time was about  2,200,000 a year. Of this some  200,000was spent in helping her to balance her general budget, and theremainder represented the cost of the Arab Legion. Under the new arrangements the assistance towards the general budget would cease, and the amount required for the Arab Legion might be con-si der ably reduced. Since the war the force had been greatlyenlarged and mechanised at the request of the United Kingdom.Some reduction might now be looked for.(c) The draft Military Convention gave us the right to station and train troops in Trans-Jordan. This was of considerable importance in view of the uncertainty of our position in Egypt.(d) Nothing in the present proposals would affect adversely thepossibility of the development of southern Palestine by Jewishenterprise.The main discussion turned on Article 4 of the draft Treaty,which provided that if either party became engaged in war the other party would go to his aid as an ally.Apart from the possibility, admittedly remote, that this might involve us in war with Ibn Saud as the result of his claim to Aqaba,it was suggested that such a provision was wrong in principle inthe circumstances of to-day. The Iraq Treaty was not a conclusiveprecedent, since the provisions relating to defence in the united nations Charter were much stronger than those in the Covenant ofthe League of Nations.  If Trans-Jordan, which would now be an
independent State, became involved in a dispute with another State,the provisions of the United Nations Charter should be invokedand the provisions in the present draft Treaty ought not then to berequired. If it was our object to make the United nations organisation an effective system of world security, we should makethe fullest use of its machinery and should not attempt to by-pass it.Against this it was argued that, while it was our policy tobuild up the United Nations Organisation as an effective safeguardof peace, this would inevitably take time and for the present it wasboth legitimate and prudent, as a measure of reinsurance, to supple-ment the provisions of the Charter by bi-lateral defensivearrangements of the kind uoav proposed. Similar arrangements in the Iraq Treaty had paid a handsome dividend in the last fewyears of the war.One suggestion made was that words might be inserted inArticle 3 of the draft Treaty to provide that in the event of a dispute between Trans-Jordan and another State the UnitedKingdom and Trans-Jordan would concert with the appropriateorgan of the United Nations Organisation, as well as with one another, with a view to the settlement of the dispute by peaceful means. Against this it was argued that this would be inconsistent with a policy of discouraging interest in the Middle East by Russiaand other Powers.The general feeling of the Cabinet was that this point shouldbe further considered, in the light of the discussion, before finalauthority was given to open discussions with the Emir Abdullahon the basis of the drafts annexed to CP. (46) 63.The Cabinet Invited the Parliamentary Uncler-Secretary of State forthe Colonies to arrange for further consideration to begiven, in the light of the discussion, to the provisions inthe draft Treaty for mutual aid in the event of a dispute,and to report again to the Cabinet at their next meeting.Shipping.Keeommenda-tions by theUnitedMaritimeExecutiveBoard.(previous reference:CM. (46) 13thConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of &quot;War Transport (CP. (46) 68) covering the recommenda-tions made to Governments by the Final Session of the united maritime Executive Board regarding the shipping arrangementsafter the United Maritime Authority came to an end on the2nd March.The Minister of War Transport said that the recommendationscovered the period up to the 31st October, 1946. Part A of therecommendations provided for shipping to be contributed to a contributory Pool which would provide for the movement fromthe United States and Canada, of cargoes for U.N.R.R.A. andcertain liberated countries. A committee was to be set up inLondon to consider U.N.R.R.A.&apos;s requirements for shipping fromother areas. It was to our advantage that we should make a contribution to this traffic, though it could not be a large one. Therewas also in Part A a recommendation that nations requested toprovide tonnage outside the Contributory Pool should make &quot;all reasonable efforts&quot; to make it available &quot;at fair, reasonable andcompensatory rates.&quot; This should be some assurance that UnitedStates tonnage would continue to be available in sufficient quantities to meet requirements.Under Part B of the recommendations a United maritime consultative Council was to be appointed for the exchange ofinformation and the study of shipping problems. This body wouldhave no executive powers and its functions and procedure had notbeen settled in detail, but the Minister thought that this provisionfor continued consultation was essential. The relation of this new body to the United Nations Organisation^would need to be defined.During the negotiations the United Kingdom representatives had come to a separate agreement with the United States which
Shipbuilding.Outline ofShipbuildingProgramme;and Appoint-ment ofShipbuildingAdvisoryCommittee.. 7- The Cabinet had before them a joint memorandum by theEast Lord of the Admiralty and the Minister of War Transport(CP. (46) 64) covering a memorandum on the future of the ship-buildmg industry, which had been considered and generally approved by the Lord Presidents Committee (L.P. (46) 4th MeetingMinute 5). &apos;      &apos;        b&apos;The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he and the Ministerof War Transport endorsed the recommendations made by the Ship-building Committee appointed under Cabinet authority in October1944 to prepare an estimate of the probable demand for shipbuildingin the first ten years after the end of the war. It was not proposedthat the shipbuilding industry should remain much longer underthe present degree of control, but it was desirable to maintainmachinery for consultation and co-operation between the Govern-ment and the industry, and for this purpose the appointment of aShipbuilding Advisory Committee was recommended. The Com-mittee would have an independent chairman and would include representatives of the Government Departments concerned, the ship-building industry, the shipbuilding trade unions and the shipping industry. The Minister of War Transport and he were unable toaccept the suggestion, made at the meeting of the Lord presidents committee, that the Committee should include representatives ofthe unions of officers and seamen of the merchant navy as wellas ship-owners. The Committee ought to be kept as small aspracticable and the views of the unions could be conveyed to it through the representative of the Ministry of War Transport.Paragraph (4) of the terms of reference of the proposed Committeehad been amended and a footnote would be added to it making itclear that any questions of industrial relations (e.g., demarcationquestions arising from the introduction of new production methodsor machinery) that came before the Committee would be referredto the industry for consideration through the existing voluntarymachinery. A representative of the Ministry of Labour and national Service would be a permanent member of the Committee;and the suggestion made at the Lord Presidents Committee withregard to the method of nominating representatives of the ship-building and ship-repairing industries and the shipbuilding tradeunions would be accepted.The Cabinets discussion turned primarily on the questionwhether the Committee should include representatives of the unionsof officers and seamen of the merchant navy.ensured that sufficient United States tonnage would be at our Idisposal during the coming months. The United States would take jno action to terminate the arrangements by which we were using&quot;on bare-boat charter about 3 million deadweight tons of United&quot;States shipping. In return we bad undertaken that liner sailingsduring the next four months would not exceed a specified schedule.!In discussion, it was pointed out that these arrangements made it unnecessary to consider at present the purchase of ships from the united States, and would also afford some check on flag discrimina- ition and shipping subsidies by the United States.   As regards theundertaking to the United States on liner sailings, we should not jin fact have been able to increase these sailings above the specified jschedule during the next four months.   The position was then tobe reviewed and we might be able to secure greater freedom ofaction thereafter.The Cabinet-Authorised the Minister of War Transport to notify theother contracting Governments that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment accepted Parts A and B of the recommenda-tions made in the Report of the Fourth Session of theUnited Maritime Executive Board.
In favour of including representatives of these unions, it waq.urged that the Committee would not be an effective body unless it contained representatives of the users of ships and that the officersand seamen of the merchant navy, who were vitally concerned with problems of design (especially in relation to such matters as accom-modation, safety and defence measures) had as good a claim as the shipowners to be regarded as users of ships.The Minister of War Transport said that, in his view, theinclusion of shipowners in the Committee did not make it necessaryto appoint representatives of officers&apos; and seamens&apos; unions and,rather than include representatives of those unions, he would be inclined to exclude representatives of the shipping industry fromthe Committee, and to establish separate machinery for conveyingto the Committee the views of shipowners and officers and seamenof the merchant navy. If, however, it was the view of the Cabinetthat the Shipbuilding Committee should include representatives ofthe shipping industry, he thought that the best solution would befor the First Lord of the Admiralty and himself, in appointingrepresentatives of that industry, to include at least one person who would be able to represent the views of the merchant service.The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that it would be necessaryto discuss this proposal with representatives of the shipbuilders.Other points in discussion were : (a) Would it be desirable to appoint a Civil Servant as chair-man of the Committee ?The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that the Minister of war transport and he had it in mind to seek a chairman among those persons with wide business experience (outside the shipbuilding industry) who had been in Government service during the war. Theywould consult the Prime Minister before the appointment wasmade.(b) Could the Committee be used as a channel by which to convey the views of the Government to the shipbuilding industry ?It was explained that the Departmental representatives on theCommittee could raise any matter on the initiative of the Govern-ment.(c) The Lord Presidents Committee had accepted the recom-mendations regarding the target output of the shipbuilding industryover the next ten years and the size of the labour force to bemaintained in the industry, on the understanding that the pro-gramme would be adjusted in accordance with the needs of theGovernments employment policy; and it was urged that, shouldany reduction in the&apos; programme be necessary, every effort shouldbe made to avoid reducing the amount of shipbuilding work in thedevelopment areas.The First Lord of the Admiralty said the need for keeping the shipbuilding programme in step with the general economic policy of the Government was fully accepted, and the needs of thedevelopment areas would be kept in view. It would, however, benecessary to give a fair share of merchant shipbuilding to dock-yard towns in the South of England, if the naval building pro-gramme were severely cut.The Cabinet (1) Approved the appointment of a Shipbuilding AdvisoryCommittee on the lines proposed in CP. (46) 64, onthe understanding that it would contain representativesof the shipping industry, including at least one who could represent the views of officers and seamen of themerchant navy.
(2) Took note that the level of output and the size of labour force in the shipbuilding industry would be co-ordinated,with the general economic plan and, on this assumptionapproved the general outline of a shipbuilding programme contained in the Annex to CP. (46) 64.Shipping. 8.   At their meeting on the 21st February the Cabinet hadFuture Use invited the Lord Presidents Committee to consider (i) what classof the Queen of traffic the Queen Elizabeth would carry if she were returned toElizabeth. the North American passenger service; and (ii) to what extent(Previous ner reconversion would compete, for labour and materials, withReference:      repair or new construction of smaller vessels.C.M (46) 17th The Lord President said that, on the first point, his CommitteeConclusions,     had been informed that the reconversion proposed by the Cunarcl-minute 7.)       White Star Company would provide accommodation for 800 first-class, 700 second-class and 750 third-class passengers.    It thusappeared that the vessel would not be used solely for luxury traffic.On the second point the Committee bad been satisfied that this project for the reconversion of the Queen Elizabeth was part of a balanced programme for the shipbuilding industry. Her troopshipfittings would be removed at Southampton, where the necessary labour was available : she would then proceed to the Clyde, where she would be handled by the labour force released by the completion ofwork on H.M.S. Vanguard : and she would return to Southamptonfor completion at a time when there would be no serious competingdemand for labour.The Lord Presidents Committee therefore recommended theCabinet to approve the proposal that the reconversion of the queen Elizabeth should be taken in hand on the completion of her present voyage.The Cabinets discussion turned on the question whether theCompany&apos;s proposals sufficiently met their view that, if the Q,ueenElizabeth was to be reconverted for civilian passenger traffic, she should be adapted to carry a larger number of passengers at a lower cost per head than the Queen Mary had carried before thewar. Some Ministers felt that, as the Government had decided notto socialise shipping, it was for the Company to decide how to makethe most profitable use of this ship and how she could best be equipped to meet the keen competition on the North Atlantic route.Other Ministers felt that, so long as labour and materials werescarce, the Government could not disinterest themselves in the extentto which the vessel was to be reconverted for luxury traffic. they also felt that the Government were concerned with this aspect ofthe matter because of the probable public reactions towards the useof scarce resources for the reconditioning of a luxury liner.The general sense of the Cabinet was that the Company should furnish fuller information on the extent to which they proposed torefit this vessel for luxury traffic.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Queen Elizabeth should be released fromtrooping service at the end of her present voyage, in orderthat a start might be made with her reconversion for civilian passenger traffic.(2) Invited the Minister of War Transport to obtain and submit to the Cabinet fuller information of the Company&apos;intentions regarding the class, of civilian traffic to becarried in this vessel, and the&quot; proportion of the totalspace to be allocated to, and the degree of luxury to beprovided for, first-class passengers.
parliament.SelectCommitteeon Elections.(previous reference:CM. (45) 62ndConclusions,Minute 1.)9. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (46) 73) covering the first report of the Select Com-mittee appointed to investigate a number of cases in which Membersof Parliament appeared to have exposed themselves to the risk ofdisqualification by retaining offices or places of profit.The Lord President said that the Committee had reached theconclusion that three of the four Members whose cases had been referred to them had been disqualified. The Committee were satisfied that the disqualification arose purely from inadvertence andthey recommended that, following the precedent of the Coatbridgeand Springburn Elections (Validation) Act, 1945, a Bill validatingthe elections of the three Members should be passed. He saw no alternative to the introduction of legislation, but it would probablybe convenient to hold up the necessary Bill for a short time until theSelect Committee had reached a conclusion on a further case of possible disqualification which had since been referred to them.The Committee had drawn attention to the urgent need forclarifying the law relating to offices of profit and had suggested thata provision might be included in any amending legislation requiringa Parliamentary candidate to sign on nomination a general declara-tion relinquishing and resigning from any office of profit under theCrown which he might then hold. He understood that the LordChancellor would be reporting to the Lord Presidents Committee onthis matter in the near future. In his view, this general legislationought to be introduced during the present Parliament, though not inthe current Session.The Cabinet Invited the Financial Secretary to the Treasury to arrangefor the preparation of legislation to validate the election ofthe three Members who were found by the Select Committeeto have been disqualified.parliamentary procedure.Second Reportof the SelectCommittee.(previous reference:CM. (45) 47thConclusions,Minute 7.)parliamentary questions.10. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (46) 69) covering the Second Report of the SelectCommittee on Procedure.The Lord President said that the Select Committee had accepted in principle the proposal made on behalf of the Government that theperiod of notice for oral Questions should be extended to two cleardays (excluding Sundays). Their acceptance was, however, subjectto the important proviso that Questions received at the Table Officebefore the hour of sitting of the House should be deemed to have beenreceived the day before. A number of the Questions handed in byMembers required amendment before the Table would pass them,and it would probably prove impossible in practice to settle the formof doubtful Questions until relatively late in the day. He had setout in paragraph 6 of CP. (46) 69 three different ways of gettingover this difficulty. None of these was entirely satisfactory, but hethought that the least objectionable would be to arrange thatDepart-ments should be supplied by the Table Office with all Questions,doubtful Questions being marked with some indication that theywere being queried and Departments being informed later of thosewhich had been cleared.The Committee had recommended that written Questions shouldbe answered within seven clays and he suggested that this recom-mendation should be accepted and the necessary instructions given to departments. It should be impressed on Departments that seven days should be regarded as a maximum, and not a minimum, period.If written questions were answered without delay, the number oforal Questions would probably fall off.
Cabinet Offices, S.W. 1,25th February, 1946.Letters from The Committee had also pointed out that it would help to members of reduce the number of Questions, both oral and written, if Depart-Parliament. ments made it a rule to answer letters from Members within a fort-night. The Parliamentary Labour Party had recently made repre-sentations to the Prime Minister on the same subject. While the criticism about delay in replying to letters from Members ofParliament was to some extent misinformed, he felt that there was some ground for legitimate complaint and he hoped that, as a resultof the review which the Prime Minister had instituted, substantial improvements would be found possible.The Prime Minister said that, following on the representations made by the Parliamentary Labour Party, he had asked the Secre-tary of the Treasury to consider what improvements might be madein dealing with Ministers&apos; correspondence. The position differedgreatly from one Department to another and it did not seempracticable to give an undertaking that all letters from Membersof Parliament would be answered within a fortnight, althoughDepartments should aim at this. He proposed to send an instruc-tion to Departments on this matter.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed to accept the recommendation of the Select Coro-mittee that the period of notice for oral questions should be increased to two days, provided that Questionsreceived before the hour of sitting of the House shouldbe deemed to have been received the day before; and authorised the Lord President to arrange for theStanding Orders to be amended to give effect to thisrecommendation.(2) Took note that Departments would be instructed to answerwritten Questions within seven days and should be urged to deal with them more quickly wherever possible.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would send an instruc-tion to Departments regarding the handling of corre-spondence from Members of Parliament.
