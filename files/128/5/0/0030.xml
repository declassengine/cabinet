parliament.Business inthe Houseof Commons.Easter Recess.Hours of sitting.1. The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the business which it was proposed to take in the House of Commons in thefollowing week.On the 8th April, in Committee of Supply, there would be a debate on an Opposition Motion calling attention to the shortageof labour in agriculture and the need for improved amenities foragricultural workers. The Minister of Agriculture would reply tothe debate. The Secretary of State for Scotland would be in attendance during the debate.On the 9th April the Chancellor of the Exchequer would openhis Budget. On the 10th and 11th April there would be a general debate on the Budget Resolutions.On the 12th April the United Nations Bill would be completed;and the Second Reading of the Post Office and Telegraph (Money)Bill would be taken.Parliament would adjourn for the Easter Recess on the18th April and would meet again on the 30th April.It was proposed that after the Easter Recess the House ofCommons should meet on Mondays and Thursdays at 2-30 p.m. andsit until 10 p.m. or 10-30 p.m. On Fridays the House would sit,as at present, from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. or 4-30 p.m. These proposals would be announced that day in reply to a Private Notice question by Mr. Eden.143Leakages of 2.   Attention was drawn to unauthorised disclosures in theInformation. Press of two matters about to be submitted for consideration bythe Cabinet. The Times had printed on the 25th March an articleon the future of the Iron and Steel Industry, which described insome detail the membership and proceedings of the ministerial committee on the Socialisation of Industries. The Observer hadprinted on the 31st March an article on the future of the Ruhr,which contained some of the material included in a report on thissubject which had been prepared for the Foreign Secretary by theEconomic and Industrial Planning Staff. Both articles appearedto be based on information obtained from official sources.The Cabinet Invited the Lord Chancellor to enquire into these apparentleakages of official information, and to submit a report tothe Prime Minister.Future of the 3,   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of iron and Steel Supply (CP. (46) 120) on the future of the iron and steel industry.Industry. Minister of Supply recalled that the announcement madeon the 19th November, 1945, about the socialisation of industries had stated that the Government would postpone their decision aboutthe iron and steel industry until they had considered the reportby the British Iron and Steel Federation on the industry&apos;s plans for future development. The proposals which he now put forwardwere based on consideration of this report and bad been approvedby the Committee on the Socialisation of Industries. He had considered the possibility of continuing the pre-war policy of leaving the industry to organise itself, and also the alternative of creating a special Government body with statutory powers to supervise the development and rationalisation of the industry andthe planning of production in the national interest; but he had come to the conclusion that neither of these alternatives would be satisfactory, and he accordingly recommended : &apos;(i) That the Government should decide to nationalise theindustry and should introduce a Bill for this purpose in the 1946-47Session.(ii) That an early announcement to this effect should be ma,dein the House of Commons.   This announcement should state that[31844-1] b 2
all mineral rights in iron ore would be taken into public ownership,and its working undertaken solely by the Government; and that thepart of the iron and steel industry to be taken over would includepig-iron production of all kinds, steelmaking and heavy, steel-rolling, together with certain further processes the precise range ofwhich would have to be determined in the light of detailed examination.(iii) That immediately after this announcement discussions should be opened with the industry with a view to settling thefinancial and other arrangements which would enable an immediatestart to be made with the development schemes mentioned inparagraph 18 of CP. (46) 120.The Prime Minister suggested that the Cabinet should firstconsider the question of timing. The Government machine was already under very heavy pressure; a great deal of legislation wasbeing passed this Session which would have to be brought intooperation during 1947; and a heavy programme of further legisla-tion was already contemplated for the 1946-47 Session. Was therenot some risk that Parliament might be asked to pass more legisla-tion than the administrative machine could effectively absorb % Onthis ground there was much to be said for postponing the introduc-tion of legislation to nationalise the iron and steel industry until thethird Session of the present Parliament, provided that means couldbe found to prevent the industry from delaying meanwhile theexecution of necessary works of development.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he hoped therewould be no delay in deciding to nationalise the industry andannouncing the decision. Subject to this, he saw no reason why theintroduction of the necessary legislation should not be deferred untilthe 1947-48 Session, provided that suitable arrangements were madeto ensure that, in the meantime, development was not held up. he believed that such arrangements could be madeThe Foreign Secretary said that it was essential that a boldprogramme of development should be carried out in the interim period; for, unless this was done, the industry would be unable tomaintain its position against foreign competitors. He had no confidence that the present leaders of the industry would be capableof carrying out such a programme, and he suggested that until the nationalisation scheme came into force, which would not be until1949 if legislation were to be postponed until the 1947-48 Session,a strong Control Board should be set up to supervise the develop-ment and rationalisation of the industry. He saw no reason whylarge new plants, which could not in any event be financed withoutthe help of the Government, should not be vested in the State,pending the nationalisation of the industry as a whole.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that while he did not oppose the proposal to nationalise the industry, he felt that theCabinet should not overlook the many difficulties inherent in theproposal. As the Minister of Supply admitted, it would be verydifficult to draw a dividing line between what wras to be nationalisedand what was to be left under private enterprise. Was it wise tomake an announcement about nationalisation until the Govern-ment were able to say more precisely where this line would bedrawn? Again, it should be remembered that this industry was largely dependent on imported raw material and, on that account,was in a different position from that of the coal industry or thevarious public utilities which it had already been decided to nationalise. There were also likely to be difficulties about the supplyof coking coal as was explained in the Annex to CP. (46) 120. Indealing with the coal industry he was finding that, whatever thefinancial arrangements, there was a great reluctance to undertakenew development in the interim period and the managerial staff inthe industry were losing interest in their work because of uncertainty about their personal position. He suggested that theForeign Secretary&apos;s proposal for the establishment of a Control j
247CM. 30 (46).Board for the interim period should be worked out in more detailbefore the Cabinet were finally committed to it. In the coal industry the war-time experiment of public control without public ownershiphad not been successful.In further discussion, there was general agreement that theindustry should be nationalised but that it would be desirable to defer the necessary legislation until the 1947-48 Session. It wasalso the view of the Cabinet that it would be useful to establish a Control Board on the lines suggested by the Foreign Secretary to supervise the development and rationalisation of the industry duringthe interim period. It was important that there should be an early announcement of the Governments intentions, which should defineas closely as was possible without detailed discussion wjith theindustry the scope of the undertakings to be covered. Paragraph 13of CP. (46) 120 gave a reasonably accurate indication of whatwould be covered, and a definition on these lines would be sufficientpending detailed discussions with the industry.Other points in discussion were : (a) The Control Board might be given the task of preparing the nationalisation scheme as well as of supervising the develop-ment and rationalisation of the industry in the interim period.(b) It was important to press on with the development schemes in South Wales, on Tees Side and at Motherwell in order to allevi-ate the growing problem of unemployment in the development areas.(c) The industry had been handicapped in recent years throughthe high rates of interest which it had had to pay on the very heavy capital expenditure involved in the modernisation of itsplant.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that legislation to nationalise the iron and steelindustry should be introduced in the 1947-48 session and that an announcement of the Governments inten-tions should be made at the earliest possible date.(2) Agreed that during the period before the iron and steelindustry was nationalised it should work under the super-vision of a Control Board, appointed by the Government,whose duty it would be to secure the necessary develop-ment of the industry and to work out a detailednationalisation scheme. It was also for consideration whether any large new plants erected during the interim period should be provided by public funds and vested in the State, pending the nationalisation of the industry as a whole.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary, the Chancellor of theExchequer, the Lord Chancellor and the Minister ofSupply to submit to the Cabinet for consideration attheir meeting on the 11th April proposals for the con-stitution and functions of the suggested Control Boardtogether with a draft of the proposed announcement ofthe Governments intentions.4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary (CP.(46) 131) annexing a memorandum on the Order of the VictoryMarch.The Home Secretary said that, as Chairman of the ministerial committee on Victory Celebrations, he agreed in principle with theproposals set out in the memorandum; but he had certain commentsto offer.The main points in the Cabinets discussion were :  (a) It was the view of the Cabinet that Sir Edward Bridges,as having been Secretary to the War Cabinet throughout the war,
should be included among those who were to stand behind HisjMajesty on the Saluting Base.(b) It was suggested in the memorandum that the Prime minister and the Home Secretary should drive in the first carriageand that Mr. Churchill should be in the second.The Home Secretary suggested, and the Cabinet agreed, that!it would be more appropriate that the Prime Minister and IMr. Churchill should drive in the first carriage.(c) The Home Secretary said that he intended to take His 1Majesty&apos;s Pleasure about the attendance at the parade of the various!members of the Royal Family.(d) Other suggestions made in further discussion were that section of representative housewives should be included in the proces-1sion; that at least one person representing each of the Dominions!and India should be given a prominent place in the stand immedi- \ately behind the Saluting Base; and that suitable provision would Ihave to be made for the attendance of members of the Diplomatic!Corps.The Cabinet-(1) Approved, subject to the modifications noted in para-graphs (a) and (6) above, the Order of March proposedin the memorandum annexed to CP. (48) 131;(2) Took note that the Home Secretary would take HisMajesty&apos;s Pleasure on these proposed arrangements;(3) Invited the Ministerial Committee on the Victory Celebra-tions to proceed with their consideration of the otherseating arrangements for the Victory March, and to take into account the points which had been raised in the cabinet&apos;s discussion.Paris PeaceConference.ProposedPublicationof Records by united StatesGovernment.(previous reference:W.M.(43)93rdConclusions,Minute 6.)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (46) 124) regarding the desire of the United StatesGovernment to publish, as part of a series of official documents on the foreign relations of the United States, the minutes of theproceedings of the Council of Four at the Paris Peace Conference.The Foreign Secretary said that in 1943 the War Cabinet had considered that a determined effort should be made to persuade theUnited States Government to refrain from publishing these records,and Mr. Churchill had prevailed upon President Roosevelt to vetothe project at that time. Since then, however, some of the con-siderations which had influenced the War Cabinet had lost their force; and in present circumstances it seemed difficult to maintain our opposition to the publication of these documents.The Cabinet-Authorised the Foreign Secretary to inform the UnitedStates Ambassador in London that His Majesty&apos;s Govern- jment no longer desired to offer objection to the publication&apos;of the records of the proceedings of the Council of Fourat the Paris Peace Conference.Food.ProposedReductionin CheeseRation.6. The Prime Minister said that he had been informed,by the minister of Food that, in view of the difficulty of obtaining supplies from the United States, it would be necessary to make some reduc-tion in the cheese ration. The Minister desired to announce this in the debate on the World Food Situation which was to take placein the House of Commons that afternoon.
249CM. 30 (46)-The Cabinet took the view that no final decision should be takento make this reduction until every possibility of maintaining theexisting supplies had been fully explored. In any event, it would be inexpedient to announce such a reduction in the course of the debate that afternoon.The Cabinet-Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for anearly Meeting of Ministers on World Food Supplies toconsider the possibility of maintaining the existing cheeseration; and would ask the Minister of Food not to makeany announcement on this question for the time being.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,Uh April, 1946.
