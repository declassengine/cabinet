Tariff Policy.(previous reference:CM. (56) 35thConclusions.Minute. 11.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (C. (57) 201) recommending thatthe forthcoming Tariff Bill should not include mandatory provisionsexempting Commonwealth goods from duty.The President of the Board of Trade said that the adoption ofthe Brussels nomenclature, which was one of the main objects of this bill, would make it no longer necessary or appropriate, from thetechnical point of view, to re-enact the existing mandatory provisions for the exemption of Commonwealth goods from duty. Moreover,it would be desirable, on policy grounds, not to re-enact these provisions, since their existence tended to weaken our negotiating position in relation to Commonwealth Governments. In order to anticipate any.possible misunderstanding of our action, however, hewould make it clear, in a parliamentary statement, that our decision not to re-enact the existing provisions did not imply any fundamental change in our policy, The Colonies presented a special problem.But, since we should never discriminate against them in favour ofthe independent members of the Commonwealth, they weresafeguarded by our duty-free entry commitments to the independent members of the Commonwealth, in so far as the commodities whichthe Colonies produced were covered, by these commitments: and itwas therefore unnecessary to include in the forthcoming Bill anyspecial provisions in relation to the Colonies.In discussion it was suggested that a decision not to re-enact theexisting provisions was not, and could not be presented as, a merely52360-5B 2Pensions. 1.   The Prime Minister saidthat, on reflection, he had reached(Previous        the   conclusion   that   the   Cabinefs   further   discussion   of   a reference:      supplementary pensions scheme would be assisted if they had beforeC.C.

Itshould be completed within a fortnight and should be initiallysubmitted to the Ministers primarily concerned in order to ensurethat, from their respective points of view, it was a correct andobjective description of the various possible courses of action.Thereafter it should be considered by Ministers Collectively.The Minister of Pensions suggested that, in dealing with thescheme originally devised by the Life Offices themselves, thestatement should recognise the possibility that the scheme might bebased on a rather smaller percentage of earnings than had originally been envisaged. It might also include a variant of his own proposals,whereby the flat-rate provision would be supplemented by a schemewhich would be mainly voluntary but Could be made compulsoryin certain circumstances.      1 &apos;Even if the Cabinet reached a.decision on this matter in thenear future, the legislation involved would be complex and it mightbe impossible to introduce the Bill Until March 1958. , Tt would thenbe difficult to ensure its enactment before the end of the Session;and it was for consideration, therefore, whether the government&apos;s proposals should be published at a relatively-late point in the Session,- either in the form of a Bill or as. a White,Paper, legislative action being deferred until the 1-958-59 Session- 1     &apos;The Cabinet -      . .Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to arrange for thepreparation of a factual statement of the various formswhich a scheme of supplementary pensions might assume,on the. lines indicated by the Prime Minister.
mtechnical question. These provisions were, in fact, an impedimentin our trade negotiations with independent Commonwealth countries;and, when combined with our obligations under the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, they effectively prevented us fromadjusting tariffs in those cases where we had no specific commitments to foreign countries and no active Commonwealth trade interest was involved. But if, for these reasons, the existing provisions were re-enacted in relation only-to the Colonies, it would be clear thatwe were changing our policy rather than making a purely technicaladjustment.;In further discussion it was emphasised that action which might appear to be against the interests of Commonwealth countries at this time might give rise to misunderstandings. The independent members of the Commonwealth and the Colonies were alreadysuspicious of the part which we were taking in the movement towards closer economic association in Europe; and public opinion in this country might consider that a decision to abandon the existing statutory provisions contrasted unfavourably with recent statements by the;Prime Minister of Canada about the need to strengthen theCommonwealth ties. The position of the Colonies was one ofparticular difficulty, in view of our special responsibilities towards them, even though the existence of the statutory provisions inquestion did not prevent us from placing restrictions, other thantariffs, on the entry of their products into the United kingdom market.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that the considerations were nicely balanced. A decision not to re-enact theexisting statutory provisions, at least in relation to the independent members of the Commonwealth, could be defended on the groundthat it was in our interest to gain greater freedom of negotiation with Commonwealth countries and to secure some liberty to adjusttariffs in those cases where we had no specific foreign commitments and no active Commonwealth trade interest was at stake. But sucha decision might be viewed unfavourably by other commonwealth countries; and in that event the Government^ supporters in thiscountry might-be critical of the proposed action. A final decision must depend, to some extent on the reactions of the other membersof the Commonwealth; and we should take the opportunity of theforthcoming meeting of Commonwealth Finance Ministers to discussthe issue with them. The position of the Colonies should bere considered thereafter. Meanwhile the drafting of the Bill should proceed on the basis that the existing provisions would be retained,on the understanding that an amendment could be introduced at alater stage should the Cabinet decide, in the light of the views ofthe other members of the Commonwealth, against their re-enactment.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to circulate amemorandum defining the exact scope of the existingmandatory provisions for the exemption of Common-wealth goods from duty in their application to theindependent members of the Commonwealth and to theColonies respectively.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to ascertain, atthe forthcoming meeting of Commonwealth finance ministers, the reaction of the independent members ofthe Commonwealth to the possible discontinuance ofthese provisions.(3) Agreed to resume consideration, of this question at a later meeting in the light of the results of the action to betaken under Conclusion (2) above.(4) Agreed that, in the meantime, the drafting of the Tariff Billshould proceed on the basis that the existing mandatoryprovisions would be re-enacted.
4. The Cabinet had before them a telegram from the foreign secretary in New York (Telegram No. 1468 of 17th September)about the arrangements for meeting the costs of clearing the suez canal.The Prime Minister said that it was satisfactory that theSecretary-General of the United Nations had agreed that the Frenchand British claims for work carried out under United Nationscommand should rank for reimbursement with the advances madeby certain other countries towards the costs of clearing the suez canal. We should seek to agree with the French Government that,in the forthcoming discussions with the representative of theSecretary-General, the British and French claims would be limitedto reasonable figures and that we should not, by undue insistence,provoke a demand that the Governments of the United Kingdom andFrance should accept responsibility for meeting the whole cost ofclearance. Though the method of collection had not yet beendecided, it seemed likely that the system adopted would provide fora voluntary surcharge on transit fees. Any such surcharge should,if possible, be limited to a maximum of 5 per cent, in order to minimise any repercussion on freight rates.In discussion there was general agreement that the recovery ofany surcharge should not be entrusted to the Egyptian Suez CanalAuthority. In the case of British shipowners it would be preferable that the sums due should be paid in London in the same way as the transit fees. The Secretary-General might open a separate account for this purpose.The British ship-owners had given notice that they wouldformally ask the United Kingdom Government to reimburse themfor any surcharge payments which they had to make. They had,however, agreed not to raise this issue in public until after thediscussions in the United Nations. Legislation would be requiredfor any such reimbursement from public funds, though the surchargecould probably be admitted as a trading expense for purposes oftaxation.Some foreign ship-owners might refuse to pay the surcharge.In that event only the Egyptian authorities would be in a positionto enforce the payment by refusing passage to the ships concerned.It would, however, be unacceptable to allow Egypt to exercise anysuch sanction, and the arrangements for collecting the surchargemight well break down. On the other hand, it was more importantat the present juncture to secure the agreement of the GeneralIsrael: ArabBoycott.(previous reference :CC. (57) 52ndConclusions,Minute 3.)Suez Carnal.Cost ofClearance.(previous reference :CC. (57) 52ndConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (C. (57) 204) covering a report by officials on the implications of the Arab boycott of Israel.The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that this reportindicated that any unilateral attempt on the part of the UnitedKingdom to oppose the Arab boycott of Israel would be ineffectiveand that the Government should therefore restrict their efforts toassisting individual firms who encountered difficulties as a resultof the activities of the Arab Boycott Committee. He endorsed these conclusions. Effective measures to counter the boycott could onlybe taken with the support of other Governments, principally theUnited States. It was clear, however, that we could not secure such support; and any attempt by the United Kingdom to takeindependent action would not achieve any positive results and mightwell impair our prestige in the Middle East.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of C. (57) 204.
I , 6Assembly to an arrangement which appeared to be practicable than to attempt to foresee the possible consequences if that arrangementsubsequently broke down. It would be for subsequent consideration whether, if it proved impossible to enforce the surcharge, thecountries which had made the original advances should write off the sums involved.The Cabinet then considered the terms of a draft reply to besent to the Foreign Secretary in New York.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs to arrangefor the despatch to the Foreign Secretary in New Yorkof a telegram in the terms of the draft approved in their discussion.U.N.E.S.C.O.(previous reference :CM. (56) 57thConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the formerMinister of Education (C. (57) 198) about Ministerial responsibilityfor U.N.E.S.C.O. affairs.The Lord President said that, in his capacity as Minister ofEducation, he had been reluctantly prepared to accept a recommendation that responsibility for U.N.E.S.C.O. affairs shouldbe transferred from the Minister of Education to the foreign secretary, provided that this proposal was endorsed by the Cabinet.He feared, however, that this transfer might invite criticism on theground that it implied that our attitude towards U.N.E.S.C.O. wouldhenceforward be dominated by political considerations.In discussion it was recognised that the proposed transfer had certain administrative advantages since the Foreign Office were ina better position to co-ordinate, in the context of our general relations with the United Nations, the handling of the wide range of subjects which U.N.E.S.C.O. discussed. On the other hand, therewere political disadvantages in creating the impression, both in thiscountry and abroad, that the United Kingdom Government proposedto exercise a more rigid, and a more specifically political, controlover matters formally within U.N.E.S.C.O.&apos;s terms of reference.Moreover, our relations with the International Labour organisation had shown the advantage, in the case of technical organisations, of leaving responsibility with the Minister directly concerned. on balance, therefore, it would be preferable for the Minister ofEducation to retain responsibility for U.N.E.S.C.O. affairs.The Cabinet Agreed that the Minister of Education should remain responsible for U.N.E.S.C.O. affairs.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,20th September, 1957.
