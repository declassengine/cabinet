The Queen&apos;s 2.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of the speeches. Cabinet (C. (57) 232) covering a revised draft of The Queen&apos;s SpeechProrogation of on tne Prorogation of Parliament.Parliament.(previous reference:CC. (57) 71stConclusions,Minute 2.)It was agreed that a number of passages, relating respectively to Malta, Cyprus, the recent series of nuclear trials and theappointment of a Committee of Enquiry into the fishing industry,should be omitted from the The Speech. It was also agreed that the reference to the recent meeting of the Commonwealth finance ministers in Canada should be in more general terms and that no mention need be made of the negotiations for the establishment ofa free trade area in Europe.The Cabinet approved the draft Speech, subject to these changes and to certain other verbal amendments.The Cabinet (1) Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to circulate a final draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation ofParliament.(2) Invited the Prime Minister to submit the final draft for her majesty&apos;s approval.agricultural policy.(previous reference :CM. (56) 31stConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordChancellor (C. (57) 240) covering a report by a Sub-Committee ofthe Home Affairs Committee recommending that legislation toamend certain of the provisions of the Agriculture and agricultural holdings Acts, 1947-49, should be introduced in the forthcoming session.The Lord Chancellor said that Ministers had had under review for a considerable time the problems arising from the excessivedegree of security at present enjoyed by the tenant farmer and fromthe serious difficulties which confronted the Agriculture ministers in exercising their statutory powers of discipline over the agricultural industry. Two new factors had now emerged which made it more realistic to contemplate introducing amending legislation on thesematters. First, the recommendations of the Committee on administrative Tribunals and Enquiries would now make it necessaryin any event to envisage legislation on the functions of agriculturaltribunals. Even a limited measure for this purpose would focusattention on the disciplinary provisions of the Agriculture Act,1947, and would reveal that these provisions had now ceased to be effective. Secondly, an unexpected measure of agreement had been achieved between landlords and farmers on the desirability ofrelaxing the existing statutory provisions governing the tenancy ofagricultural holdings. The farmers also recognised that agriculturalrents had remained artificially depressed, and they would probablyacquiesce in amending provisions which would enable rents to be assessed on the basis of open market values. The proposed legislation would cover these three subjects, and would include, inaddition, a provision to amend the existing law in respect of thebequest of and succession to agricultural tenancies in Scotland.Despite the measure of agreement between the interests primarilyaffected, the Bill would clearly provide scope for controversy.Nevertheless, it would be acceptable to the Governmenfs supporters,and could be amply justified on merits.52550-8B 2Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the final week of the current sessionfollowing the reassembly of Parliament on 29th October.
The Minister of Agriculture said that there could be no questionof ignoring the recommendation of the Committee on administrative tribunals, and Enquiries that the disciplinary functions of the agriculture Ministers should be transferred to independent tribunals.Action to give effect to this recommendation would, however,necessarily entail radical amendment of Part II of the agriculture act, 1947. The Agriculture Act passed in the current session had now placed the agricultural subsidies on an independent long-term basis, and the farmers no longer had reason to fear that theamendment of Part II of the 1947 Act would be interpreted as freeingthe Government from their obligations under the subsidy provisions-of Part I of that Act. Although the Opposition would no doubtcriticise the proposed measure, the opportunity t)f introducing legislation based on a substantial measure of agreement betweenlandowners and farmers was unlikely to recur, and the Governmentwould be charged with lack of political courage if, after the extensiveconsultations which had taken place, they failed to proceed with this legislation.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that he fully endorsed the case for introducing amending legislation on the lines proposed.The amendment of the law governing the succession to, and thebequest of, agricultural tenancies in Scotland would, however, be highly controversial in Scotland and would be resisted by the ScottishNational Farmers&apos; Union.Discussion showed that the Cabinet recognised the case for proceeding with the proposed legislation in the forthcoming session,particularly in view of the measure of agreement which had beenreached between landowners and farmers. The repeal of the disciplinary powers would be welcomed by the governments supporters, and a relaxation of the provisions governing security of tenure would provide encouragement to younger farmers. In its application to agricultural rents, the Bill would not be strictlyanalogous with the recent Rent Act and would be unlikely to provokeas critical a reaction. On the other hand, the Cabinet had had littleopportunity to consider the full implications of this measure, whichwould provide scope for general political and social controversy.The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament should, therefore,refer only in general terms to the possibility of introducing legislation to amend the Agriculture Acts. Such a reference might be combined,in a composite paragraph, with references to the government&apos;s intention to promote measures to repeal certain emergency powersrelating to land and to give effect to certain recommendations of theCommittee on Administrative Tribunals and Enquiries. It would subsequently be necessary for the Cabinet to consider, before the debate on the Address, the precise scope of the proposed amendmentof the Agriculture Acts.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the legislative programme for the forthcoming session should provide, in principle, for some degree of amendment of the Agriculture and Agricultural HoldingsActs, 1947-49.(2) Agreed to give further consideration, at a subsequent meetingbefore the Debate on the Address, to the precise scopeof such amending legislation.(3) Agreed that, pending a final decision, the governments intentions in this matter should be expressed in general terms in The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening ofParliament.
Administration        4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the home of Justice.       Secretary and the Lord Chancellor (C. (57) 236) seeking approval tothe appointment of a Royal Commission to consider the arrangementsfor the administration of justice by courts of assize and quarter sessions.The Home Secretary said that, while much could be achieved inthe field of penal reform by administrative methods and by the changes envisaged in several relatively minor Bills which he proposedto introduce in the forthcoming session, the major problem was to devise a suitable method of giving adequate effect through themachinery of justice to the concepts of penal treatment which were now generally accepted. The principles on which the sentencing ofconvicted offenders was now based assumed that the court, havinginformed itself of the history, character and potentialities of the offender and of the possible effect on him of the various forms oftreatment available as penalties, would select the most appropriateform of sentence. The law provided magistrates&apos; courts with amplepowers to these ends: but the superior courts were still virtuallyobliged to proceed direct from conviction to sentence. He therefore proposed that a Royal Commission should be appointed to examinethe arrangements for the administration of justice in courts of assizeand quarter sessions and to consider, in particular, what alterationswere required to ensure that these courts, before passing sentence,would have adequate information about the circumstances of offenders convicted before them.In discussion it was suggested that, although it was important that courts should be seen to give the fullest possible effect to the modern concepts of penal treatment, it was no less important to avoid unnecessary delay between the conviction and sentence.   It wouldbe dangerous to adopt, without more careful examination,  a procedure which would gradually undermine the principle of anitinerant judiciary, which was one of the cardinal features of our legalsystem. On the other hand, it was the clear intention of the criminla justice Act,  1948, that courts should have before them such information as was necessary to enable them to adapt the sentence:   :&quot;;   to the offender; and, now that increased facilities for the supply ofUli    W;such information were available, it was desirable to consider howut   ^ far^the&apos; judicial system&apos;might heed&apos; to be modified in order to take full advantage^ of&apos; those facilities. &apos;&apos;&apos;-1 - : -    ;. .    .&apos;.ji        i, i.   j   The,,PrimeMinister, summing mpitthe discussion, said that ity..  - - a. s; :..  would be necessary to examine in more detail the scope of any reviewv/of&apos; the, administration, of justice which the Government mighti; r;   undertake.  It would be desirable that any mention of this subject&apos;/.:..)::   :   ;.in The Queen&apos;s Speech should be expressed in general terms rather-    ;    &apos;   than by reference to the appointment of a Royal Commission.   It&apos;       .      would be for consideration whether the relevant paragraph of the:    Speech should also mention the possibility of a Government measure. to implement the proposals of the Wolfenden report relating toprostitution.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Affairs Committee to examine, in greater detail, the proposals outlined in C. (57) 236.(2) Agreed that it would be for consideration, in the light of theresult of the further examination to be made under conclusion (1) above, how far it would be appropriate thatThe Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament should refer to the Governmenfs intention to review thearrangements for the administration of justice by the superior courts.
sis6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (C. (57) 234) on the proposal thatthe forthcoming Tariff Bill should not include mandatory provisionsexempting Commonwealth goods from duty.The President of the Board of Trade said that further examination of the existing statutory provisions relating to duty-free entry for Commonwealth goods had shown that it would not bepossible to reproduce these provisions exactly in the forthcomingTariff Bill without perpetuating the arbitrary distinction betweenduties charged in particular tariff enactments, which it was a main purpose of the Bill to eliminate. He had also ascertained, duringthe recent meeting of Commonwealth Finance Ministers in Canada,that there would, in general, be no objection on the part of the other independent members of the Commonwealth to our discontinuingthese provisions in the new legislation, on the understanding thattheir discontinuance would not imply any change in our own policy.The position of the Colonies was admittedly different; but toperpetuate the relevant provisions in relation only to the colonies would involve drawing an invidious distinction between differentmembers of the Commonwealth and might provoke the other independent members of the Commonwealth to reconsider their agreement to accept the discontinuance of the provisions. It wouldbe preferable, therefore, that the provisions should be wholly omitted from the new legislation and that the Colonies should be reassuredby a suitable public statement of our intention to make no change inour policy.5. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary ofthe Cabinet (C. (57) 211) outlining the various proposals for further government action in relation to pensions and the arguments forand against each possible course.The Prime Minister said that, after discussing this question withthe Ministers primarily concerned, he was satisfied that the government&apos;s specific proposals, as indicated in The Queen&apos;s speech on the Opening of Parliament, should be limited to an increase in warpensions and increases in retirement benefits and contributions underthe National Insurance scheme and that the Speech should merelyindicate that the Government were continuing to study the widerproblems of provision for old age. Thereafter, it would be desirablethat the Cabinet should have, at a suitable opportunity, a full discussion of the further possibilities of action outlined in C. (57) 211.If the Government were to introduce proposals which would providefor supplementation of the National Insurance system on a significantscale, the choice might be found to lie between the two schemesdefined in C. (57) 211 as the September plan and the August plan.Of these, the latter would represent a relatively simple operation fromthe technical point of view. On the other hand, the September plan,though technically more complicated, appeared to present certainpolitical advantages. It would be necessary, therefore, to arrange forthe relative merits and the administrative implications of thesedifferent proposals to be examined further before the Governmentcould decide their final policy in this matter.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers proposal that The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of parliament should indicate that the Government were continuing to study the wider problems of provision for old age.(2) Agreed to resume, at a subsequent meeting, their discussionof the various possible courses of action described inC. (57) 211.
In discussion the following points were made: -(a) Although certain of the other independent members ofthe Commonwealth had indicated, at the recent meeting of commonwealth Finance Ministers in Canada, that they &quot;wereprepared to accept the discontinuance of the existing statutory provisions, the position of other members was less clear. It mightbe desirable that, before the Bill was introduced, United kingdom high Commissioners in all the Commonwealth countries concerned should be instructed to verify that no objection would be raised byany member of the Commonwealth to Our proposal.(b) Unlike the independent members of the Commonwealth, theColonies were unable to protect themselves by trade agreements orotherwise; and, if the existing statutory provisions were omitted fromthe new legislation, they would inevitably be suspicious of our intentions. On the other hand, it was inconceivable that we shouldimpose a duty on Colonial products in any case in whichcorresponding products from independent members of theCommonwealth were entitled to enter this country free of. duty.Moreover, to perpetuate the existing statutory provisions in relationto the Colonies alone would be liable to involve us in embarrasment in negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of advantage appeared to lie in omitting the existing provisions entirely from the forthcoming Bill. The Colonies should,however, be given ample notice of our intentions and should be givenall possible reassurances. If necessary, their position could bere considered later.The Cabinet (1) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to consider, inconsultation with the Commonwealth Secretary, how far it was desirable to verify that the other independent members of the Commonwealth were prepared to accept our proposal to discontinue, in the forthcoming TariffBill, the existing statutory provisions for the exemption of Commonwealth goods from protective duties.(2) Agreed that, subject to Conclusion (1) above and on theunderstanding that the position of the Colonies would bere considered if necessary at a later stage, these provisions should not be reproduced in the new legislation.Legislative 7.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeBST^slTseKioii Secretary (c- (57) 242) proposing a revised legislative programme for&apos; the forthcoming session.Reference: In addition to the issues of policy dealt with in&apos; the precedingCC. (57) 59th Minutes 3-6, the following points were made in discussion:  SnufeZ)8&apos; ia) The Public Works Loans and Trustee Savings Banks bills should be classified as essential measures.(b) The Slaughterhouses Bill should be placed in a reservecategory pending a final decision on the scope of the legislation toamend the Agriculture and Agricultural Holdings Acts.(c) Legislation to give effect to the recommendation of theCommittee on Administrative Tribunals and Enquiries in favour ofa Council on Tribunals could be made ready for introduction in theforthcoming session and would be welcomed by the governments supporters. It was not wholly certain, however, that time could befound for this additional measure.
3 hi 1(a?) To avoid delay in arranging the work of standing committees in the new session, the drafting of those Bills which hadbeen accorded a firm place in the programme should now be pressed forward urgently. It was essential that the drafting of the LocalGovernment Bill should be completed in time for it to receive its second Reading before Christmas. The preparation of the proposed legislation to repeal certain emergency provisions relating to land should be similarly expedited in order that, if possible, this legislationalso might be given a Second Reading before Christmas. It it became necessary to draw on the reserve list of Bills, the Charitable Trusts(Baddeley Judgment) Bill would be a suitable and uncontroversialmeasure for this purpose.The Cabinet-(1) Endorsed, subject to the points made in their discussion andto the conclusions recorded under Minutes 3-6 above, thelegislative programme annexed to C. (57) 242.(2) Invited all Ministers who were responsible for Bills whichhad been accorded a place in the legislative programme for the forthcoming session to take urgent steps to expedite the final drafting of these measures.8. In the light of the discussions recorded in Minutes 3-above, the Cabinet considered the revised draft of The Queen&apos;sSpeech on the Opening of Parliament which had been circulatedunder cover of a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet (C. (57) 235).In discussion it was suggested that the Speech should be further conclusions&apos;/&quot; revised in order that the Governmenfs programme of legislationMinute 7.) &apos;    might be presented in a more imaginative and attractive setting.Various textual amendments were suggested and approved. Thefollowing points of substance were also considered:  (a) Paragraph 1. The Speech would appropriately open with a reference to The Queen&apos;s recent stay in Canada and her visit to theUnited States.(b) Paragraphs 2-4. These paragraphs might need furtherconsideration in the light of the outcome of the Prime Minister^forthcoming discussions with President Eisenhower in Washington.(c) Paragraph 4. In the light of the slow progress of the current financial negotiations with representatives of the egyptian government in Rome, it would be preferable to omit the referenceto the Governmenfs intention to continue to press for the restitutionof British property in Egypt and for the payment of compensationby the Egyptian Government.(d) Paragraph 9. The Minister of Defence said that it was desirable, in order to stimulate voluntary recruitment, that thisparagraph should indicate that conditions of service in the forces would be improved. In discussion, however, it was emphasised thatthe Cabinet had not yet considered the extent to which it would bepossible, in current economic circumstances, to contemplate measures for this purpose; and it was agreed that the balance of advantage layin omitting the paragraph entirely.(e) Paragraph 14. This paragraph, which was directed primarily to conditions in Scotland, would be liable to be interpreted more generally, in a manner inconsistent with the Governmenfs economic policy. It was agreed that it should be omitted.(/) Paragraph 16. In present economic circumstances it mightbe advisable that this paragraph should be omitted from the speech, although the proposed measure should probably retain its place in the legislative programme.The Queen&apos;speeches.Opening ofParliament.(previous reference :
(g) Paragraph 18. This paragraph, together with paragraphs 23and 24, should be revised in the light of the Cabinefs earlier decision about the desirability of introducing legislation to amend theprovisions of the Agriculture Acts.(h) Paragraph 19. This paragraph should be omitted from the speech, in accordance with the Cabinefs earlier decision that theBill dealing with slaughterhouses in England and Wales should beheld in reserve.(/) Paragraph 20. The measure relating to agricultural drainageschemes in Scotland should be accorded a firm place in the legislative programme.(j) Paragraph 25. The Public Records Bill should be omitted from the Speech; but it should be retained in the legislative programme and might prove suitable for introduction in the Houseof Lords.(k) Paragraph 26. The proposed legislation on child welfarewould constitute a useful and attractive measure of social reform and should be accorded a firm place in the legislative programme.(/) Paragraph 27. The references to penal reform and thetreatment of offenders should be redrafted in the light of the cabinets decision on the Home Secretary&apos;s memorandum on the administrationof justice (Minute 4 above).The Cabinet (1) Invited the Committee on The Queen&apos;s Speeches to prepare,in the light of their discussion, a revised draft of the queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament.(2) Agreed to consider the revised draft at a subsequent meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,22nd October, 1957.
