Cyprus.(previous reference:CC. (57) 51stConclusions,Minute 6.). *1. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the memorandumby the Prime Minister (C. (57) 161) on a suggested new approach tothe problem of Cyprus.The Prime Minister said that, in the light of the previous discussion of this memorandum, arrangements had been made for theMinistry of Defence, Foreign Office and Colonial Office to makea more detailed examination of the exact boundaries of the enclavesof territory which would remain under exclusive British sovereignty.On the constitutional issue, a mandatory system appeared toprovide no solution to the problem of sovereignty over the Islandsince the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) had neitherthe legal authority nor the machinery which would enable it to grant a mandate to the United Kingdom to govern the whole Island on atrusteeship basis. On the assumption, therefore, that sovereigntywould be shared between the United Kingdom, Greece and Turkey,it still seemed advisable to incorporate in the new arrangementssome sanction which would operate if they broke down. In such an event the Governors first recourse would be to the three sovereignGovernments, acting either unanimously or by a majority vote. If,however, a sanction of this kind proved to be ineffective, it mightbe necessary to empower the Governor to appeal to NATO to takethe necessary action, and to require NATO in that event to callon its member countries to supply troops to maintain order in Cyprus.This conception, however, would not necessarily be acceptable to theGovernment^ supporters; and it would be open to the furtherobjection that it might represent a step in the direction of transformingthe whole Island into a NATO base. On the assumption, therefore,that it would be impossible for us, once the new arrangements hadbeen launched, to re-assume exclusive sovereignty over the wholeIsland in the event of a crisis, it might be better that, in such an event, we should resign our share of the tripartite sovereignty and allow the Greek and Turkish Governments to restore order as bestthey could. Alternatively, if we were not prepared to disinterestourselves completely in those areas of the Island outside our enclaves,we should consider reinforcing the position of the Governor by thecreation of a Council consisting of representatives of the sovereignPowers which would provide him with the necessary support and authority in the event of a breakdown of public order. Even so, itmight be thought necessary to incorporate in the plan some ultimatesanction against the possibility that the representatives of the threesovereign Powers might fail to agree amongst themselves. It was difficult to see what form this sanction could take apart from an authority conferred on NATO to intervene and restore order. But,although it was right that NATO should have the power, failing agreement among the three sovereign Governments, to appoint and,if necessary, to dismiss the Governor, the objections to theOrganisation^ being also empowered to intervene to restore order would need to be more closely examined.In further discussion it was suggested that the proposed arrangements would not be as acceptable to opinion in the UnitedStates and the United Nations as they would be if they containedsome reference to the ultimate possibility of self-determination forthe Island as a whole. It might, therefore, be considered whetherprovision should be included for review after a fixed interval, say,ten years, to allow the issue of self-determination to be re-examined.As against this it was argued that such a provision was likely to provoke a renewal of terrorism towards the end of the period inquestion. It might suffice, at least at this stage, to indicate that therewas nothing in the new arrangements which would prevent self-determination from taking effect at any time, provided that theGovernments of the United Kingdom, Greece and Turkey reached agreement upon the necessary measures.52550-2b 2
Suez Canal.(previous reference:CC. (57) 51stConclusions,Minute 1.)Cost ofClearance.2. The Foreign Secretary said that it had been proposed thata special surcharge on the ships using the Suez Canal would providethe most convenient means of securing the repayment of the advances made by certain countries to finance the clearing of the canal. Although such a surcharge would be unwelcome to ourselves and to other maritime nations, there was no prospect of securing theagreement of the United Nations that the repayment should be discharged by the Egyptian Government. Indeed, if the matter was raised at the United Nations, it might provoke a demand that the costs should be met by the United Kingdom and french governments&apos;; and our opposition to such a proposal would not onlyjeopardise the chance of securing satisfactory arrangements for financing the costs of the United Nations Expeditionary Force(U.N.E.F.) but might also precipitate the premature withdrawal ofthat Force. The proposal that the costs of clearance should be met by a surcharge would, however, be more acceptable if these costsincluded the clearance expenses which we ourselves had incurred at port&quot; Said.In discussion it was suggested that some countries which had contributed to the cost of clearance, for example Norway, mightwell find themselves paying as much in surcharge as they would obtain in reimbursement; and, from this point of view, there wouldbe much to be said for writing off the claims involved if the agreementof the United States, as the preponderant single contributor, couldbe obtained.   Subject to this, there appeared to be no satisfactoryDiscussion then turned to the timing of the publication of thenew arrangements. If these were to command the support of theUnited States and of NATO, they should not be launched untilthe proposal that Cyprus should be granted independence under international guarantee had been publicly discussed and been shown to be unacceptable. On.this basis it would be desirable to arrangein advance of the debate on Cyprus in the General Assembly of theUnited Nations in the autumn, a conference between ourselves and theGreek and Turkish Governments at which the proposal to establish an independent Cyprus could be examined. Both the United Statesand NATO should be invited to send observers to this conference;and representatives of the Cypriot communities should also be invitedto attend, either as delegates or as witnesses. The conference wouldprobably break down as a result of Turkish opposition to the concept of independence for Cyprus. If, thereafter, we put forward our own proposals, either during or immediately after the debate in theGeneral Assembly, they would be the more likely to enjoy the supportof the United States in that the alternative plan would have been seen to offer no possibility of a solution. On this hypothesis, however,it would be necessary to consider carefully the exact point of time at which we should inform the United States of our own proposals.The issues involved in the organisation of the tripartite conferenceand the subsequent publication of our own proposals should be examined in greater detail by the Ministers immediately concerned.The Cabinet-CD Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with the LordChancellor and the Colonial Secretary, to consider thearrangements for the organisation of a tripartiteconference and the subsequent publication of our own proposals, on the basis outlined in their discussion.(2) Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to arrange for further examination by officials of the Departments concerned of the constitutional issues noted in their discussion.
Israel. 3.   The Foreign Secretary said that the Shell Oil Company and(Previous the British Petroleum Company had decided to close down their reference: distributing organisation in Israel as the result of a threat by theCC. (57) 17th Saudi Arabian Government that, if they continued to operate in conclusions, Israel, they would be denied facilities in Saudi Arabia. It was minute 9.) unfortunate that the two companies should have represented this toBritish Oil ^e Government of Israel as a political decision, although they hadCompanies.     not *n ^act consulted Her Majesty&apos;s Government before taking it.Steps had already been taken to disabuse the Government of Israelof any misunderstanding which might have arisen on that account.The decision of the companies had in fact been dictated primarily by commercial considerations, including the low level of profitability of their operations in Israel. There was no reason to suppose that,as a result of their withdrawal, Israel would be deprived of access to alternative sources for oil supplies.In discussion there was general agreement that there was no occasion for the Government to ask the companies to reconsider their decision. Consideration should, however, be given to the extent towhich our commercial interests, and those of other countries, mightbe affected by the Arab policy of attempting to establish an economicboycott of Israel, and to the steps which might be taken, in association with the United States, to counteract it.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Government should not attempt to persuade the Shell Oil Company and the British petroleum company to reconsider their decision to withdraw theirdistributing organisation from Israel.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for theEconomic Policy Committee to examine the implications of the Arab boycott of Israel and to consider what action might be taken to mitigate any damage which this boycottmight inflict on our commercial interests.alternative to the proposed surcharge. Our agreement to thisproposal must be subject, however, to the conditions that our ownclaim should rank for reimbursement and that the surcharge wouldbe applied without discrimination to the shipping of all countries.It was also desirable that repayment should be spread over as long aperiod as possible, in order that the surcharge could be fixed at a figure which would not significantly affect transport costs and import prices.Certain member countries might resist the proposed surchargeif it was embodied in proposals submitted formally to the united nations. It would be preferable, therefore, for the arrangements toform the subject of an agreement between the Secretary-General ofthe United Nations and the Egyptian Government. Although the surchange might have to be collected in the first instance by theEgyptian Canal Authority, the risk that this might be interpreted as implying formal recognition of that Authority would be reduced ifan agent of the United Nations could be stationed in Egypt to supervise its collection.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to be guided by the sense oftheir discussion in dealing with the proposal that the cost of clearing the Suez Canal should be met by a surcharge on theshipping using the Canal.
Industrial 4.   The Minister of Labour said that, in the  course of disputes. negotiations between the Transport and G. icral Workers Union and(Previous the municipal and provincial bus companies, the municipal companiesReference: had offered a wage increase of Is. 6d. to which the Union had .C. (57) 36th responded with a claim for an increase of 10s.   The provincialConclusions, companies, on the other hand, had offered an increase of only 3s.Minute 5.) which had been rejected by the Union. As a result, the men employedProvincial by the provincial companies were due to come out on strike towardsBus-Workers, the end of the week.Covent Garden.The provincial companies were willing that the dispute should,be submitted to arbitration by the Industrial Disputes Tribunal. TheUnion, however, had refused to agree to this. The decision on thispoint rested with the Minister of Labour, and he had referred thematter to the Tribunal. There was some risk that the Union would regard this as a challenge to their authority and would try to extend the strike, not merely to the municipal companies, who were due to resume negotiations in the following week, but also to the rest of thetransport industry. Nevertheless, it would be unwise to acquiesce ina unilateral refusal by the Union to accept a reference to theappropriate Tribunal.In discussion, there was general agreement with this view.The Minister of Agriculture said that a dispute had broken out at Covent Garden, as a result of which the men engaged in unloadingfruit and vegetables had declared a strike. If this strike spread to theother London markets, the consequences, though unfortunate, could probably be dealt with. If, however, it extended to the provincialmarkets, it might be necessary for the Government to take emergencyaction to meet the situation which might then arise.The Prime Minister said that the Emergencies Committee should keep this situation under review.The Cabinet &apos;Invited the Emergencies Committee to keep under review the situation resulting from the strike at Covent Garden.Industrial 5.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, together withRelations. the  Minister  of  Labour,  he  would  shortly  be meeting  the(Previous representatives of industry to learn the result of their further reference: consideration of the Governmenfs proposal to establish a newC.C. (57) 38th advisory body on wages and prices.  Thereafter, the Cabinet would conclusions, need to consider the result of this meeting; but it was desirable that minute 8.) the Government should adhere in principle to their original intentionto establish an advisory body of this kind.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.Jute Industry. 6.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the President of theBoard of Trade (C. (57) 166) covering a draft Parliamentary statementannouncing a reduction in the degree of protection accorded to thejute industry.The President of the Board of Trade said that since the end of. the war the jute industry had continued to enjoy a unique form ofprotection under an arrangement whereby the Jute Control purchasedall imported supplies of jute goods and resold them at prices whichwere 40 per cent, above cost. The Economic Policy Committee had decided that this degree of protection was both contrary to theinterests of the industrial and agricultural users of jute goods and
Post OfficeFinance.(previous reference:CM. (56) 27thConclusions,Minute 6.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePostmaster-General (C. (57) 158) submitting proposals for increases in Post Office charges to yield additional revenue of  42 millions a year.The Postmaster-General said that since 1951 increases in PostOffice costs amounting to about  100 millions had been met, 75 millions by increases in charges and  25 millions by improvements in efficiency. It had been decided in 1956 that the Post Office financesshould be put on a commercial basis, and a further substantial increase in revenue was now needed to meet the additional increasein costs resulting from a series of recent wage awards. As many ofthese awards had been retrospective, his proposals were designed to balance the Post Office accounts over the three financial years ending31st March, 1959, and to yield a small surplus of  5 millions at theend of that period. The sum of  63 millions which it would benecessary to collect during the eighteen months between 1st October,1957, and 31st March, 1959, was made up of  58 millions in respectof wage commitments already incurred and  9 millions as a reserveagainst future wage increases, less a credit of  4 millions forprospective improvements in efficiency.As regards presentation of these proposals, there would be no advantage in merely multiplying the occasions for public disquiet byspreading the increases over a period, especially since it would benecessary to make provision, even in a first instalment, for additional revenue of some  38 millions. Moreover, eleven-twelfths of theproposed increases were attributable to increased wage costs, andit was desirable that the additional charges should be clearly seen tobe related to the wage awards which had been responsible for them.could not be sustained without jeopardising the ultimate survival of a jute industry in this country. A reduction in selling marginsfrom 40 per cent, to 20 per cent., which would be justifiable oneconomic grounds, had been felt to be too severe, and a compromisefigure of 30 per cent, had been agreed. This reduction would not besufficient to cause industry and agriculture to resume the use of jutepacking materials in preference to paper which was now provinga more economical substitute; but it would serve as an intimationto the jute manufacturing industry that the exceptional protectionwhich it had enjoyed must now be expected gradually to disappear.The best prospects for Dundee and the surrounding locality lay indiversifying industry in the area; and there were grounds for optimismthat the jute industry itself would prove capable of manufacturinga greater variety of products.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that he accepted theneed, on economic grounds, to begin reducing the exceptional degreeof protection which the jute industry had hitherto enjoyed. A gradualapproach in the initial stages was, however, very desirable. Even thereduction in selling margins now proposed would result in some3,000-4,000 people becoming unemployed and would be liable to revive controversy about the extent to which the Government were committed, by previous pledges, to maintain protection for the juteindustry. If the co-operation of the industry was to be secured andmore serious local unemployment was to be avoided, the transitionto a more diversified industrial structure in the Dundee area shouldbe phased over a period.The Cabinet Authorised the President of the Board of Trade to make astatement in Parliament on the following day, in the termsof the draft annexed to C. (57) 166, on the future of thejute industry.
The postal services would account for  24 millions, and the telephone service for  18 millions, of the additional annual revenueinvolved. With the exception of the letter post, all the increased charges had been imposed on services which were in deficit or neededadjustment in some other respect. While the inland letter serviceadmittedly yielded a profit at present, the additional revenue neededcould not be obtained without increasing the basic postal rate from \d. to 3d., a charge which would yield over  12 millions. Moreover,,the delivery service could not be mechanised, and its costs were therefore mainly determined by postmen&apos;s wages, which had risen to three times the 1939 level. Even after the increase our inlandpostal service would still be the cheapest in Europe, outside spain and Portugal. Nine-tenths of all inland letters were under 1 ouncein weight and would not, therefore, be affected by the proposal thatthe 3d. charge should apply only to the first ounce. To extend the3d. charge, like the existing 2\d. charge, to the first 2 ounces wouldinvolve a loss of some  3 millions of the  12^- millions of additionalpostal revenue envisaged by the proposals.As regards the telephone service, the uneconomic differentials inrentals should be abolished. It would also be necessary to increase to 3d. the cost of a local call and to abolish free local calls. On theother hand, subscribers would benefit from proposals, to be announced in the autumn, for a very considerable extension of thearea in which the local 3d. call would be operative.All the proposals had been approved by the Post Office AdvisoryCouncil, who had rejected as impracticable such drastic economiesas a withdrawal of the first delivery of letters. Not merely would this involve a discharge of some 20,000 Post Office workers, manyof whom were established, but it would seriously impair the efficiency of industry and commerce.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, between thealternative courses of raising charges and subsidising services, he hadno doubt that the former course must be adopted. Even at the riskof unpopularity the Government must maintain a realistic attitudetowards increases in charges which were directly attributable to wageawards; and, whatever adjustments in the detailed proposals mightbe called for, the need to secure a total increase in revenue of the orderproposed appeared inescapable.Discussion showed that there was considerable support in theCabinet for this view. On the other hand, it was urged that theproposed increases would be liable to provoke a good deal of criticism.Despite numerous attempts to relate rising prices to wage awards, theGovernment had had very limited success in establishing thisconnection in the public mind. It might, therefore, be wiser tointroduce the proposed increases in successive stages. In any event,some of the details of the proposals merited further consideration,particularly the increased poundage on postal orders, the modifications in Commonwealth and foreign postal charges and theincrease to A\d. of the charge for an inland letter exceeding 1 ounce.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion at a further meeting that afternoon.
