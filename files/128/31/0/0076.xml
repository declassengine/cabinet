washington talks.(previous reference :CC. (57) 74thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Prime Minister made a report to the Cabinet on thediscussions which he and the Foreign Secretary had held in washington and Ottawa from 23rd to 26th October.The Prime Minister said that the results of their discussions with president Eisenhower and Mr. Dulles had been set forth in the&quot; declaration of common purpose &quot; which had been issued at the endof that meeting. This was, in effect, a declaration of inter-dependence.The Government and people of the United States had been greatly impressed by recent Soviet successes and above all by the spectacularevidence, in their launching of an earth satellite, of Soviet achievementsin science and technology. They now recognised that no singlecountry, however powerful, could alone withstand the Soviet threatand that all the resources of the free world must now be marshalled tomeet it. The prevailing mood in Washington had therefore been favourable to proposals for closer Anglo-American co-operation, andthe following understandings had been reached.First, it had been agreed that the two Governments would infuture take steps to concert a common policy for countering Sovietencroachment, not only by military preparations but also by political,economic and propaganda measures. This co-operation would be presented as a means, not of establishing an Anglo-Americanhegemony, but of deploying the resources of the two countries more effectively in the service of the free world. They would therefore seek to apply their common policies through the existing alliancesand associations of the free world or, where appropriate, in concert with individual friendly Governments.Secondly, the United States Government had agreed to adoptand apply the principle of pooling resources in the development and production of new weapons. Means of applying this principle inpractice would be studied in the first instance between the twoGovernments; but it was contemplated that the scope of this connection-operation should later be widened to include other allied countrieswhich were in a position to make a significant contribution to thecommon effort.Thirdly, in pursuance of this policy, President Eisenhower had undertaken to ask Congress so to amend the Atomic Energy Act asto allow of greater co-operation in that field with the United Kingdomand other friendly countries.Fourthly, it had been agreed that the United States and theUnited Kingdom should regard their possession of nuclear weaponsas a trust for the defence of the free world, and should jointly seekmeans of reassuring the world that they would be used, and would only be used, for that purpose.These understandings represented substantial and valuableconcessions on the part of the United States Government. In returnwe had been asked to do no more than give a private undertaking that, while the present Government was in office, the United kingdom would not, without the agreement of the United States, press for achange in the representation of China in the United Nations. Andthe United States Government had agreed to make a joint study with us of the threat to Hong Kong and the steps which might be takento meet it.52550-9b 2The Queen&apos;s 1.   The Prime Minister said that, while he had been inVisit to North Washington and Ottawa, he had been deeply impressed by theAmerica. enthusiasm which had been evoked by the visit of The Queen andthe Duke of Edinburgh to Canada and the United States. Thesuccess of this visit and the memories which it bad left in these two great countries had made an invaluable contribution to the continuingclose fellowship between this country and the North Americanpeoples.
The Prime Minister said that, during their brief visit to Ottawa,he and the Foreign Secretary had been able to give the canadian government a first-hand account of the discussions in Washington.The Prime Minister of Canada and his colleagues had warmly welcomed the results which had been achieved.The Foreign Secretary said that, largely as a result of the personalfriendship between the Prime Minister and President Eisenhower, wehad now succeeded in regaining the special relationship with theUnited States which we had formerly enjoyed. It would, however,be important to ensure that the goodwill and understanding whichhad been established between the heads of the two Governments wasgiven effective expression at the lower levels of administration in both countries. It would also be important that, in return for the greater measure of collaboration which the Americans were now prepared to contemplate in respect of weapons research and development, Weshould ourselves be ready to consider concessions in certain cases,such as civil aviation policy, where the United States regarded us asbeing too actively concerned to further our own interests at theexpense of theirs. It might also be desirable to reconsider thequestion of voyage licensing and bunkering in connection with the strategic controls over trade with China.The Home Secretary expressed, on behalf of the Cabinet, theirwarm appreciation of the results achieved by the visit of the PrimeMinister and the Foreign Secretary to Washington.East-west trade.(previous reference:CC. (57) 72ndConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Foreign Secretary said that while he was in Washingtonhe had taken the opportunity to explain to the United StatesGovernment the nature of our objections to the total embargo whichthey had proposed on the export of copper to the Soviet Union.The United States Government had been impressed by the argument that an expansion of civilian consumption in the Soviet Union might in the long run have the effect of reducing its military strength; andthey had agreed that the two Governments should undertake a jointreview of the criteria governing the restrictions on East-West trade.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement by the foreign secretary.The Queen&apos;speeches.Prorogation and opening ofParliament.(previous reference :CC. (57) 75thConclusions,Minutes 2and 8.)4. The Cabinet had before them notes by the Home Secretary(C. (57) 250 and 249) covering revised drafts of The Queen&apos;s speeches on the Prorogation and the Opening of Parliament.In discussion it was agreed that reference to the Prime Ministersvisit to Washington and Ottawa would be more appropriately inserted in the Speech on the Opening of Parliament. Various other textualamendments of this Speech were also discussed and agreed.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would submit the finaldrafts of The QueenS Speeches on the Prorogation and theOpening of Parliament for Her Majesty&apos;s approval.Federation of rhodesia and nyasaland.(previous reference:   ,CM: (56) 47thConclusions,Minute 9.)5. The Cabinet bad before them a memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary (C. (57) 248) on constitutional changes inthe Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.The Commonwealth Secretary said that, in order to enlarge theFederal House, the Federal Government had passed a Rill amending the 1953 Constitution and proposed to introduce a Franchise Bill to
Interception of 6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HometioZmUmCa&apos;    Secretary (c- (5y) 246) covering the report of the Committee ofPrivy Councillors who had enquired into the interception of communications.regulate the election of the enlarged House. The 1953 Constitutionprovided that a Bill amending the Constitution must be reserved forassent in the United Kingdom and that a standing committee of theFederal Assembly (the African Affairs Board) should be entitled todraw attention to any Bill which, in their opinion, was a&quot; differentiating measure&quot; in that it subjected Africans todisadvantageous conditions, restrictions or disabilities to whichEuropeans were not also made liable. If the African Affairs Boardasked for a constitutional Bill to be reserved it could only be assentedto by Order in Council which was required to lie before both houses of Parliament at Westminster for forty days.During the debate on the Constitution Amendment Bill theFederal Government had also disclosed their proposals for modifying the franchise. Under these proposals there would, for the time being,be only a very small fraction of qualified Africans on the ordinaryelectoral roll and, in the case of the eight constituencies which wouldbe represented by elected African members, there would initially bea European majority in the aggregate vote. The African AffairsBoard had purported to find in these facts a cause of objection tothe Constitution Amendment Bill, on the ground that it would make possible a franchise system which would4 differentiate betweenAfricans and Europeans to the disadvantage of the former.The Commonwealth Secretary said that during his recent visit to the Federation he had discussed this issue at length withrepresentatives of all shades of local opinion and had, in particular,questioned the Federal Government closely about the possibility of adopting more liberal franchise arrangements. As a result he was satisfied that the Constitution Amendment Bill represented asubstantial advance on present practice and that the United KingdomGovernment could properly advise that it should receive the royal assent. This course would undoubtedly provoke controversy bothin the Federation and in this country. But it would be preferable to the alternative of compelling the Federal Government to abandonboth their Bills. In that event the Prime Minister of the federation was likely to go to the country on a less liberal franchise, on the achievement of Dominion status in 1960, and on general oppositionto British interference in the affairs of the Federation. There was little room for doubt that he would be returned by a large majority,and the hardening of the European attitude towards the Africanwould inevitably provoke fresh racial discord.The Cabinet were informed that the Colonial Secretarysupported the course proposed by the Commonwealth Secretary.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in the Cabinetthat this course should be followed.The Cabinet Agreed that a draft Order in Council, assenting to theConstitution Amendment Bill, should be laid forthwithbefore Parliament; and that Government spokesmen shouldbe prepared to maintain in debate that the modifications ofthe franchise proposed by the Government of the Federationrepresented a liberal and substantial improvement of theexisting arrangements.
The Committee had noted that the authority for the interception of postal packets and telegrams derived from a practice of very longstanding, and they had expressed the view that this authority mustbe regarded as wide enough to cover telephone communications also.They had satisfied themselves that the power was exercised in ascrupulous and conscientious manner and that telephonecommunications were intercepted only where there was good reasonto believe that a serious offence or security interest was involved.The Committee had recommended, subject to certain reservationsby Mr. P. C. Gordon-Walker, M.P., that the power of interceptionshould continue to be used for the purposes for which it was used atpresent, subject to certain additional safeguards.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for thereport of the Committee of Privy Councillors on the interception of communications to be published as a white paper on 31st October and would announce that theGovernment accepted the conclusions and recommendationsof the report.7. The Home Secretary said that the Opposition Leaders had expressed a desire that on the reassembly of Parliament formaltributes should be paid in the House of Commons to the late mr.. R. R. Stokes, M.P. Mr. Stokes had been a popular and respectedMember of the House of Commons; but formal tributes had hitherto been confined to Members who had attained the highest eminence,as Leaders of a Government or Opposition or by the length of their service in the House. The suggestion made by the opposition leaders would therefore involve a significant extension of pastpractice. The alternative would be for the Prime Minister and the leader of the Opposition to refer to Mr. Stokes in the course oftheir speeches in the forthcoming Debate on the Address.Discussion showed that the Cabinet favoured the alternative course suggested by the Home Secretary.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,29th October, 1957.Parliament.Procedure.
