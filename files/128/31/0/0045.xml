Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the first week after the Whitsun Recess.The Opposition had selected as a subject for debate on 25th june the progress achieved in giving effect to the recommendations of thevarious Committees which, under the chairmanship of Sir ErnestGowers, had enquired into social and industrial conditions. ThePrime Minister, in consultation with the Home Secretary and theMinister of Labour, would consider which Ministers should speak on.behalf of the Government in this debate.Home Guard.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 40thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (C. (57) 128) on the question whether theHome Guard might be allowed gradually to lapse without legislation.The Secretary of State for War said that he sought authority tomake an early announcement that the remaining activities of theHome Guard would cease at the end of July. He was satisfied, afterconsultation with the Attorney-General, that while no amending legislation would be strictly necessary to enable the Home Guard tobe disbanded, it might nevertheless be thought to be desirable, on grounds of constitutional propriety, that the Governmenfs decision should receive legislative sanction. Moreover, it might become necessary to reconstitute the Home Guard at some future time and,once the force had been disbanded, further statutory authority wouldbe necessary for this purpose. A Bill dealing with the reserve forces would, in any event, be needed at an early date, and this wouldprovide a convenient opportunity for obtaining statutory authorityboth to disband the Home Guard and to reconstitute it, if necessary,at a later date.In discussion there was general agreement that, in the light ofthe continuing expenditure on the Territorial Army and the civil defence forces, further outlay in respect of the Home Guard could not longer be justified, &quot;and that the Home Guard should now be disbanded.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (57) 128 and authorised theSecretary of State for War to make an early announcement that the activities of the Home Guard would cease at the endof July.Legislative 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeProgramme. Secretary (C. (57) 132) reporting the recommendations of the FutureSession of Legislation Committee on a provisional legislative programme for1957-58. the forthcoming session.The Home Secretary said that the main policy Bills listed inparagraph 6 of C. (57) 132, together with the essential and contingentlyCabinet 1.   The Prime Minister said that it was in principle undesirableProcedure. that public statements on matters of Government policy should bemade by members of the Cabinet, without prior consultation withtheir colleagues, in the course of visits overseas. Ministers should,so far as possible, avoid making such statements on occasions whenit was obvious that they could not have had recent opportunity for consultation with their colleagues.The Cabinet-Took note of the Prime Ministers statement.
ISessential Bills in Lists A and A 1 in the annex to that memorandum,would demand more time than was likely to be available for legislation in the 1957-58 session. Subject, however, to further review at alater date, these Bills would constitute a well-balanced programme,of which the main features would be measures dealing with the reform of the House of Lords, local government organisation and finance, pensions and national insurance, and the repeal of theemergency regulations relating to land. The Mental Health bill could possibly be made ready for inclusion in the programme for1957-58, but only at the cost of sacrificing other important legislation in that session and depriving the 1958-59 programme of one of its main elements. The Credit Trading (Part I) Bill could be deletedfrom the programme. Further consideration would need to be givenin due course to the desirability of proceeding in the forthcoming session with both the Betting and Gaming Bill and the Deer Bill,which would be controversial measures. A Bill, or Bills, dealingwith Adoption and Child Life Protection, which would be non-contentious and would have widespread appeal, might be added tothe programme.In order that the legislation for the session should be ready intime, the Bills indicated in paragraph 6 of C. (57) 132, together withthose in Lists A and A 1, should be regarded as the basis of theprogramme, and the Ministers concerned should now be authorisedto obtain the necessary policy clearance and to give instructions fordrafting to proceed.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Lord Chancellor said that the Emergency legislation committee had made considerable progress with the preparation of proposals for legislation which would enable the emergency regulations relating to land to be revoked. There was no question ofperpetuating in permanent legislation the full range of the powers atpresent contained in the emergency regulations, and the Committeehad rejected a significant proportion of the proposals for permanentpowers which Departments had put forward. In view of the government&apos;s undertaking to repeal the remainder of the emergency regulations during the life-time of the present Parliament, it was important that this legislation should be enacted in the forthcoming session, in order that time might be available to deal with economic controls in the following session. Room would also have to be foundin the legislative programmes for the remaining sessions of the parliament for certain minor Bills, such as the Water Bill and theInventions and Designs Bill, the enactment of which would benecessary before the emergency powers could be finally dispensed with.(b) The Commonwealth Secretary said that it would be essentialto legislate in the next session about Christmas Island.(c) The Minister of Housing said that the New Towns Bill forthe forthcoming session would be a limited measure, concerned solelywith the extension of borrowing powers, and should be promoted tothe category of essential Bills. A more important measure, dealingwith the future ownership of the New Towns, should be reserved forthe final session of the Parliament.(d) The Minister of Agriculture said that the agricultural holdings Bill and Slaughterhouses Bill were likely to be of onlymoderate length, and it would be desirable, if possible, to enact bothBills in the forthcoming session.(e) The President of the Board of Trade said that the Inventionsand Designs Bill was less important than the Weights and MeasuresBill. The law on this subject was now in urgent need of reform andit would be in our commercial interest to proceed with this Bill.
Cancer of the 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeLung- Secretary (C. (57) 135) covering the draft of a statement by the(Previous        Minister of Health about the connection between tobacco smokingReference:       and lung cancer.CM. (56) 32naConclusions, The Home Secretary said that the Medical Research Council had minute 5.) stated, in a special report which would be published on 28th June,that the most reasonable interpretation of the great increase in deathsfrom lung cancer was that a major part of it was caused by smokingof tobacco, particularly cigarettes. This was the first time that theCouncil had made a positive statement of this nature. TheCommittee appointed by the Cabinet to recommend what policy the Government should adopt in this matter had approved the draft statement appended to C. (57) 135 and. had suggested that it shouldbe made by the Minister of Health on 27th June, copies of theMedical Research CounciTs report being made available in the VoteOffice the same evening. The &quot;draft statement implied a rather more positive endorsement of the latest medical findings than had hitherto been forthcoming from foreign Governments; and it might entailsome risk that the Government would be expected to take specificaction to discourage tobacco smoking.In discussion there was general agreement that a government statement on the lines of the draft annexed to C. (57) 135 should accompany the publication of the report of the Medical research council. The following suggestions were, however, made:  (a) The Government should not admit a &quot; duty &quot; to warn thepublic of the connection between smoking and lung cancer. Thisdisease could be differentiated from those, such as tuberculosis andpoliomyelitis, which were infectious or contagious.(b) The opening sentence of the statement should be amended to indicate that the risk of lung cancer was greatest in connection with heavy smoking of cigarettes.The Cabinet-Authorised the Minister of Health to make a statement inthe House of Commons on the 27th June in the form of thedraft annexed to C. (57) 135, as amended in their discussion.(/) The Minister of State for Colonial Affairs said that, while itmight be possible to dispense with a Colonial Loans Bill, legislation to increase the capital of the Colonial Development corporation would almost certainly be required.. The Singapore Bill should now be included in the category of essential Bills; the JamaicaDependencies Bill would certainly be required; and the need to enactthe Overseas Civil Service Bill was becoming increasingly urgent.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the work of preparing the legislation comprised in Lists A and A 1 annexed to C. (57) 132, together withthe Bills listed in paragraph 6 of that memorandum, to beput in hand as rapidly as possible.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to circulate a memorandumreviewing the arguments for proceeding with the betting and Gaming Bill in the forthcoming session.(3) Agreed to resume at a later meeting their consideration ofthe legislative programme for the forthcoming session.
Suez Canal. 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theBritish Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (57) 136) about the further stepsEvacuees.       which might be taken to assist British subjects who had had their(Previous        assets in Egypt sequestrated.Reference:C.C. (-57) 39th The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in view of theConclusions,    interruption of the discussions in Rome between officials of the minute 4.)       United Kingdom Government and the Egyptian Government, publicopinion would probably demand further action in relief of the Britishevacuees from Egypt. Such action might be taken under the following heads:  (a) Suez Contractors&apos; employees in the light of the Cabinefs earlier decision that priority might reasonably be given to their claims the contractors&apos; employees should now be offered advances equal to the full assessed value of the property and effects which they had left behind in Egypt. The amount involved would be of the order of  425,000, excluding  100,000 representingsums which the employees had on deposit in Egyptian banks. On thebasis of the general principle that the claim of the United KingdomGovernment against the Government of Egypt should be kept to theminimum, the claims of the individual employees should not be assigned to the Government as a result of the advances proposed but should be left outstanding against the Egyptian authorities.(b) Assets Held in this country it would be possible to arrange for certain United Kingdombanks to make advances against securities which they were holdingto the order of banks in Egypt on account of the refugees. these advances would be made at a nominal rate of interest, but the bankswould require a Treasury guarantee against loss. There were certainobjections to an arrangement of this kind, and it would be preferable,before deciding to adopt it, to await the result of the enquiry whichthe Egyptian Director-General of Exchange Control had undertaken to make into the possibility of releasing the securities in question.(c) Grants by the Anglo-Egyptian Resettlement board the scope of the Board&apos;s activities might reasonably be extendedin a number of minor respects; and the process of resettlement mightbe accelerated if the payment of resettlement grants, while remainingdependent upon the applicant having found himself employment, wasno longer made dependent upon his having already foundaccommodation as well. On this basis, when an applicant had foundemployment the Board would give him the full scale of resettlementgrant at a fixed rate to cover both accommodation and furniture andwould inform him that they would no longer accept him as their responsibility. Such a proposal, which might cost in all between 1 million and  1^ millions, would be recognised as generous andwould also relieve the Resettlement Board of the continuing liabilitiesabout which they were now seriously concerned.As an alternative to these arrangements it would be possible tointroduce a general scheme for making advances against sequestratedassets and to create a special organisation for this purpose. Such ascheme would, however, imply that the Government were themselvesaccepting liability to compensate British subjects for losses sustainedas a result of the Anglo-French operation against Egypt and would prejudice still further our prospect of obtaining compensation from egypt. Moreover, British assets abroad had been seized in other cases; and if the Government decided, in the present instance, to compensate the losers in full in the absence of any compensation fromthe country responsible, they would be creating a new and potentiallydangerous precedent.In discussion there was general agreement that the contractors&apos;employees should be treated on the lines suggested by the Chancellorof the Exchequer and should be informed forthwith, in strict
confidence, of the Governmenfs decision. It was agreed also that thescope of the activities of the Anglo-Egyptian Resettlement board should be extended as the Chancellor of the Exchequer had proposed.As regards securities held by banks in this country to the order ofbanks in Egypt on account of the refugees, it was suggested that thegeneral public would find it difficult to understand why these assetscould not be put at the disposal of their owners and why theGovernment appeared to contemplate no action in this respect.It would be desirable to ascertain with greater certainty whether these assets could not be released, at least by those banks whoseheadquarters were registered in this country or elsewhere in british territory. But if the legal objections to this course proved to be insuperable, it would be necessary to reconsider whether theGovernment should introduce a scheme whereby the banks concerned would make advances against these securities on the basis of a treasury guarantee against loss, notwithstanding the objections tosuch an arrangement and the fact that certain banks had already indicated that they could not take part in a scheme of this kind.It would be desirable to defer at least till after the Whitsun recessany public announcement of the Governmenfs intentions on thewhole issue of compensation for British evacuees from Egypt. Therewas some evidence that the Egyptian Government were being subjected to increasing economic pressure; and, while it was important to convince public opinion in this country that theGovernment intended to deal sympathetically with British evacueesfrom Egypt, it would be to our advantage to present our proposals in such a way as to avoid any implication that we were weakening inour attitude towards the Egyptian Government or were willing to compromise on the issue of obtaining from them the maximum ofcompensation in respect of losses sustained by British subjects.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Secretary of State for War to inform the employees of the Suez Canal Contractors&apos; Companies, in strict confidence, that the Government were prepared tomake advances equal to the full assessed value of theproperty and effects which they had left behind in Egypt,excluding the sums which they had on deposit in Egyptianbanks.(2) Authorised the Home Secretary to inform the Anglo-egyptian resettlement Board that their activities might be extendedon the lines indicated in Appendix I to C. (57) 136, andthat they would be entitled, as soon as an applicant had secured employment and seemed likely to be able tosupport himself, to give him the full scale of resettlementgrant and to inform him that they would no longer accepthim as their liability.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for further examination of the legal obstacles to the release by Britishbanks of securities which they held to the order of banksin Egypt on account of British refugees.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to reconsider, in thelight of the result of the enquiry under Conclusion (3)above, the possibility of introducing a scheme wherebyUnited Kingdom banks would make advances against the securities in question, on the basis of a Treasury guarantee against loss..(5) Agreed that no public announcement of any of the proposalswhich they had discussed should be made until after the whitsun recess.(6) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.
Agriculture.(previous reference:CC. (57) 38thConclusions,Minute 4.)Export of cattle.8. The Minister of Agriculture said that it had now beenestablished, through discussions under the auspices of western european Union (W.E.U.), that satisfactory arrangements could bemade with most of the Continental Governments concerned for livecattle exported from this country to be slaughtered reasonably near the ports of disembarkation. The French authorities, however, were anxious that the trade in cattle to destinations in the south of france should be allowed to continue. The animals would therefore remain subject to a long overland journey under unsatisfactory conditions.This would be contrary to the recommendations of the Committee of roads 7.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisterProgramme.     of Transport (C. (57) 137) about the roads programme.The Minister of Transport said that the Government had hitherto been compelled to approach the problem of road improvement by aseries of relatively small projects, and that, unless he was authorisedto embark on the major schemes which he had already announced asbeing of the highest priority, the Government would be unable to demonstrate, at the end of the present Parliament, that they had made any effective contribution to reducing congestion on the roads. Inview of the considerable time which had to be devoted, to thepreliminary planning and organisation of schemes of this kind, thedecision of principle must be taken forthwith. It would remainimportant, however, that the rate of authorisation of other schemes should not be reduced. For this purpose he urged that the roads programme over the years 1959-63 should be established on the basisof annual expenditure of  60 millions a year. If the annual outlaywas limited, as the Chancellor of the Exchequer had requested, to 50 millions a year, the value of the smaller schemes which could beauthorised would be significantly reduced and, apart from the major projects, the resources devoted to road improvement would be rapidly and progressively reduced at the time when the highway authorities would be organised to make the maximum effort. No financial commitment would be incurred for some time after the programme had been approved; and even if a decision of principle in favour of annual expenditure of  60 millions was taken now, this figure couldbe adjusted, if necessary, in the following year. On the other hand, ifthe initial decision was based upon too small an annual figure, thetime and opportunity lost could never subsequently be made good.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the demands upon the economy as a whole were still too heavy. An annual expenditureof  50 millions, as he had suggested, would represent an increase of nearly 50 per cent, over the present figure of  35 millions a year. Inthe light of present economic circumstances this represented a very substantial increase but the question might be reconsidered in the lightof a further review of the investment programme during the summer.In discussion there was general agreement that the scale of theroads programme needed further examination in relation to the investment programme as a whole. This examination should bedirected, however, not merely to determining a single figure as themeasure of the rate of annual expenditure, but also to ascertainingwhat expenditure would be needed from time to time in respect ofland purchase, extinction of rights, &amp;c. to enable the Government,if they so decided, to proceed subsequently with a programme of a defined size.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Minister of Transport, to reconsider the roads programme in the light of their discussion and in relationto the investment programme as a whole.
9CC. 45 (57)Enquiry into the export of cattle and would be unacceptable to publicopinion. If the trade was not to be completely prohibited, it might become necessary to enforce a requirement that the cattle should beslaughtered within a maximum distance from the ports of arrival. he sought authority, in consultation with the Ministers concerned, to give to our representative at the resumed discussion in W.E.U. instructions which would not preclude this possibility.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Agriculture to settle, inconsultation with the Foreign Secretary, the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, the Secretary of State for Scotland and thePresident of the Board of Trade, the instructions whichshould guide our representative in further discussions withthe authorities of the European countries concerned aboutthe conditions which should be attached to the export tradein live cattle from this country, on the understanding thatany restrictions that might be imposed upon this trade wouldbe non-discriminatory in form.Cabinet Office, SWA,6th June, 1957.
