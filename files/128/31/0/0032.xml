a n 9wwwSuez Canal.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 30thConclusions.)1. The Cabinet had before them telegrams from Washington(Nos. 830, 833, 834 and 838) in which H.M. Ambassador reportedthat the United States Government, while broadly accepting our proposal that the Security Council should be invited to agree thatthey should pursue on behalf of the Council their negotiations withthe Egyptian Government about the future control of the Suez Canal,thought it expedient that they should hold at least one further directdiscussion with the Egyptian Government before the issue wasformally referred to the Security Council.In discussion it was emphasised that it would be difficult toprevent ship-owners from making plans to resume transit of the suez canal for more than a few more days. The Government would find it impossible, however, to justify a position in which British ship-owners were precluded from adopting the more economic route while their competitors were free to use it. It was desirable, therefore,that the issue should have been referred to the Security Council andour own arrangements to pay Canal dues in transferable sterlingshould have been negotiated with Egypt before ships of other nations started to use the Canal again on any appreciable scale.While we could not object to one further conversation between theUnited States Government and the Egyptian Government before thegeneral debate in the Security Council, it should be our objective toarrange this debate at the earliest possible moment and to secure, ifpossible at the outset of the proceedings, the general agreement ofthe Council that, since it would take some time to negotiate a final settlement with the Egyptian Government, it would be in the interestsof world trade that an interim basis should be found for shipping to resume transit of the Canal. As soon as the Security Council had expressed this view a meeting of the Suez Canal Users&apos; Association(S.C.U.A.) might be summoned to endorse the Councils conclusion;and in the light of that endorsement the Bank of England might thenbe authorised to open discussions with the National Bank of Egyptabout the arrangements for the payment of canal dues by british shipping through the proposed No. 3 Account.If the initial stages of the debate in the Security Council werehandled expeditiously, it should be possible for this action to be takenwhile the Council were proceeding to consider the report by theUnited States Government of their discussions with the egyptian government and the proposal that those discussions should becontinued on behalf of the Council. In this way we should have secured the general endorsement both of the Security Council andof S.C.U.A. for a general resumption of use of the Canal while at thesame time safeguarding our right to maintain that United Kingdomshipping would be using the Canal and paying dues to the EgyptianCanal Authority only on an interim basis and without prejudice tothe further discussions which the United States Government wouldconduct, as the agent of the Security Council, with the egyptian government. There would remain the risk that the Egyptian CanalAuthority might refuse to accept payment of Canal dues by UnitedKingdom shipping in transferable sterling. But the egyptian government would find it more difficult to sustain this position if our action in resuming transit of the Canal had the general approvalof the Security Council.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange to obtainthe views of the Foreign Secretary on the course of actionwhich had been suggested in their discussion and on theprobable reactions of the French Government.(2) Agreed that, subject to the Foreign Secretary&apos;s views, H.M.Ambassador in Washington should be instructed to seek the agreement of the United States Government to thecourse of action suggested in the Cabinefs discussion.
NationalService.(previous reference:CC. (57) 21stConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Labour (C. (57) 91) on the future of National Service.The Minister of Labour said that, on present estimates, theServices would need a total of 279,000 National Servicemen up tothe end of December I960. During the same period there were likelyto be some 570,000 fit men within the scope of the National service acts, of whom about 240,000 would be men who had alreadyregistered and were now on deferment, while the remainder would beyoung men who had not yet registered. It would be impracticable to reduce this total to the smaller figure required by the Services by raising the medical standards or by any system of extending defermentto selected industries. On a purely arithmetical basis, the numbersalready registered for National Service, together with the 30,000 youngmen who would become available as a result of the registration inMay this year, would meet the Service requirements up to 1960. Inpractice, however, the margin for contingencies would probably be too small, and in the later years the Services would be suppliedincreasingly with older men, most of whom would be Universitygraduates or men With professional qualifications. The problem,therefore, was to ensure a properly balanced intake into the Services.The choice appeared to lie between a system of selection by ballot,which was politically unacceptable, or an alternative scheme on thelines proposed in his memorandum. Under this scheme the register of men available to be called up would, in effect, be divided into two sections, one for older men becoming available for call-up on completion of their deferment, the other for younger men becoming available after registration in the normal way. Within these two categories the oldest men would continue, as at present, to be called up first. It would be necessary to determine in advance the proportionin which men should be called up from the two sections of theregister. This ratio should initially be two older men to one youngerman, but these proportions could be adjusted subsequently. If,however, more younger men were called up, this would necessitatepostponing the announcement that men born after a certain date would no longer be required for National Service. It was desirablethat the Government should make such an announcement as early as possible, in order to enable the men concerned to plan their careersand the Universities and Technical Colleges to prepare their futureprogrammes. Admittedly, this scheme would have the result that acertain number of older men who had already registered would not becalled up; but this situation would arise equally under any otherarrangement. The scheme was based on the assumption that thenecessary improvement in regular recruitment would be achieved.Otherwise, further legislation for some new form of compulsory national Service would be required.In discussion it was recognised that the main advantages of thescheme were that it would not require legislation and that it wouldenable the Government to announce at the appropriate time that menwithin the scope of the existing National Service Acts who were bornafter a certain date would not be called up. On the other hand, itwould involve calling up a greater proportion of older men who might otherwise be employed in civil life with greater benefit to the national economy; and it might also produce a larger number of technically(3) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Ormsby-Gore) to instruct H.M. Ambassador in Washington that,for the time being, no communication should be made tothe United States State Department about our proposalsfor the payment of Canal dues by British shipping intransferable sterling.
qualified men than the Services could usefully employ. Moreover, itwould imply that the age of call-up of younger men would riseprogressively until it reached 21 by early in 1960. Although thescheme might initially cause less political controversy than a systemof selection by ballot, it would inevitably create individual anomaliesin the later stages.Some of these disadvantages might be mitigated if the number ofmen eligible for call-up was reduced by extending the existing arrangements for indefinite deferment to cover all graduate teachers,agricultural workers and certain selected transport employees. any extension of the principle of deferment on these lines would, however,need to be carefully phased in order to avoid overcrowding at training colleges. The differences between the age of call-up of the older andthe younger men under this proposed scheme might also be reducedby arranging for the call-up of those at present under deferment inthe inverse order of age, i.e., the youngest first. This possibility shouldbe further examined.Improvements in Service conditions would be essential if thenecessary increase in regular recruitment was to be achieved. on present indications the Army would be about 20,000 short of theirrequirement of manpower in 1960. The situation would need to be reviewed in 1959, when it should be possible to assess whether the improved conditions of service were likely to enable the Army toreach their target of 165,000 regulars by 1962.If the total strength of the Royal Navy was to be reduced to80,000 by 1962, some 1,200 to 1,500 volunteers might have to be rejected this year. If, however, voluntary recruitment proceeded atthe present rate, the total strength of the Navy by 1962 would be about90,000. To discourage the traditional flow of volunteers for the navy would be inconsistent with the Governments aim to establishall-regular forces. The Minister of Defence was already examining the possibility that the Navy, including the Royal Marines, mightassume some of the responsibilities at present undertaken by the other services.Summing up, the Prime Minister said that the balance ofadvantage appeared to be in favour of adopting the proposals putforward by the Minister of Labour. It was impossible to forecast atpresent whether the Governments aim of all-regular forces by 1962would be achieved or whether there would remain a gap which would need to be filled by some form of compulsory service. Under theproposed scheme a decision on this question could be deferred untilthe need for some alternative arrangement had been established. the suggestions for extending the scope of indefinite deferment and forinverting the order of call-up of men at present deferred should,however, be further examined.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of Labour to consider the suggestions made in discussion for extending the scope of indefinitedeferment and for inverting the order of call-up of men atpresent deferred under the National Service Acts.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1) above, approved the proposals inC. (57)91.
