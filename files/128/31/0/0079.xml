SubjectEgypt.Financial Negotiations
Egypt.financial negotiations.(previous reference :CC. (57) 78thConclusions,Minute 3.)The Cabinet had before them a note by the Prime Minister(C. (57) 267) on the stage reached in the financial discussions withrepresentatives of the Egyptian Government in Rome. Annexed tothis was a draft of heads of agreement which might provide the basis for further negotiation.The Prime Minister said that it was for consideration whether itwould be to our advantage to break off these negotiations or tocontinue them in the hope of achieving a settlement on the linesdescribed in C. (57) 267 as a prelude to the resumption of more normal relations with Egypt. Under this settlement, which would besubject to subsequent approval by the two Governments, we shouldrelease  18 millions to the Egyptian Government while they would undertake to desequestrate the property which they had seized andto transfer to us an amount not less than  30 millions, to be appliedto meet claims in respect of property which had been sequestrated ornationalised.In discussion it was suggested that a settlement of this kind would be represented by the Egyptian Government as a victory for themselves and might contribute to a further weakening of ourposition in the Middle East at a time when the renewal of Egyptianpressure against Jordan made it desirable that, our Arab friendsshould feel assured that they could rely on our effective support. Onthe other hand, there was little possibility of our being able to over-throw, the present Egyptian Government by economic pressure, andour allies in the Middle East were prepared to agree, in principle, thatwe should resume commercial relations with Egypt provided that theterms of the settlement were more advantageous to ourselves than tothe Egyptians. By excluding from the negotiations the question ofcompensation for the damage to Port Said (together with the questionof compensation for damage to the Suez CanalBase), we had made itimpossible for the Egyptian Government to claim that they hadcompelled us to pay compensation in respect of war damage, whilethe terms of the proposed agreement would provide us with a meansof satisfying, at least in part, the growing public demand that the victims of the Egyptian policies of nationalisation and sequestrationshould receive some redress.Moreover, this agreement could reasonably be represented as more advantageous to us than to the Egyptians. It would admittedlybe possible for us, in the last resort, to apply the whole of theEgyptian assets which we held to satisfy our claimants. But these assets would fall far short of meeting the claims in full; and a unilateral sequestration of the whole of the Egyptian sterling balanceswould represent a repudiation of our liabilities which would undermine international confidence in sterling. Under the proposed agreement, on the other hand, the payment by Egypt would be larger than the corresponding release from the Egyptian sterling balances.Moreover it would be only an advance payment on account, and weshould retain our full rights in respect of the balance of our claims.Finally, the agreement would give us the discretion, which it was important that we should retain, to apply the payment on account tosatisfying claims in respect of the two categories of sequestrated and nationalised properties in such proportions as we saw fit. Providedthat these facts were clearly understood by the Egyptian authorities,that the arbitration provisions in the agreement were as satisfactory as possible and that our representatives endeavoured to secure an advance payment as much as possible in excess of the minimumfigure of  30 millions, it would, on balance, be to our advantage to conclude with the Egyptian Government an agreement which would facilitate the resumption of normal commercial relations between thetwo countries and, by easing the acute economic embarrassment of
the Egyptian Government, serve to reduce rather than to increase their incentive to foment fresh political tension in the Middle East.It would, however, be important to warn the Egyptian representatives in Rome that, before Her Majesty&apos;s Government reached a finaldecision on the terms of the settlement, they would need to take account of certain related political factors at the time, particularly the progress achieved in dealing with the question of compensationfor the Suez Canal Company, the attitude of the United Nationstowards the proposal of the Secretary-General that the cost of clearing the Suez Canal should be recovered by means of a surcharge on Canal dues, and the willingness of the Egyptians to release the two british political prisoners whom they still held.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Foreign Secretary, to submit to the Prime minister the draft of a telegram instructing our representatives inthe financial negotiations with the Egyptians in Rome to seek to secure a settlement on the general basis described in C. (57) 267, subject to clarification with the Egyptianrepresentatives of the various points raised in their discussion.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary and the commonwealth secretary to arrange that the Governments of the UnitedStates, Canada, Australia and New Zealand should bekept informed of the progress of these negotiations andof the settlement which we sought to achieve.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,13th November, 1957.
