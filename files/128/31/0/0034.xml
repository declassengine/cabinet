3CC. 34 (57)Cyprus.(previous reference:CC. (57) 29thConclusions,Minute 5.)i. The Cabinet had before them telegrams Nos. 374 and 375from H.M. Ambassador at Ankara enclosing the text of a draft statement on Cyprus to be made by the Turkish Prime Minister onthe following day.The Foreign Secretary said that the Turkish Government had asked for our comments on this text, and in telegrams Nos. 831 and832 to Ankara he had indicated the amendments which, subject tothe views of the Colonial Secretary, he would propose. It might become necessary to admit that we had been consulted about this statement; but we should maintain that the views which it reflectedwere those of the Turkish Government themselves, and the factthat we had suggested amendments to it must not be held to implyour approval of the wording which it employed or our acceptanceof the position which it defined.The Colonial Secretary said that he concurred in the procedure and the amendments proposed by the Foreign Secretary.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of these statements.Jordan. 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that the situation in Jordan(Previous remained confused, but that King Hussein appeared to be reference: maintaining his position. It would be in our interests to encourageCC (57) 33rd him to look primarily to Saudi Arabia for political support and to conclusions, Iraq for military assistance. The Government of Iraq intended to minute 5.) station troops close to the frontier and would be prepared to advanceinto Jordan in response to a request from the King. If necessary,they would take action against the Syrian forces in Jordan; but ifSyria invaded Jordan in strength, the Iraqi and Jordanian armieswould need to be afforded air support, and it might become necessaryto consider whether we would make aircraft available from Cyprusfor this purpose. The Government of Iraq were also pressingKing Saud to co-operate in supporting King Hussein; and they had suggested that, since adequate financial assistance for Jordan did notappear to be forthcoming from the other Arab Governments,Her Majesty&apos;s Government should respond generously to any request by the Government of Jordan for financial support. In thesecircumstances we must consider what policy we should adopt ifKing Hussein appealed for our help and what obligations, if any,we should acknowledge under the Tripartite Declaration if theGovernment of Israel intervened in Jordan. We must also considerthe position of our own forces in Jordan.In discussion it was agreed that we should continue to urge theGovernment of Iraq to offer assistance to Jordan. Even under theformer Treaty with Jordan we were not bound to provide support for the Government of Jordan in the event of a purely internaldisturbance. If, therefore, King Hussein sought our assistance weshould need to consider our policy carefully. In the meantime theFrench Government should be asked to reinforce the advice whichwe and the United States Government had already given to theGovernment of Israel to refrain from intervention; and we should ascertain whether, in the view of the United States and french governments, the situation which was developing demanded formalconsultation between the three Governments in the light of the tripartite Declaration. At the same time, we should press the UnitedStates Government to give a clear indication of the action which theywould take if the situation deteriorated further. It was disquietingthat they apparently regarded the Eisenhower doctrine as inapplicablein this instance, on the ground that it was valid only in a case of external aggression.
Suez Canal.(previous reference :C.C. (57) 33rdConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Cabinet had before them Washington telegram No. 90Qcontaining the latest Egyptian draft memorandum defining the termson which the Egyptian Government proposed to operate the Canal.The Foreign Secretary said that this memorandum representedan improvement on earlier Egyptian proposals. The egyptian government now suggested that dues should continue to be chargedin accordance with the last agreement between themselves and the suez Canal Company; that any increase should be limited to 1 percent, per annum; and that any greater increase should either be negotiated or be submitted to arbitration. They were also preparedto accept arbitration if any alteration in the code of regulations governing the Canal was challenged, or if the users of the Canal had any grounds for complaining of discrimination; and they were apparently content that the question of compensation in respect of the nationalisation of the Suez Canal Company should, failing agreement,be referred to arbitration. Broadly, therefore, the Egyptian proposalsconformed with five of the six principles adopted by the security council on 13th October, 1956. It was open to question, however,whether they satisfied the principle that the Canal should be effectivelyinsulated from the politics of any one country. Moreover, the status of the memorandum as a whole was doubtful. The egyptian government contemplated registering it with the Secretariat of theUnited Nations in accordance with Article 102 of the Charter, anArticle which applied only to treaties or agreements between nations.It appeared, however, to be a unilateral document, which the egyptian government would be at liberty to withdraw or to modify at will. Itwas presumably for this reason that the United States Governmentwere not satisfied that the memorandum provided adequateassurances for the interests of users of the Canal. They felt that itwould be preferable that it should be referred to the Security council by themselves and the Egyptian Government and that, even if thelatter did not wish to be a party to a joint report, the United Statesaction in submitting the memorandum to the Council should not beheld to imply that the negotiations between themselves and Egyptwere now at an end.In discussion it was suggested that the most serious objection tothe Egyptian memorandum was its lack of any sanction to compel the Egyptian Government either to observe its terms or to acceptthe award of any arbitration proceedings.   On the other hand, aAbout 800 R.A.F. personnel were stationed at Mafraq; but itwould be imprudent for these troops to intervene unless they were assured of rapid reinforcement by Iraqi forces. They could probablydefend themselves against attack; but they were without operational aircraft, and air cover would have to be provided, if necessary, from cyprus. About 100 British civilians might need to be evacuated ifserious hostilites broke out. Aircraft could be made available forthis purpose from Iraq, provided that no obstruction was offeredlocally. It would be advisable that our troops in Jordan should not become involved; but it was for consideration whether a more senior officer should be put in command of the station at Mafraq, and itwould also be relevant to possible future decisions of policy toascertain the value of the military equipment still remaining in Jordan.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to instruct H.M. Ambassadorsat Washington and Paris to take action on the lines agreed in their discussion.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence to consider the possibility of putting a more senior officer in command of the R.A.F.station at Mafraq, and to ascertain the value of the military equipment remaining in Jordan.
unilateral document of this kind might be not without advantage from our point of view. We should therefore refrain from admittingpublicly that it might contain some of the elements of an acceptablesettlement, and should concentrate our immediate efforts on pressing the United States Government to refer the issue to the security council forthwith in order that we might be able thereafter to initiatediscussions with the Egyptians about the means of payment of canal dues by British shipping. Once this step had been taken it would bepossible to consider, at greater leisure, whether we should seek tonegotiate further amendments to the Egyptian proposals.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to instruct H.M. ambassador in Washington to make further representations to theUnited States Government in the sense of their discussion.Nuclear 4.   The Foreign Secretary said that we had now withdrawn ourWeapons Tests, acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court(Previous of Justice, in order that we might substitute a new form of conditionalReference : acceptance. This would preclude the possibility that an injunctionCC. (57) 17th might be obtained from the Court to prevent us from proceeding with conclusions, our forthcoming tests of nuclear weapons.Minute 4.)The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement.Oil Supplies. 5.   The Prime Minister said that, after further reflection, he(Previous        considered that it would be premature to bring petrol rationing to an reference:      end at a moment when we could not be wholly confident about ourCC. (57) 33rd   future  oil supplies.    It was  still  possible  that the  EgyptianConclusions,     Government would seek to impose, as a condition of permittingMinute 6.)       United Kingdom shipping to resume the use of the Suez Canal, termsof payment of Canal dues which we should find unacceptable.Moreover, if the present situation in Jordan resulted in generalhostilities in the Middle East, the flow of oil through the Syrianpipeline might again be interrupted.   In either event it might then become necessary to maintain rationing as a means of reducing thedemands on our reserves of gold and dollars.  It would be prudent,therefore, to defer the derationing of petrol until the prospects of restoring a more stable situation in the Middle East could be moreaccurately assessed.In discussion there was general agreement that, in spite of thedifficulty of maintaining a system which was open to growing abuse,it would be wise to postpone the derationing of petrol for the timebeing.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Power to arrange for anannouncement to be made in the House of Commons that day to the effect that the prospects for supplies of oil fromthe Middle East were not yet sufficiently reliable to justifythe ending of petrol rationing.Wilton Park. 6.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the foreign secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (57) 96 and 97) onthe future of the educational centre which the Foreign Officemaintained at Wilton Park.
The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that thisestablishment, which had originally been created for re-educatingGerman prisoners of war, had in recent years served as a centre atwhich German civilians who occupied leading positions in public life in Germany could be given some understanding of British democraticinstitutions. It had achieved a considerable reputation, and thedecision that it should be wound up, which had been taken in theprevious year, had aroused such disappointment that it seemed probable that contributions to its maintenance could be obtained both from Germany and from other European countries. While it would no longer be appropriate to maintain such a centre for the exclusiveinstruction of Germans, it was for consideration whether it was in our best interests to close an establishment which, at relatively small cost,could contribute to a better understanding of this country on theContinent. The cost in the current financial year could be met bysavings elsewhere on the Foreign Office Votes.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while he did noidispute the arguments for maintaining this establishment, it would beimpossible to bring Government expenditure under effective controlif every decision to effect economies was reopened because a casecould be made out for continuing the service in question.In discussion it was suggested that it might not be to our advantage to sever the link between the United Kingdom and europe which was provided by the establishment at Wilton Park. It was,however, for consideration whether, if it was kept in being, it shouldnot be directed to establishing stronger links between this country and europe generally, in the light of our current policy of workingtowards a closer association with Europe, particularly in economic affairs.The Prime Minister said that he proposed shortly to undertake a review of the methods which we employed to influence foreignopinion and of our expenditure for this purpose. Pending this reviewit would be reasonable to extend the work of the centre at WiltonPark for a further year.The Cabinet-Agreed that the educational centre at Wilton Park shouldcontinue in operation for a further year, pending a review ofour cultural and information services as a whole.7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (57) 93) covering proposed Government amendments tothe Shops Bill in the House of Lords.The Home Secretary said that the purpose of the Bill was toamend and clarify the law which regulated the closing hours of shops,Sunday trading and street trading. Its main provision would reduceby one hour the number of hours which shops were at presentpermitted to remain open, but since few shops availed themselves ofthe latitude at present allowed them, the Bill appeared to be more restrictive in effect than it was. The Bill was not an importantmeasure of social reform; but it appealed to the trade unions, and its introduction had helped to divert pressure for legislation to implement the Report of the Gowers Committee on working hours andconditions in shops and offices, which would impose a heavy burden on commercial interests. The proposed amendments to the Bill, bytransforming it into a somewhat more liberal measure, were designedto make.it more palatable to the Governments supporters withoutarousing the hostility of the Opposition. In order to introduce the amendments at the stage now reached it would be necessary to movefor the Bill to be recommitted in the House of Lords. While it wouldShops Bill.(previous reference :C.C. (57) 24thConclusions,Minute 4.)
7CC. 34 (57)be premature to reach a decision on the ultimate fate of the Bill, itmight prove difficult to find time for it in the House of Commons at such a late stage in the session.In discussion it was suggested that, if the Government might be obliged to abandon the Bill, there would be little advantage in introducing into it amendments to which the Opposition were boundto object. On the other hand Government spokesmen in the Houseof Lords had already undertaken to table certain of the amendments proposed in C. (57) 93. It might therefore suffice to confine theGovernment amendments to those to which the Government were already committed, and to defer a decision about the further progressof the -Bill until it was possible to estimate more exactly theParliamentary time likely to be available for its subsequent stages.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary to be guided by the views expressed in their discussion.remuneration of doctors and Dentists.(previous reference :CC. (57) 33rdConclusions,Minute 2.)8. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the interim awardto be made to doctors and dentists serving in the National health service.The Prime Minister said that he had come to the conclusion that,in order to avoid stimulating further claims on the part of otherprofessional groups, it would be wise to restrict the interim award todoctors and dentists to 5 per cent. This percentage, combined withthe award of 10 per cent, which had already been made to the juniormedical staff of hospitals, could be reasonably represented as an interim payment in round figures against a claim which was underconsideration by a Royal Commission, while an award of 6 per cent,would convey an impression that the interim payment had been more precisely calculated in relation to the immediate merits of the case.He was satisfied that a difference of 1 per cent, in the interim payment would not affect the decision of the doctors whether or not towithdraw from the National Health Service. He also considered,after further discussion with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, thatthere would be no advantage in combining the announcement of an interim award to the doctors with a statement of the governments intentions in regard to the salaries of the lower judiciary.The Minister of Health said that, while he accepted the case for restricting the interim award to 5 per cent., it would be helpful if thisaward were brought into effect on 1st May instead of 1st July. TheChairman of the Royal Commission would be content that theGovernment should express their willingness to consult with the doctors&apos; representatives over the actual distribution of the proposedaward. It would be made clear, however, that the Government werenot prepared to enter into negotiations on this question.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would announce inParliament on the following day an interim increase of5 per cent, in the remuneration of doctors and dentistsemployed in the National Health Service.(2) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to announce inParliament during the course of that week the government&apos;s intention to introduce legislation to giveeffect to the increases in remuneration which had beenagreed for the lower judiciary.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,15th April, 1957.
