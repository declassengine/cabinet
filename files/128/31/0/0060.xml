(57) 52ndConclusions,Minute 2.)GeneralKeightley&apos;despatch.industrial disputes.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 36thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Prime Minister said that General Keightley&apos;s despatchon the Suez operations last autumn was being studied by the ministers immediately concerned. He proposed to examine it personally before it was published and also to show a copy of the final draft toSir Anthony Eden. It was customary to publish the despatcheswritten by operational commanders and any departure from this practice on this occasion would be likely to create the impression that publication had been deliberately suppressed by the Government.It would, however, be desirable that the despatch should be published as early as possible during the Parliamentary recess.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of this statement.Cyprus.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 59thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Foreign Secretary said he had discussed informally withthe United States Secretary of State our proposal to arrange a furthertripartite conference on Cyprus. On the strength of an assurance thatthe United Kingdom had not entered into any prior agreements withthe Turkish Government, Mr. Dulles had agreed that the UnitedStates Government would indicate their support for this proposal to both the Turkish and Greek Governments. The United States wouldnot wish to send observers to the conference, but a United Statesexpert on Cyprus would be stationed in London during thediscussions. The Secretary-General of the North Atlantic treaty organisation had already indicated his support for the conference.The proposal , should now be put to the Greek and TurkishAmbassadors in London.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.*4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (C. (57) 182) covering a report by officials on the economiccost of industrial disputes.Discussion turned first on the action which the Governmentcould take in preparation for the possibility of a major strike later in the year. -The Emergencies Organisation was in a state of readiness. But further consideration should be given to the questionwhether, if existing emergency powers lapsed, troops could legallybe required to assist in the maintenance of essential supplies and services.. In addition, arrangements should be made to safeguard,as far as possible, certain key sectors of the economy where strike action would be particularly damaging, such as the ;eleetric power stations and the oil tanker transport system. Further consideration should also be given to the means of securing a wider distribution ofcoal stocks and the maintenance.of a certain minimum of rail transport for such essential commodities as milk. Officials should consider in greater detail the action which might need to be taken to ensure thatthe life of the community could be carried on if any of these basicsupplies and services were affected by a strike.In further discussion, it was recognised that opinion among acertain section &apos; of the Governmenfs supporters was increasinglytending to the view that, if the Government could succeed in breakinga major strike, the&apos;tirade unions would be obliged to adopt a more moderate attitude and the authority of the Government in industrial relations would be more securely established.   It would be unwise* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
to encourage this approach to the problem. It was unrealistic to suppose that, in modern conditions, a Government could hope todeal with widespread industrial unrest by such methods or that suchsuccess as they might achieve in repressing a major strike would notbe more than offset by the bitterness and ill-feeling which would result.The Governmenfs objective should be to unite public opinion inrecognising the folly of any serious interruption of production. Theunions should be encouraged to realise that their members, no lessthan other sections of the public, were consumers and that anydislocation of the economic life of the community was to theirdisadvantage. This argument was likely to appeal with particularforce to the women; and it was for consideration whether theGovernmehfs publicity should seek occasion, from time to time, toemphasise this aspect of industrial disputes.But, although the Government should discourage any expectation that they would welcome, and could defeat, a direct challenge fromthe unions, they must also be able to demonstrate that they had adefinite policy for dealing with industrial disputes. For this purpose they should be resolute in condemning the type of intimidation whichhad been so disturbing a feature of the recent bus strike and had beenrepugnant to a large section of public opinion. They should alsoensure that their views on the correct relation between wages and output were clearly and forcibly presented to the general public. Asystem by which the Government assumed responsibility for determing wage levels would be impracticable. Nor would it be economically sound that the Government should seek to establishwage stability by conceding, for example, a compulsory limitation of dividends or a tax on capital gains. The extent to which theGovernment could resist pressure from the trade unions would restrather on their ability to rally public opinion in support of an arbitration award which was demonstrably reasonable and just and,in particular, to satisfy the Chairmen of the Boards of nationalised industries that they would have the Governmenfs support in adhering to such an award.Arbitration procedures, however, were unlikely to commandwidespread confidence unless the public were more accuratelyinformed of the full implications of unjustified wage claims. It was doubtful whether it would be practicable to arrange for the publicinterest, as distinct from the conflicting interests of employers and employees, to be represented by counsel at arbitration tribunals. Butthe new Council on Productivity, Prices and Incomes should do muchto foster an increased awareness of the inter-relation between wagesand prices and of the dangers of increases in remuneration whichcould not be justified by commensurate increases in productivity.There were signs that, as a result of the recent Parliamentary debate on the economic situation, there was now a clearer appreciationamong the general public of the fact that the economy could notabsorb, without damage, injections of purchasing power on the scaleimplied by the wage increases of the last eighteen months; and the government&apos;s objective should be to extend this gradual education of public opinion as rapidly and widely as possible, in order that aclimate of opinion might be established in which arbitration awardswould command greater and more informed attention.It could be argued, however, that the more successful the newadvisory Council proved to be in demonstrating the inflationarydangers of unjustified wage increases, the more reluctant the tradeunions would be to allow wage claims to go to arbitration and toaccept the awards of arbitrators. It was for consideration, therefore,whether the Government should adopt a more radical approach tothe problem by introducing fresh legislation on industrial relations,designed to modify the statutory rights and safeguards which had beenconceded to the unions in earlier years under the pressure of economic circumstances very different from the conditions of full employmentprevailing to-day.   Gn the other hand, the political objective of the
^1 &apos;ii 0Aircraft 5.   jne Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the EconomicIndustry. Policy Committee, after examining the methods by which the proposed(Previous examination of the future organisation of the aircraft industry mightReference: be carried out, had concluded that, in view of the fact that many ofC.C. (57) 50th the factors involved were matters of Government policy, an informalConclusions, body, consisting partly of industrialists and partly of senior officialsMinute 5.) qf the Departments concerned, would be preferable to a formalindependent Committee.The Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for an informal enquiry into the future of the aircraft industry toGovernment was, and must remain, the establishment of theConservative Party, in the eyes of public opinion, as a national party which was concerned to represent the interests of all sections of thecommunity. A large section of the electorate now consisted of individuals who were members of trade unions; and the Governmenfsvictories in the elections of 1951 and 1955 undoubtedly derived inpart from the degree of support which they had obtained from thissection of the electorate. It would be inexpedient to adopt any policyinvolving legislation which would alienate this support and divide,rather than consolidate, public opinion.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that officials should be instructed to give further consideration to the action whichmight need to be taken, possibly at short notice, to safeguard thecommunity against any critical interruption of the supplies and services essential to the life of the community. On the broader issues,there was no clear or simple solution to the problem of reconcilingfull employment and price stability with free collective bargainingand a fixed exchange rate. In these circumstances the Governmenfschief responsibility was to secure that the general public were fullyalive to the dangers of a continuous inflation of wages and prices and to take, without hesitation, such action as lay in their power toreduce those dangers. Government expenditure itself contributed tothe maintenance of that excess of demand in the economy which made inflated wage claims possible. Resolute action to hold in checkGovernment expenditure, both civil and defence, would therefore be needed; and the Cabinet must be prepared to endorse such action,however unpalatable it might be. The various suggestions whichwere being canvassed in financial circles for the establishment of direct control by the Government over the supply of money at the source should also be examined. Arbitration procedures should be reviewed; and the Government must be ready to exert their fullinfluence in support of arbitration awards which were clearly fair and reasonable. By so doing they would be most likely to command the support of public opinion in resisting pressure and intimidationfrom organised labour.The Cabinet (1) Took note of C. (57) 182.(2) Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to arrange for officials to carry out a more detailed examination of the means whereby essential supplies and services could be safeguarded against critical interruption in the event of major industrial unrest.(3) Invited the Minister of Labour to circulate a memorandumon arbitration procedures.(4) Took note that the Prime Minister would consider howfurther study could best be made of the various suggestions made in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion for further action to arrest the process of cost-inflation.
il 91be carried out by an informal body, comprising senior officials of the Treasury, the Ministry of Transport and theMinistry of Supply, together with two or three independentexperts with suitable commercial and financial experience.nuclear power.(previous reference:C.Q (57) 14thConclusions,Minute 5.)I.B.R.D.Loan.   - - -. . -6. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Economic-Policy&apos; Committee had agreed that, on balance, it would be to our advantage to seek to secure a loan from the International Bank for reconstruction and Development (I.B.R.D.) to assist in financing ournuclear power programme. It was essential that we should takemore active steps to attract foreign investment in this country if wewere to maintain our own investment both at home and in commonwealth territories. He therefore sought authority to open discussions with the Chairman of the International Bank, in the lightof which he would subsequently submit more definite proposals tothe Cabinet.The Minister of Power said that a decision to borrow fromabroad on behalf of our nuclear power programme, which had become a symbol of our industrial leadership in the post-war period,would be a considerable shock to public opinion. Moreover, a loan of this kind might well be exploited by competitive United Statesinterests to our disadvantage, and if it involved an issue on theNew York market, it might impair international confidence in sterling.In discussion it was urged that public opinion would resent anyimplication that we were unable to finance our nuclear&apos; power programme from our own resources. Nor should we overlook therisk that a loan for this purpose might damage our general prestigeabroad and jeopardise our unfettered control over the futured development of our own nuclear development programme.:.:.;. Against this, however, it was pointed out that the proposed loanwould incorporate no element of equity interest, while the fact thatthe International Bank might be sufficiently confident of the soundnessof our nuclear power programme to assist in its financing should beto the advantage, rather than the detriment, of our internationalreputation as pioneers in nuclear technology.The Cabinet  ,.(1) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to explore,without commitment, the possibility of obtaining a loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction andDevelopment for the financing of our nuclear power programme.   .(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting,in the light of the result of the enquiry to be made under conclusion (1) above.cotton imports.(previous reference:CC. (57) 57thConclusions,.Minute 9.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (C. (57) 185) covering a report by officials on revised proposals for securing a limitation on the importsof cotton textiles from Asiatic Commonwealth countries.: The President of the Board of Trade said that further examinationhad shown that the establishment of a &quot;peril point &quot;for imports ofcotton textiles from India, Pakistan and Hong Kong would exposeour commercial interests to serious risks. . Nevertheless, if no satisfactory solution of this problem could be found, a grave situation would develop in Lancashire in&apos; the near future. It was nowproposed, therefore, that the Lancashire industry should continue to
seek voluntary agreements with the industries of India, Pakistan and hong Kong, but that any agreement made with the Hong Kongindustry should be controlled by that industry and not by means of import licensing in this country. Should the Hong Kong industryfail to carry out their undertakings, the industries of India and pakistan would be released from their obligations and it would benecessary to consider, at that time, what further action might betaken. In contrast to imports from India and Pakistan, imports ofcotton textiles from Hong Kong had remained relatively stationaryin recent years, and the Hong Kong industry might therefore be willing to enter into a voluntary agreement of this kind.The Colonial Secretary said that a voluntary agreement,controlled in the manner proposed, would almost certainly collapse.Meanwhile, the Lancashire industry would have been given theimplicit assurance of continuing protection and, when the voluntaryagreements broke down, the Government would have no alternative but to impose quota restrictions, with all the consequences for our commercial interests which that course would entail. The present proposal would therefore merely postpone the essential decision,which the Government would later find themselves obliged to take in even more unfavourable circumstances. If the Cabinet adoptedthis proposal, he would feel obliged, in informing the Governor of hong Kong, to warn him that other Hong Kong industries might beexpected to accept similar arrangements in due course and that weshould henceforward be unable to come to the defence of HongKong against corresponding action by other countries against exports from the Colony. He would also wish to inform the Governor ofthe Cabinefs decision in advance of any announcement on thesubject, in case he could suggest some adjustment of the arrangements which would mitigate their consequences.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in favour of proceeding with the proposals in C. (57) 185. It was desirable to avoid anycourse of action which might prematurely precipitate the general issueof the free entry of Commonwealth goods, and the problem ofimports of cotton goods should, if possible, be solved on a pragmaticbasis. If the quota of permitted imports from Hong Kong was setat a figure which exceeded the present level of such imports by areasonable margin, it should be possible to present the proposals tothe Hong Kong industry in a manner which would ensure their acceptance.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in C. (57) 185.(2) Authorised the Colonial Secretary to inform the governor of Hong Kong of these proposals before any public announcement was made.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,1st August, 1957.
