The Cabinet had before them a note by the Prime MinisterSituation.        (c (57) 225) on the public presentation of the Governmenfs(Previous        disinflationary measures.Reference:CC. (57) 69th        The Prime Minister said that it was important that these conclusions,    measures should be presented forcefully and consistently.   the minute l.)      Governmenfs decision to restrict the supply of money should not,Presentation of however, be represented as a challenge to organised labour.   OnPolicynmen     tne contrary, the Government should emphasise that the strengthand stability of sterling were a pre-condition of the maintenance ofa high level of employment.   Moreover, the measures taken inrelation to public investment were designed merely to stabilise therate of expenditure at a level which was already very high.In discussion there was general agreement with this view. Theextent of the Governmenfs power to influence developments shouldnot, however, be exaggerated. The measures recently announcedwere bound to take time to achieve their full effect, and meanwhilesome further price increases were.inevitable. Moreover, the majorityof wage settlements were the result of agreement reached after directbargaining between employers and workpeople. The influence whichthe Government could exert on them was relatively slight; and arbitration awards tended to follow, rather than to dictate, the pattern of wage increases determined by free collective bargaining.Nevertheless, acceptance of an arbitration award, for example in a nationalised industry, should not be interpreted as implying thatthe Government would necessarily consent to the creation ofadditional money to finance that award. It was for consideration whether it should be made clear, at any major arbitration in future,that the award would have to be implemented by means of economies in the scale of the services concerned. It would also be convenient if the recently appointed Council on profits, prices and incomescould issue its first report as rapidly as possible, in preparation forthe forthcoming round of wage negotiations.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Lord President and the Minister of Labour, toprepare in the light of their discussion a note on the government&apos;s economic policy for the guidance ofGovernment speakers.
Redistribution ot 3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSeats-. Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland (C. (57) 208)(Previous        reporting the result of further discussion with the Leaders of theC Mtfo) TOth Opposition Parties on the Governmenfs proposals for amendmentsConclusions,     01 the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1949.Minute 5.) j.^e chief Whip said that, as a result of this discussion, it was recommended that the Opposition Leaders should be informedthat:  (a) In the Governmenfs view, no clarification of existing legislation was needed in order to enable a Boundary Commissionto recommend major alterations of individual constituencies in exceptional cases between general reviews.(b) The question of weighting in the case of county and boroughconstituencies must be left to the good sense of the Commissions.(c) The Government were prepared to accept the proposal thatappointments to the Commissions should be made in agreementbetween the Parties, subject to the proviso that the Minister of LocalGovernment, who appointed one member each to the English and welsh Commissions, would continue to appoint individuals with aknowledge of local government.(d) The Government agreed that, subject to the concurrence ofMr. Speaker, all Deputy Chairmen of the Commissions should beJudges.(e) The Government agreed that the Registrars-General and theDirector-General of Ordnance Survey should serve as assessors tothe Commissions and not, as at present, as members.(/) The Government were prepared to implement the suggestion in the Report of the Vivian Committee on Electoral Machinery that,in addition to local hearings, each separate Commission should situnder its Deputy Chairman &quot; to hear any representations from theChief or National officers of the principal Party organisations withrespect to the provisional proposals.&quot;The Opposition Leaders were likely to accept the majority ofthese proposals.The Cabinet Authorised the Home Secretary and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland, after further consultation with Mr. Speakeron the status of the Deputy Chairmen of the boundary commissions, to inform the Leaders of the opposition parties that, subject to any further comments which theymight wish to make, the Government proposed to introduce,as soon as Parliamentary time permitted, legislation on thelines indicated in C. (57) 208.Elections. 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeUse of Cars to Secretary (C. (57) 207) proposing the repeal of Section 88 of thetake Voters to Representation of the People Act, 1949, which restricted the numberthe Poll.        D  carg y^hjch might be used on behalf of a candidate to take votersto the poll at a Parliamentary election.Various other textual amendments were discussed and approved.It was also noted that the exact wording of certain passages in the speech would need to be re-examined nearer the time of its delivery.The Cabinet -Invited the Lord Chancellor to circulate in due course a revised draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation ofParliament.
CC. 71 (57)The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the home department said that the repeal of this provision was bound to be resisted by the Opposition. There was, however, strong feelingamongst the Governmenfs supporters in favour of the abolition ofthis restriction, which had been rejected by the 1944 Speaker&apos;conference on Electoral Reform and had been enacted in the face of vigorous objection by the then Conservative Opposition.The Secretary of State for Scotland and The Attorney-Generalsupported this proposal. Widespread evasion of section 88 wasbringing the law into contempt and prosecutions were difficult to institute through lack of adequate evidence.In discussion there was general agreement with this view. Itwas however suggested that, if the repeal of this section was includedin the proposed legislation on the redistribution of Parliamentaryseats, the non-controversial character of the latter measure wouldbe impaired. Moreover, the scope of the Bill might be enlargedto an extent which would permit amendments relating to othercontroversial electoral questions. On the other hand a separate Billon this subject would increase the demands on an already crowdedlegislative programme. Further consideration should therefore begiven to the possibility of drafting a Bill confined in scope to the redistribution of Parliamentary seats and the use of cars to takevoters to the poll. The Opposition should not be informed of the government&apos;s intentions until a final decision had been reached onthe form of the necessary legislation.The Cabinet-(1) Approved in principle the proposal that section 88 of the representation of the People Act, 1949, should be repealed.(2) Invited the Legislation Committee to consider, in the lightof their discussion, the form of the legislation necessaryfor this purpose.Betting and gaming.(previous reference:CC. (57) 59thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (57) 206) covering draft heads of clauses for a betting and Gaming Bill.The Prime Minister said that, despite the Governmenfsundertaking to introduce legislation on this subject and the generaldesirability of reforming a branch of the law which at presentencouraged corruption of the police, the balance of advantageappeared to lie in not promoting a measure on so contentious a subject in the forthcoming session.In discussion there was general agreement with this view.The Cabinet Agreed that a Betting and Gaming Bill should not beintroduced in the 1957-58 session.LocalGovernmentReform.(previous reference :CC (57) 49thConclusions,Minute 9.)6. The Lord Chancellor said that the draft of The Queen&apos;sSpeech on the Opening of Parliament contained a reference to the government&apos;s intention to introduce legislation for the reorganisation of local government. The Bills in question had held a place in thelegislative programme for the forthcoming session for some considerable time; but it might be convenient that the Cabinet shouldtake this opportunity to reaffirm their decision to proceed with this legislation.
The Queen&apos;speeches.Opening ofParliament.1. In the light of the discussions recorded in Minutes 3-above, the Cabinet considered the draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech onthe Opening of the new session of Parliament (C. (57) 217). they also had before them a memorandum by the Minister of Defence(C. (57) 226) proposing a revised draft paragraph relating to there organisation of the Armed Services.In discussion various textual amendments were suggested and approved. The following points, bearing on the content of the speech, were also considered :  (a) Paragraphs 2-4. The wording of these paragraphs would need further consideration nearer the time of delivery of the Speech.(b) Paragraph 8. The Speech should contain reference, interms consistent with current economic policy, to the government&apos;s intention that the Colonial Development Corporation should been abled to continue its work. The necessary legislation for thispurpose should be drafted without delay.In discussion some doubt was expressed about the expediency of introducing these measures. The proposals for the review of thestatus of local authorities and the redistribution of their functions would be liable to offend local sentiment in some areas, while theintroduction of the general grant would be strongly opposed byeducational interests. It might be wiser to substitute for the general grant a revision of the present education grant designed to distributethe financial burden more equally between the Exchequer and thelocal authorities.On the other hand, the Governmenfs intention to introduce legislation for a comprehensive reorganisation of local governmenthad been declared in a series of White Papers, to which theGovernment were now firmly committed. A retreat from this policy would be interpreted as a sign of vacillation and surrender tosectional pressures. It was widely realised that the present structure of local government was inefficient and there was general agreement that some reform was overdue. The Commissions which would be created under the forthcoming legislation to review the status oflocal authorities would take a considerable time to complete theirsurvey; and their recommendations would, in any case, be subjectto the ultimate approval of Parliament. The proposal to substitute a general grant for the present system of specific grants had been welcomed by a considerable body of opinion among local authorities;and it was an essential element in the Governments financial policy.The introduction of industrial re-rating, coupled with the transitional provisions which the legislation would incorporate, would ensurethat for the first few years no local authorities would suffer, whilemany would benefit, from the new arrangements.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theGovernment were committed to a major reorganisation of localgovernment and it would be impossible to abandon the main elements of the scheme which the Cabinet had already approved.Nevertheless, it would be important, in presenting the legislative proposals to the general public, to emphasise that they representedonly a preliminary step towards a comprehensive scheme of reorganisation which would extend over a lengthy period and would,in particular, provide that no change could be made in the status of individual local authorities without the specific approval ofParliament.The Cabinet-Agreed that the legislative programme for the forthcoming session   should   include  legislation  providing   for   there organisation of local government.
CC. 71 (57)(c) Paragraph 9.-It would be inexpedient, in present economic circumstances, to promise improvement in the conditions of service in the Armed Forces before decisions on this matter had been taken.(d) Paragraph 11. This paragraph gave disproportionateemphasis to the external economic problem: it should be balancedby an expression of the Governmenfs confidence that measures necessary to maintain the economic basis of full employment and to restrain inflationary pressures would have the full support of all sections of the community.(e) Paragraph 12. The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to furnish, in consultation with the Commonwealth Secretary, adraft paragraph on the forthcoming Commonwealth EconomicConference.(/) Paragraph 13. Further consideration should be given to theneed for this specific reference to the financing of the nationalised industries.(g) Paragraph 16. The proposed reconstruction of roads atHyde Park Corner did not, on balance, merit special mention inthe Speech.(h) Paragraph 18. The expediency of embarking, in theforthcoming session, on legislation to amend the existing statutory provisions governing security of tenure and discipline in the farming industry and agricultural rents would need very careful consideration.It was agreed that the Sub-Committee of the Home AffairsCommittee, which was at present considering this matter, should report direct to the Cabinet as soon as possible.(i) Paragraphs 19 and 20. Further thought would need to begiven to the desirability, in current economic circumstances, of undertaking in the Speech to introduce legislation which would inevitably involve increased expenditure on the part of the localauthorities and others.(/) Paragraph 21. This paragraph should be replaced by a more general paragraph, earlier in the Speech, to the effect that theGovernment would continue to pay particular attention to ares which experienced special employment problems.(k) Paragraph 24. Two separate Bills conferring powers overland for open-cast mining and for essential defence purposes wouldbe necessary to enable the emergency regulations relating to land to be revoked. While Government supporters would not welcome the new powers which this legislation would confer, the Governmentwere pledged to revoke the remaining emergency powers during the lifetime of the present Parliament and Government supporters inthe House of Commons had shown a consistent anxiety that this undertaking should be carried out. The Open-Cast Mining bill would be limited to a term of ten years. It was reasonable to assume that it would also be practicable to introduce legislation in theforthcoming session to give effect to at least a proportion of therecommendations of the Committee on Administrative Tribunals and enquiries, and The Lord Chancellor undertook to give urgent consideration to the possibility of including an appropriate referenceto this subject in the draft Speech.(/) Paragraph 26. The proposed legislation relating to theadoption of children or their care by foster parents was a desirablesocial measure which would be welcomed in particular by theWomen&apos;s Organisations and would carry into effect therecommendations of a Committee of Enquiry.(m) Paragraph 27. This paragraph was intended to cover ingeneral terms various minor measures which were underconsideration and to provide for any action which the government might find it practicable to take on the recommendations of theWolfenden Committee.
(n) Paragraph 29. Ministers approved an alternativedescription of the proposed adjustment of the existing scheme of retirement pensions, and agreed that any reference to the introductionof a more comprehensive scheme must await a decision of policy.The Cabinet were informed that the total number of Bills whichhad provisionally been mentioned in the draft Speech, together withother essential Bills, would occupy considerably more time than would be available for legislation. Therefore, before the content ofThe Queen&apos;s Speech could be finally settled, further consideration would need to be given, at a later meeting, to the legislative programme for the session. The desirability of proceeding with anumber of Bills which were included in the provisional legislative programme would now need, in any event, to be re-examined in thelight of current economic difficulties.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Chancellor to circulate a revised draft ofThe Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament taking into account the points made and the amendmentsapproved in their discussion.(2) Agreed to resume at a later meeting their discussion of the content of the legislative programme for the forthcoming session.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,7th October, 1957.
