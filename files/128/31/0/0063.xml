WelfareOrangeJuice.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the recommendation of the Home AffairsCommittee that the scope of the welfare orange juicescheme should be modified as proposed, with effect from 1st November.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Minister of Health, to give further consideration at alater date to the possibility of reducing the subsidyprovision for this scheme in the following financial year.Sale of Arms.Cruiser for turkey.(previous reference:CM. (56) 83rdConclusions,Minute 6.)2. The Prime Minister said that the Turkish Government were continuing to press the request, which they had made earlier in theyear, that we should sell them a refitted cruiser on favourable creditterms. We had already provided them with credits to a total of nearly  5 millions for the purchase of destroyers and Viscountaircraft and, in view of the mounting arrears of commercial payments,there could be no justification for giving them further credit forthe purchase of a cruiser. On the other hand, the Turkish Govern-ment were clearly anxious to obtain a more up-to-date vessel in placeof the single obsolete cruiser they at present possessed and it wasspecially important at the present time that this request should be handled in such a way as to avoid alienating Turkish feeling. he therefore proposed that the Turkish Government should be informed,in a more amplified version of the reply which had been given themearlier, that we would be prepared to supply a cruiser on favourable terms if they could cover the greater part of the cost of it by disposing of their existing vessel as scrap and raising from other sources the credit needed to meet the cost of refit and stores.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in agreement with theproposed reply. It would be made clear to the Turkish Governmentthat we could not contemplate extending further credit for thistransaction and it was, in any event, important that we should not seem willing to supply arms to Turkey on more favourable terms than to Commonwealth countries. The refitted cruiser, which would costsome  700,000 exclusive of stores, would be of little strategic value to Turkey and was desired primarily for reasons of prestige.1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theParliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Health (C. (57) 189) reporting the conclusions reached by the Home Affairs Committee on the futurescope of the welfare orange juice scheme and on the continuingsubsidy provision to be made for this scheme.The Cabinet were informed that the proposed modifications inthe scope of the scheme were based on the findings of a Committee of medical advisers under the Chairmanship of Lord Cohen ofBirkenhead, which had recommended that special arrangements should no longer be made for ensuring that children between the ages of two and five were supplied with orange juice. No difficulties were now foreseen in putting this recommendation into effect from 1st November. The report of the Cohen Committee would not,however, provide support for a decision to withdraw or reduce thesubsidy for the provision of welfare orange juice for other classes, andit was arguable that such a step would jeopardise the prospect ofsecuring public acceptance of the reduction in the scope of thescheme. There was also a risk of a serious fall in the consumption oforange juice if the subsidy were totally withdrawn, with possibleadverse effects on Jamaica and British Honduras which would giverise to pressure for further Exchequer assistance to price supportschemes.
Cyprus. 3.   jhe Prime Minister said that no reply had yet been received(Previous from the Greek Government to our invitation to them to participateReference: in a tripartite conference on the future of Cyprus. The GreekCC. (57) 60th Foreign Minister, M. Averoff, had however informed the united conclusions, States Ambassador that, while the Greek Government intended to minute 3.) reject our proposal for a conference, their reply would be couched interms which would not preclude further possible advance. In any event it would not now be practicable to convene a conference untilthe elections had taken place in Turkey in mid-October. In thesecircumstances it would appear to be to our advantage to refuse toaccept an entirely negative reply from the Greek Government, but tomaintain our pressure on them in the hope that it would prove possible eventually to secure their agreement to a conference at someconvenient date after the Turkish elections. It was also for considera-tion whether, as no conference could now take place in the immediatefuture, it would not be expedient to take the United StatesGovernment into our confidence over the proposals we now had inmind for the future of Cyprus. This would involve a risk ofpremature disclosure, but there was reason to believe that our intentions were already becoming known in general terms and therewas a danger of losing the goodwill and support of the United StatesGovernment if they became aware through other sources that we had prepared new proposals which we had not disclosed to them. this aspect of the problem would require further consideration by theCabinet.The Cabinet Took noteMinister.with approval, of this statement by the PrimeExport of aircraft.Sale ofViscountAircraft to egypt.(previous reference :CC. (57) 61stConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Prime Minister said that, since the Cabinefs discussion on 2nd August, he had received a detailed report on the proposal thatVickers Limited should sell two Viscount aircraft to Egypt and securepayment through the Egyptian No. 1 (Special) Account. these aircraft, having no military value, could be sold without an export licence, but the transaction might attract unfavourable politicalcomment and ought therefore to be considered by the Cabinet.In discussion it was argued, against this transaction, that it wouldbe a mistake to allow the Egyptians to have these aircraft if we stillwished to apply economic pressure to induce the Egyptian Govern-ment to adopt a more reasonable attitude towards the claims ofBritish subjects whose property had been expropriated by them.These claimants, and those who supported them, would find itdifficult to understand why the Egyptians should be free to buy these aircraft while their claims remained unsatisfied. It was also suggestedthat some Commonwealth countries were still anxious to buyViscount aircraft and that, if this were so, it would be unreasonablethat Viscounts should be supplied to Egypt before all the Common-wealth demands had been met.On the other hand it was argued that we were not in a positionto enforce a trade embargo against Egypt and that unsystematicinterference with particular trading transactions would not be an effective means of bringing pressure to bear on the egyptian government.    Moreover, a refusal to allow payment for this the Cabinet Authorised the Prime Minister to arrange for a reply to besent to the Turkish Government on the lines which he had proposed in discussion.
Jordan.(previous reference:CC. (57) 43rdConclusions,Minute 5.)United states military Aid.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of State for Foreign Affairs (C. (57) 190) regarding aproposal that the United States Government should finance, as partof their military aid programme, the supply of fifteen Centurion tanksto Jordan.The Prime Minister said that he had been seriously concerned atthe original proposal that fifty-four Centurions should be supplied toJordan by this means. Jordan&apos;s acquisition of so large a number of modern tanks would have disturbed the balance of military power inthe Middle East and, in particular, would have provoked a strong demand from Israel for compensating supplies. The smaller numbersnow envisaged would give rise to less difficulty. And in any event, ifwe declined to supply Centurions on this basis, the United StatesGovernment might well decide themselves to supply the tanks forwhich the Jordan Government were asking. The Cabinet should,however, recognise that, after this transaction went through, Israelmight well renew her request for a further supply of Centurions; and,in view of the strength of Parliamentary feeling in favour of Israelat the present time, it could not be assumed that the Governmentwould be able to reject such a request.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in general agreementwith the views expressed by the Prime Minister.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs toinform the United States Government that we should be willing to supply fifteen Centurion tanks to Jordan on thebasis that payment would be made in dollars from their programme of military aid to Jordan.(2) Reserved their decision on the question whether this needentail a compensating sale of British tanks to Israel.transaction to be made from the Egyptian No. 1 (Special) account would be inconsistent with the statements about the Account whichhad been made on the Governments behalf in the House ofCommons and with the assurances given to the Egyptian Govern-ment when it was established. Under those assurances Egypt wasfree to use her sterling earnings in that Account for the purchase ofany British goods which were not subject to export licensing. Thesale of these Viscounts would ensure that at least a part of the duespaid for the transit of British ships through the Suez Canal would beused to buy British goods; it would encourage the Egyptians tocontinue to use British civil aircraft; and it would provide continuingemployment at the factories of Vickers Limited, who needed further orders for civil aircraft.The Cabinet (1) Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to ascertain fromVickers Limited, and to report to the Prime Minister,whether they still had any unsatisfied orders for Viscountaircraft from Commonwealth countries.(2) Agreed that, subject to the results of the enquiries to be madeunder Conclusion (1), Vickers Limited should beauthorised to supply two further Viscount aircraft to theEgyptian National Airline on the understanding that payment would be made from the Egyptian No. 1(Special) Account.(3) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs to explain to the United States Government the basis on which thesale of these aircraft to Egypt had been authorised.
6. The President of the Board of Trade said that the AdvisoryCouncil of the Export Credits Guarantee Department (E.C.G.D.) had reported that some limitation must now be imposed on the amount of medium-term commercial credit to be granted to India underSection 1 of the Export Guarantees Act. It was evident that India,having failed to obtain a Government loan, was relying on thefacilities of E.C.G.D. as an alternative means of securing extendedcredit. The volume of medium-term commercial credit which hadbeen granted to India, or applied for, amounted to some  34 millions and it was proposed to impose as soon as practicable a limitation of 25 millions for this form of credit. It was customary to accept theadvice tendered by the Advisory Council on the commercialoperations of E.C.G.D.; and officials of the Treasury, Board of Tradeand Commonwealth Relations Office, who had considered the matter,could see no valid grounds for rejecting the advice given on this occasion. Refusal of further commercial credit to India, would,however, arouse comment and the decision would need carefulpresentation to the Indian Government.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it would be difficult toover-ride the advice of the Advisory Council of the E.C.G.D. in sucha matter. Although it would be possible to grant India extendedadditional credit on political grounds under Section 2 of the export guarantees Act, it would probably be preferable that she should beleft to accelerate her drawings on her sterling balances. He would,however, like time to examine the matter further.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith representatives of the Ministry of Power, the Board ofTrade and the Commonwealth Relations Office, to give further consideration to the case for restricting the amountof medium-term commercial credit extended to India underthe Export Guarantees Act, and to the best means of presenting such a decision to the Indian Government.7. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of the exchanges of view which he had held with the United States Government on the significance of the recent political developments in Syria. There was little doubt that the Soviet Government had substantially increased their hold over Syria, and &quot;there was a serious risk that the country would soon fall wholly within the influence of the Soviet Union. TheUnited States Government had been considering what action couldbe taken to counter, or at least to contain, this Soviet move and theyhad sent a special emissary to the Middle East for discussionspresumably designed to strengthen the will of neighbouring States to resist further Soviet encroachment. There were, however, no indica-tions that the United States Government had formulated any definite policy or plan of action for dealing with the situation. Oil pipelinespassing through Syria could handle 25 million tons of oil a year from iraq and a further 12 million tons from Saudi Arabia. Interferencewith these supplies would involve serious inconvenience for europe and would cripple the economy of Iraq. It was therefore important that no action should be taken which might provoke Syria to cut thesepipelines unless it formed part of a considered plan, which the UnitedStates Government were prepared to carry through, for restoring thewhole position in the Middle East in favour of the Western Powers.It should not be overlooked that action which led the Syrians tointerfere with these pipelines might also cause the Egyptian Govern-ment to restrict the passage of oil through the Suez Canal; and in that event the damage to the economy of European countries would bevery severe.
The Prime Minister read to the Cabinet the draft of a messagedesigned to bring these considerations to the attention of the UnitedStates Government.In discussion there was general agreement that further efforts should be made to ascertain the intentions of the United StatesGovernment, and to bring to their notice the considerations whichthe Prime Minister had outlined. This might be done either by a personal message from the Prime Minister to the United states secretary of State or through H.M. Ambassador in Washington.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would consider, in thelight of their discussion, what further representations shouldbe made to the United States Government in this matter.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,28th August, 1957.
