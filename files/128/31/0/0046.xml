ContentsDisarmament
The Cabinet had before them Disarmament. (i) a note by the Foreign Secretary (C. (57) 143) containing the(Previous        texts of an informal United States memorandum of proposals for reference:      a partial disarmament agreement and of the Soviet reply;CC. (57) 37th        (ii) a memorandum by the Foreign Secretary (C. (57) 146)Conclusions.     outlining the main issues involved in the disarmament discussionsMinute 1.)       and containing the text of a draft statement on nuclear tests whichhad been prepared for submission by the four Western delegations to the Disarmament Sub-Committee;(iii) a note by the Minister of Defence (C. (57) 151) commenting on the defence implications of these recent disarmament proposals.The Foreign Secretary said that the provisions for conventionaldisarmament in the recent United States proposals were broadly acceptable. The problem of nuclear disarmament, however, hadbeen completely altered by the apparent acceptance by the SovietGovernment of the principle of control over cessation of tests, andby the offer by the United States Government of a ten months&apos;moratorium on tests, beginning in July 1958, provided that it wascoupled with a declared willingness to enter into further negotiationsfor the eventual cessation of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons. A cessation of production was unlikely to be acceptable to the Soviet Government. It would also be unwelcome to us, in so far as it would prevent the further development of ourweapons programme. But the United States Government, with thesupport of the French Government, regarded it as essential on theground that a ban on nuclear tests alone would not prevent the emergence of additional nuclear Powers. Since it was important that, in these circumstances, we should not appear to be frustratingprogress towards disarmament, the best course would be to test the sincerity of the latest Soviet offer by putting forward in theDisarmament Sub-Committee proposals on the lines of the draft statement at Annex B of C. (57) 146. Under these proposals, the suspension of nuclear tests would only become operative when thenecessary arrangements for their detection and control had been incorporated in a treaty which had been ratified by all countries.The United States representative estimated that this stage wouldnot be reached, at the earliest, until July 1958. The subsequent ten months&apos; moratorium on tests would provide an opportunity to assess the willingness of the Soviet Government to accept in practice asystem of inspection in connection with tests and to proceed with further negotiations for the control of production of fissile material.The ban on the manufacture of fissile material for weapons wouldnot come into operation until one month after the necessary detailedcontrol system had been established. It was estimated that it wouldtake a further two years, i.e., until 1960, to complete these negotiations. This would provide us with a further period in which our development programme could proceed before we could be compelled to cease production; and we should make it clear that our willingness to accept a cessation of production at that point wouldbe dependent on certain conditions to be agreed.If, as was probable, it became apparent during the negotiationsabout the cessation of production that the Soviet Government would refuse to accept an effective control over the manufacture of fissile material, the United States Government envisaged that nuclear testscould then be resumed. But, even if the Soviet Government rejectedproposals on the lines of the draft statement, they would continueto press for immediate agreement on a simple and unqualifiedsuspension of tests; and if we and the United States were not to be subjected to heavy pressure in the General Assembly of the united nations to accept a resolution to this effect, we must put forward proposals which offered a reasonable alternative approach to theproblem.   On a balance of the considerations involved, therefore,
we should associate ourselves with the proposals in the draft statement, which should suffice to hold the position in the general assembly.The Prime Minister said that the proposals in the draft statement, which we knew to represent the considered views of theUnited States Government, faced us with very difficult decisions. If weabandoned our programme for further nuclear tests, much of the effort which we had so far devoted to the development of nuclear weaponswould be wasted, and the further improvements in efficiency and economy which were our objective would be frustrated. Moreover,a ban on the manufacture of fissile material for nuclear weaponsafter 1960 would undermine our defence policy. One of the main objectives of that policy was to maintain our political independence,and this purpose would be frustrated if we were prevented fromproducing our own nuclear weapons and the United States and soviet Governments refused to destroy the stocks of nuclear weapons which they would have accumulated by 1960. The United states proposal to link the suspension of nuclear tests with a subsequentsuspension of the manufacture of nuclear weapons could be arguedto be advantageous to us from one point of view since, if the SovietGovernment were not prepared to accept control of the productionof fissile material, the proposals as a whole would be rejected. Onthe other hand, if the Soviet Government, contrary to expectations,were prepared to agree to the control of the production of fissile material, our security and independence would depend either onthe United States agreeing to provide us with sufficient fissile materialor complete weapons to meet our requirements, or on an exceptionalprovision in the general agreement whereby we should be allowedto continue to manufacture fissile material for a further period afterthe general agreement had come into effect. It was therefore essentialthat our willingness to enter into negotations about an ultimatecessation of production should be described as dependent on conditions to be agreed; and these conditions would need to befurther explored in the interval which would remain, under thepresent proposals, before the suspension of tests became operativein July 1958.In discussion it was recognised that if nuclear tests weresuspended, it was unlikely that they could ever be resumed in viewr of the growing pressure of world opinion for their abolition. If, inaddition, a ban on the production of fissile material was realised, theeffect on our position as a nuclear Power would be serious. It wouldbe important, therefore, to discuss with the United States whattechnical help, fissile material or weapons they would be preparedto provide to meet our requirements, if we endorsed proposals onthe lines of the draft statement. Agreement had been reached inJanuary that if the Soviet Union accepted the United Statesdisarmament proposals, negotiations would take place between theUnited States and the United Kingdom on the provision of fissile material and weapons to meet our needs. It would, however, bedesirable, if possible, to secure in addition the provision of technical information, in order to reduce our dependence on further tests.It would be preferable to have an assurance from the United StatesGovernment on these questions before we accepted the commitmentinvolved in the draft statement. The United States Government,however, had already indicated that they were not prepared to enterinto such discussions until it had been ascertained whether theRussians were willing to negotiate on the lines of the latest UnitedStates proposals for a partial disarmament agreement. On the otherhand, in view of the risks involved for the United Kingdom in accepting these proposals, it was essential to set out clearly theunderstandings on which we were prepared to support the UnitedStates Government in putting forward these proposals. Theseunderstandings, which would constitute some of the &quot; conditions to
be agreed &quot; mentioned in the second paragraph of the draft statement,should be set out in a further message from the Prime Minister to president Eisenhower.In further discussion it was agreed that it would be desirable toappoint a Committee of senior officials of the Foreign Office, atomic energy Authority, Commonwealth Relations Office and Ministry ofDefence, under the recently appointed Ministerial Committee, tokeep under review further developments in the disarmamentdiscussions. A Treasury representative should be associated withthis Committee.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would send a message to president Eisenhower setting out the understandings onwhich the United Kingdom Government were preparedto support the proposals for partial disarmament outlined in the draft statement at Annex B to C. (57) 146.(2) Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to arrange for theappointment of a Committee of senior officials on thelines proposed in discussion to keep under review further developments in the disarmament discussions.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,.  24th June, 1957.
