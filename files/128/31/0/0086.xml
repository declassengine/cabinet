The Cabinet resumed their discussion of a memorandum byRecords. the Secretary of the Cabinet (C. (57) 244) on the proposal that Cabinet(Previous        records should be opened to public inspection after fifty years.Reference: jn fjiscussion it was pointed out that, under the Public RecordsC.C. ^(57) 80th gjij at present before Parliament, Departmental records in general would be made available for public inspection in the Public RecordOffice after fifty years and that, since these records would oftenincorporate extracts from Cabinet records, it would be reasonablethat the latter should also be opened to public inspection, providedthat particular categories of papers could be withheld for a longer period. Moreover, the impersonal style in which Cabinet discussions were recorded should protect members of the Cabinet from the disclosure of individual views which might be embarrassing even after fifty years and should ensure that Ministers would continue to feel able to exchange opinions freely.The Prime Minister said that the balance of advantage appearedto lie in allowing Cabinet records to be opened to public inspectionafter fifty years. The Governments conclusion on this question neednot, however, be announced until the Public Records Bill had been enacted. At that point it would be necessary to secure the agreementof the Opposition Parties to the proposal and to seek the consent ofThe Queen to its implementation.The Cabinet-(1) Approved, in principle, the proposals in C. (57) 244.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange that,subject to the consent of The Queen and the agreementof the Leaders of the Opposition Parties, the government&apos;s decision on this question should be announced at theappropriate time.Government *4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theExpenditure. Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (57) 295) on the Civil Estimates,1958-59, together with memoranda by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C. (57) 298) and the Minister of Defence (C. (57) 297)on the Defence Estimates, 1958-59.Anglo- 1.   The Prime Minister read to the Cabinet a letter which heAmerican       had received from President Eisenhower after his return from theRelations.       recent meeting of the North Atlantic Council.   This letter waswelcome evidence of the renewed desire of the United StatesGovernment to work in close co-operation with the United Kingdom.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, when stringentmeasures had been taken in September to limit public investment and to restrict bank advances in the private sector, it had been made clear that steps would be taken to limit current government expenditure. In the event Supplementary Estimates of some  100millions would. be required for the current year, while the civil estimates submitted for 1958-59 were  275 millions higher than theoriginal Estimates for 1957-58, showing the largest increase everrecorded in peace-time. The buoyancy of the revenue and the growth of the Gross National Product provided no real solution to this problem, since both reflected the inflationary conditions which theGovernment sought to cure. Moreover, the high level of taxationwhich contributed to the increase in revenue was itself a major causeof inflationary pressure. Action ought therefore to be taken inrespect of current Government expenditure equivalent to that already taken in respect of bank advances and public investment. For thispurpose it should be the aim to reduce the total of Civil and defence estimates for 1958-59 to a figure no greater than the probableexpenditure of 1957-58, including the Supplementary Estimates.This would involve a reduction of  153 millions in the Civil and defence Estimates as at present proposed. The normal procedures of Treasury scrutiny, if stringently applied, might achieve economies of about  40 millions. Further reductions could only be achieved by major decisions of policy. Such decisions might secure savings of some  40-50 millions in expenditure on the health and welfare services; and further economies of the same magnitude should besought in defence expenditure. A major saving of some  65 millions a year could, however, be achieved if the family allowance for thesecond child was abolished. Economies of this nature would bedifficult to achieve and politically unpopular. But they wereunavoidable if the Government were to succeed in imposing an effective check on inflation and averting the threat to the stability of sterling.In discussion there was general agreement that economies inGovernment expenditure must be secured. For the following reasons,however, doubts were expressed about the practicability of someof the more drastic measures envisaged.(a) It was perhaps unrealistic to suppose that the Estimates for1958-59 could fully reflect a disinflationary policy which had been launched as recently as last September. It wotild be only in 1959-60that this policy could be expected to yield its full return in terms ofthe stability of Government expenditure.(b) It was doubtful whether selective scrutiny of DepartmentalEstimates could be expected to yield large economies, while theimposition of a uniform reduction in those Estimates would be impracticable because of statutory commitments. There was generalagreement therefore that to obtain a large reduction in expenditureit would be necessary to revise Government policy in selected fields.(c) A considerable part of the increase in expenditure was attributable to the growing cost of the agricultural price supportpolicy in a period of declining world prices for agricultural products and to the emergence, for the first time, of a deficit on the national insurance Fund. But the former was the result of a situation whichshould itself exert a disinflationary influence on the economy, whilethe latter could be rectified, though not immediately, if theGovernment decided to introduce a graduated pensions schemerelated to earnings.(d) Any significant reduction of expenditure overseas,particularly in respect of investment in our dependent territories,would be difficult to achieve in view of the long-term commitments which we had undertaken for promoting social and economic development. It would also provide further openings forpenetration of friendly countries by hostile influences.
Air Defence *5.   The Prime Minister said that, after a careful examinationof the united by the Defence Committee of the issues involved in the future airKingdom. defence of the United Kingdom, he had reached the conclusion thathe could not recommend the Cabinet to disband Fighter Command.Although there was a strong case on purely military grounds fordispensing with fighter aircraft in the near future, public opinion,both in this country and among our allies in the North atlantic alliance, would be liable to react adversely to our apparent inability to provide a defence for the deterrent; nor would it be politic to leavethe United Kingdom without protection against aerial reconnaissance and intrusion. While it was Unfortunate that expenditure on research and development in connection with fighter aircraft would need tocontinue, this expenditure would not be substantial in the next year or two, and a further review of the position would be made in due course in the light of the latest assessment of the nature of a possibleattack on this country.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement.* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.(e) Considerable economies had already been made in defence expenditure and further large reductions were impracticable at thepresent stage if existing policies were to be maintained. In particular,any reduction in the amount provided for improvements in service pay, allowances and amenities would seriously prejudice the prospects of improved recruitment. Nor would it be desirable to reduce theexpenditure attributable to the development of nuclear weaponsuntil it was clear how far the United States would be prepared,possibly in the context of an international agreement on disarmament,to share essential information with us more freely.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement that the Governments anti-inflationarypolicies must continue to be vigorously applied. To this end itwould be necessary to achieve substantial reductions in the estimates for 1958-59. But the precise amount of these reductions was less important than the ability of the Government to demonstrate thatthey were adhering to their aim of limiting the quantity of money in circulation. Moreover, the nature of the economies and the timing of their application must not be such as to prejudice the paramountobjective of securing wage stability or to involve the Governmentin a politically indefensible position. In the light of these considerations it would be desirable first to establish the maximumeconomies in both civil and military expenditure which could beachieved within present policies, and thereafter to examine whatadjustments of policy might be practicable to secure the further economies required.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange forDepartments to be instructed to secure the maximumreductions in the Civil Estimates, 1958-59, which werecompatible with present policies.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to consider what further economies could be effected in the Defence Estimates for1958-59, having regard to the points made in their discussion.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,31st December, 1957.Aircraft 6.   The Minister of Civil Aviation said that both the deIndustry.        Havilland Aircraft Company and the Bristol Aeroplane Company(Previous        were prepared to undertake the design and construction of the newReference:      jet air liner required by British European Airways (B.E.A.).  B.E.A.CC. (57) 60th had expressed a preference for manufacture by the de HavillandConclusions,     Company.    This  Company,  however,  had  been  reluctant  to minute 5.)      co-operate in the rationalisation of the aircraft industry which theGovernment were concerned to bring about, whereas the bristol aeroplane Company had expressed their readiness to join with the hawker-Siddeley Group in this project.   It would, therefore, bedesirable that the Government should seek to influence B.E.A., sofar as possible, to place their order with Bristols rather than with de Havillands.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.
