3CC. (56) 571. The Foreign Secretary said that no further news had beenreceived about the operations in Oman. Despite the rumours whichwere appearing in the Press, there was no question at the moment ofBritish ground forces being despatched to support the Sultan of muscat; but it might be desirable to emphasise, in reply to questions in Parliament,, the value of the assistance which we were providing tothe Sultan in other ways. The United States Government, who hadbeen informed of our intentions, had so far refrained from comment;but we should need to bear in mind their concern to maintain good relations between the Western Powers and Saudi Arabia.In discussion there was general agreement with these views. Itwas suggested, however, that, in view of the risk that the incidentmight be deliberately magnified into an occasion of international tension, we should ascertain more precisely how far we should beentitled under international law to take action in support of the sultan.The Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for an examinationof the extent to which We should be entitled, under international law, to take action in support of the Sultan of muscat.st*el 2.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Steel BoardPrices. had proposed to announce on 24th July an increase in steel prices.

The Minister of Transport said that the report which he hadTransport now received from the British Transport Commission appeared to commission. constitute a satisfactory rebuttal of the charges of waste and(Previous inefficiency brought against them by Mr. Gethin, one of their formerReference : employees.

Sir Harold Howitfs investigation would not only coverMinute 2.) the specific charges which had been brought against the Commission,but would also include an examination of their purchasing policy as
. a whole. Both the Commission^ report and the result of Sir HaroldHbwitfs enquiry would be published.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement by the Ministerof Transport.Pensions.(PreviousReference5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePrime Minister (C. (57) 176) about pensions.The Prime Minister said that, on further reflection, he had cometo the conclusion that the legislative action required to effect animprovement in pensions should proceed in two stages. The first Billshould be confined to the National Insurance pension and should beintroduced at the opening of the next session, in time to enable theincreased pension to be brought into effect, if possible, by Christmas.The precise amount of the new rate of pension would need to befurther considered. It would also be necessary to decide the revisedrate of contribution, which would depend to some extent on the content of any scheme of supplementary pensions which the cabinet might decide to adopt, If the revised contribution was to take effect as soon as possible after the increase in the pension, the printing ofthe necessary stamps would have to be commissioned by about themiddle of September, and the risk that the Governmenfs intentionsmight, as a result, be prematurely disclosed would have to be accepted.The Minister of Pensions said that, if an increased pension wasto be payable by Christmas, it would be necessary to announce in thefirst week of November that pensioners must produce their pensionbooks to be re-rated. Such an announcement would not merelyanticipate the Second Reading of the Bill but would also preclude theGovernment from accepting any amendment of the Bill during its passage through Parliament.In discussion there was general agreement that it would be advantageous if the increase in the rate of pension could take effect by Christmas, particularly in view of the desirability of arranging forthis increase to become operative at much the same time as theincrease in National Assistance rates which would almost certainly be necessary before the end of the year. On this hypothesis, however,it would be necessary either to arrange for existing stamps to be over-stamped by Post Offices or to put the printing of new stamps inhand within the next few weeks with the risk that, if the Bill was subsequently amended by Parliament, a certain amount of nugatoryexpenditure would have to be accepted and the increase in pension would have to be postponed until the spring of the following year. &apos;\But the responsibility for this delay would be seen to attach not tothe Government but to those who, by their amendment of the Bill,had frustrated the Governmenfs desire to enable the pensioners to benefit as rapidly as possible from the increase in pension.The decision on the amount of the increase in both pension andcontribution could not, however, be taken until it had been decided whether a supplementary pensions scheme should be introduced. Anincrease in the rate of pension for a single man by \0s. would provide some margin of insurance against a further rise in prices. On theother hand it would be considerably more inflationary in its impact on the economy than an increase of only 5s.; and it was doubtfulwhether it should be conceded unless the Cabinet were prepared totake a firm decision to introduce a supplementary pensions schemewhich would afford significant relief to the Exchequer. In thisconnection the Cabinet were informed that the representatives of theinsurance companies, who had been informally consulted about the graduated scheme of supplementary pensions which the Governmenthad in mind, had indicated that they were not unduly concerned
5CC. (56) 57about its probable effect on their own interests and that they wouldprobably not wish the scheme to be complicated by a provision whereby individuals already participating in approved occupational pension schemes should be entitled to contract out of the graduatedelement in the benefits of the new scheme.The Prime Minister said that, in the light of the discussion, theCabinet would need to give further consideration to the complex ofissues involved. It would be necessary to reach decisions on thesebefore the summer recess.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Pensions, in consultation with thePostmaster-General, to give further consideration to the praticability of the administrative arrangements whichwould be needed to enable an increase in the national insurance pension to take effect by Christmas.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.CommonwealthEconomicDevelopment.(previous reference :CC. (57) 51stConclusions,Minute 7)6. The Commonwealth Secretary said that the draft white paper annexed to C. (57) 160 on the role of the United Kingdom in commonwealth economic development had been extensively revisedafter further consideration by the Economic Policy Committee. Itwas desirable, however, that it should end on the most constructivenote possible, and the concluding paragraphs of the amended versionannexed to E.A. (57) 93 were being further revised for that purpose.It was proposed that the White Paper should be published on30th July.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had had anopportunity to explain to the Governmenfs supporters the considerations which must influence the Governmenfs policy for commonwealth economic development and he was satisfied that thefinancial limitations on the United kingdom&apos;s  contribution were now more widely appreciated. Nevertheless, the publication of the white paper would serve a valuable purpose.The Cabinet-Authorised the publication, in the following week, of theWhite Paper on the United kingdom&apos;s  role in Common-wealth economic development in its revised form.Anglo-CanadianTrade.(previous reference:CC. (57) 48thConclusions,Minute 4.)7. The Cabinet had before them a note by the President of theBoard of Trade (C. (57) 164) about Anglo-Canadian trade.The President of the Board of Trade said that it was essentialthat the Government should make a constructive response to the offer by the Prime Minister of Canada to divert $625 millions of Canadianimports from the United States to the United Kingdom. Ascompared with 1937 the proportion of our exports to Canada which now qualified for preferential treatment had fallen from 88 per cent,to 80 per cent., while the average margin of preference had declined from 23 per cent, to 10 per cent. There would be advantage,therefore, in seeking to negotiate a new and more favourable trade agreement with the Canadian Government, It would be open to usin return to assist Canadian exports to the United Kingdom byrelaxing certain of our restrictions on dollar trade. It would be prudent, however, to ascertain what additional opportunities canada would be willing to provide for our exports before entering into any discussion of specific measures to assist Canadian exports to thiscountry. As we imposed fewer restrictions than Canada on trade between the two countries, it would be to our interest to respond to

Cotton.(previous reference:C.C (57) 20thConclusions,Minute 4.)Imports.8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (57) 173) discussing the issues involved in regulating imports of cotton textiles from India. pakistan and Hong Kong.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the cotton industries of India and Pakistan would be willing to enter into a voluntary agreement for regulating their exports to the United Kingdom,provided that the Hong Kong industry would participate in such anarrangement. The Hong Kong interests were, however, unwilling todo so and the Cotton Board were now urging that Her Majesty\sGovernment should publicly endorse the need for a voluntary agreement between the industries concerned. Any such statement would imply that the Government would be prepared to invoke themachinery of import licensing to the extent which might be necessaryto implement the agreement.The Economic Policy Committee had been unable to agree or.the desirability of action on these lines. There was as yet nounemployment in Lancashire which could be attributed to the increasein imports of cotton goods from these countries. On the other hand there was no prospect that United Kingdom industry would be ableto withstand indefinitely the unrestricted competition of goodsproduced in the Asiatic Commonwealth countries where an entirely different standard of living prevailed ; and eventually the Governmentof the day might find themselves compelled to impose some limit on imports of this kind. It could therefore be argued that, on balance,it would be to the advantage of the Hong Kong industry to collaborate with the industries of India and Pakistan in operating a voluntary agreement which would enable them to preserve the share of theUnited Kingdom market which they had already obtained.any readiness on the part of the Canadian Government to modify their tariffs in our favour; and, if the Canadian Government provedunexpectedly generous in this respect, it might even be possible to contemplate the creation of a free trade area embracing the twocountries.In discussion there was general agreement that, in principle, weshould welcome the initiative by the Prime Minister of Canada. Itwould be desirable to make an appropriate reference to this initiative in the debate on the economic situation on 25th July. Thereafter iiwould be necessary to give further consideration to the possible courses of action summarised in C. (57) 164 before entering into any definite discussions with the Canadian Government. It seemed unlikely that the Canadian Government would be prepared to contemplate the competition to which Canadian industry would be exposed if Canada entered a free trade area. On the other hand, theywere greatly concerned about the increasing degree of control which united States interests were acquiring over Canadian resources; andthey might be prepared to establish closer economic links with thiscountry in various ways. The possibilities in this respect should befurther explored by officials.The Cabinet (1) Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to arrange for amore detailed examination to be made of the possibilityof increasing Anglo-Canadian trade.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to make, during theforthcoming debate on the economic situation, an appropriate reference to the recent initiative by the PrimeMinister of Canada.
The Colonial Secretary said that he was unable to support such aview. The problem of the competition of manufactured goods fromthe Asiatic Commonwealth countries in the United Kingdom andother Commonwealth markets would eventually need to be tackledcomprehensively. It was not a problem which could be settledpiecemeal, and the adoption of import licensing for cotton textilesfrom Hong Kong would lead to claims by other United Kingdomindustries for similar protection. We should feel obliged to come tothe defence of Hong Kong under the General Agreement on tariffs and Trade against arrangements made by other countries to restrictby means of import licensing the import of Hong Kong goods, andwe could scarcely agree to be a party to a similar arrangementourselves.The President of the Board of Trade said that it was essential thatthe Government should maintain a reasonable balance between the legitimate interests of the other Commonwealth countries involved and those of this country itself. The threat of increasing andunrestricted imports of textiles was impeding both recruitment oflabour and investment of capital in the Lancashire industry. More-over, the sole question now at issue was whether the Governmentshould intervene to encourage the negotiation of a voluntary agree-ment and to facilitate its implementation; and this step could be clearly distinguished, from a unilateral decision to impose import restrictions.The Prime Minister said that it would be reasonable for theGovernment to offer their assistance in implementing a voluntary agreement. The question whether they should exert any pressure onHong Kong to participate in such an agreement was more difficult.It would seem justifiable, however, to warn both the Government andthe industry in Hong Kong of the possible repercussions on theprinciple of free entry of Commonwealth poods if imports ofparticular commodities were allowed to endanger too acutely the stability of industries in the United Kingdom, and to suggest to themthat it was to their advantage to safeguard their interests by entering into a voluntary agreement at a time when the United kingdom industry was prepared to contemplate a relatively generous quota (&quot;or their exports.Discussion showed that there was considerable support in theCabinet for this view. It was agreed that the matter should be further discussed on these lines with the Governor of Hong Kong during thecourse of his visit to this country.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the colonial secretary and the President of the Board of Trade torepresent to the Governor of Hong Kong, on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister, the arguments for encouraging the cotton textile industry in Hong Kong toenter into a voluntary agreement for the regulation of their exports to the United Kingdom.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.23 rd July, 1957.
