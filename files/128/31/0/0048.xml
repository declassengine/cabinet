Suez Canal. 1.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theBritish Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (57) 142) on the provision of financialEvacuees.       assistance for British evacuees from Egypt.(previous reference: The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in accordance with c.C. (57) 45th Cabinet&apos;s earlier decisions, the War Office were negotiating withMlnuteS16)S&apos; tne- ^uez Canal contractors&apos; companies about the advances to bemade to their former employees, and the Anglo-egyptian resettlement Board had been authorised to make additional grants to other evacuees in certain circumstances. These two provisions would be announced in the debate in the House of Lords on27th June. He had studied further the possibility of securing therelease by United Kingdom banks of securities, amounting to nearly 2 millions, held to the order of banks in Egypt for British evacuees.The banks had been advised that they would be liable to legal action if they released these securities without the consent of the EgyptianExchange Control. They were, however, prepared to make advancesagainst the securities, provided that the Treasury would indemnifythem. The disadvantage of such an arrangement was that theGovernment would appear to be taking over the claims in respectof these assets; and, since it seemed likely that in any future settlement with the Egyptian Government, the claims of the twoGovernments would be set off against each other, the amountsinvolved in these advances would not be recoverable except byappropriation of the . Egyptian sterling balances, which wasobjectionable on other grounds. He proposed that, together withthe Commonwealth Secretary and the Minister of Education, heshould see Lord Killearn, the spokesman of the claimants, beforethe forthcoming debate in order to explain the difficulties involved;but it might become necessary to offer to explore further anarrangement on the lines proposed by the banks.In discussion it was suggested that it was not in our general interest to expedite negotiations with the Egyptian Government, andthat it would therefore be inequitable to continue to ask Britishcitizens to wait for the settlement of their claims until Governmentalnegotiations had been completed. Moreover, there was growingpressure from the Governmenfs supporters in Parliament and inthe country for some measure of assistance to British evacuees whoseassets had been sequestrated, particularly where those assets were held in this country. The present position could not be maintainedindefinitely, and it would be more creditable, and perhaps more economical in the long term, to make some concessions now ratherthan be forced to make them at a later date. Any advances whichmight be made should be based on some test of need and onverification of ownership; and the arrangements should not prejudice the legal position in future negotiations with the egyptian government. In this connection further consideration should begiven to the liability of the banks in respect of securities held in thiscountry, since it was not certain that the decision of the House ofLords, which had been accepted as the precedent determining the inability of the banks to release these securities without the consentof the Egyptian Exchange Control, was applicable to the present case.It was for consideration whether the claimants should be advised to test the issue in the courts. If further examination confirmed thata test case should be launched, this would be an additional reasonagainst the premature introduction of any scheme of advances againstthe securities.Further consideration should also be given to arrangementsfor making advances to British evacuees whose assets in Egypt hadbeen sequestrated. It would, however, be important to avoid any action which might prejudice the recovery of these assets. Suchadvances should therefore be made on an ex gratia basis; and thiswould be emphasised if they were paid by a body associated with theAnglo-Egyptian Resettlement Board.
OverseaInformationServices.(previous reference:CC. (57) 6thConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster (C. (57) 141) covering a report by theCommittee on Oversea Information Services, together with amemorandum by the Prime Minister (C. (57) 145) summarising themain points for decision.The Prime Minister said that the Governors of the british broadcasting Corporation (B.B.C.) had formally asked that theyshould be allowed to submit to the Government &quot;their own viewson the development of the Corporation^ external services beforethe Cabinet took a final decision on this point. It would be preferable, however, that the Cabinet should first reach a conclusionabout the development of these services, and that the B.B.C. should thereafter be informed of this conclusion before it received anypublicity. He proposed himself to receive; the Chairman of the governors of the Corporation; and, if the Cabinet approved theproposals now before them, he would be able to inform the B.B.C.that: -(i) The Government reaffirmed their intention to maintain theindependence and integrity of the B.B.C. so far as the detailed content of their external programmes was concerned.(ii) The Government intended, however, to exercise their rightto define the direction and emphasis of the Corporation^ externalprogrammes and would expect the Corporation to collaborate inthe redeployment of those programmes which was summarised inparagraphs 42-46 of C. (57) 141,(hi) The Government had approved in principle a programme ofcapital re-equipment by the B.B.C. in this country, coupled withthe establishment of certain relay stations abroad, as indicated inparagraphs 47-52 of C. (57) 141, subject in each case to further discussion of the details of these programmes and of their financial implications.(iv) While the Government trusted that the B.B.C. would develop their external television service on their own responsibility to the maximum extent permitted by commercial considerations,they intended, in the initial and experimental phase of overseatelevision development, to confine Exchequer assistance for thispurpose to the Central Office of Information, which would be theThe Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in his forthcomingtalk with Lord Killearn, to be guided by the general sense of their discussion.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange forfurther consideration to be given to the desirability of advising the claimants to launch an action in the courts to test the legal inability of United Kingdom banks to release, without the consent of the Egyptian exchange control, securities which they held to the order of banksin Egypt for British refugees.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, subject to theresults of the enquiry to be made under Conclusion (2)above, to prepare a scheme for advances by UnitedKingdom banks to British refugees from Egypt against such securities, on the basis of a Treasury indemnity.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Home Secretary, to consider arrangements for making ex gratia advances to British evacuees from Egyptagainst assets sequestrated in that country through an agency associated with the Anglo-Egyptian ResettlementBoard.
Governments agent for the preparation of television materialdesigned specifically for showing in areas overseas as a deliberateinstrument of information policy.On the financial implications of the proposals as a whole, theCabinet might feel that the oversea information services should beauthorised to expand over the next few years from a present annual rate of expenditure of about  13 millions to a new level of about 15 millions (which would comprise those proposals indicated in theAppendix to C. (57) 141 as being of first priority), provided that:  (a) every effort was made to secure further economies in theexisting services, particularly in the Foreign Office information services in Germany; and(b) the expansion of the oversea information services as a whole was so controlled that the expenditure involved would not, withoutfurther Cabinet authority, exceed a figure of  15 millions a year whenall the proposals in question had taken full effect.It would be necessary, in addition, to make some provision forthe capital expenditure required by the B.B.C. for re-equipment and expansion, both in this country and abroad. The programmesubmitted for this purpose in C. (57) .14.1 was estimated to cost 5^ millions spread over some fifteen years, but the bulk of this expenditure would accrue in the earlier part of this period. It was for consideration whether some limit to the annual expenditure forthis purpose should be established.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was prepared toaccept the proposals submitted in C. (57) 141, provided that theywere subjected to the ordinary process of detailed scrutiny by theTreasury and were accompanied by further economies in existing services, particularly in Europe. He could not, however, accept thesuggestion that, if costs rose, the  15 millions allocation should be automatically increased in proportion. In the event of a further increase in costs, the oversea information services could not. claimto be exempt from the fresh review to which all categories ofGovernment expenditure would then need to be subjected. He was prepared to agree in principle that the provision for a programme ofcapital re-equipment and expansion by the B.B.C. should be additional to the allocation of  15 millions for current expenditure;but the amount to be assigned to capital expenditure, and the rate atwhich it should be committed, would need to be given furtherconsideration when the details of the programme had been more fully examined.In discussion there was a general welcome for the proposals outlined in C. (57) 141. It was suggested, however, that the natureof the oversea information services might make it advisable for theDepartments concerned to be given, without prejudice to themaintenance in principle of normal Treasury control, rather greateradministrative latitude within the ultimate allocation of  15 millions.It was agreed that, in so far as the proposals concerned theB.B.C., the Corporation should be informed of the governments intentions on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister; and that,after the discussion with the B.B.C., the proposals should be published in the form of a White Paper.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals contained in C. (57) 141, subjectto the points made in their discussion.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for theBritish Broadcasting Corporation to be informed of theseproposals, in so far as they concerned the Corporation.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to circulate the draft of a White Paper, in which the proposals wouldbe published before the summer recess.
Cyprus.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 34thConclusions,Minute 1.)Visit ofM. Spaak to greece and turkey.TripartiteConference.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to reply to the enquiries fromthe Secretary-General of the North Atlantic treaty organisation on the lines indicated in their discussion.The Foreign Secretary said that the Turkish Government had suggested that we should now invite the Greek Government and themselves to a further tripartite conference on the future of Cyprus,as a means of complying with the last United Nations resolution.Though the Greek Government would probably refuse any suchinvitation, there would be no harm in issuing it. Moreover, this procedure, which would be consistent with the initiative taken by theNorth Atlantic Council, would allow further time for considerationof our future policy. If a conference was to be held, however, the invitations ought to be issued within the next few days, and their terms would need to be settled quickly. The form of invitation usedfor the 1955 Tripartite Conference would no longer be suitable. Apossible alternative might be to invite the other two governments to &quot; consider how to give effect to the United Nations resolution.&quot;Further study should be urgently given to this formula; and theproposal might also be discussed, without commitment, with theTurkish Ambassador.In discussion there was general agreement that there would bepolitical advantage in issuing an invitation on these lines since, evenif it was accepted, a conference of this kind should not prejudice our future freedom of action in deciding our policy towards Cyprus,while, if we rejected the proposal, the Turkish Government mightwell take offence.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theColonial Secretary and the Minister of Defence, toprepare, for consideration by the Colonial PolicyCommittee, draft invitations to the Greek and turkish governments to attend a tripartite conference on Cyprus.dollar expenditure.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 44thConclusions,Minute 3.)Imports.4. The President of the Board of Trade said that the economic policy Committee had examined and endorsed the proposedrelaxations in the control over imports of industrial raw materials and other commodities from dollar sources which were summarised in C. (57) 134. While these relaxations might involve an additionaldollar expenditure of up to  10 millions by the United Kingdom and perhaps  3  millions by the Colonies, the increase in the cost of3. The Foreign Secretary said that M. Spaak, the Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), had asked to be informed about our future policy toward Cyprus beforestarting on his visit to Athens and Ankara on 29th June. He had also asked whether it would be advisable for him to meet Archbishop Makarios.In discussion it was agreed that it would not be possible tocomplete the formulation of our policy in the near future and thata temporising reply would have to be sent to M. Spaak. It wouldbe unwise to advise him not to see Archbishop Makarios, and heshould be left to reach his own decision on this point. At the sametime it might be suggested to him that his formal responsibility, asthe Secretary-General of NATO, was to hold discussions aboutCyprus with the Greek and Turkish Governments, since the originaloffer of mediation by NATO had been addressed to the Governmentsconcerned.
LocalGovernmentFinance.(previous reference:CC. (57) 10thConclusions,Minute. 2.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Local Government (C. (57) 148) covering a draft white paper setting out the Governmenfs proposals for the reform of localgovernment finance.The Minister of Local Government said that the principalquestion remaining for decision was the amount of the reductionchequer grants to local authorities which should accompany the partial re-rating of industry. While he had negotiated with thelocal authorities on the basis of the Cabinet&apos;s previous decision thatthe proceeds of re-rating should accrue wholly to the Exchequer, thelocal authorities, whose response to the Governmenfs proposals asa whole had not been unfavourable, had clearly indicated that they expected to receive some share of the financial benefit to be derivedfrom this measure. In view of the importance of securing their support for,the new system of local government finance he proposedthat they should be conceded  15 millions, being half the grossproceeds of re-rating, and that this concession should be effected byan adjustment of  10 millions in the general and equalisation grants,the balance of  5 millions being held in reserve for settlement whenthe effect of the proposed changes in the highway grants, which were still under negotiation, could be assessed.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that the Scottish localauthorities were uniformly opposed to the Governmenfs proposals,and were prepared, in particular, to contemplate a reorganisation ofhighway grants only on the basis that any deficiency which might result would be met by the Exchequer. In these circumstances it was essential, in Scotland, that a substantial proportion of the proceeds of re-rating should accrue to the local authorities if their reasonablecollaboration in the proposals as a whole was to be secured. Subjectto a concession on this point, the preparation of a correspondingWhite Paper on local government finance in Scotland could now proceed.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the proposed concession to the local authorities was indefensible in principle andwas incompatible with the original intention to reduce the extent towhich the local authorities were both subject to central control anddependent on Exchequer assistance. The expenditure of the centralGovernment was once again tending to rise, and the prospects of future reductions in taxation depended on the Exchequers receiving the maximum of relief from such major changes of policy as that now under discussion. The concession now envisaged would be inconsistent with this principle and would be the more dangerousimports as a whole should not exceed  2-3 millions a year in thecase of the United Kingdom and about  1 million a year in thecase of the Colonies. It was to our economic advantage that our industry should have access to the cheapest and most satisfactorysources of raw materials. Moreover, while the proposed relaxationsdid not represent more than a modest advance towards the removalof controls over dollar imports, they would help to promotecommercial relations with Canada. Since the new Prime Ministerof Canada had expressed a close interest in Commonwealth trade,it might be appropriate to defer announcing them until he had beeninformed of them on his arrival for the Meeting of commonwealth prime Ministers.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (57) 134 and authorised theChancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for them to be announced after the Prime Minister of Canada had beeninformed.
in that it would establish a precedent for even more costly concessions in respect of the later stages of re-rating, if and when they were undertaken. He had already agreed that the new general grant should be paid in its entirety in the year to which it was attributable,an administrative change from which the local authorities would benefit by more than  30 millions in the first two years of the new scheme. The only further easement which he could contemplatewould be limited to an Exchequer contribution towards the transitional arrangements which were designed to operate for thefirst few years of the scheme. This contribution would have to be restricted to an amount which, taken together with the additionalpayment resulting from the change in the administrative arrangements for disbursement of the new general grant, would not,after allowing for the full potential loss of tax, involve the exchequer in a net loss in any year. A limited concession of this kind mightcomprise  5 millions over a period of four years or  7^ millions over a period of six years.The Cabinet decided that, in view of the complexity of the issues involved, the question should be remitted to a Committee of ministers for more detailed examination.The Cabinet (1) Appointed a Committee of Ministers consisting of-Home Secretary (in the Chair)Chancellor of the ExchequerSecretary of State for ScotlandMinister of labour minister of Local GovernmentMinister of EducationMinister of transport to give further consideration to the claim of the localauthorities to an appropriate share in the proceeds of re-rating, and to report their conclusions to the PrimeMinister.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to circulate to thisCommittee the details of his proposed alternativeconcession.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland, in consultationwith the Minister of Local Government, to prepare, inthe light of the result of the enquiry under Conclusion (1)above, a White Paper setting out the Government^proposals for the reform of local government finance inScotland.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,25th June, 1957.
