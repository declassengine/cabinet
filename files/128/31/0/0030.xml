ContentsSuez Canal.
The Cabinet had before them telegrams from Washington(Nos. 826, 827 and 828) in which H.M. Ambassador reported thatthe United States Government had not yet decided whether it wouldbe wiser that they should themselves pursue negotiations with theEgyptian Government on the future control&apos; of the Suez Canal or that the issue should now be referred to the Security Council.The Prime Minister said that there were disadvantages in either of these, courses. , If the United States Government, continued tonegotiate direct with the Egyptian Government, the other Govern-ments concerned would find themselves in difficulty if the negotiationsresulted in proposals for a settlement which they could not accept.Moreover, the United States Government seemed to contemplate that this policy might involve restoring a more normal relationship between the United States and Egypt. It would be unfortunate if,as a result, they relaxed the current restrictions on Egyptian assets in the United States or renewed financial aid to Egypt. If, on theother hand, the issue was now formally submitted to the security council, the Egyptian Government might interpret this as aprovocative gesture and might seek, in retaliation, to discriminate against United Kingdom and French shipping by refusing, forexample, to accept payment of Canal dues in transferable sterlingor to permit transit of the Canal until their claims for war damagehad been satisfied.There were, however, political advantages in invoking theSecurity Council, and it might be possible to combine the alternative courses which the United States Government had in mind. On this basis the United States would report to the Security Council theresult of their current negotiations with the Egyptian Governmentand would indicate that they would be prepared, if. the Council sowished, to continue these exploratory discussions, their representa-tives being assisted by advisers drawn from the Suez Canal Users&apos;Association and international shipping organisations. This proposal might be the subject of a general discussion in the Security Council,without a formal resolution which might invite a Soviet veto. If theproposal commanded general acceptance, the United StatesGovernment would then offer to report back to the Security council the outcome of their further negotiations.This procedure would avoid any impression that the security council was being used to mobilise world opinion against Egypt:on the other hand, it would have obvious advantages from the pointof view of political presentation both in this country and in France.Moreover, it would provide time in which interim arrangements might be made for the passage of United Kingdom shipping throughthe Canal and for the payment of Canal dues under protest; and,if the Egyptian Government attempted to discriminate against UnitedKingdom and French ships, it would be advantageous if UnitedStates representatives were engaged in negotiations at the time. Theessential feature of the proposed arrangements would, however, bethe stipulation that the United States Government should report back to the Security Council the result of their further negotiations.This should ensure that the United States Government acted as the agent of the Security Council and should remove, any impression that the nations interested in the Suez Canal were resigned to accepting any settlement with the Egyptian Government, howeverunsatisfactory it might be.In discussion it was suggested that there might be some advantage if the United States Government first proposed to theEgyptian Government that Egyptian representatives should attend a conference of the nations primarily interested in the Canal, theterms of reference being based on the six principles endorsed by theSecurity Council on 13th October, 1956. If the Egyptian Governmentrejected this proposal, they would have demonstrated theirintransigence afresh and the submission of the issue to the SecuritySuez Canal.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 29thConclusions,Minute 2.)
Council would be even more clearly warranted. As against this itwas argued that some ships would resume transit of the Canal inthe near future, and the Government would be in a difficult position if they had not by then taken some further action which would justify, them in allowing United Kingdom ships to use the Canalwithout prejudice to the ultimate settlement. If the egyptian government rejected the proposal for a conference, there would beno basis on which we could allow United Kingdom ships to resumetransit of the Canal without appearing to prejudge the main issue.If, on the other hand, the Security Council had already accepted inprinciple a United States offer to pursue negotiations with theEgyptian Government on behalf of the Council, we should be onstronger grounds in maintaining that our action in allowing UnitedKingdom ships to resume the use of the Canal and to pay transitdues under protest was without prejudice to the outcome of these negotiations. Even if the discussions between the United States and egyptian Governments did not yield a satisfactory settlement, itwould be more difficult for the Egyptian Government subsequently to discriminate against our shipping if we had in fact been using the canal in the meantime.In further discussion it was agreed that the views of theFrench Government should be sought on the proposal that theUnited States Government should pursue their negotiations withthe Egyptian Government on behalf of the Security Council, andalso on the suggestion that one of the non-permanent members ofthe Security Council should be invited to propose a conference between the Egyptian Government and the countries principallyinterested in the Suez Canal. In either case, however, our objectivewould be to retain freedom of manoeuvre in the further negotiationswith the Egyptian Government while allowing United Kingdom andFrench shipping to begin to use the Canal again without prejudgingthe final settlement. It would, therefore, be desirable that thearrangement whereby United Kingdom ships, in concert with theshipping of other nations, would resume transit of the Canal andwould pay dues to the Egyptian Canal Authority under protestshould, if possible, be made by the Suez Canal Users&apos; association on the initiative of the United States Government.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs(Commander Noble) to instruct H.M. Ambassador atWashington to make representations to the United StatesGovernment on the lines agreed in their discussion.(2) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs to informthe Foreign Secretary in Paris of the action taken under conclusion (1) above, and to invite him to ascertain theviews of the French Government as a matter of urgency.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,8th April, 1957.
