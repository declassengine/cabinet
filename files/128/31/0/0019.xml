3 C.C. 19 (57)1. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the current reviewof farm prices.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet must now choose between imposing a settlement at a figure of  13 millions, with no increase in the guaranteed price for milk, and reaching an agreed settlement at  14J millions which would concede an extra farthinga gallon for milk. Strong arguments could be advanced in favourof either course. An imposed settlement could be justified on grounds of principle, namely that a realistic agricultural policy shouldnot provide further encouragement for the production of a commodity which was already in embarrassing surplus, and that aretreat from realism in agriculture would be taken as a sign of a weakening of the Governmenfs economic policy elsewhere, e.g., incredit restriction. In favour of an agreed settlement it could be argued that it was important, particularly in view of the forthcomingdebates on the Agriculture Bill, to preserve the goodwill of the farmers, and that it would be unwise to sacrifice the advantages ofagreement for the sake of a sum which was relatively trivial in itself and was considerably less than the cost increases in milk production which the farmers would be left to carry. He was himself inclined to the view that, if an agreed settlement on the basis which he had outlined was regarded by the Cabinet as not unreasonable on merits,the advantages to be derived from it should be welcomed. But ifthe Cabinet regarded this settlement as intrinsically unsound, it was doubtful whether it would be wise to pursue those advantages at thecost of a concession which could not strictly be defended from theeconomic point of view.In discussion it was urged that the Government would be judged largely by their success in reducing public expenditure and in providing further incentives for individual initiative and enterprise.Their difficulties in carrying out these tasks would be increased if, inconcluding this price review, they made a concession which would beseen to be detrimental to the Exchequer, to our friends in theCommonwealth, and in the long run to the farmers themselves. Itwas true that the amount at stake was trivial, but it was for that reason all the more significant as a symbol of the Governmenfsdetermination to stand firm or their inability to resist pressure. TheGovernment had hitherto acted with courage and resolution in theirtreatment of defence, the social services and credit policy. to concede to the farmers a price increase for the very commodity onwhich the farmers themselves knew that their case was unsoundwould be interpreted as evidence of weakness and inconsistency.^On the other hand, the political implications of sacrificing the goodwill of the farmers and alienating a considerable section of the government&apos;s supporters for the sake of so nominal a sum shouldnot be under-rated. If the Government had intended to make no concession at all to the farmers, it would have been wiser to impose a settlement at the original minimum figure of  8 millions. But duringthe negotiations the Government had already raised their offer to 13 millions, and it would now be inexpedient to lose the advantages of an agreed settlement for the sake of a further  1^ millions. Therisk of alienating the Governmenfs own supporters was particularlyserious at the moment when, in view of the risk of industrial unrest,it was essential to maintain the maximum degree of unity throughoutthe country. Moreover, a settlement at  14^ millions would not be indefensible on merits. The additional farthing for the guaranteed price of milk should be seen in relation to an increase of 2\d. a gallonin the costs of milk production. A very considerable part of these additional costs would, therefore, be left with the producersthemselves, of whom 125,000 were small farmers. To make aminimal concession to the small farmer as part of a settlement which, in its totality, could fairly be represented as severe, wouldnot be inconsistent with the Governmenfs declared policy ofproviding incentives for individual enterprise.  It would be desirable,Farm price review.(previous reference:G.C. (57) 18thConclusions,Minute 1.)
however, that the forthcoming White Paper should emphasise that,in contributing only a farthing towards cost increases of 2\d. in milk production, the Government were concerned to emphasise that agricultural subsidies should be increasingly directed to the supportof those commodities which it was in the national interest toencourage. -The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in the light of thediscussion, he was reluctantly prepared to agree to a settlement of  14\ millions, including an increase of a farthing in the guaranteed price for milk. But it should be made clear to the farmers that theymust accept or reject this settlement as a whole, and that theGovernment would not in any circumstances agree to any furtheradjustment of its details. It was also desirable that the procedurewhereby the annual review was carried out should now bere-examined by an inter-departmental committee, the Chairman ofwhich should be provided by a Department other than the treasury or the Ministry of Agriculture. This examination should be put inhand well in advance of next year&apos;s annual review.The Cabinet -(1) Authorised the Minister of Agriculture to conclude thenegotiations with the representatives of the farmers onthe basis of an offer of  14  millions (including an increaseof a farthing in the guaranteed price for milk) and on the clear understanding that the Government were notprepared, in any circumstances, to make any furtheradjustment in the details of this settlement.(2) Invited the Minister of Agriculture to arrange that theforthcoming White Paper on the Price Review should emphasise the Governments concern that agriculturalsubsidies should be increasingly directed to the support of. those commodities which it was in the national interestto encourage.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for theprocedure of the Annual Farm Price Review to bere-examined by an Inter-Departmental Committee.industrial relations.(previous reference:CC. (57) 17thConclusions,Minute 10.)2. The Minister of Labour said that the Governments proposalto appoint an arbitrator in the wages dispute in the shipbuilding industry had been well received by public opinion. The more extremeelements in the unions concerned remained, however, opposed to arbitration and had indicated that they might seek to extend strike action beyond the shipbuilding industry, if this proved necessaryto enforce their claim. The employers would probably acceptarbitration, though with considerable reluctance.In these circumstances there would be no advantage in asking the arbitrator to proceed to make an award: public opinion was unlikely to support a decision reached without evidence from theunions. It might, however, be expedient to offer the services of the Arbitrator to the engineering industry. If the engineering unionscould be persuaded to accept arbitration, the award might be of use in securing a settlement of the shipbuilding dispute.The Government should adhere to their view that arbitrationoffered the best hope of a settlement, and that view should be restatedfirmly in answer to a Private Notice Question that day. The situation was liable, however, to be complicated by the result of the arbitration in the railways dispute, which would be made known early in thefollowing week. It now seemed likely that the arbitrator would awarda wage increase of only 3 per cent, and there was little doubt thatthe National Union of Railwaymen would reject this award. TheBritish Transport Commission might be willing to renew their earlieroffer of an increase of 3\ per cent. This seemed to be the minimumconcession required to avoid a railway strike.
In discussion it was emphasised that widespread industrial disputes would have serious effects on the national economy and on confidence in sterling. For this reason it was arguable that theemployers in the shipbuilding and engineering industries werefollowing too uncompromising a policy and that they should be readyto concede the modest increase in wages which was likely to be awarded if the dispute went to arbitration. On the other hand itwas argued that, sooner or later, a firm stand would have to betaken on a wages demand, and the employers in these industries had decided that this was the right time to make that stand.Although their representatives would probably accept the principleof arbitration, it was doubtful whether they could be persuaded totake the further step of offering now a specific figure, however modest,for an increase in wages. They might, however, feel able toundertake, in accepting the principle of arbitration, to give effect tothe award of the arbitrator; and a statement to this effect might make some contribution towards easing the tension in the dispute. Itwould, however, be necessary to consider their probable reactionif the Transport Commission offered a wage increase higher thanthat awarded at arbitration, and this aspect of the inter-connection between the disputes in the two groups of industries would need to be handled with particular care.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion at a later meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,14th March, 1957.
