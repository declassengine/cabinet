Libya. 2.   The Foreign Secretary said discussions with a United States(Previous        delegation on our future policy towards Libya were due to beginReference:      that day.   Our treaty with Libya no longer had a military valueCM. (56) 46th  commensurate with our present commitment to subsidise the LibyanConclusions,    Government at the rate of some  12 millions a year.  Recent eventsMinute 9.)       had tended, however, to alienate Libya from Egypt; and there werepolitical advantages in not withdrawing entirely our support of the libyan Government.  He hoped that we should still find it possibleto retain in Libya forces sufficient to uphold the authority of thepresent pro-Western Government, to safeguard our continuinginterest in air-staging facilities, and to demonstrate that we did not intend to allow a vacuum to develop in that country.  For the restit would be reasonable to look to the United States to assume the major responsibility for providing financial support for Libya, andfor building up its armed forces to an appropriate level.  We mightbe able to help by providing some equipment;   but we couldnot accept any commitment in relation to the recurrent costs of the libyan armed forces, nor could we offer the Libyan government financial assistance towards creating a Libyan air force.   our commitment might be reduced to a sum of the order of  2 millions.The Prime Minister said that it was important that in presentcircumstances we should not create the impression of withdrawingentirely from the Middle East. On the other hand, as it was evidentthat we could no longer expect to use Libya as a base for operationselsewhere in the Middle East, our commitment should be reducedto the minimum necessary to safeguard our essential needs in north africa. The discussions with the United States delegation shouldbe directed accordingly.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in general agreementwith this view.The Cabinet-Invited  the Foreign  Secretary  to  be guided,  in  thenegotiations with the United States delegation, by the views expressed in their discussion.Jordan.(Previous&apos; Reference:CM. (57) 1stConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Foreign Secretary said that it now seemed possible thatSaudi Arabia might.be willing to give some financial support toJordan. In order to avoid the embarrassment to which we should be exposed if, as a result, Jordan unilaterally repudiated the Anglo-Jordan Treaty, he proposed to inform the Jordan Government thatwe had taken note of their desire to terminate the Treaty; that,recalling our past friendship with Jordan, we were anxious that our future relations with her should be such as to consolidate andto promote that friendship; and that we were ready to open the Cabinet. j.   The Prime Minister said that at this first meeting of theCabinet under the new Administration he would like to express hisgratitude for the long and loyal service of old colleagues who would no longer be sharing in their counsels. Above all he would likeonce more to voice his deep regret at the resignation of their formerleader, Sir Anthony Eden. Few men had suffered more grievouspolitical misfortune; but his fame and reputation would stand higheras time passed and events were seen in their true perspective.The Cabinet endorsed these sentiments and asked the PrimeMinister to send on their behalf a message of affection and gratitude to Sir Anthony Eden.The Prime Minister extended a warm welcome to Ministers whowere for the first time attending as members of the Cabinet.
Europe.(previous reference:CM. (57) 3rdConclusions.)4. The Foreign Secretary said that, in a recent discussion withthe Foreign Minister of Belgium, he had emphasised that any closerpolitical association between the United Kingdom and Europe must depend on the outcome of the current discussions about our membership of a free trade area in Europe. M. Spaak had, however,informed him that the French Government were now determined todevelop as rapidly as possible a capacity to manufacture nuclear weapons, with the result that EURATOM would be liable to developon military, as well as on civil, lines. The other members of the potential common market in Europe were alarmed by this possibilityand by the risk that Western Germany would follow such a lead by france. M. Spaak proposed, therefore, to take an early opportunityof warning the United States Government of these developments.In discussion it was suggested that the United States reaction toEURATOM, which had hitherto been favourable, would be liable to change for the worse if the organisation assumed a military character.On the other hand it might be possible to turn United States anxietyon this score to good account in the context of disarmament and ofthe reappraisal of defence policy which was currently being conducted by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider the best means of approaching the United States Government about the implications of the developments in Europe reported by theForeign Minister of Belgium.Aden.Security of the protectorate.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 48thConclusions,Minute 1.)5. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet of repeatedviolations of the frontier of the Aden Protectorate by Yemeni troops and tribesmen. He had been considering whether it would be in our interest to take the initiative in referring this matter to the security council, and proposing that the United Nations should stationobservers on the frontier to assist in keeping the peace and should help in delineating the frontier itself. The Government of the Yemenhad now, however, notified the Security Council that they reservedtheir right to ask for action towards a settlement of the dispute, andto this extent the initiative had passed out of our hands. It was forconsideration whether we should now confine ourselves to stating our case in the Security Council and refrain from putting forward thesuggestion that United Nations observers should be stationed on thefrontier. The risk of making this suggestion was that, owing to thenature of the treaties On which we relied, our title as the protecting power might be called in question.ediscussions on the future of our Treaty relationship with Jordan.H.M. Ambassador at Amman had advised that, in view of the trend of public opinion in Jordan, we might be more likely to gain than toforfeit goodwill by bringing to an end the existing arrangementsgoverning the payment of subsidy and the disposition of troops and maintaining only our financial contribution to Jordan&apos;s development programme.In discussion there was general agreement that we should nowapproach the Government of Jordan on these lines, on the under-standing that no further instalment of subsidy would be paid untilthe probable outcome of the discussions was clear.The Cabinet-Authorised the Foreign Secretary to send a communication to the Government of Jordan on the lines proposed.
Middle East. 6.   The Foreign Secretary said that the Iraq Petroleum CompanyTour by        were arranging for six Members of Parliament, representing theMembers of     Government and the Opposition Parties, to make a tour of the MiddleParliament.      East, which would start at Beirut and would include a number of places in the Persian Gulf. There was no means of preventing such a tour, but the Cabinet should be aware that it involved some risk ofembarrassing incidents.In discussion the point was made that a disproportionate numberof Members of Parliament had recently visited Israel or were due togo there shortly. This proposed tour of Arab countries would do something to redress the balance, and the Iraq Petroleum company would no doubt be amenable to representations that the itineraryshould be arranged in such a way as to reduce the risk of incidentsto a minimum.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements.The Parliamentary Undersecretary of State for the colonies said that the frontier between the Aden &quot;Protectorate and the Yemenwas based on an agreement with the Turkish Government at the endof the First World War which had never been recognised by the imam of the Yemen. Moreover, some of the treaties negotiated inthe nineteenth century with the local sheikhs in the Protectorate wereinformal in character; and, while the majority of the present sheikhscould be expected to remain loyal if doubt was cast on the validity ofthese treaties, there were some who might seize the opportunity toattempt to renounce their connection with the United Kingdom. Thepossible precedent for similar action in the case of our otherProtectorate Treaties, e.g., with Uganda and Somaliland, could bevery damaging. Discussions with representatives of the Yemen were due to take place shortly on the delineation of the frontier; and,although it was unlikely that these would yield any useful result, theproposal to appoint United Nations observers should be deferred until they had been completed.In discussion it was suggested that, while it was doubtfulwhether United Nations observers would be able to fulfil any satisfactory function in such difficult and mountainous country,public opinion was likely to press for their appointment. It might therefore be wise to inform the Security Council that, while we intended to discuss the delineation of the frontier with theGovernment of the Yemen, we should welcome the help of united nations observers in preventing hostilities in the region of whateverfrontier was finally agreed. An invitation to appoint observers forthis limited purpose should preclude any attempt by the united nations to take part in the definition of the frontier or to examine ourtitle to the territory which we occupied, while at the same timeenabling us to retain some initiative before the Security Council. Theadvice of our representative at the United Nations and of theGovernor of Aden should be sought on this course.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theParliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies,to seek the advice of the United Kingdom Representative atthe United Nations and of the Governor of Aden on thedesirability of inviting the Security Council to appointobservers to visit the Aden Protectorate on the basissuggested in discussion.
Kashmir. 7.   The Commonwealth Secretary recalled that the agreement(Previous        reached in the United Nations in 1948-49, whereby the future statusReference:      of Kashmir would be determined by a plebiscite, had been frustratedCM. (56) 104th by the disputes for which India was largely responsible about theConclusions,    timing of military withdrawals, and that all later attempts atMinute 10.)      mediation had ended in failure.   The constituent assembly ofKashmir had now passed a resolution purporting to accept theinclusion of Kashmir in India. This resolution was inconsistent withthe earlier affirmation of the Security Council that, pending the plebiscite, the constituent assembly was not authorised to reach any decision on the future status of Kashmir.   Pakistan had thereforeraised the issue afresh in the Security Council, and we had undertaken to support her in doing so.  We could rely on the United States andother friendly Governments in the Security Council to associate themselves with us; but India would undoubtedly take offence at our attitude.Thereafter a resolution might be introduced in the security council, proposing afresh that a plebiscite should be organised inKashmir and that a United Nations force should be despatched to supervise it. It would be desirable that this force should beestablished in Kashmir, and that the Indian and Pakistani troops should be withdrawn well in advance of the plebiscite itself. Pakistanhad already offered to withdraw her troops; but a plebiscite wouldbe liable to provoke acute communal strife in India, and the indian government would probably oppose it by every possible means.In discussion there was general agreement that this question should be handled in the Security Council in strict conformity withthe established procedure of the United Nations and that, although we ourselves should not take the lead in the discussion, we should support an initiative, preferably sponsored by some other country, onthe lines indicated by the Commonwealth Secretary.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theCommonwealth Secretary, to inform the United kingdom representative at the United Nations of the views expressedin the Cabinefs discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,15th January, 1957.
