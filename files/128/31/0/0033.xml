Parliament. .1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the week hefore the adjournment ofParliament for the Easter recess on 18th April.Public Service 2. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the SecretarySalaries. of State for Scotland and the Minister of Health (C. (57) 89) and by(Previous the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (57) 90) submitting alternativeReferences: proposals for an interim increase in the remuneration of doctors and cc. (57) 17th   dentists in the National Health Service.Conclusions, The Minister of Health said that it would be justifiable to offerMmutel and the doctors, whose remuneration had remained stationary for overC (57) -Oth gye ygarS; a more favourable interim adjustment than 5 per cent., and conclusions, award of 1\ per cent, which he proposed would probably proveMinute 5.) to be well within the settlement which the Royal Commission wouldRemuneration eventually recommend. While some sections of the medicalof Doctors and profession would not be influenced in their opposition to the RoyalDentists. Commission by any temporary award, the more moderate elementswere ready to reach a satisfactory interim settlement which wouldenable the profession to collaborate in the work of the RoyalCommission. An interim increase of 74 per cent, would reinforce theauthority of these moderate sections of opinion; but it was impossibleto forecast whether even this higher figure would be a decisive factor in dissuading the doctors from withdrawing from the National health service. If an increase of 1\ per cent, was approved, there would be considerable advantage in allowing the distribution of this award tobe settled by discussion with the profession.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, if, in preference toappointing a Royal Commission, the Government had decided tonegotiate with the doctors, a final settlement of their claim on thebasis of an award of 7.a per cent, might well have been achieved. Tooffer this figure as an interim award would therefore be liable to prejudice the work of the Royal Commission, and the ultimatesettlement of the doctors&apos; claim might prove correspondingly more costly. Moderate opinion among the doctors would be placated byan interim award of any kind. But the more extreme elements in the profession would not be won over by the difference between 5 percent, and 1\ per cent., and the higher figure would make it necessary: to reopen the recent settlement of the remuneration of universitystaffs and would provoke new claims for corresponding benefits fromother quarters. The doctors were already enjoying a greater increase over their pre-war remuneration than any other comparableprofession, and they would derive considerable benefits from theBudget. For all these reasons he considered that the interim awardshould be confined to an increase of 5 per cent.In discussion it was emphasised that any offer to discuss withthe doctors the distribution of any interim award should not appearto imply a departure from the Governments previous decision notto prejudice the deliberations of the Royal Commission by entering into separate negotiations with the profession. A more limitedundertaking to consider any suggestions which the doctors might wish to submit should suffice to ensure that the final decision on thedistribution of the interim award would remain with the Government.A suitable formula to establish this point should be agreed with theChairman of the Royal Commission.On the amount of the interim increase the Cabinet agreed thatan award of 1\ per cent, could not easily be justified, particularly inview of the risk that it might provoke a re-opening of the interimaward of 10 per cent, already granted to the junior hospital grades.On the other hand, the arguments for and against an interim increaseof 6 per cent, as opposed to 5 per cent, were more evenly balanced.The remuneration of doctors had not been increased since 1951; and51460-17 b 2
there might be advantage, particularly in relation to industrial wages,in seeking to avoid the emergence of a uniform pattern of increases of 5 per cent, in remuneration and in appearing to discriminate in the size of the awards granted to the various sections of the communitywhose pay was adjusted at different periods and by reference to different considerations. Moreover, the majority of doctors wouldnot derive substantial benefit from the Budget. On the other hand,they enjoyed exceptionally favourable treatment in terms of incometax, and the real value of their remuneration must be interpreted inthe light of this relief. It was unlikely that the difference between an increase of 5 per cent, and an increase of 6 per cent, would materially affect their attitude, which was dominated by their determination to maintain, if possible, the principles of remunerationprescribed in the reports of the Spens Committee; and an increaseof 6 per cent, might be interpreted as a new minimum wage level, of universal application throughout the wage structure. If so, anyattempt to hold wages at their present levels would be frustrated.The Cabinet next considered the question of other public servicesalaries.Judicial Salaries. The Lord Chancellor said that a settlement of the claims of thelower judiciary was now seriously overdue, and it would be inexpedient to grant an interim award to the doctors withoutannouncing at the same time the Governmenfs intention to giveeffect to the settlement which had already been agreed for county court judges, metropolitan magistrates, and comparable members ofthe judiciary. Their remuneration had not been increased since 1952,and even when the new settlement had been brought into operationit would still reflect a smaller increase over pre-war emoluments thanthe doctors were already enjoying before any interim award wasmade.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it would be convenient to put into effect, at the same time as the Governmenfs proposals forthe doctors and the lower judiciary were announced, the recom-mendations of the Coleraine Committee for a further adjustment inthe pay of certain civil servants. This could be done without legislation and no announcement need be made. It would also bedesirable to introduce, at an appropriate moment, the necessary legislation to increase the salary of the Comptroller and Auditor-General in the light of the recommendations of the PriestleyCommittee.The Prime Minister said that the arguments in relation to the interim award to the doctors were very evenly balanced as between an increase of 5 per cent, and an increase of 6 per cent. The cabinet would need to give further consideration to the issues involved before reaching a final decision. It might be desirable, however, that theannouncement which he had undertaken to make before the easter recess should deal both with the interim award to the doctors andwith the settlement of the claims of the lower judiciary, and should present the increases in each case in terms of a comparison of the resultant remuneration with the remuneration received before thewar. By illustrating the advantage which the incomes of doctorswould still retain over another typical group of professional incomes,this should put the doctors&apos; claims in their true perspective.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed to defer until their next meeting their decision onthe amount of the interim increase in remuneration to be awarded to doctors and dentists serving in the national health Service.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister ofHealth, after consultation with the Chairman of the RoyalCommission, to draft a formula defining the extent to
which the Government would be prepared to considersuggestions from the doctors about the distribution of the interim award.(3) Agreed in principle that legislation should be introduced, atan appropriate moment, to give effect to increases in remuneration for the lower judiciary and for the comptroller and Auditor-General.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to decide, inconsultation with the Ministers concerned, the timing ofthe action to be taken under Conclusion (3) above.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Housing (C. (57) 92) recommending that the applicationof the Manchester Corporation to acquire a substantial area ofagricultural land at Lymm in Cheshire for housing purposes should now be submitted to a public enquiry.The Minister of Housing said that the Manchester corporation had recently presented this application afresh and had convincedhim that they had fully carried out the obligation imposed on themin 1954 to seek alternative sites for housing development. He was satisfied that a considerable proportion of the alternative sites whichwere theoretically available to meet Manchester&apos;s needs would eitherprove, in the event, not to be available or would not be under the effective control of the Corporation. Although the applicationinvolved a direct conflict between the interests of agriculture andthose of housing, Manchester had one of the worst problems of slum clearance in the country, and, if the Cabinet upheld their previous decision to reject the application to develop the site at Lymm, theCorporation might ask the Government to relieve them of their housing responsibilities. A decision which would be politicallyacceptable could not be reached until the facts had been clearlyestablished by means of a public enquiry into the whole problemof Manchester&apos;s housing problem and all the possible solutionswhich might be proposed. In this exceptional case there would be advantage in arranging that the enquiry should be conducted not by an official of the Ministry of Housing but by an &quot; independent&quot;inspector, and that his report should be published.The Minister of Agriculture said that he was bound to resist the diversion of first-class agricultural land to housing if suitablealternative land, of less agricultural value, could be made availablefor this purpose. He remained unconvinced that the manchester corporation had explored every possible solution of their problem and, unless their application to develop Lymm were rejected, theywould have no compelling incentive to do so. The application todevelop the site at Lymm had given rise to acute political controversy,which would be exacerbated by a public enquiry. Both for thisreason and on the merits of the case it would be desirable for theCabinet to endorse their earlier decision and, by rejectingManchester&apos;s application for the time being, to induce theCorporation to make a further effort to discover alternative housingsites in the next few years.The Lord Chancellor said that, as Chairman of a Committee ofMinisters who had previously examined this matter, he had formed the conclusion that Manchester would be able to obtain enough sitesto allow.building to proceed at the rate of 3,000 houses a year from1961 to 1967. Whether this forecast would need to be modified inthe light of the new evidence now brought forward could not bedetermined without further investigation.The Prime Minister said that, in view of the difficult issues involved, it would be helpful if the Committee of Ministers who had previously considered this matter would examine it again in the lightof the further evidence now available.
r- 6The Cabinet Invited the Lord Chancellor to re-convene the Committeeof Ministers who had investigated this matter earlier, toconsider whether .the application ;of the manchester corporation to acquire the proposed site at Lymm might appropriately be submitted to a public enquiry; and, if so,what form such an enquiry might best take.Suez Canal. 4.   The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Ormsby-Gore)(Previous        said  that  the further  discussion  between  the   United   states reference:      Ambassador in Cairo and the Egyptian Government, which was to.(57) 32nd   have been the prelude to the initiation of a debate in the SecurityConclusions,    Council, had not yet taken place.  In view of the sequence of actionMinute 1.)      which the Cabinet had approved as our objective, it was desirablethat we should maintain pressure on the United States Governmentto secure that this discussion took place as rapidly as possible; andit would be helpful, from this point of view, if the United StatesState Department could now be informed in confidence about theproposed means of payment of Canal dues by United Kingdomshipping which we urgently needed to discuss with the egyptian authorities.In discussion it was agreed that we should still seek to securethat the Executive Group of the Suez Canal Users&apos; Association(S.C.U.A.) should meet for a confidential discussion on the12th April; that the Security Council should meet not later thanthe 15 th April for a discussion of the need for interim arrangementsfor the payment of Canal dues; that the Council of S.C.U.A. should meet on .16th or 17th April to agree the interim payment of dues;and that, at that point, the Bank of England should be authorisedto open discussions with the National Bank of Egypt about theproposal that dues should be paid by United Kingdom shipping intransferable sterling through a new No. 3 Account. It was desirablethat these steps should, if possible, be taken in rapid succession.Shipowners were already pressing for instructions about the meansof payment of Canal dues; and it would be indefensible if arrangements for this purpose had not been made by the time thatthe Government announced the end of petrol rationing, if theCabinet approved that course.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs(Mr. Ormsby-Gore) to instruct H.M. Ambassador in washington to make representations to the United StatesGovernment on the lines agreed in their discussion, andto inform the United States State Department, in strict confidence, of the proposals about the payment of canal dues by British shipping which we needed urgently tonegotiate with the Egyptian authorities.Jordan. 5.   The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that the(Previous        Prime Minister of Jordan had resigned and the position ofReference:      King Hussein was insecure.  The King had apparently appealed forCC.(57) 17th   assistance to the Government of Iraq; and the Prime Minister of conclusions,    Iraq, who was anxious to take this opportunity to establish closerMinute 7.)      co-operation with the Government of Saudi Arabia in opposing the emergence of Communist tendencies in Jordan and in giving support to King Hussein, had asked for our views and advice. In consideringour reply we must recognise that the continued existence of Jordancould no longer be taken for granted and that there was a risk thatthe neighbouring States, including Israel, might attempt to divide
Oil&apos;Supplies. 6.   The Minister of Power said that, now that the&apos;supplementary(Previous        tax on petrol had been withdrawn, it would be desirable that petrolReference:      rationing should be brought to an: end at the&quot; conclusion of theC.C. (57) 20th   rationing period on 16th April.  Supplies during, the second quarterConclusions,     would amount to about 92 per cent, of probable demand, whileMinute 1.)      stocks were equivalent to about eight weeks&apos; consumption.  Even ifwe were denied the use of the Suez Canal&apos;; it should be possible tosatisfy unrestricted demand until August before&apos;- stocks- declinedtowards the minimum operational level.  If by that date we had notresumed the use of the Canal, it would be possible to re-imposerationing.   In present circumstances, however, the growing publicpressure for the end of rationing, combined with the formaldeclaration by the Egyptian Government that the Canal was open,would make it increasingly difficult to maintain rationing for verymuch longer.   The restriction on the supply of fuel oil should beretained until stocks had been rebuilt.In discussion considerable doubts were expressed about the wisdom of ending petrol rationing at the present moment. It was open to question whether such action would be interpreted by publicopinion as a sign of strength or of weakness. We could not yet tellwhether we should be able, as a result of the proposed proceedings inthe Security Council and the Suez Canal Users&apos; Association to achieve a satisfactory settlement with the Egyptian Government. Nor could we foresee what further demands they might make for example, theremoval of restrictions on the Egyptian sterling balances or thepayment of compensation for damage sustained during theAnglo-French operation as the price of their permission for UnitedKingdom shipping to use the Suez Canal. Moreover, the satisfactorylevel of our stocks of petrol reflected mainly the help which we hadreceived from the United States. But it was doubtful whether theUnited States Government would view favourably a decision on our part to end petrol rationing at this juncture; and, in any case, thepurchase of petrol from the Western Hemisphere imposed a heavythe Kingdom between them. It might be advisable, therefore, to warn the Government of Israel to refrain from precipitate action. Itmight also become necessary to consider urgently the position of theBritish forces still in Jordan.In discussion it was&apos; agreed, that these developments might present a serious.&quot; threat to; our&apos; interests in the Middle East. Inparticular, if general hostilities broke out as a result of the collapse of the Kingdom of Jordan, the oil pipeline through Syria might once more be damaged; and this should&apos; be taken into account inconnection&apos;with the proposal to end petrol rationing. Moreover, ifthe territorial integrity of Jordan could not be preserved, it wouldbe in our interests that Iraq should take the opportunity to strengthenand extend her influence m the area. On the other hand, the claims of Saudi Arabia might be supported by the United States. It wouldbe desirable therefore that we should seek to concert urgently withthe United States Government the reply to the request from the iraqi government for advice on the desirability of intervention by iraq and Saudi Arabia in support of King Hussein. It might also be advisable to concert With the United States Government the terms ofthe&apos; proposed warning: to the Government of Israel.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs(Mr: Ormsby-Gore) to&apos; instruct&apos; H:M. Ambassador in washington to discuss with the United&apos;States Government,as a matter of urgency, the situation Which was developingin Jordan and to seek to concert with them the action which each of the two Governments should take..
strain on our balance of payments which it might become necessaryto relieve by maintaining restrictions on the consumption of petrol ifit proved impossible to allow British shipping to resume use of the suez Canal. It was unlikely, in any event, that public opinion in thiscountry expected petrol rationing to be brought to an end at a mount when the Budget Speech had clearly forecast its continuancefor at least some weeks and coupons were still being distributed inrespect of the second rationing period.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at a subsequent meeting.british transport commission.London Fares.(previous reference :CM. (56) 53rdConclusions,Minute 7.)7. The Minister of Transport said that the withdrawal of the supplementary tax on petrol implied that the legal basis for thetemporary increases in bus fares would lapse within 14 days, andthat the minimum London fare would then fall from 3d. to 2\d. TheTransport Commission^ costs had, however, risen appreciablyduring the period in which the supplementary tax had been in force,partly as a result of the recent wage settlement. The commission would therefore need to apply forthwith to the Transport tribunal for authority to increase fares, including an immediate increase of the2\d. London fare to 3d. Any other increases granted by the tribunal would not, however, be implemented until the autumn. In taking this course, the Transport Commission would be merely discharging their statutory duty, and there were no grounds on which theGovernment could seek to dissuade them for a further period fromseeking authority for the necessary increase in the minimum Londonfare to 3d.In discussion it was agreed that there could be no objection tothe Transport Commission making the proposed application to theTransport Tribunal provided that it was made clear that the case forthe increase in the minimum London fare rested mainly on the recent increase in wages.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,11th April, 1957.
