remuneration of Doctors and dentists.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 16thConclusions,Minute 6.)1. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that The Queenhad been pleased to approve the appointment of Sir Harry Pilkingtonas Chairman of the proposed Royal Commission on the pay of doctors and dentists. He proposed to announce this appointment,and the names of the other members of the Royal Commission, inthe House of Commons that afternoon. He also proposed to announce that the Government had decided, as an interimadjustment, to increase the pay of junior members of hospital staffsby 10 per cent, from 1st April, and were considering whatcorresponding interim adjustment would be justified in the pay ofother doctors and dentists covered by the Commission^ terms ofreference. A further announcement on this subject would bepromised in due course.He had meanwhile explained to the representatives of the doctors and dentists that the adjustment in pay which theGovernment were considering for doctors and dentists not coveredby the award to junior staffs would not be deferred to await anyinterim report by the Royal Commission. He hoped that, as a result,moderate counsels would now prevail and that the two professionswould collaborate in the work of the Royal Commission. A furtherannouncement might be made before the Easter recess, awardingan interim increase of possibly 5 per cent, to those doctors and dentists who would not benefit from the award to junior staffs.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would make a statement in the House of Commons that afternoon, in the terms which he had outlined, on the pay of doctors and dentists.Parliament.2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Defence Policy. 3.   The Prime Minister briefly informed the Cabinet of the(Previous provisional  conclusions   on  the  future  size,  organisation  and reference: equipment of the Armed Forces which had been reached by aC.C.

These conclusions would be reflected in the Statement on Defence,1957, which the Cabinet would shortly be asked to consider.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Ministers statement.NaclearWeapons Tests.(previous reference:CM. (56) 74thConclusions,Minute 6.)4. The Foreign Secretary said that the more extreme elements of public opinion, both at home and abroad, appeared to bemobilising in opposition to the next nuclear weapons test which wewere now planning. If this test was frustrated, the effect on our programme of research and development would be serious. It would therefore be desirable, not only to accelerate the test as much aspossible, but also to make further improvements in the safetyprecautions to be observed and to give the Japanese Governmentsufficient information to allay their anxiety. It might also benecessary to adopt a rather more generous attitude as regardscompensation for any loss or damage which could reasonably be attributed to the tests.The Cabinet agreed that the arrangements for conducting thenext test of nuclear weapons should be reviewed as a matter of urgency. It would also be necessary to consider whether, as anadditional means of allaying public disquiet, facilities should be accorded to representatives of the Press to witness the test.   Care
British Forces 5.   The Foreign Secretary said that, in the discussions whichin Europe. the Prime Minister and he had held in Paris, the attitude of French(Previous Ministers had been unsympathetic to our proposal to reduce the reference:       strength of our forces in Europe.  Even if, with the goodwill of theC.C. (57) 15th    Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, and the Secretary-General of conclusions,     the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) the process of minute 1.)        consultation in NATO was concluded in the next few days, theFrench Government would probably attempt to frustrate our proposal by tabling a resolution in the resumed discussions in theWestern European Union (W.E.U.). We should make no concession in advance, in the hope that the other members of W.E.U. might be suffiently well disposed to enable us to secure the consent of W.E.U.to our proposals without modification.   It might, however, benecessary to offer, at some stage, to limit the scope of the presentdecision to the withdrawal planned for 1957-58 and to discussafresh, later in the year, the extent of the withdrawal in 1958-59.This offer should, however, be held in reserve for the present.In discussion there was general agreement that, while we mustadhere to our intention to reduce our forces in Europe, we should seek to present this decision in a way which would cause leastembarrassment to the French Government who would shortly be faced with a critical debate in the National Assembly. Moreover, the paris Agreements and the current plans for the closer association ofthis country with Europe in a Free Trade Area had given greatencouragement to our friends throughout Europe, and a faultypresentation of the withdrawal of British forces might do serious damage to our relations with European countries generally. Weshould therefore spare no effort to avoid a vote against us in W.E.U.,which would leave us no alternative to breaking the W.E.U. treaty in order to give effect to our policy.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to instruct our representatives at NATO and W.E.U. to be guided, in the debates aboutthe reduction of our forces in Europe, by the considerationsnoted in their discussion.Congress for 6.   The Foreign Secretary said that he had given further thoughtRights and to the request by the Congress for Rights and Freedom in Russia forFreedom in permission to hold a meeting in this country. He proposed to informRussia. the Congress that there was no legal barrier to international(Previous conferences being arranged in this country, provided that theyReference: involved no threat to the maintenance of law and order.

Jordan.(previous reference:CC. (57) 10thConclusions,Minute 6.)5 CC. 17 (57)7. The Foreign Secretary said that the negotiations forterminating the Anglo-Jordan Treaty would probably be concludedon the basis of an agreement whereby we would remove part of ourstores but would hand over to the Jordan Government all fixedinstallations, transfer to them equipment which we lent them someyears ago together with a quantity of ammunition, and cancel an outstanding debt of about  1^ millions. In addition, we shouldnotionally pay to the Government of Jordan the February instalment of the subsidy under the Treaty, but should make no payment in,or after, March. The Jordan Government, for their part, would payus million in May and thereafter  \ million each half year forthe next four years. In all, they would pay us an amount between 4 and  4^ millions. In the circumstances this represented the bestsettlement we could hope to achieve and might be regarded as a relatively cheap price for the termination of our obligations underthe Treaty.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement.Suez Canal.(previous reference:CC. (57) 14thConclusions,Minute 3.)8. The Foreign Secretary said that the Egyptian Governmenthad so far made no reply to the letter from the Secretary-General ofthe United Nations outlining a possible basis for an interimadministration of the Suez Canal. Meanwhile we were continuingour efforts to persuade the United States Government to indicate howfar they were prepared, in the event of Egyptian recalcitrance, to bringfinancial pressure to bear on the Egyptian Government to secure asatisfactory settlement.The Minister of Transport said that there was some risk that theEgyptian Government would declare the Canal open before anyinterim agreement for its administration had been reached. british shipping interests would expect to be advised what policy they should then pursue, and it might be advisable to suggest to them that theyshould initially confine themselves to seeking assurances aboutnavigational safety and the adequacy of the technical facilities along the Canal. They should not, however, be drawn into any discussion about the payment of Canal dues or a possible boycott of the Canal.The Prime Minister said that, while it might be possible to gaina little time in this way, the Cabinet would shortly need to takemajor decisions about our policy as regards use of the Suez Canal.For this purpose it would be helpful if Ministers could have a factualstatement including the extent to which we relied upon the Canal,the amount likely to be involved in the payment of dues, and the degree of control over British ship-owners which the Governmentcould exercise in the last resort.The Cabinet Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to arrange, as amatter of urgency, for the preparation of a comprehensivefactual memorandum about British use of the Suez Canal,on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister.Israel.(previous reference:CC. (57) 15thConclusions,Minute 2.)9. The Foreign Secretary said that the Egyptian government appeared to have decided to resume administration of the Gaza Strip.Cairo Radio had also announced that Egypt would continue toexercise belligerent rights in the Gulf of Aqaba. This could be interpreted as meaning that the Egyptian Government regardedthemselves as still at war with Israel; and in that event Israel wouldbe entitled to attempt to reoccupy the Gaza Strip by force.   We
were seeking to obtain from the United States Government a clearerstatement than they had so far vouchsafed in public about the actionwhich they would be prepared to take in order to establish freedomof navigation through the Gulf of Aqaba.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.industrial relations.(previous reference :CM. (55) 29thConclusions,Minute 2.)10. The Minister of Labour said that the wages dispute betweenthe British Transport Commission (B.T.C.) and the National Unionof Railwaymen (N.U.R.) had been submitted to arbitration after theN.U.R. had rejected the B.T.C&apos;s offer of an increase of 3-1- per cent.There was some risk that the arbitration tribunal might award anincrease of no more than 3 per cent., in which case the N.U.R. would undoubtedly reject the award and call a strike.In the shipbuilding industry the employers, in rejecting the claim for a wage increase of 10 per cent., were invoking the government&apos;s policy of wage restraint, and the unions therefore regarded theirthreat of a strike as a direct challenge to the Government. Theywould probably give effect to this threat, and there was some risk that the strike would extend to other industries. Since the partiesto the dispute had reached their respective attitudes after prolongednegotiation, the normal conciliation machinery of the Ministry ofLabour could make no contribution towards a settlement. Equally,since the causes of the dispute were clear, the issue was not appropriate for examination by a court of inquiry. The only hopeof a solution lay in referring the dispute to arbitration. LordEvershed, if he would accept appointment, would be a wholly suitablearbitrator. But, even if the employers reluctantly acquiesced in this procedure, it was unlikely that the unions would accept it. In that case, a serious and protracted strike appeared to be unavoidable.The Cabinet then discussed the draft of a statement in whichthe Minister of Labour proposed to announce, that day, the reference of the dispute to an arbitrator. There was general agreement that theGovernment should stand firm on the policy outlined in that statement and should take no action which could be interpreted bythe employers as implying that the need for wage restraint was anyless than hitherto. It was essential that the Governments case should be presented clearly and convincingly to public opinion, whichmight be expected to support the simple proposition that, even if two parties could not agree on the settlement of a dispute, they should at least be prepared to accept the ruling of an impartial arbitrator.It was also important to emphasise that, although in the circum-stances of this particular dispute something other than the normalconciliation action of the Ministry of Labour was required, thefacilities for conciliation remained at the disposal of the employersand the unions.In further discussion it was emphasised that, if the disputedeveloped into a general strike, its economic effects would be verydamaging, particularly in terms of the impact on the balance ofpayments and on foreign confidence in sterling. The more moderateelements of opinion in the Trades Union Congress should, if possible,be enlisted in support of the Governments policy; and it would be helpful if the forthcoming award to the railwaymen was such as to diminish the risk of a strike on the railways as well. In the meantime the administrative machinery for dealing with situations of emergency should be brought into readiness.
The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Labour to announce in the House ofCommons that day, in terms of the draft statement asamended in discussion, the Governments intention toappoint an arbitrator in the wages dispute in the shipbuilding industry.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for an early meetingof the Emergencies Committee to consider what action might be needed if the present industrial disputes resultedin widespread strikes.11. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Power (C. (57) 63) about pensions increases for pensionersof the gas and electricity industries who, before nationalisation, were employed by private companies.The Minister of Power said that, on nationalisation, both the gasand electricity industries had assumed responsibility for pensionerspreviously employed by municipal undertakings and private companies. The pensioners previously employed by the former, butnot the latter, type of undertaking had been entitled to the benefitsconferred by the various Pensions (Increase) Acts of recent years. Itwas difficult to defend such a distinction, and he was under pressure to extend the benefits of the most recent Pensions (Increase) Act of1956 to ex-company employees. The cost of doing so would amountto only  170,000 for the gas industry and  50,000 for the electricity industry. But pressure must then be expected for a correspondingimprovement in the pensions of former employees of other industries which had been nationalised, particularly the railway services.The Minister of Transport said that, following the passage of earlier Pensions (Increase) Acts, the British Transport commission had increased on an ex gratia basis the pensions of the salariedpensioners of the former railway companies who were excluded fromthe National Insurance Scheme. If the benefits of the Act of 1956were now extended to the ex-company pensioners of the gas and electricity industries, it would probably be necessary to make afurther award, at the cost of an additional  650,000, to the salariedpensioners of the railways, and it would be difficult to resist the pressure which would then be exerted to secure an increase in thepensions of the retired wage-earning employees of these companies.The cost of a concession to this further claim would exceed  1 million,and in view of the present financial position of the transport commission it might be necessary for the Government to make thenecessary regulations without the consent of the Commission.It was the general view of the Cabinet that it was no longer possible to differentiate between the claims of the two types of pensioners in the gas and electricity industries, even if this ultimatelyinvolved extending corresponding treatment to the salaried pensionersof the former railway companies. There was, however, nocomparable justification for conferring on the wage-earning staffs ofthese companies the benefits of the Pensions (Increase) Acts.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was in agreementwith this view, although the expected pressure on behalf of thesalaried pensioners of the former railway companies should be resisted for as long as possible.
The Cabinet Agreed that the benefit of the Pensions (Increase) Act of1956 should be extended to the ex-company pensioners ofthe nationalised gas and electricity industries, and there-after, if necessary, to the salaried pensioners of the formerrailway companies.12. The Cabinet had before them a note, circulated by theMinister of Agriculture at the meeting, indicating the price changes which, in agreement with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, he had offered the farmers&apos; unions.The Minister of Agriculture said that a settlement with the farmers appeared to be possible on the basis of this schedule of price changes, provided that the Government would concede, in addition,an increase of one farthing per gallon for milk. The total cost of theprice review would, on this basis, be about  14  millions, of which 12 millions would fall on the Exchequer and  2^ millions on theconsumer. As a result, the price of milk would have to be maintained at Sd. a pint for rather longer during the summer than had originally been envisaged; but the additional farthing per gallon for milk wasa concession which, however indefensible economically, was ofpolitical significance as a symbol of the Governmenfs concern for theinterests of the small farmer.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that a settlement on thebasis suggested by the Minister of Agriculture would increase the costof agricultural subsidies as a whole in 1957-58 by some  35 millions.Moreover, a concession of an extra farthing per gallon for milk would represent a retreat from the Government^ earlier decision on thispoint, for which no economic justification could be advanced. Itwould be indefensible to maintain the price of milk at Sd. per pintwhile, at the same time, giving further artificial stimulus to theproduction of milk.The Home Secretary said that it would be unwise to jeopardise the possibility of an agreed settlement with the farmers for the sake of an extra farthing per gallon of milk. Alternatively, however, someother form of additional assistance for the small farmer (e.g., anincrease in the subsidy for oats or a subsidy for the production ofsilage) might preserve the new relation between the Government andthe farmers and maintain the productive impetus in agriculture.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were reluctant to envisagean increase in the subsidy for milk and were initially disposed to favour a subsidy for the production of silage if a satisfactory settlement could be achieved on this basis and the administrative difficulties could be overcome. The balance of the considerations involved, however, required further examination.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of this question later that day.Farm price review.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 16thConclusions,Minute 4.)
