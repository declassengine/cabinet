1843CC. 24 (57)Cyprus.(previous reference:CC. (57) 23rdConclusions,Minute 4.)industrial disputes.(previous reference:CC. (57) 23rdConclusions,Minute 3.)1. The Home Secretary said that, since the Prime Ministerhoped to return on the following day, it would be advisable that theannouncement of the Governmenfs policy on Cyprus should be deferred until 28th March, in order to allow time for the PrimeMinister to discuss the situation with the Cabinet and to take accountof the views of the Turkish Government.The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Ormsby-Gore)said that H.M. Ambassador at Ankara had indicated that the mainsuggestion which the Turkish Government would wish to make ifArchbishop Makarios was to be released would be that our relaxation of the security measures should be confined to an offer of a safeconduct for the principal leaders of EOKA and that no significantcancellation of the emergency regulations should be envisaged until it was possible to judge whether, in response to the Archbishop&apos;s appeal, EOKA was prepared to abandon terrorism.It was agreed that the draft statement of Government policy should be revised in the light of the views of the Turkish Governmentand of any other amendments which members of the Cabinet might wish to suggest to the Colonial Secretary.The Cabinet (1) Agreed to defer further discussion of the question of Cyprusuntil after the Prime Minister had returned, and to postpone until the 28th March the announcement of the government&apos;s policy on this question.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to revise the draft announce-ment in the light of the views of the Turkish Governmentand of any other amendments which members of theCabinet might send to him.2. The Minister of Labour said that his hopes of an early settlement of the dispute in the shipbuilding industry had been, atleast temporarily, disappointed. The employers had offered a wage increase of 5 per cent., but the unions had refused to reduce their demand below an increase of 1\ per cent. In these circumstances theGovernment must either refrain from further intervention, acceptingwhatever consequences might follow, or constitute a Court of enquiry which, although it would have served no useful purpose at an earlier stage when the difference between the parties had not been reducedto specific figures, might now contribute to a solution. The employershad accepted his proposal to establish a Court of Enquiry. Thedecision of the unions was so far unknown; but there were grounds for believing that they were concerned about the financial implications of a protracted strike and might be prepared both to co-operate inthe proposed procedure and to suspend strike action in the interim.Even if they proved recalcitrant the Government would not bejustified in bringing pressure to bear on the employers to grant a wage increase of more than 5 per cent. an offer which was both fairin itself and likely to command sufficient support among the unions,at&quot; least in the engineering industry, to render a major engineeringstrike improbable.In discussion it was agreed that, in dealing with the wage claims which were pending in the coal and electricity industries, the objective of the National Coal Board and the Central Electricity authority should be to achieve a settlement on the basis of an increase notexceeding 5 per cent. This figure seemed likely to become thegeneral measure of wage increases in the new period which was now beginning. In so far as production remained at about its present level, wage increases of this order were bound to be reflected in prices and to renew inflationary pressure. If, however, a fresh increase in production could be stimulated, this risk might be diminished to some
Suez Canal. 3   jne Minister of Transport said that the clearance of the Suez(Previous        Canal had now reached a relatively advanced stage, and the EgyptianReference:      Government might shortly announce that the Canal was open toC.C. (57) 22nd   ships of at least 20,000 tons which were prepared to pay dues to theConclusions,    Egyptian Canal Authority.  After consulting the Prime Minister by minute 4.)       telegram, he proposed that British shipowners should be privatelyadvised to refrain from using the Canal for the time being and thatwe should seek to use our influence to persuade the shipping of friendly countries to adopt the same course.   This advice could bejustified by the uncertainty about the availability of technical servicesalong the Canal and by the possibility that mine-sweeping had notyet been completed.  These representations to shipowners, however,could not serve as more than a temporary expedient, and our positionwould become increasingly embarrassing if the negotiations for anagreement about the future administration of the Canal were notexpedited.The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Ormsby-Gore)said that the Egyptian Government appeared to be adopting anobstructive attitude in their discussions with the Secretary-Generalof the United Nations in Cairo, and the latter had asked his financial adviser, Mr. McCloy, to join him. On the instructions of the foreign secretary, Mr. McCloy would be informed that we expected theEgyptian Government either to accept the Four-Power proposals orto put forward a reasonable counter offer; that the essential pointin the Four-Power proposals was that a proportion of the Suez canal dues should be entrusted to a body independent of the Egyptian CanalAuthority; that British shipowners had been advised to refrain from using the Canal until the position had been clarified; and that theEgyptian Government should be warned that capital would not be forthcoming for the development of the Canal if they failed to inspire confidence in its future administration. It would shortly be necessary,in the light of the results of the discussions in Cairo and of theBermuda Conference, to decide what policy we should adopt if theEgyptian Government maintained an uncompromising attitude onthe question of payment of Canal dues.The Cabinet -(1) Took note of these statements.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of this matter on the PrimeMinisters return.Shops Bill. 4.   The Home Secretary said that he proposed that the Minister(Previous of Education should announce in the House of Lords that afternoonReference: that, despite the objections which had been raised against the ShopsC.C. (57) 22nd Bill, it was the Governments present intention to proceed with it.Conclusions, Amendments should then be tabled at the Report Stage to restoreMinute 5.) broadly the existing permissible hours of latest closing for shops.These and other amendments would virtually transform the Bill intoextent but only at the cost of an increase in imports. The implications of these possible developments would need further study.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statement by the Minister of Labour.(2) Invited the Minister of Power to be guided, in any discussions which he might have with the Chairmen of the Boards ofthe Nationalised Industries, by the views expressed in their discussion.
a codifying measure and, since most shops already shut earlier thanthey were legally obliged to, it would not be possible to criticise the amended version of the Bill as a restrictive measure. The questionwhether it would be practicable to proceed with the Bill in the Houseof Commons in the current Session would have to be considered laterand would depend on the availability of Parliamentary time.In discussion there was general agreement with this view. the enactment of the Bill in the current Session would reduce the pressure by the trade unions for further instalments of legislation arising fromreports of the Gowers&apos; Committee. This Bill would prove lessonerous to the commercial community than the other Gowers&apos;measures which the Government would be pressed to promote if itwere dropped.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals of the Home Secretary for dealingwith the Shops Bill in its further stages in the House ofLords.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,26th March, 1957.
