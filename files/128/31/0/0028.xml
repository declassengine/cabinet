3 CC. 28 (57)Lord Salisbury. 1. The Prime Minister said that Lord Salisbury had come tothe conclusion that he could not support the Cabinefs decision to terminate the detention of Archbishop Makarios in the Seychelles(CC. (57) 25th Conclusions, Minute 4) and had decided on that account to resign from the Government., The Prime Minister said that he felt sure that all his colleagues in the Cabinet would have learned of Lord Salisbury&apos;s decision with regret. They would feel deeply the loss of his support and counsel.For him personally it was a great sorrow to be parted from acolleague and friend with whom he had worked in harmony for so many years.2. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of theCabinet (C. (57) 84) covering a revised draft of the Statement on defence, 1957, and a further revised draft which was handed roundby the Minister of Defence at the meeting.The Cabinet considered the latest draft paragraph by paragraph,and various detailed amendments were suggested and approved.In discussion the following points of substance were made:  (a) It would be desirable to give rather more emphasis to theessential role of civil defence.(h) The omission of any reference to the strategic stockpile offood could be accepted. A decision should however be taken in thenear future about the policy of stockpiling food and oil, not only for major war but also for limited emergencies.(c) The Chiefs of Staff said that the paragraphs dealing withmanpower did not make it sufficiently clear that the proposed reduction in the total size of the Forces was dictated primarily by economic considerations and could not, in their view, be justified on military grounds alone. The point would be met if the opening partof paragraph 45 in the draft circulated under C. (57) 84 was insertedat the beginning of paragraph 46 of the later draft.(a1) It would be desirable to include a figure for the targetstrength of the all-regular Forces in 1962, since a more general statement was likely to give the impression that the total strengthwould be below the target figure envisaged. Account should alsobe taken of Colonial forces and other personnel recruited overseas,which were of value in meeting oversea defence commitments. Themethod of expressing this point should be considered further by theMinister of Defence in consultation with the Foreign Secretary.(e) The Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, had already beeninformed that the two Territorial Army Divisions at presentearmarked as reinforcements for Europe in a global war could notbe provided. He had not expressed concern about this decision since he realised that the units could not be trained and transported to europe in time to make a significant contribution. From the pointof view of maintaining the morale of the Territorial Army, however,it would be important to emphasise that the units would still be trained as fighting formations although their primary assignmentwould be to home defence.(/) In the paragraphs dealing with research and development itwould be desirable to include examples of the projects which were tobe abandoned in order to curtail demands on scarce manpower and resources. On the other hand it might be unwise at this stage tostate categorically that there would never be a requirement forsupersonic bombers or for further developments in fighter aircraft,since there could be no certainty that guided weapons and ballisticrockets would meet all future needs.(g) While it would be important to state that the recentagreement with the United States for the supply of ballistic missilesStatement on defence, 1957.(previous reference:CC. (57) 26thConclusions,Minute 1.)
industrial 3.   The Minister of Labour said that the Executive CommitteeDisputes. of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions had(Previous now decided to recommend to the unions concerned that strike actionReference: should be suspended while the Courts of Enquiry were sitting. this c.C. (57) 26th recommendation had still to be considered by the unions, and their conclusions, response was unpredictable.   The attitude of the AmalgamatedMinute 2.) Engineering Union would probably decide the issue.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement.would afford us a welcome economy of both time and money, specificreferences to the possible scope of the future programme of jointresearch with the Americans in this field should be avoided at thisstage.(h) The Minister of Defence emphasised that the success of thenew policy depended entirely on the reduced forces being wellequipped and on the necessary steps being taken to encourage regularrecruitment. From the latter point of view it would be essential tooffer terms of compensation which were patently fair to the officersand other ranks whose services were prematurely terminated as aresult of the reduction in the forces.(/) In previous years the Statement on Defence had included anumber of statistical tables. These would now be published as aseparate White Paper at a later date.(/*) The Australian Prime Minister had asked for advance information about the proposals in the White Paper since there wasto be a debate on defence in the Australian Parliament on 4th April.It was agreed that this request should be met and that summariesshould also be sent in confidence to the Governments of Canada andNew Zealand through the United Kingdom High Commissioners.(k) Advance information about the proposals in the White paper should also be given to the Governments of the members of western european Union and the North Atlantic Alliance through H.M.Ambassadors to the countries concerned, who could take theopportunity of explaining particular points of interest to theindividual countries.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with theForeign Secretary, to consider further the drafting of the paragraph about the strength of the all-regular forces in1962.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1) above, approved the draft statement on Defence, 1957, as amended in discussion.(3) Agreed that the Statement on Defence, 1957, should bepublished on 4th April.(4) Took note that the statistical tables relating to defence expenditure and manpower would be published later asa separate White Paper.(5) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to arrange for theGovernments of Canada, Australia and New Zealand tobe given in confidence advance information of theproposals in the Defence White Paper.(6) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for H.M.Ambassadors in the countries concerned similarly toinform the other members of the Western european union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.
Parliament, 4.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Chancellor of the Exchequer would open his Budget on 9th April. The debate on the Budget resolutions would occupy the succeeding two days and would be completed on 15th April.Parliament would be adjourned for the Easter recess from18th April to 30th April.Suez Canal.(previous references:C.C. (57) 14thConclusions,Minute 3, andC.C. (57) 24thConclusions,Minute 3.)Payments to egypt.5. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (C. (57) 85) covering a report by officials on the reinstatement of facilities for certain current payments betweenresidents of the sterling area and Egypt.In a preliminary discussion it was agreed that, although thetechnical preparations for the introduction of the proposed No. 3Account should continue to be studied, it would be premature toauthorise the Bank of England to open discussions with the NationalBank of Egypt with a view to the establishment of such an Accountuntil the prospect of reaching a satisfactory settlement of the future administration of the Suez Canal could be more accurately assessed.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Foreign Secretary, to arrange for further considerationto be given to the technical preparations for theintroduction of a No. 3 Account for current paymentsbetween the sterling area and Egypt, on the understandingthat no communication on this subject would be madefor the time being to the National Bank of Egypt.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of C. (57) 85 at a later meeting.Sudan. 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign currency. Secretary (C. (57) 87) recommending that authority should be givenfor the release to the Sudan Government of  15 millions of theEgyptian sterling balances in connection with the redemption of theEgyptian currency at present circulating in the Sudan.The Foreign Secretary said that any release from the Egyptiansterling balances would diminish the Egyptian funds available to meetthe claims of British subjects whose assets had been sequestrated inEgypt. On the other hand, the Sudan Government considered thatthey had a valid claim in equity to a proportion of the Egyptiansterling balances which had accrued during the period when the twocountries had constituted a single monetary unit, and we had already undertaken to release to the Sudan, in connection with theredemption of Egyptian currency, any sum which was acceptable tothe Egyptian Government. The latter had now agreed to the releaseof a sum sufficient to redeem the whole of the Egyptian currency inquestion, which the Sudan Government estimated at  20 millions.It was in our interests to retain the good will of the sudan government, both for the sake of our air staging rights at Khartoumand because of the strategic position which the Sudan occupied in africa. He recommended, therefore, that the claim of the sudan government should be met by an offer to release  15 millions fromthe Egyptian sterling balances, either in one sum or in instalments of 10 millions forthwith and the remainder at the end of the year.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he accepted the needfor the proposed release, despite the reduction in the Egyptian assets
which would remain under our control. A single payment of  15millions would be preferable to a release in two instalments, if it wereunderstood that this would represent a final settlement of the question.The Cabinet-Approved the release to the Sudan Government of  15millions, in a single sum, from the Egyptian sterling balances, in final settlement of their claim in connectionwith the redemption of Egyptian currency circulating in theSudan.Cabinet Office, S.W.I.2nd April, 1957.
