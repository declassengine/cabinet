2. The Home Secretary recalled that the Cabinet had agreed on 21st October that no further enquiry need be held into the allegation that there had been a premature disclosure of information about the increase in Bank Rate on 19th September. Since then nofurther evidence had been adduced in support of this allegation. But,in the course of supplementary Questions in the House of CommonsGc7(57)&apos; 74th on 12th November, serious imputations had been made against theConclusions, honour of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and of Mr. Oliver Poole,Minute 1.) the Deputy Chairman of the Conservative Party. On 13th november the Prime Minister had reviewed the position, in consultation withsome of his senior colleagues; and he had come to the conclusion thatthese imputations created a new situation in which it was expedient that a formal investigation should be held. For, without such an investigation, neither the Chancellor of the Exchequer nor Mr. Poolewould have an adequate opportunity to rebut the imputations whichhad been made against them. He had therefore decided that a tribunal should be appointed under the Tribunals of. Inquiry(Evidence) Act, 1921, to enquire into this matter. This decision hadbeen announced in the House of Commons on 13th November, anda Government motion for the appointment of the tribunal had nowbeen placed on the Order Paper.The Prime Minister regretted that it had not been practicable to consult the Cabinet before this decision was announced, but he hopedthat his colleagues would endorse the action which he had taken.The Cabinet agreed that in the hew circumstances it was right that a formal investigation should be held. Their discussion turnedmainly on the scope of the proposed enquiry. By. the terms ofreference set out in the Government motion the tribunal would beinvited to consider &quot; whether there is any justification for allegationsthat information about the raising of Bank Rate was improperlydisclosed to any person and whether, if there was any such disclosure,any use was made of such information for the purpose of privategain.&quot; The Opposition had tabled an amendment designed to extend the scope of the enquiry so as to cover the question whether animpending movement of Bank Rate might have been&quot; deduced fromthe advance information given to certain individuals about theother economic measures announced by the Government on19th September. The Cabinet agreed that, while the tribunal shouldbe free to take evidence-regarding the various interviews at which. this advance information had been given, the purpose of its enquiry should be to ascertain whether there had been a premature disclosure of information about the impending increase in Bank Rate. It was this allegation that had been made with intent to damage the.. Governmenfs credit, and it was important that those who had made it should be called upon to substantiate it and should not be allowedto take refuge in more general complaints about the procedure adopted in giving advance information about the Governmenfs other measures.The Cabinet were also informed of the proposed composition ofthe tribunal of enquiry..The Cabinet-(1) Endorsed the Prime Ministers decision that, in the new circumstances created by the imputations brought againstthe integrity of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the parliament.EconomicSituation.AllegedLeakage ofInformation.(previous reference -1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Home Secretary asked that Ministers in charge of departments should expedite the preparation of Bills included in the government&apos;s legislative programme.

The Foreign Secretary said that the Crown Prince of the yemen, in recent discussions in London, had renewed the claim thatAden and the Aden Protectorates should be ceded to the Yemen.We could not entertain any claim of this kind, although we should seek to improve conciliation procedures for settling the local boundarydisputes.The Foreign Secretary said that the Government of Tunisia had asked the Governments of the United States and the United kingdom to supply them with arms. They had been told that they should look to the French Government in the first instance but that, in default of French agreement to supply the necessary equipment, we wouldbe prepared, in concert with other.Western Powers,.to make supplies available provided that the Tunisian Government would guaranteenot to transfer them to any other country. It now appeared that theFrench Government might be prepared to deliver certain equipment to the Tunisian Government but only on condition that the latteragreed to accept no supplies from any other country, to look to theWestern Powers for any further supplies and to reject a gift of armswhich had been offered by the Egyptian Government. The TunisianGovernment might well refuse to accept these conditions and, if theydid, the Governments of the United States and the United Kingdommust be prepared to honour their undertaking to Tunisia. Thequantity of arrns involved would not be large; but the FrenchGovernment would be critical of our action. Nevertheless, we shouldnot risk alienating friendly countries and compelling them to look tothe Soviet bloc for supplies of arms.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of these statements.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that our representatives in, the financial discussions with the Egyptian Government in Rome had sought clarification of the instructions which they had been given asa result of. the Cabinefs discussion on 12th November. They shouldbe informed that our main concern was to retain our full rights inrespect of the balance of our claims outstanding after the payment onaccount to be made by the Egyptian Government and to have discretion to apply that payment towards. claims in respect either of nationalised property or of sequestrated property.The Cabinet  - 1(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Foreign Secretary, to arrange for further instructionsto be sent to our representatives in the financial discussions with the Egyptian Government in Rome on the lines which he proposed.    &apos; :i7iiJ?:r r;V&apos;;.  . Deputy Chairman of the Conservative Party, a formalenquiry should now be instituted into the allegation thatthere had been a premature disclosure of information about the increase in Bank Rate on 19th September.(2) Approved the terms of the Government motion for theappointment of a tribunal for this purpose under the tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act,&apos; 1921, and agreedthat the Opposition amendment to that&apos; motion should bev resisted.\ (3) Approved the proposed composition of the tribunal, and*   authorised the Home Secretary to arrange for the formal- ! , details of its appointment to be announced as soon aspracticable.
r     - . &apos; &apos;CC. 80 (57)4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the colonial secretary (C. (57) 262 and 268) about the constitutional developmentof Malta and the future of the Malta dockyard.The Colonial Secretary said that the United KingdomGovernment, while committed in principle to integrating Malta withthe United Kingdom, were not committed to the terms on whichintegration should take place or to the future status to be accorded to Malta. The Malta Government were concerned that the islandshould enjoy equality of status with the United Kingdom and thatthe legislation giving effect to integration should explicitly provide that Malta should become a part of the United Kingdom. any arrangement for this purpose which involved an amendment of theRoyal Style and Title would be unacceptable. Alternative draftclauses providing for the incorporation of Malta in the UnitedKingdom were annexed to C. (57) 262, the longer expressly altering the title of the United Kingdom and the title of the Parliament of theUnited Kingdom, the shorter merely providing that the title &quot; UnitedKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland&quot; should beconstrued as including Malta. The former would be more acceptable to Maltese opinion, as defining more explicitly the close associationof the Island with the United Kingdom. Similarly, in order toemphasise the equality of Malta with the United Kingdom, it wouldbe desirable that the legislation should include affirmations declaring that the status of Malta and Maltese representation in the UnitedKingdom Parliament would not be diminished without Malta&apos;consent and that the United Kingdom Parliament would not legislate for Malta in matters within the competence of the Maltese Parliamentwithout Maltese consent except for the fulfilment of the UnitedKingdom&apos;s responsibilities for defence and external affairs and incertain other cases.In discussion doubts were expressed about the desirability, inrelation to public opinion both in this country and in theCommonwealth, of emphasising too strongly the equality of Maltawith the United Kingdom in terms of status, particularly in view Ofthe possible effects on the established relationship between GreatBritain and Northern Ireland. The shorter of the alternative draft;clauses annexed to C. (57) 262 might, therefore, provide the mostprudent definition of Malta&apos;s future status. The proposedaffirmations were also open to question. The first might be regardedas conceding to Malta a constitutional privilege which was notenjoyed by Northern Ireland or possibly even by Scotland and Wales,while the second involved a limitation of the powers of the UniredKingdom Parliament which would need to be carefully examined inthe light of the Statute of Westminster and of the legislation defining the authority of the United Kingdom Parliament in relation to the parliament of Northern Ireland.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with theCommonwealth Secretary, the Colonial Secretary and theLaw Officers, to arrange for a further memorandum to be circulated, examining in greater detail the legal and constitutional implications of the proposals in C. (57) 262.The Colonial Secretary said that the present situation in whichthe economy of Malta was largely dependent on Service expenditure was unsatisfactory, and he endorsed the aim of creating privateindustrial capacity in Malta to which the labour now employed bythe Services could gradually; be transferred. He doubted, however,whether the plans so far discussed for the commercial use of the dockyard would provide for the continued employment of more than

The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of the Cabinet (C. (57) 244) examining whether it would be practicable, if Cabinet records were opened to inspection in thePublic Record Office after fifty years, to prevent private publicationof these records in extenso and to withhold from the Public RecordOffice such parts of them as could not suitably be opened to public inspection even after fifty years.The Cabinet agreed that the practical precautions described inC. (57) 244 should provide adequate safeguards for these purposes.In discussion, however, doubts were expressed on the questionof principle involved in the proposal to open Cabinet records to public inspection. Even after the Cabinefs proceedings began to be recorded, Ministers had assumed that their exchanges of opinions in cabinet discussions, which were essential to the discharge of collective responsibility, would hot be revealed. It was agreed that this aspect of the question should be further considered.The Cabinet Agreed to resume, at a subsequent meeting, their consideration of the proposal that Cabinet records shouldbe opened to public inspection after fifty years.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the colonial secretary (C. (57) 266) seeking endorsement of certain changes whichwere about to be introduced in the constitutional arrangements in kenya.The Colonial Secretary said that, during his recent visit toNairobi, he had been obliged:,to take urgent action to resolve theconstitutional-deadlock which. had arisen in Kenya. With theauthority of the Prime Minister he had announced various remedialabout half of the present labour force; and, if considerable numbersshould become redundant, we should be bound by our pledge to assistthe Maltese Government in remedial measures.   These would beCOStly. i&quot;.-     ; :    -&apos; &apos; v*--: - &apos; -^M^Ki., The First Lord of the Admiralty said that discussions had already taken place with Vickers about the possible commercial use of the dockyard, and he would like to carry those discussions further assoon as possible. The Admiralty would be able to guarantee enoughnaval work to keep the facilities at Malta fully employed over thenext, three ,years,c. which would give time for the building up ofcommercial Work, and after that period some further naval work could still be carried on in Malta.In discussion there was general agreement that this problem should be further considered in conjunction with that of theconstitutional development in Malta and in the light of the DefenceCommittee&apos;s conclusions on the problem of naval dockyards generally.Meanwhile, without prejudice to the CabinetY final decision,discussions should proceed with Vickers regarding the possiblecommercial use of the Malta dockyard.The Cabinet-. (2) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to discuss with theVickersArmstrong Company their possible use of the malta dockyard without prejudice to the Cabinefs finaldecision regarding the future of the dockyard.(3) Agreed to resume their consideration of the future of the malta dockyard in the light of the Defence Committee&apos;conclusions on future policy on naval dockyards generally.
measures. The number of African communal representatives in theLegislative Council would be increased by six, and twelve additionalseats would be provided, to be shared equally between the three separate racial communities and to be filled by an inter-commUnalmethod of election. In order to protect any one community againstdiscriminatory legislation, a new Council of State would be created,with powers of revision, delay and reference to the United KingdomGovernment. The responsibilities of the European and AsianMinisters without Portfolio would be more clearly defined, and thetwo portfolios available to African Ministers would be increased in importance. The ability of the Governor to maintain a Governmentmajority in the Legislative Council in all circumstances would be fully safeguarded.In discussion there was general agreement with the measureswhich had been taken.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the proposals in C. (57) 266.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to submit to the colonial policy Committee, in due course, his detailed proposals on the method of nomination of candidates for election to the inter-communal seats and on the composition,functions and powers of the new Council of State.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,14th November, 1957.
