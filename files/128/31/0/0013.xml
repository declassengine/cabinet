1. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that he had proposed to Her Majesty The Queen that she should confer onHis Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh the style and dignityof a Prince of the United Kingdom, in recognition of the greatservices which His Royal Highness had rendered to the country andhis unique contribution to the life of the Commonwealth, culminatingin the tour which he had just concluded. The Queen had beengraciously pleased to approve this proposal, to which effect wouldbe given forthwith by Royal Warrant to be followed by the issue of letters Patent. The Queen had signified her pleasure that His royal highness should be known henceforward as The Prince Philip,Duke of Edinburgh. This would confirm a title which common usageand general affection had already accorded to him. The PrimeMinisters of the older Commonwealth countries, though not formallyconcerned, had been informed of this proposal, which would receivegeneral welcome throughout the Commonwealth.The Cabinet Endorsed the Prime Ministers statement with warmapproval.2. The Prime Minister said that, following the cabinets decision not to embark in the present session on a comprehensiveBill which would embrace both the National Health Service and theNational Insurance scheme, he had reached the conclusion that a review of the National Insurance scheme should be put in hand,with a view to ascertaining what modifications to it might be madeas a substantial contribution to social policy. He had decided toask the Minister of Labour to assume responsibility for conductingthis review, with the help of a small Committee of Ministers, in thehope that it would be possible to work out practical proposals whichmight form the subject of legislation in the 1957-58 session. TheCommittee would consist of:  Minister of Labour (in the Chair),Minister of Pensions,Minister of Health,Financial Secretary, Treasury,Parliamentary    Secretary,    Ministry    of    Pensions(Miss Pitt).The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ statement.3. The Foreign Secretary said that, although public opinion in the United States was increasingly opposed to the use of sanctions against Israel, the recent statement of policy by President Eisenhower,designed to bring further pressure to bear on the Government of israel to withdraw their forces, had produced a situation in whichwe could not be certain that, if a resolution invoking sanctions against Israel was introduced in the United Nations, the UnitedStates Government would not feel obliged to vote in its favour. the body of opinion in the United Nations which was concerned tosecure a just settlement for Israel was anxious to anticipate this risk by putting forward alternative proposals. These had now takenshape in a resolution drafted by the Canadian Government whichwould include the following proposals: (i) the parties should observeand implement the Armistice Agreement; (ii) a United Nations force should be deployed on both sides of the border between Israel and egypt and in the Gaza Strip; (iii) the parties should refrain from-13 B ?
interference with innocent passage through the Straits of Tiran andthe Gulf of Aqaba; (iv) the United Nations should be invited to send a commission to Gaza to supervise the replacement of the Israeliadministration and to arrange for United Nations association withits future administration; (v) a United Nations Committee shouldbe appointed to visit Gaza and make recommendations for a final settlement of the problem in that area; and (vi) if Israel still refusedto withdraw her forces, the United Nations should give furtherconsideration to effective measures to achieve the desired ends. If aresolution of this kind was passed by a two-thirds majority, theGovernment of Israel would have secured as much in the way of guarantees for their future security as they could reasonably hope to achieve. We should therefore express our support in principle forthese proposals, even at the cost of accepting the implied threat of sanctions, rather than allow matters to drift into a deadlock whichmight have disastrous results.A resolution of this kind might, however, be defeated or bemutilated to an extent which would render it useless for our purpose.If it was then supplanted by a resolution invoking sanctions againstIsrael, we should be faced with a very delicate decision. We couldnot vote in favour of a resolution which would afford Israel no prospect of a just settlement or of adequate guarantees of her security.But we could not vote against a resolution invoking sanctions againstIsrael without further alienating opinion in the Arab world.H.M. Ambassador at Bagdad had reported that, in the opinion of thePrime Minister of Iraq, it would be fatal to us to fail to insist on thewithdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip, but that, if theGovernments of the United Kingdom and the United States pursueda common policy in this matter, they would regain the confidence of Iraq and other Arab Governments and would strengthen their hands in dealing with the Egyptian Government in future. We were now, therefore, in a position of great difficulty, inasmuch as we wereuncertain of the course which the United States Government would ultimately adopt and were exposed to the risk that, if we remainedpassive in the face of developments, we should find ourselvesconfronted by a resolution which we should be unable either tosupport or to oppose.In discussion it was suggested that public opinion in this country was now actively concerned to secure a just settlement for Israel.In the absence of such a settlement Israel could not reasonably beexpected to withdraw her forces; but, so long as she refused towithdraw them, there could be no assurance that the Suez Canaiwould be re-opened or the Syrian pipeline repaired. But delay inthis respect, though vital to ourselves, was far less important to israel and, indeed, to the United States. Unless, therefore, Israel wasconfronted with at least the threat that sanctions would be invokedagainst her if she did not withdraw her troops, she would have noinducement to accelerate this withdrawal. On the other hand, if aresolution invoking sanctions against Israel was adopted by theUnited Nations (even though we ourselves voted against it or at leastabstained) and if we subsequently wished to dissociate ourselves fromits implementation, the effect on the supplies of oil to this countryand to Western Europe might be no less damaging, quite apart fromthe harm to our political relations with the Arab States.Initially, therefore, our efforts should be directed to securing themaximum support for the type of resolution which the canadian government had in mind. We should not ourselves sponsor aresolution of this kind; but we should speak vigorously in its favourand should seek to ensure that, in debate, it had priority over anyAfro-Asian resolution invoking sanctions. In certain respects,however, the text of the Canadian resolution, as indicated in new York telegram No. 628, would need to be amended if it wasto be acceptable to public opinion in this country. It was agreedthat: -
(i) In paragraph 7 the reference to clarification of the legal position of the Straits of Than and the Gulf of Aqaba should be omitted; the reference to &quot;innocent passage &quot; should be amended to&quot; free passage&quot;; and if, as seemed probable, the canadian government themselves wished to omit the reference to the assertionof belligerent rights, we need not object.(ii) Paragraph 8, which appeared to weaken the specificprovisions of paragraph 7, should, if possible, be omitted; but weshould not insist on this omission against the better judgment of theCanadian Government.(iii) Paragraph 11, which contained the implicit threat to invokesanctions against Israel, should be amended to indicate that theUnited Nations were concerned less to secure a unilateral withdrawal by Israel than to ensure that both parties to the dispute implementedthe terms of the resolution as a whole. It should therefore be redrafted, if possible, to read &quot; Unless the terms of this resolutionare implemented and Israel withdraws, the General Assembly should give consideration to measures which might be effective in achieving the desired ends.&quot;It would, however, be necessary to consider carefully our courseof action if a resolution on the Canadian model failed to secure ahearing or was defeated on a vote, and a resolution invoking sanctions against Israel was then put forward. In addition to the fact thatwe could neither vote for nor vote against such a resolution withoutdamage to our interests, the precedent which would be establishedif the General Assembly was allowed to demand the imposition of sanctions could be very damaging, particularly to a commercialnation such as ourselves. We should therefore spare no effort toensure that a resolution of this kind was defeated, and that our ownattitude towards it was put clearly on record. For this purpose itmight be advisable that we should table a resolution of our own,outlining as clearly as possible the principles of a solution which weshould be prepared to accept as just and reasonable. If possible,we should secure a vote on this resolution. But even if we failedto do so, our policy would have been demonstrated to world opinion and we should be justified thereafter in abstaining from voting onany resolution invoking sanctions against Israel. In so doing weshould admittedly run the risk that our abstention might contribute to the necessary two-thirds majority vote in favour of the impositionof sanctions. But the alternative course of voting against a resolutioninvoking sanctions might imply consequences, in terms of ourrelations with the Arab States and the future safety of our oil supplies, which we could not lightly contemplate.The Prime Minister said that it was clear that our immediateobjective should be to secure the amendment of the Canadianresolution on the lines indicated in the discussion, and to give it ourmaximum support in debate. He proposed, therefore, to send a personal message to President Eisenhower, emphasising theimportance of fair treatment for Israel and urging him to give thesupport of the United States Government to the Canadian resolution.If, however, the Canadian resolution failed to achieve its purpose and was supplanted by a resolution invoking sanctions against Israel,it would be necessary to consider carefully whether we should vote against such resolution or should merely abstain. Abstention might prove to be the wiser course; but whatever policy we pursued shouldbe one which we could justify to our own conscience and to publicopinion as just and honourable.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to instruct the UnitedKingdom representative at the United Nations to be guided,in the debate on the withdrawal of Israeli forces, by theviews expressed in their discussion.
4. The Foreign Secretary said that the Canadian Minister for external Affairs, Mr. Pearson, had suggested that, in the debate onCyprus in the General Assembly of the United Nations, he should propose that the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) shouldbe invited to consider this problem. We had hitherto opposedsuggestions of this kind, on the ground that the findings of NATO, ifunfavourable to either party, might result in the defection of eitherGreece or Turkey from the Organisation. Nevertheless, the supportof NATO might well be needed at some stage; and the Secretary-General of NATO had himself indicated that, in any event, it was now desirable that NATO should examine the problem. In thesecircumstances it might be unwise to reject Mr. Pearson&apos;s suggestionoutright, and it would be preferable to express readiness to considerthe proposal sympathetically, without finally committing ourselves toaccept it.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement.5. The Foreign Secretary said that it was important that, atthe meeting of member countries of the Western European Union(W.E.U.), which was due to take place in London on 26th February,our decision to reduce the numbers of our forces in Europe shouldbe presented as the result of a more realistic reassessment of our contribution to European defence, and that it should not appear inany sense as a decision to dissociate ourselves from Europe. Forthis purpose it would be useful to mention the opportunities for collaboration between the United Kingdom and Europe both inrationalising the many inter-Governmental and Parliamentary bodies which now existed and in the field of research and development for defence purposes.The Minister of Defence said that we must not risk any breach of the commitments about the disclosure of secret information into which we had entered with the United States and commonwealth countries. Subject to this, there was a number of specific projects which involved no problem of security and might form an acceptablebasis for more extensive co-operation with European countries. Butthe results to be expected should not be over-estimated, particularly since the private firms engaged in this work, who were in competition with each other commercially, would not necessarily be willing to exchange information freely.The Prime Minister said that it was of the highest importance that we should retain the goodwill of our fellow members of W.E.U.in connection with the reduction of our forces in Europe. An offer to collaborate with them in giving more coherent shape to the manytypes of European institution should be helpful in this respect,provided that we were not committed to the principle of federation.But, as regards research and development, it should be made clear to the other member countries that our proposals would not, for thepresent at least, extend to nuclear projects; and the United StatesGovernment should be informed in advance of our intentions inthis matter.The Cabinet- (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to be guided, in the exchangeswhich would take place with member countries of theWestern European Union during the following week, bythe points made in their discussion.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange that the UnitedStates Government should be informed, in advance ofthese exchanges, of our intentions in regard to more extensive collaboration with European countries on research and development for defence purposes.
I110East-West 7.   The Cabinet resumed their discussion of memoranda by theTrade. President of the Board of Trade (C. (57) 22) and the Foreign SecretaryCopper Wire.   (C. (57) 26) about the export of copper wire to Russia.(Previous . .   The President of the Board of Trade said that, since it was the reference:      licences issued in respect of strategic materials, not the quantitiesCC. (57) 8th     actually delivered, which had to be reported to the Co-ordinatingConclusions,     Committee in Paris, the earlier proposal that we should arrangeMinute 6.)      for deliveries of copper wire to be prolonged beyond the end of the licensing period would not allay the disquiet of the United StatesGovernment.   Only by licensing in instalments would it be possibleto avoid disclosing immediately the total quantity of copper wirethat it was proposed to license for the current year.The Foreign Secretary said that, in these circumstances, it was essential that we should be candid in informing the United StatesGovernment of our real intentions. If they continued to expressdisquiet, they could also be informed that the quantity of copperwire authorised for export to the Soviet Union in the current year would be taken into account in determining the quantity to be licensed for the following year.The Cabinet     - -Invited the Foreign Secretary, the Chancellor of theExchequer and the President of the Board of Trade toconsider, in consultation, the terms in which our intentions in this matter should be conveyed to the Co-co-ordinating committee, and to submit a draft communication for thePrime Minister^ approval.Remuneration 8.   The Minister of Health said that the doctors&apos; representativesof Doctors had expressed dissatisfaction at the Governments decision to appointand Dentists, a Royal Commission.   While they no doubt suspected that the(Previous findings of the Royal Commission might make it impossible for themReference: to maintain thereafter the interpretation which they had placed onCC. (57) llth the Spens&apos; reports, they also feared that the appointment of a RoyalConclusions, Commission would postpone a decision on their claim for someMinute 3.) time.   They might become more reconciled to the proposal if theyAden.    :: .   6.   The Minister pf Defence said that within the preceding(Previous twenty-four hours the Yemeni bombardment of the frontierReference: fortifications of the Aden Protectorate had been intensified. one.c. (57) llth fort had been partially demolished and the local levies had had to conclusions, withdraw. It was essential that effective retaliatory action should be minute 5.) &apos;    taken; but the additional guns which had been provided to strengthen.....the defences of the Protectorate could not be moved sufficiently; quickly to cover all the points from which the Yemeni tribesmenmight attack There was, therefore, no alternative but to attack theYemeni guns from the air, and he sought the Cabinets approval-;; for this course.The Foreign Secretary said that the officer in charge of theoperations should be reminded of the political implications of actionof this kind and should be instructed to furnish promptly convincing evidence of damage to our installations On any occasion when itwas decided to retaliate from the air.The Cabinet-Agreed that retaliatory air attack against Yemeni batteriesshould be authorised, and invited the Foreign Secretary, theMinister of Defence and the Minister of State for colonial affairs to concert the necessary instructions to theCommander of the local military forces.
illInternationalLabourOrganisation(previous reference :CM. (56) 45thConclusions,Minute 10.)rehabilitation of the disabled.9. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofLabour (C. (57) 41) recommending that the Government should accept recommendation No. 99, on the vocational rehabilitation ofthe disabled, which had been adopted by the International LabourConference in 1955, and that this decision should be conveyed toParliament in a White Paper. The text of the recommendation hadbeen presented to Parliament in Cmd. 8629, and the law and practiceof the United Kingdom in this matter were already in generalaccordance with the recommendation.The Cabinet Approved the proposal in C. (57) 41.Oil Supplies. 10.   The Minister of Power said that, because the Irish Republic(Previous        did not come within the scope of the petrol rationing scheme in forceReference:      in this country, it had not been considered practicable to introduceCC. (57) 12th   the same restrictions on the consumption of petrol in NorthernConclusions,    Ireland as in the rest of the United Kingdom. The Secretary of StateMinute 6.)       for Scotland had represented to him that it would be difficult tojustify extending to Northern Ireland preferential treatment whichwas not accorded also to Scotland.   It would not, however, bepossible to relax the present rationing arrangements in favour ofScotland without doing so in favour of other holiday areas, suchas Wales and Cornwall, with the result that the rationing system would collapse.The Cabinet Agreed that it would not be practicable to extend to otherparts of the United Kingdom the preferential treatment inregard to petrol rationing which had had to be accorded to Northern Ireland.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,22nd February, 1957.could be informed that consideration would be given to the grantof an interim award later in the year.The Prime Minister said that he proposed to arrange for a private discussion with representatives of the doctors and dentists, at their request, in the hope that it would be possible to allay their suspicionsand to convince them of the desirability of a comprehensive reviewof medical and dental remuneration. The Royal Commission should now be appointed without delay and pressed to complete its work as soon as possible; but there would be no justification for reversingthe decision which the Government had taken. An interim award,at least for the lower-paid members of the professions, might bedesirable; but this proposal would need further consideration, andthe decision might depend, to some extent, on the willingness of the doctors to accept a fresh approach to the problem of their remuneration.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers statement.
