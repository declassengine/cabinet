Parliament.India.2. The Prime Minister said that the regret expressed by thePrime Minister of India for the scurrilous article about Her majesty the Queen which had been published by the official organ of theCongress Party could perhaps be deemed adequate, and the incidentcould be regarded as closed.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of this statement.Congress forRights and freedom inRussia.3. The Foreign Secretary said that certain Russian emigreswished to hold in this country a meeting of an organisation knownas the Congress for Rights and Freedom in Russia. The grant of facilities for this could not reasonably be regarded as provocative tothe Government of the Soviet Union, and he was inclined to thinkthat no objection need be raised, on the understanding that individualswishing to attend the meeting would be subject to the usual scrutinyon their application for visas. The Congress had the support ofcertain Russians who were resident, and held academic posts, in thiscountry; but it did not appear to have any organised Britishsponsorship.The Lord Chancellor said that our attitude towards applicationsof this kind had, in the past, been strict and it would be advisable,before giving consent, to ascertain by reference to the Law officers that such consent could not be construed by the Government of theSoviet Union as contrary to the general comity of nations.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with the LordChancellor, to seek the opinion of the Law Officers on the propriety of giving facilities for a meeting in this country of the Congress for Rights and Freedom in Russia.Farm price review.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 11thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Agriculture(C. (57) 60) on the possible bases for a settlement of the current reviewof agricultural price guarantees.The Minister of Agriculture said that a settlement could not be imposed on the farmers at the minimum figure ( 8 millions)permissible under the new system of long-term assurances withoutexposing the Government to the charge that they were violating thespirit, if not the letter, of these assurances and were disregarding the legitimate claims of the small farmer.  13 millions represented the lowest figure for an imposed settlement which the Government couldclaim to constitute a fair interpretation of the new system ofassurances. Against this, there was a reasonable prospect of achieving an agreed settlement at a figure of  15 millions, including an increase of id. a gallon in the guaranteed price for milk.Moreover, the net cost of such a settlement might be reduced to 11 millions if the retail price of milk was retained at Sd. a pint duringthe summer. Finally, the reception which would be given to the agriculture Bill embodying the new system of long-term assurances,which was due to have its Second Reading on 20th March, would depend directly on the extent to which the settlement of the currentreview had been agreed or imposed.51320-3 B 21. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.It would be announced on the following day that the Chancellorof the Exchequer would open his Budget on 9th April.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in present economic circumstances, the Government would be justified in imposing asettlement on the basis of the minimum figure permissible under the assurances. In order to retain the goodwill of the farmers, a liberalinterpretation of this figure might be justified. But there was no economic case for giving further support for the production of eithereggs or milk; and, if the price of pigs was left unchanged, the resultant settlement, at approximately  10 millions, wouldincorporate a concession to the small farmer, would establish the totalcost of agricultural subsidies in 1957-58 at a level  30 millions higherthan in the current year, and would represent a defensible interpreta-tion of the new system of long-term guarantees in a year in which theneed for economy was paramount.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat an imposed settlement was unavoidable. But it was important that the figure should not be so low as to destroy the new relation between the Government and the farmers which the system of long-term assurances had created. The objective should therefore be soto arrange the distribution of a total award somewhat above theminimum figure of  8 millions as to make no concession on milk and eggs but to encourage the production of other foodstuffs on sound economic lines.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in view of thebalance of arguments advanced in the discussion, he was prepared toconsider an imposed settlement on the basis of a figure of 12 millions. This, however, was on the assumption that the eggsubsidy was reduced, as had been proposed, and that no increase inthe milk subsidy would be permitted. Both Australia and NewZealand were concerned at the effect of our milk subsidy on theirmarket for dairy products in this country, and the Prime MinisterOf New Zealand had recently represented that the matter was sufficiently serious to warrant urgent discussion.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Agriculture to arrange for thenegotiations with the farmers to be continued on the basisagreed in their discussion and to circulate, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer, a schedule of individual commodity guarantees related to an award of 12 millions.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (57) 57) submitting revised proposalsfor increases in certain public service salaries.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while he saw noreason to modify his earlier proposals on allowances for Peers and increases in remuneration for members of the Boards of nationalised industries, the Lower Judiciary, and the Comptroller and Auditor-General, he had given further thought to the increases which wouldbe appropriate for Members of Parliament and Ministers. for members of Parliament he now proposed that, the sessionalallowance being abolished, the salary should be increased to  1,500or  1,750. All Ministers in the House of Commons should be permitted to draw this new Parliamentary salary in full; and on this assumption the increase in Ministerial salaries could be limited tothe following categories:  (a) The salary of  1,500 of Parliamentary Secretaries should beraised to 2,000.(b) The Financial and Economic Secretaries to the treasury should be regraded as Ministers of State for purposes of salary.
(c) The Officers of the Household who acted as Whips in theHouse of Lords and as Departmental spokesmen should be regraded,for purposes of salary, on a basis of equivalence with the newentitlement of Parliamentary Secretaries.As a result, a differentiation between the emoluments ofMinisters in the House of Commons and those of Ministers in theHouse of Lords would persist; but examination had failed to discloseany means of avoiding this.In discussion it was suggested that, while the need for improve-ment in the salaries of Members of Parliament and Ministers,particularly Parliamentary Secretaries, was urgent, opinion amongthe Governments supporters, both in the House of Commons and inthe country as a whole, would react unfavourably to these proposals.It was essential, for political reasons, that the Government should beseen to be pursuing, in the months ahead, a firm and determinedpolicy which was clearly consistent with Conservative principles; andany measure which could be interpreted, however wrongly, as being at variance with such a policy would be a tactical error at the presenttime. Action on these proposals should, therefore, be deferred forthe time being, although they should be brought forward forrenewed consideration in the summer. In the interval further thought might be given both to the content of the proposals,particularly as regards the very modest increase in the salary ofParliamentary Secretaries, and to their public presentation at a later stage.The Cabinet (1) Agreed to defer action for the time being on the proposalscomprised in C. (57) 57.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider in whatrespects these proposals might be further improved, andto bring them before the Cabinet again during the summer.remuneration of doctors and Dentists.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 13thConclusions,Minute 8.)6. The Prime Minister said that, in the light of their decisionto defer action on increases in public service salaries, the cabinet would wish to reconsider the tactics to be adopted in dealing withthe claim by the doctors and dentists for an increase in remuneration.In discussion it was agreed that the Government must adhere totheir decision to refer the main issue to a Royal Commission. Itwould, however, be possible to inform the representatives of the doctors and dentists that, while a final settlement of medicalremuneration must await the recommendations of the RoyalCommission, the Government were prepared to consider thepossibility of some interim award. The Royal Commission wouldnot be in any way concerned with an award of this kind, the determination and timing of which would rest solely with theGovernment. As an indication of their goodwill, however, theGovernment would grant forthwith an interim increase of 10 per cent,for junior hospital doctors. The grant of comparable awards to othermembers of the two professions would be considered in due course.On the basis of a statement of this kind it should be possible to defer granting an interim increase to the main body of doctors and dentists until nearer the time when it would be expedient to announce the proposed increases in public service salaries. On the other hand,this award should not be postponed too long or it might appear, whenultimately granted, to have been conceded to the pressure whichwould undoubtedly be organised by the two professions in the coming months. It might therefore be desirable to undertake that the resultof the Governments consideration of an interim award for the main body of doctors and dentists would be announced before the easter recess, i.e., in advance of the annual conference of the British medical association which was due to be held in April.
Germany.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 2ndConclusions,Minute 1.)The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange to informthe representatives of the doctors and dentists of theGovernments intentions, as agreed in their discussion.7, The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (57) 53) about the new Working Group which hadbeen. constituted for the resumption of discussions on Germanreunification.The Foreign Secretary said that our representative on theWorking Group should be guided by the following considerations: -(a) Our aim should remain a reunified Germany in the north atlantic Treaty Organisation.(b) No change should be made in the basis of our proposals on german reunification and European security.(ic). It would be possible to put forward certain amplificationsof the proposals made at the last meeting of Foreign Ministers in geneva which, while not altering their substance, would help tosatisfy public opinion in Western Europe that we were doing our best to reach a settlement and that the responsibility for failure lay with the Soviet Government.(d) We should not propose a Conference with the Soviet Unionabout Germany at the present time, unless the Federal german chancellor wished one to be held; and, if such a Conference were proposed by the Soviet Union, we should agree only if previouscontacts through diplomatic channels had established that it offeredsome prospect of achieving positive progress.The Cabinet Agreed that the United Kingdom representative on theWorking Group on German Reunification should be guided by the considerations which the Foreign Secretary had outlined.Cyprus. 8.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Foreign(Previous       Secretary (C. (57) 58) submitting alternative drafts of a communi-Reference:      cation to the Secretary-General of the North Atlantic TreatyC.C. (57) 15th   Organisation (NATO) about his proposal to initiate measures for conclusions,    conciliation in the Cyprus dispute.   The first draft assumed that,Minute 6.)      instead of awaiting an approach by the Secretary-General, we shouldtake the initiative in suggesting that he should take action underthe appropriate NATO resolution.   The second draft was cast inthe form of a reply to the invitation from the Secretary-General, onthe assumption that we should be content to await his approach.The Colonial Secretary said that he would prefer that anyattempt at conciliation by NATO should be deferred in order to give time for the situation in Cyprus to be brought under more effective control. If, however, it was necessary to make some concession tothe Secretary-General, there would be advantage, for domesticpolitical reasons, in taking the initiative rather than in appearing to admit that we had no choice but to hand over to NATO a problem which we could no longer solve ourselves.The Foreign Secretary said that, if we took the initative, weshould be less well placed to make the process of conciliation subjectto such conditions as we might find it necessary to stipulate. If, onthe other hand, we accepted a proposal put forward by the Secretary-General, we should merely be indicating that we were prepared to explore every reasonable opportunity of reaching a solution. Wehad already said, when the possibility of attempting conciliation hadbeen mentioned at the recent meeting of the North Atlantic Council,that we were willing to take part in discussions of this nature, either
7CC. (16) 57within NATO or elsewhere. There seemed no need therefore for usto take any further initiative.Discussion showed that the balance of opinion in the cabinet favoured the view expressed by the Foreign Secretary. The questionof procedure and timing might be further discussed with theSecretary-General on this basis, during the forthcoming visit of thePrime Minister and the Foreign Secretary to Paris. It would,however, be unwise to state, in any letter to the Secretary-Generalwhich might eventually be published, that we could give noundertaking that we should be prepared, either now or in the future,to submit the Cyprus question to arbitration. It would be sufficientto specify that any conciliation machinery which might be set upwould be &quot; confined to,&quot; rather than &quot; concerned with &quot; procedures of enquiry, mediation and conciliation, and would not extend to arbitration. It was agreed that paragraph 2 (i) of the draft lettersshould be amended in this sense.The Cabinet Invited the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary to be guided by the sense of their discussion in the forthcomingconsultations with the Secretary-General of NATO on thepossibility of submitting the Cyprus problem to conciliation.South-West 9.   The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the proposal thatAfrica consent should be given to the transfer of control over the South-Company. West Africa Company (S.W.A.C.) from the United Kingdom to an(Previous American-controlled company, the Tsumeb Corporation, Ltd., and reference: to the transfer of the domicile of S.W.A.C. for tax purposes, from theCC. (57) 14th   United Kingdom to South Africa.Conclusions, The chancellor of the Exchequer said that the TsumebMinute 7.) Corporation were prepared to enter into an undertaking not to apply for consent to transfer the domicile of S.W.A.C. overseas for a numberof years. The Economic Policy Committee had therefore concurred in his view that it would be contrary to our interests to refuse assent to a transaction which would to some extent relieve the UnitedKingdom of the burden of financing development in the sterling area.A refusal of consent would be interpreted as an indication that it wasno longer our policy to encourage dollar investment in theCommonwealth.The Prime Minister said that he was not satisfied that theproposal would result in any additional dollar investment in theCommonwealth. The American company might confine themselvesto reinvesting simply the current profits of operation. He feared,therefore, that there might be considerable public objection to the transaction. Much would depend, however, on the precise terms inwhich the various undertakings involved were expressed, particularly as regards the duration of the period during which the TsumebCorporation would undertake not to seek consent to the transferof the domicile of S.W.A.C. The exchange of letters in which theGovernments consent would be sought and given would need to be carefully examined from this point of view.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the President of the Board of Trade and the Ministerof Power, to consider the terms in which the Governmentsconsent to the proposed transfer of the controlling interestin the South-West Africa Company to the TsumebCorporation might be given, and to submit a draft exchangeof letters to the Prime Minster for his consideration.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,7th March, 1957.
