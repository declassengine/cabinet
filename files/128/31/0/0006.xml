3CC. 6 (57)1. The Foreign Secretary said that the United StatesGovernment were proposing to table at the United Nations aresolution inviting us to seek, by negotiations with the otherGovernments concerned and with the different sections of opinion in cyprus, a solution to the problems of the Island. Although theUnited States Government were inspired by friendly motives inmaking this proposal, their resolution would imply that the united nations were entitled to pronounce on the internal administrationof our dependent territories. He therefore proposed to seek to dissuade the United States Government from tabling a resolution inthese terms.The Cabinet were in agreement with this view. It was pointedout, however, that the resolution would not be open to objection ifit merely called upon us to continue negotiations with the Greek and turkish Governments.The Cabinet Agreed that, subject to the point made in their discussion,the Foreign Secretary should seek to dissuade the UnitedStates Government from tabling a resolution on Cyprus inthe United Nations in the terms which they had proposed.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (57) 18) about the forthcoming negotiations for thetermination of the Anglo-Jordan Treaty.The Foreign Secretary said that our principal aim would be tosecure the termination of the Treaty by 31st March under anagreement which would enable us to remove from Jordan the valuablemilitary stocks and equipment which we held there. For this purpose it might prove necessary to offer concessions in regard to other military stocks, payment for fixed installations, the cancellation of debt, and the continuance of the subsidy for the remainder of thecurrent year. It must also be our objective to maintain, as far aspossible, some degree of continuing influence in the affairs of Jordan;and an offer of continuing financial assistance for certain development projects might be helpful in this respect. Further consideration should be given to this possibility in the light of the progress made inthe negotiations.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the aggregate valueof the various concessions listed in paragraph 24 of C. (57) 18amounted to some  18 millions. It would be difficult to justifymaking Jordan a gift of this order at a time when it was proposed toenforce stringent economy in this country. An attempt should therefore be made to offset the subsidy payments due for theremainder of the year against the value of the fixed installationswhich would be transferred to Jordan. The gift to Jordan of thatportion of our military stocks at Zerqa which was earmarked forthe Jordan-Arab Army should be the last, not the first, of the concessions which we should contemplate. No commitment shouldbe accepted to provide further financial assistance for development projects without a thorough assessment of the results to be expected and the other claims on our resources. As regards paragraph 24 (d)and (e) of the memorandum, we were in no position to make a furthergift of arms to Iraq and it would be premature to contemplatecontributing to a stockpile of arms in support of the Bagdad Pactuntil a decision to create such a stockpile had been taken.The Secretary of State for War said that our negotiators shouldtake no initiative in offering to provide British officers to advise onthe training of Jordanian forces. We should be ready to consider a request from Jordan to this effect; but it might prove necessary to rely on volunteers to discharge this function in future, and it wouldbe necessary to establish in advance that their conditions of service would be satisfactory.
naval discipline Act.(previous reference:CM. (56) 69thConclusions,Minute 6.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the FirstLord of the Admiralty (C. (57) 13) asking that a Bill to amend theNaval Discipline Act should be included in the legislative programme for the current session.The First Lord of the Admiralty recalled that mention of this legislation had not been included in The Queen&apos;s Speech partly because the report of the Select Committee which had been considering the subject had not then been published. TheCommittee&apos;s report, which included a draft Bill, had now been presented; the Admiralty were prepared to accept the Committee&apos;srecommendations with the single exception of that relating to the composition of courts-martial, on which their views were set out inAppendix A of C. (57) 13; and it was desirable that the amending legislation should be introduced without delay.The Home Secretary said that the House of Commons would expect the Government to proceed with this legislation, and a placecould be found for it in the Legislative Programme.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that legislation should be introduced in the current session to amend the Naval Discipline Act on the lines recommended by the Select Committee, subject to thesubstitution of a revised version of the clause on the composition of courts-martial as proposed in Appendix of C. (57) 13.(2) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to submit the draftBill for examination by the Legislation Committee.National 4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of insurance. Labour and the Minister of National Insurance (C. (57) 14) regardingUnemployment the changes to be made in the rules entitling persons working onBenefit. short-time to claim unemployment benefit.(Previous The Minister of Labour recalled that, when the last government reference: had considered this question on 9th October, 1956, they had agreedCM. (56) 70th to review it again in the light of the progress of wage claims duringConclusions, the autumn. They had then felt that if, when the time came to minute 2.) introduce the National Insurance Bill, industrial relations were easy,it might be a mistake to inflame them by proposing changes in these rules which would be highly controversial.   The Minister said thatThe Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that ourtactics should be to make the fullest use of concessions in the formof military equipment which possessed little further value for us andof fixed installations which, in any event, we could not remove. Weshould be considerably more cautious in offering to transfer military equipment not already in use, and in offering further financialassistance. It was no doubt desirable that we should aim at retainingsome continuing influence in Jordan, but the price to be paid for thisshould be considered at a later stage. Our negotiators should begiven general instructions on these lines, and should report back forfurther authority as the negotiations proceeded.The Cabinet Approved, subject to the modifications agreed in their discussion, the proposals in C. (57) 18 for the conduct of theforthcoming negotiations for the termination of the Anglo-Jordan Treaty of 1948.
5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum on overseabroadcasting by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (C. (57) 15),in which it was proposed that the publication of the DepartmentalEstimates for oversea information services should be accompaniedby a statement indicating that a review of these services was being undertaken and that, when it was complete, some revision of theEstimates would probably be necessary. This proposal was, however,subject to the reservation that in the case of oversea broadcastingcertain measures should be taken forthwith, viz.:  (i) An increase in the Arabic service of the B.B.C. from A\ hours to 9^ hours a day.(ii) The provision, on a permanent footing, of relay facilitiesfor the Arabic service of the B.B.C., by using the transmitters atSharq-al-Adna which the Government would purchase from theNear East Arab Broadcasting Station.(iii) The provision of a second Middle East service by installingan additional high-power transmitter, primarily in order to providea programme of entertainment and straight news for the uneducatedmasses in the Arab countries. It would be for subsequent consideration whether this service should be undertaken by acommercial organisation.In discussion there was considerable support for theintensification of broadcasting to the Middle East. It was the policyof the B.B.C. to maintain in their oversea programmes the samestandards of objectivity as they maintained in their home service;and it had become clear during the Anglo-French operation against egypt that there was a need to secure a more forceful presentation of the Governmenfs own views in the Middle East. A lightprogramme of the kind suggested by the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster might make a substantial contribution to this purpose.The Chancellor of the Exchequer emphasised, however, that theDepartmental Estimates for oversea information services for 1957-58would probably show an increase of  1- 1^ millions over theprovision for the current year. The measures proposed by theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster might involve expenditure not far short of  500,000, including the very high figure of  180,000 forOverseaBroadcasting.(previous reference:CM. (56) 73rdConclusions,Minute 4.)in the present state of industrial relations he thought it would be inexpedient to take the extreme course of proposing that nounemployment benefit should be paid in respect of any calendar weekunless the worker had been unemployed in that week for two dayson which he normally worked. He thought it would be enough to propose that no benefit should be paid for a day on which theclaimant did not normally work. This would mean that workersnormally working a five-day week would, if working only three dayson short-time, be entitled to two days&apos; unemployment benefit.The Minister of National Insurance supported this proposal. Itwould at least remove the most glaring anomaly in the presentposition and would produce a substantial saving to the national insurance Fund. While it would doubtless meet with someopposition, it would be included in a Bill containing other proposalswhich would be to the advantage of insured persons.The Cabinet Agreed that the National Insurance Bill, which was to beintroduced in the course of the current session, should include a clause providing that unemployment benefit should not be paid in respect of a day on which the claimantdid not normally work.
Northern 5,   jhe Cabinet had before them a note by the Home SecretaryIreland. and the Commonwealth Secretary (C. (57) 5) submitting for approvalTerrorist the basis of a reply to the Irish Foreign Ministers aide-memoire of activities.       24th December, 1956, about terrorist activities.(Previous The Home Secretary said that Mr. Cosgrave, in his reply to reference: the note on terrorist activities which H.M. Ambassador in DublinCM. (56) 103rd had delivered to him on 18th December, had sought to reviveConclusions, the issue of partition by taking the line that terrorism would minute 2.) never be eliminated until the territorial unity of Ireland hadbeen restored. H.M. Ambassador had advised that there would be advantage in attempting to make a guardedly forthcoming response to this aide-memoire. Recent events, however, had caused feeling in Northern Ireland against the Republic to harden and there wouldbe unfavourable reactions there if it became known that her majesty&apos;s Government were prepared, at this juncture, to enter into discussions which contemplated the possibility of a united Ireland.In these circumstances, it was proposed to say, in reply toMr. Cosgrave, that it was only by voluntary agreement between theNorth and South that any change in the present position could bebrought about, and that Her Majesty&apos;s Government must stand bythe terms of the Ireland Act, 1949. If, however, the Irish Republicwere prepared to seek through administrative action ways and meansof improving relations between the North and South, it could beexpected that the Government of Northern Ireland would proveresponsive.The Cabinet-Approved the basis of the reply, as set out in C. (57) 5, tothe Irish Foreign Minister^ aide-memoire of 24th December1956.Ghana. 7.   The Commonwealth Secretary said that, in accordance with(Previous        the normal conception of the functions of the Colonial DevelopmentReferences:     Corporation, Clause 3 had been included in the Ghana IndependenceCM. (57) 87th  Bill in order to debar the Corporation from undertaking new projectsConclusions,    in Ghana after the date on which it attained full self-government.Minute 7 and    This clause had attracted strong criticism in the House of Lords,C.M.(56)64th   partly on the ground that it might prejudice the results of theConclusions,    Governments  review  of future  investment  in  CommonwealthMinute 2.)       countries.  If, however, Clause 3 was omitted from the Bill, Ghanawould remain legally eligible for assistance from the corporation under the Overseas Resources Development Acts.   It was forconsideration, therefore, whether Government spokesmen in theforthcoming debate should offer to accept a suggestion which hadthe operating costs of the transmitters at share-al-Adna. He couldnot contemplate additional expenditure of this order, unless it wasmatched by corresponding economies elsewhere in the estimates for oversea information services as a whole.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposals outlined in C. (57) 15.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster tore-examine the estimate of  180,000 for the operating costs of the transmitters at share-al-Adna.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, toconsider possible means of securing that the additional expenditure entailed by his proposals would be offset by corresponding economies in the Estimates for oversea information services as a whole.
now been put forward that the clause should be omitted from theBill but that the Corporation should, at the same time, be directed by the Government not to undertake any new scheme of development in Ghana until the result of the comprehensive review of investment in the Commonwealth was known.The Attorney-General said that, on a preliminary review of thequestion, he was doubtful whether the legal effect of omittingClause 3 from the Bill would be as had been assumed. He would wish, however, to give further consideration to this question.In discussion it was suggested that, when the review of futureinvestment in Commonwealth countries was complete, it might benecessary to introduce a new investment policy which woulddistinguish, in respect both of Colonies and of independent countries,between those territories which genuinely needed financial assistance and those which, although possessing adequate financial resources,required help in the form of manpower, technical advice, &amp;c. This,however, was a long-term project. Until the review was complete itwould be dangerous to countenance any breach of the principle thatthe Colonial Development Corporation should operate only in colonial territories. In the light of the Attorney-General&apos;s examina-tion of the legal implications of omitting Clause 3 from the GhanaIndependence Bill, it would be necessary to give further thought tothe tactics to be adopted in the resumed debate on the Bill in theHouse of Lords.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Attorney-General to examine, as a matter of urgency, the legal implications of omitting Clause 3 fromthe Ghana Independence Bill.(2) Invited the Colonial Policy Committee to give furtherconsideration to the tactics to be adopted in the resumeddebate on the Bill in the light of the Attorney-General&apos;sconsidered opinion on the legal issue.Suez Canal.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 4thConclusions,Minute 2.)8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (57) 6) about the future control and administration ofthe Suez Canal.The Foreign Secretary said that he was now somewhat moreoptimistic than was implied in his memorandum about the prospectof our being able to avoid paying dues directly to the egyptian government when the Canal was reopened, particularly since theSecretary-General of the United Nations now appeared to becontemplating the creation of some international organisation toreceive dues.The Cabinet were reminded that the United States Secretary ofState had recently informed the Minister of Defence (washington telegram No. 156) that, in his view, it was important that an arrange-ment should be made for the payment of dues by all users to someorganisation other than the Egyptian Canal Authority. It would clearly be helpful if Mr. Dulles could be induced to make such astatement publicly.The Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider whether theUnited States Secretary of State might be asked to make apublic statement about the payment of Suez Canal dues toan international authority.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,1st February, 1957.
