Cotton. 1.   The President of the Board of Trade recalled that on 1stImports. August the Cabinet had agreed that the Lancashire cotton industry(Previous should seek to reach a voluntary agreement with the industries ofReference: India and Pakistan for the limitation of cotton exports from thoseCC. (57) 60th countries, to be administered by import licensing in this country,Conclusions, on the understanding that there would be a similar agreement with minute 7.) the Hong Kong industry which would be policed by the Hong Kongindustry itself. If the Hong Kong industry failed to keep within thelimit voluntarily agreed, the industries of India and Pakistan wouldbe released from their agreement, and the United KingdomGovernment would then have to decide whether to accept the failureof the scheme or to impose quota restrictions on the textile importsinvolved. The Governor of Hong Kong had, however, stated thatit would not be possible to assemble any sufficiently representativegroup of the Hong Kong interests concerned to negotiate a voluntary agreement on these lines; and he had therefore suggested that theLancashire industry, without reference to Hong Kong, should negotiate agreements with the industries of India and Pakistan whichwould include a ceiling for cotton exports from Hong Kong. ThePresident of the Board of Trade said that in that event India and pakistan would seek to impose a low limit on exports from HongKong, the agreements would be rapidly frustrated, and the UnitedKingdom Government would be faced with the need to imposequotas on imports of textiles from Asiatic Common wealth countries.In these circumstances he recommended that the Cabinefs earlier decision should be reaffirmed and that the Governor of Hong Kongshould be pressed to make further efforts to arrange for the formationof a body representative of the local industry which could negotiate a voluntary limit on cotton exports from the Colony.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the colonies said that the Governor of Hong Kong had made it clear that, evenif such a body could be convened, the industry would have no incentive to agree to any limit on textile exports. Moreover, neitherthe industry nor the Hong Kong Government would be either ableor willing to police any agreement. The alternative proposal putforward by the Governor was intended to preserve the substance ofthe arrangement approved by the Cabinet without making HongKong formally a party to a voluntary agreement which the Colonyhad neither the wish nor the means to implement.In discussion there was general agreement that it would be impracticable for the Lancashire industry to seek to agree a voluntary limitation of exports with the industries of India and pakistan in the absence of any indication of the limit to be placedon exports from Hong Kong. Although the United KingdomGovernment would probably have to take the effective decision about this limit, it would be undesirable that the figure should be fixedwithout any consultation with the Hong Kong industry and that local interests should be allowed to evade any share in the responsibility.The Governor of Hong Kong should, therefore, be informed that,before the Lancashire industry could pursue further negotiationswith the industries of India and Pakistan, it would be necessary todetermine the limit to be placed on cotton exports from Hong Kong;and he should be invited to consider how the local industry would best be brought into consultation for this purpose.The Cabinet:  Invited the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for theColonies, in consultation with the President of the Boardof Trade, to prepare, for the Prime Ministers approval,a further message to the Governor of Hong Kong on thelines agreed in discussion.52550-14
Economic *3.   The Cabinet resumed their discussion of memoranda by theSituation. Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (57) 194(Previous and 195) about the economic situation.  They also had before themReference: a memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (57) 209)CC. (57) 67th outlining the measures which it was proposed to introduce, togetherConclusions, with a memorandum by the Minister of Housing (C. (57) 212) aboutMinute 2.) the implications of the reductions in the housing programme.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was essential thatthe supply of money should be restricted if the inflationary pressurewas to be contained. He adhered, therefore, to his proposal that themoney value of public investment should be held during the next two years at its present level; and the Committee of Ministers whohad examined the measures which he contemplated for this purposewere satisfied that, although these measures were drastic, they wererealistic and practicable. Similarly, in the private sector, bankadvances should be restricted to their current level. In addition,however, it might well be necessary to take fresh powers of controlover the banking system in order to enforce an adequate restriction of credit in general; and a small working group of representativesof the Treasury and the Bank of England had been constituted,under the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, to consider what further action might need to be taken for this purpose.On further consideration he was satisfied that his earlier: proposals for an intensification of the restrictions on hire-purchasewere likely to be only marginally effective; and he did not proposeto pursue them further. He was also impressed by the objectionsto the introduction of a building control. Such a measure mightaggravate the pressure on resources in the interval while thenecessary legislation was being enacted. It would involve theestablishment of a large and cumbrous administrative organisation to implement the control. Moreover, it would be uncertain in itsincidence and relatively slow to take effect. In the light of these considerations it might well be wiser to seek to curb inessentialbuilding by means of a general intensification of the restriction of credit.It was also for consideration whether the measures nowproposed should be reinforced by an increase in Bank Rate. Suchan increase would probably be inevitable in order to maintain foreignconfidence in sterling when the full extent of the probable loss ofgold and dollars during September was known; and it would also provide a powerful and immediate support to the otherdisinflationary measures.In discussion it was emphasised that the proposed measures would be interpreted by public opinion as indicating that theGovernment were now departing, for the first time, from the objectives of the 1944 White Paper on Full Employment. these measures were likely to cause industrial dislocation, the failure ofmany small businesses and substantial unemployment. They would,therefore, be unwelcome to those of the Governmenfs supporterswho regarded the maintenance of full employment as the primaryobjective of economic policy; and their political implications mightbe very damaging. Moreover, they constituted an implicit admission that the Government had failed in their attempt to manage the economy on a basis of voluntary agreement and that they were unable to maintain for more than a brief period the state of balancedprosperity which they had achieved during 1953. Their impact* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.(&quot;previous       OtJL^^^        Mormed 0f &quot;&quot;^ develoPment^ in the reference:      .CC. (57) 65thConclusions.)
would be particularly severe on housing, and slum clearance,especially in Scotland. The Government had introduced the RentAct on the assumption that any rise in property values which it might provoke would be limited and controlled by the increase in thenumber of new houses becoming available. This assumption was now liable to be falsified; and it would be impossible, withoutprovoking a dangerous political situation, to intensify the restriction on new housing beyond the limits so far envisaged.The proposed measures could also be criticised on the grounds that they were directed solely against investment and would leaveconsumption unaffected; that they ignored the evidence that adeflationary tendency was already beginning to appear in the economy and would be given a further impetus by the prospectivereductions in defence expenditure; and that they assumed that thedefence of sterling was the sole responsibility of the United Kingdomand imposed no duty on the other members of the sterling area totake corrective action of their own.Nevertheless, it appeared impossible to devise any alternative means of defending sterling at the present critical juncture and ofdemonstrating the Governmenfs determination to resist the implications of the substantial new wage claims which were nowbeing formulated. For these reasons the proposed measures wereinescapable, despite the hardship and bitterness which they would create. If they resulted in the defeat of the Government at the next general Election, the Government would at least be able to claim that they had taken positive action to arrest the inflationary drift;and their policy would subsequently be seen to have been fully justified. If, however, the Government remained inactive in the face of the growing pressure on sterling and the continued rise in prices,their reputation would suffer a reverse from which it might notrecover for a considerable time.But, although the proposed measures were necessary, thequestion of their reinforcement by an increase in Bank Rate would need to be considered with great care. The Governor of the Bankof England had proposed that the Rate should be raised from 5 percent, to 7 per cent. An increase of this order was probablyunprecedented except on the outbreak of a major war. It would impose a heavy additional burden both on the Exchequer and on theexchanges; and its repercussions throughout the economy,particularly in terms of mortgage charges, would provokeconsiderable political criticism. On the other hand, an increase of2 per cent, -was probably no more effective, in present economic circumstances, than an increase of 1 per cent, in earlier periods.Moreover, if it proved to be effective, it should be possible to reducethe Rate again in the fairly near future.The Prime Minister said that he would arrange, together withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, to discuss the proposed increasein Bank Rate with the Governor of the Bank of England later that evening. As regards the other measures, the decision whichconfronted the Government would probably prove to be a turningpoint in their administration of the affairs of the nation. the presentation of the Governmenfs proposals would therefore be particularly important. Public opinion would not necessarilyendorse those proposals if their justification was based mainly onthe need to maintain the international value of sterling and to enablethe United Kingdom to continue to discharge its liabilities to foreigncountries. The measures should be defended primarily by referenceto the interests of the United Kingdom as a community whosevarious members were mutually interdependent. The Governmentshould claim that their objective was to safeguard production andemployment, which were to the advantage of wage earner andinvestor alike. Both classes should be reminded that the years since1951 had witnessed a remarkable expansion of the economy and amarked improvement in standards of living; that these achievementscarried their own dangers; that in 1955 it had become necessary to
7    488Cabinet Office, S.W.1.18th September, 1957.take certain steps to restrain the growth of demand; and that presentcircumstances made some intensification of this restraint unavoidable.The Government were therefore faced with a choice betweenremaining inactive or applying a reasonable degree of control to both the public and the private sectors or seeking to enforce a detailed pattern of restriction over the whole economy. It was clearly impossible to remain inactive and merely to accept the progressive collapse of the economy which would result. If, therefore,public opinion could be convinced that some measure of control was essential, debate would then tend to focus on the method and degreeof that control and the Government could claim that the measureswhich they now proposed, unpalatable though they might be, wouldbe more effective, and would involve less interference with individualfreedom and initiative, than the detailed system of economic planningwhich a Socialist Administration would seek to impose. Thestatement of the Governments intentions should reflect this approach to the issues involved, both in its order of presentation and in itsdiscussion of the measures to be adopted; and its emphasis on theinnovations which the Government had in mind, including possible measures to enforce a more effective control over the bankingsystem, should not appear to involve any abrupt change of attitudeor any breach in the continuity of the economic policy which theGovernment had pursued in the last six years.The Cabinet then considered the draft of a statement ofGovernment policy to be issued on 19th September. This draft was approved, subject to various textual amendments.The Cabinet:  (1) Took note that the Prime Minister and the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer would discuss with the Governor of theBank of England the amount of any increase in bank rate which might be made in the near future.(2) Took note, with approval, of the measures outlined in C. (57)209, subject to further detailed consultation between theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministers concerned.(3) Approved the draft statement of Government policy, subjectto the amendments agreed in discussion.
