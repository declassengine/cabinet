Farm price review.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 17thConclusions,Minute 12.)1. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of a possible basis forthe settlement of the current review of farm prices.The Minister of Agriculture said that the proposed increase of afarthing a gallon in the guaranteed price for milk should be considered in relation to an increase in production costs which, after allowing for increased efficiency, amounted to about 2\d. per gallon. So faras Commonwealth producers were concerned, the deterrent effects of the rising cost of production in this country were more important than the proposed nominal increase in the subsidy. There weredrawbacks to the alternative of a subsidy for silage production. Thecost (which might be higher than the cost of the proposed increase inthe milk subsidy) would fall directly on the Exchequer; the subsidy would be both expensive and difficult to administer; and it would do less than a milk subsidy to reassure the agricultural industry aboutthe Governments concern for the interests of the small farmer.The Home Secretary said that it was important to reach, ifpossible, an agreed settlement with the farmers in order not to destroy the fresh sense of confidence created by the new system of long-term assurances. The existing milk subsidy was admittedly not altogetherjustified from a purely economic point of view; but it was difficult,at present wage levels, for farmers to make milk production pay, anda nominal increase of one farthing per gallon did not involve anyvital question of principle.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, by encouragingexcess production, the milk subsidy would provoke a downwardtendency in the price of manufactured milk, and each fall of onepenny in that price would cost the Exchequer  1,700,000. In thesecircumstances there was no justification for increasing the milksubsidy, and to do so at a time, when sacrifices were being demandedfrom other sections of the community would be interpreted as anunwarranted concession to pressure by the farmers and as a retreatfrom realism in agricultural policy. Moreover, if the subsidy was increased again this year it would be virtually impossible to resistdemands for increases in subsequent years. It would be better to concede a settlement at a figure of  13 millions, instead of 12 millions, if the additional sum could be applied to a commodity,such as oats, whose production it was in the national interest toincrease.Further discussion showed that, while the considerations werenicely balanced, the Cabinet continued to entertain misgivings aboutincreasing, even nominally, the guaranteed price for milk. Eventhough costs might already be exerting a restraining effect on production, the risk that substantial quantities of milk might have tobe disposed of as waste was a powerful argument against any further increase in the subsidy. Nor would it be feasible, without discour-aging consumption, to retain the retail price of milk at Sd. during the summer season. A further attempt should therefore be made to induce the farmers to accept a settlement which, while providing no increase in the subsidy for milk, would offer improved guarantees for oats or barley or some other commodity which it would be economically defensible to encourage. Since it was unlikely that the farmers&apos; representatives would be willing to agree to a settlement ata total figure less than  15 millions, an alternative settlement of thiskind, based on a figure of  13 millions, might well have to be imposed.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Agriculture to continue negotiationswith the farmers&apos; representatives on the basis agreed in their discussion, and to report the outcome to the Prime Ministerfor consideration in consultation with the Home Secretary,the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland.
Suez Canal.(previous reference :CC. (57) 7thConclusions,Minute 6.)BritishEvacuees.2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (57) 62) submitting proposals for the payment of re-settlement allowances to British subjects evacuated from Egypt.The Cabinet were in agreement with the scales of allowancesproposed. These were primarily designed to meet the needs of those members of the Anglo / Egyptian community who would be unableto re-settle themselves in this country without financial assistance.It was important that, as a separate matter, urgent consideration should be given to the more substantial claims of those persons whose property and assets had been left behind in Egypt and had in somecases been sequestrated by the Egyptian Government. These persons,together with commercial firms who were similarly deprived of access to their Egyptian property, had been invited to submit to the ForeignOffice particulars of their assets and claims in preparation for eventualnegotiations with the Egyptian Government. Until such negotiations could be begun, there was some case for making advances, perhapson a graduated basis, against established claims in this category. this could be justified on grounds of equity; and the considerable publicdisquiet on this subject would increase if action was unduly delayed.The position of the non-Governmental pensioners and British subjectsformerly employed by the Egyptian Government but discharged inDecember 1951 should also be considered sympathetically.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary to arrange, as a matter of urgency, for a Committee including representatives of theHome Office, Foreign Office, Treasury and Board of Tradeto classify the various types of financial and commercialclaim against Egypt and to consider the possibility of makingsuitable advances against established claims by private individuals in this category.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,13th March, 1957.
