Free trade area.Agriculture.(previous references :CC. (57) 61stConclusions,Minute 2, and cc. (57) 43rdConclusions,Minute 8.)1. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of theCabinet (C. (57) 188) covering a report by officials on agriculture andthe European Free Trade Area.The Paymaster-General said that it had now become clear thatthe Free Trade Area negotiations would not reach a successful conclusion if the United Kingdom maintained a completely negative attitude on foodstuffs. The other European countries were insistingthat,  in  exchange  for  the  eventual  duty-free  entry  of  ourmanufactured goods into their markets, they should gain easier access to our market for their agricultural products.   The european countries were not in favour of free trade in foodstuffs; they favoured an evolution towards a system of managed markets.   But they expected the United Kingdom to acknowledge the need for somearrangements   for   foodstuffs   complementary   to   those   under negotiation  for  industrial   goods.    There   were  two   possibleapproaches:   on the one hand, we might offer jto undertakeobligations of a general character in respect of foodstuffs inside some form of institutional framework; on the other, we might negotiateconcessions on imports of specific agricultural commodities.   Thereport by officials set out a possible solution, based on the formerapproach and within the limits of existing commitments.  Under it,we might offer to subscribe to a Statute for agriculture, separate fromthe Free Trade Area Convention, but negotiated and signedsimultaneously with it in the Organisation for European economic co-operation  (O.E.E.C.).    This  Statute might provide for the continuation of the present O.E.E.C. arrangements for consultation on agricultural policies; for rules for trade in agricultural productssimilar to those in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(G.A.T.T.) and O.E.E.C.; for the elimination of tariffs and quotas onfoodstuffs over a definite period, subject to the United Kingdom notbeing obliged to remove tariffs; for a strengthening of the existingagricultural institutions in O.E.E.C., provided that decisions were based on unanimous voting; and for institutional arrangements underwhich the United Kingdom could consider association with themachinery of the six Powers in respect of particular commodities.The United Kingdom might also give as helpful an undertaking aspossible not to increase uneconomically the domestic industry&apos;s shareof her own market in foodstuffs.  An initiative on these lines might provide an acceptable solution, if it were put forward at theappropriate time in the negotiations.   On the other hand, it mightnot prove sufficiently attractive to our European partners; and in that event we should need to consider whether we should go beyond thelimits set by our existing policies and commitments.  Officials werestudying this and would submit a further report towards the end ofSeptember.  It was not necessary to take decisions at the present stage; but it would be helpful for officials to know whether theirreport was regarded as an acceptable basis for their further work.In discussion there was general agreement that the line of policy set out in the report afforded the possibility of a solution and should form the basis of the further work by officials. The following points were, however, made:  (a) We should need to consider carefully the precise stage in thenegotiations at which we should take an initiative on foodstuffs. Itwould be helpful if we could first know more about the methods bywhich the six Powers proposed to operate their managed market inagriculture. It would also be important that other countries, suchas Denmark, should be made to realise that their interests were beingdamaged by the arrangements of the six Powers, and that there wasno logical reason why we should afford them compensation for thisdamage by allowing them a greater share of our own market infoodstuffs.(b) While we were unlikely to experience great difficulty in securing European agreement that we should not eliminate our
tariffs on products of interest to the Commonwealth, we might haveto pay a price for this agreement, since a wide range of our importsof foodstuffs was affected. As against this, it was argued that the elimination of tariffs on foodstuffs was not a critical issue for manyEuropean countries because of the movement towards managedmarkets based on minimum price arrangements: we need not therefore adopt too defensive a posture in refusing to subscribe totariff elimination. In any event, we should not allow the european countries to determine whether there was a significant Commonwealthinterest in a product: this should remain a matter-for our own judgement.(c) We should find substantial difficulty in eliminating the quota restrictions on apples, pears and potatoes. We could not undertaketo eliminate these until some other safeguards for our own production had been devised. The feasibility of minimum price techniquesmight well be further examined.(d) In insisting that we should enter into some parallelarrangements in respect of foodstuffs, other European countries werenot primarily interested in the United Kingdom as a market forlow-priced food exports; they were more concerned to secure theassociation of the United Kingdom with their own managed marketarrangements based on minimum prices. Our closer association with europe over foodstuffs was not likely to damage our agricultural interests: it was more likely to have the result that consumers in thiscountry would pay higher prices for foodstuffs.(e) The presentation of any initiative on these lines, both toother Commonwealth Governments and to Government supporters in this country, would need careful preparation. There was a general impression that we intended to insist that foodstuffs must be excludedfrom the Free Trade Area, and any apparent change in this policy was liable to be misunderstood. Even if we went no further thanthe modest suggestions outlined in the report, there might be a major political reaction against the Governments involving themselves inconsultative arrangements whose eventual outcome could not before seen. It would be helpful if the Paymaster-General were toattend the forthcoming meeting of Commonwealth Finance Ministers,as a demonstration that we were conscious of the Commonwealthinterest in the Free Trade Area negotiations. It was also suggestedthat, with the same end in view, a standing committee should beestablished in London, comprising Commonwealth high commissioners or their representatives, to keep under continuous review the progress of the Free Trade Area negotiations.Presentational difficulties might arise most acutely over any undertaking by the United Kingdom not to increase uneconomicallythe domestic industry&apos;s share of the market in foodstuffs. We should need to take into account in framing such a declaration the increasing efficiency of the farming industry, which was leading to a markedexpansion in production; the obligations of the 1947 agriculture act; and the devices practised by many other European countries toprotect their own agricultural industries. There was generalagreement that the presentational problem might be lessened, and our negotiating position strengthened, if representatives of the national farmers&apos; Unions (N.F.U.s) were associated with the negotiations atsome stage.Summing up the discussion, The Prime Minister said that theCabinet were evidently in general agreement that the approachoutlined in the report should form the basis of further study by officials. This approach could be reconciled with our policy thatagriculture should be excluded from the scope of the Free trade area, since the arrangements which it envisaged were little more than an extension and strengthening of existing arrangements withinO.E.E.C. The proposed Statute would involve us in no commitments,but would furnish a framework within which any necessary further measures could be discussed.   Separate treatment for foodstuffs on
Common-wealth Affairs(previous references :C.C. (57) 56thConclusions,Minute 6, andC.C. (57) 56thConclusions,Minute 7.)Meeting ofFinanceMinisters.2. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Joint permanent secretary to the Treasury (C. (57) 187) on the forthcoming meetingof Commonwealth Finance Ministers and the subsequent discussions between United Kingdom and Canadian Ministers on trade matters.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the canadian government had circulated a memorandum (Annex A ofC. (57) 187) for discussion at the meeting of Commonwealth finance ministers which was to be held in Ottawa in September. From this it was clear that the Canadians would press strongly for a commonwealth Economic Conference. The miscellany of topicssuggested in the memorandum as a basis for the agenda of such aConference was not, however, impressive: experience suggested that,to be successful, a full-scale Conference of the nature proposed should concentrate on a single major issue. It would be embarrassing if theConference were held and proved to be a failure. nevertheless it might be necessary to fall in with the wishes of the canadian government and agree to a Conference. There might be justification for this, since developments in the Free Trade Area negotiations andthe general problem of the running down of sterling balances by commonwealth countries in process of development might of themselves make a gathering of Ministers desirable sometime duringthe course of 1958. In these circumstances, we might allow our attitude to the Canadian proposal to be governed by the reactions ofthese lines could be fully justified on the basis that there was no general inclination in Europe towards free trade in agriculture on thelines envisaged for manufactured goods. In the negotiations weshould make full use of the point that it was the agriculturearrangements of the six Powers which would damage the interestsof food-exporting countries such as Denmark, and that it was illogicalthat compensating benefits should be looked for at our expense. in presenting any new initiative on these lines, care should be taken tocarry the other Commonwealth Governments with us; for thispurpose the Paymaster-General should attend the meeting of theCommonwealth Finance Ministers and a standing committee consisting of Commonwealth High Commissioners or theirrepresentatives should be set up in London to keep under review thecourse of the Free Trade Area negotiations. As regards publicopinion in this country, we should need to recognise that any injuryarising out of arrangements of this sort was likely to be suffered bythe consumer rather than by the farmer. Nevertheless there would be advantage in early informal consultations with representatives of theN.F.U.S. It must also be remembered that, in the last resort, themost effective method of presenting and defending proposals for closer economic association between the United Kingdom and europe was in terms of the need to increase the solidarity of the free worldagainst the menace of Soviet and Chinese Communism. Such an approach might hold an appeal both for the Commonwealth and for public opinion in this country.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Paymaster-General to arrange for officials toundertake their further studies of agriculture in the context of the Free Trade Area on the basis ofC. (57) 188 and of the points made in discussion.(2) Invited the Paymaster-General to consider, in consultationwith the Minister of Agriculture, how representatives ofthe National Farmers&apos; Unions could best be brought intoinformal consultation on these matters at an early date.(3) Agreed to resume their consideration of this question at alater meeting in the light of the further work to beundertaken in pursuance of Conclusion (1) above.
other Commonwealth Governments; but, if it were decided to hold aConference, we should insist that adequate preparations for it shouldbe made at a preliminary meeting of senior Commonwealth officials.In discussion it was suggested that other commonwealth governments were unlikely to be attracted by the Canadian proposal;Canadian officials were certainly sceptical of its value; and we mightsecure a more favourable outcome of the bilateral Anglo-Canadiantrade discussions if the Canadian Government were no longer pinningall their hopes on a Commonwealth Conference. On the other hand,it was argued that it would be unwise for us to adopt a purely negative attitude to the Canadian proposal, particularly if it were thoughtunlikely that the Anglo-Canadian trade discussions would lead toany imaginative results. The new Canadian Government were welldisposed to the United Kingdom, and if we failed to respond to theirconstructive proposals they might encounter serious domestic political difficulties. Moreover, at a time when we were taking a leading partin negotiations for closer economic association in Europe, it wouldbe particularly inappropriate for us to oppose the holding of a commonwealth Economic Conference. This might well createmisunderstanding of our attitude both in this country and in Canada.it was generally agreed that, on balance, the better course wouldbe for us to adopt a positive attitude towards the Canadian proposal.If, at the meeting of Finance Ministers, there were any generaldisposition to favour the proposal for a Conference, we should takethe lead in endorsing it, subject to adequate prior official preparation.If the general sentiment was against a Conference we should seek tohelp the Canadian Government by drawing attention to the need for continuing Commonwealth consultation on the European Free trade area negotiations, and should suggest the establishment of a standingcommittee of Commonwealth High Commissioners, or theirrepresentatives, in London, to keep the progress of the negotiationsunder close review. We should go on to propose that a special meeting of senior Commonwealth officials should be held in the spring of 1958 with the object of discussing developments in theEuropean negotiations and reviewing the whole range of commonwealth economic problems. It should be the task of thismeeting to report to Ministers whether there appeared to be a needfor a Commonwealth Economic Conference or some similar gatheringof Ministers. A positive approach on these lines would be understoodand appreciated by the Canadian - Government and could also beexpected to meet with a favourable response from public opinion inthis country. Meanwhile, the United Kingdom High commissioner in Canada should not give any indication to Canadian officials thatwe felt any reservations about the suggested Conference.The Cabinet (1) Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to submit for the. Prime Ministers approval a note setting out the attitude which Her Majesty&apos;s Government should adopt towardsthe Canadian proposal for a Commonwealth EconomicConference, reflecting the points made in discussion.Anglo- The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that Mr. Deifenbaker,Canadian the Candian Prime Minister, had stated that his Government aimedTrade. at a major reorientation of trade by diverting 15 per cent, of canadian imports from the United States to the United Kingdom.The Canadian Government would not be able to achieve this unless they were prepared to discriminate openly against the United States;and it seemed clear from the Canadian memorandum that there wasin fact no likelihood of such open discrimination by Canada againstthe United States. One way in which such a diversion of trade couldbe brought about, without involving Canada in a breach of herinternational obligations, would be for her to enter into a free trade
area with the United Kingdom. It was true that, in the short term,such a development would yield greater advantages to the UnitedKingdom than to Canada and for that reason it was unlikely thatthe Canadians would look favourably on such a suggestion. But,even so, it would be good tactics to put it forward, as a safeguard against any criticism that we had failed to respond to the Canadianinitiative. If the Canadians rejected the proposal, we might suggestthat in return for a removal of the United Kingdom&apos;s quantitative restrictions on Canadian imports, Canada should undertake both toreduce her tariffs as far as possible in our favour and to reinforce the sterling area reserves, preferably by agreeing to hold part of herreserves in sterling. In present circumstances the Canadian reaction to this proposal might also be adverse. But it could be presented asa political, economic and commercial development of greatimportance. If we were successful in concluding an agreement with canada on these lines, we should be under acute pressure to removeour quantitative restrictions on United States goods; and we might therefore need to negotiate a bargain, if possible on similar lines,with the United States Government. Failing any agreement on either of these major issues, we should have to fall back on relatively minormeasures designed to improve the flow of Anglo-Canadian trade.These, while useful, would have little marked effect.The President of the Board of Trade said that it should not beimpossible for us to organise our commercial relations with Canadaon the same lines of intimate co-operation as was envisaged for our commercial relations with Europe under the Free Trade Area.Canada was anxious to become an industrial Power with a substantialtrade in manufactured goods as well as in staple commodities.Against such a background, we should press strongly the idea of an anglo-Canadian free trade area: although the short-term advantageswould be on the side of the United Kingdom, Canada should recognise that she would reap a long-term benefit. Under such aproposal the diversion of imports aimed at by Mr. Diefenbakerwould be assured, since all Canadian tariffs aeainst United kingdom goods would eventually disappear. If the Canadians rejected thisproposal we should, in putting forward the alternative suggestionoutlined by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, take care to ensure that canada made substantial reductions in her tariffs in our favour.We might justify the continuance of our quantitative restrictions on united States imports, at a time when we had removed them inrespect of Canada, on the basis that Canada&apos;s agreement to reinforce the reserves placed her in a soecial position. We should also consider in this connection the possibility of some limited transfer from UnitedStates to Canadian securities in the Exchange Equalisation Account(E.E.A.) with the general object of increasing United Kingdominvestment in Canada.In discussion it was agreed that the negotiations with Canadashould be conducted by stages on the broad lines proposed.Mr. Diefenbaker was genuinely concerned about the extent to which canada was relying on the United States for the development of hereconomy. It should not therefore be taken for granted that theCanadian reception of our proposals would necessarily be adverse,provided that they were presented in a manner designed to appeal tothe sentiments of the new Canadian Administration. The possibilityof transferring from United States to Canadian securities in theE.E.A., or of realising part of them, with the object of expanding thescale of United Kingdom investment in Canada would have a strongappeal to the Canadians and should be further explored. It mightbe possible by this means to establish an Anglo-Canadian InvestmentBoard which would direct funds to specific projects, with the prospect that the development thereby created would lead to an increased demand for United Kingdom capital goods.
Discussion then turned on the tactics which should be followed in the bilateral trade discussions. It was recognised that, if our ideaswere communicated in advance to Canadian officials, they would be subjected to destructive criticism. Moreover, our proposals were ofsuch a nature as to make them more appropriate for Ministerialrepresentations on a broad political plane rather than for discussions between officials. On the other hand, given the limited time whichwould be available for the Ministerial discussions, whether in&apos;Washington or in Ottawa, it was clear that in the absence of and preliminary preparation Canadian Ministers would not be able tocarry matters very far.The Prime Minister said that there seemed to be no prospectof any worthwhile discussions with Canadian Ministers at the ottawa meeting in September unless they had time to consider inadvance the lines along which we were thinking. The Minister ofAgriculture was to visit Canada early in September, and thePermanent Secretary of the Board of Trade would also be in north america on official business at that time. It would be a convenientway of opening these matters with Canadians if the Minister ofAgriculture were to indicate to Mr. Diefenbaker, in general terms,the scope of the proposals which were now under consideration by her Majesty&apos;s Government. This would give the Canadians an advance indication of our thinking and might yield some clue to theirlikely reactions. The Permanent Secretary of the Board of Tradecould give further details of our ideas, as required. Meanwhile, a personal message could be sent to Mr. Diefenbaker suggesting thatthe Minister of Agriculture should have discussions with him duringthe course of his visit to Canada next month. The Chancellor ofthe Exchequer might send a similar message to the Canadian finance minister.The Cabinet (2) Took note that the Prime Minister would send a personal message to the Prime Minister of Canada suggesting thatthe Minister of Agriculture should have preliminary discussions with him in September on the subject of anglo-Canadian trade.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to send a personal message in similar terms to the Canadian finance minister.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer in consultation withthe. Ministers concerned, to arrange for the preparation ofa brief for the use. of the Minister of Agriculture in had discussions with Canadian Ministers, based on C. (57) 187and on the points made, in the Cabinefs discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,28th August, 1957.
