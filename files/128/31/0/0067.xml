C.C. 67 (57)1. The Foreign Secretary said that the Greek proposal for theinseription of Cyprus on the agenda of the General Assembly of theUnited Nations would come forward for debate in the following week.He had agreed with the Colonial Secretary that it would be unwise to oppose the inscription of a Cyprus item. The present Greekproposal, however, was in two parts, the first referring to the issueof self-determination, the second to the alleged atrocities committed by the British colonial administration in Cyprus. We could clearly not agree to the inscription of the second part of the proposedformula. But, while making it clear that we were bound to oppose theGreek proposal in its present form, we should indicate that we wouldnot object to the inscription of a general reference to the cyprus problem and we should seek to secure that a more moderate formof words was adopted, possibly on the initiative of the United states delegation.In discussion it was agreed that, in opposing the inscription ofthe second part of the Greek proposal, we should not give theimpression that we were reluctant to discuss the alleged atrocities.Our opposition should be based on the ground that we were notprepared to discuss in the United Nations the administration of cyprus, which was an internal matter for the United KingdomGovernment.The Cabinet-Approved the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposals for dealing withthe inscription of a Cyprus item on the agenda of theforthcoming meeting of the General Assembly of the united nations.EconomicSituation.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 66thConclusions,Minute 2.)*2. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of memoranda bythe Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (57) 194and 195) about the economic situation. They also had before them the draft of a statement about inflation, which the Chancellor of theExchequer proposed to issue during the following week, togetherwith a memorandum by the. President of the Board of Trade(C. (57) 203) about hire-purchase restrictions.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, after discussing in greater detail with the Ministers concerned his proposals for curtailingthe supply of finance for investment in the public sector, he was satisfied that these proposals were realistic and practicable. In thecase of the private sector the statutory powers available to theGovernment to regulate bank advances were so slight that he couldnot seek to achieve more than the agreement of the banks toarangements whereby the average level of advances during thefollowing twelve months should not exceed the average level for theprevious twelve months. He remained of the opinion that some further measure of restraint on consumption should be introduced inorder to supplement the curtailment of investment and that theintensification of the restrictions on hire-purchase credit which hehad previously outlined represented the most suitable means ofrealising this purpose. A public statement of the Governmenfs firmintention to stabilise the economy at its present level by adopting the measures which he had described should make it possible, in hisopinion, to maintain the sterling-dollar exchange rate at $2-80.In discussion some doubt was expressed about this view. the degree of foreign confidence.in sterling was determined primarily bythe level of our reserves of gold and dollars in relation to our externalliabilities; and, even though the proposed measures might be adequate to restore the balance of the domestic economy, they were liable52360-2b 2(previous reference:C.C.

jjj Cjlto be judged insufficient to enable us to fulfil our functions as thecentral banker of a world-wide currency system. Moreover, existing international parities were becoming increasingly indefensible andthe efforts of central banks to protect them by successive increases in short-term interest rates were gradually provoking a recession in trade. If we were not to resort to import controls, the effective choicelay between initiating a general re-assessment of parities and allowing a depression to develop. It would be wiser in the long term to adoptthe former course, While time permitted. On the other hand it was urged that, if such a re-assessment involved the adoption of a floatingrate for sterling, this might well precipitate a collapse of the sterling area, particularly if the floating rate was introduced at the presenttime when sterling was already subject to heavy pressure. nor would such action be in any way a substitute for the measures of domestic restraint which were now under consideration. Indeed, ifa floating rate was to be effective, it would remain essential to adoptthose measures together with others even more severe.Even the proposed measures, however, would be liable to be interpreted as representing a major change in the Governmenfseconomic policy. Hitherto, in their attempts to reconcile full employment, price stability, free collective bargaining and a fixedexchange rate, the Government had been prepared reluctantly to allowprices to rise rather than to endanger the other objectives. Theywould now appear to be willing to sacrifice full employment in theinterests of price stability. The political consequences of such achange of purpose could be serious, particularly in terms of its impact on those members of the trade unions who had supported theGovernment in the last elections but still regarded the maintenanceof full employment as the primary objective of economic policy. Itwould be important, therefore, that the Governmenfs proposals should be so presented as to minimise the risk of creating a sense ofdiscouragement and frustration and that they should be accompanied,as far as possible, by measures to increase productivity. the government&apos;s aim must be to seek to restore the momentum of an expanding economy as rapidly as circumstances allowed.The effect of the proposed measures would depend largely on theextent to which public opinion, both at home and abroad, was convinced that the Government were whole-hearted in their intentionto implement their policy. It was for consideration, therefore,whether the proposals should be reinforced by the introduction of a building control. It would be inexpedient for the forthcomingstatement to include any reference to a control which could not bebrought into effect until the necessary legislation had been passed.Nevertheless, the introduction of such a control as soon as possiblewould be valuable both in terms of its economic effect and for the sake of the further evidence which it would provide of the government&apos;s determination that the curtailment of investment should operate impartially as between different sections of thecommunity. On the other hand, the Governmenfs supporters were likely to be severely critical of the introduction of a building control,on the ground that it would represent a complete reversal of conservative policy on this subject. Their criticism would be reinforced by the fact that the initial impact of the control would be liable to coincide with the implementation of the Rent Act.Moreover^ it was uncertain how effective such a control would be.Much of the inessential building which it would be designed to curbhad probably been completed and it would be undesirable thatbuilding for productive enterprise should be unnecessarily limited.It might be preferable to seek to secure a curtailment of building by taking powers to control the finance made available for this purpose by such institutions as the building societies and the insurance companies. There was general agreement that the case for theintroduction of a building control should be examined in greater detail in the light of these considerations.
Some doubt was also expressed about the inclusion in theforthcoming statement of measures to restrict still further the availability of hire-purchase credit. Such measures would result ina decline in production and a corresponding rise in prices, whichwould hamper our exports. Moreover, hire-purchase control, which affected only a minimal proportion of consumption expenditure,had been shown to be ineffective and had been abandoned as an instrument of economic policy in the United States after an exhaustivesurvey of its results. A more effective control over the volume olhire-purchase credit could be achieved by regulating more closely the volume of money made available by the hire-purchase financecompanies to finance such transactions. On the other hand, it was important that the Governmenfs disinflationary policy should beseen to incorporate measures of restraint on consumption in additionto the proposed curtailment of capital investment. The intensification of the restrictions on hire-purchase transactions represented the most convenient form which such measures might take, and howeverunpopular it might prove, it could be argued to represent an essential element in the Governmenfs proposals as a whole.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that there appeared to be general agreement that the Chancellor of theExchequer, before leaving for the meeting of the international monetary Fund in Washington, should be fortified by some publicexpression of the Governmenfs determination to maintain the presentsterling-dollar exchange rate and to adopt measures which, by limiting the amount of money made available both for investment in the public sector and for the needs of the private sector, would secure a betterbalance between the demand for and the supply of the resources ofthe economy. It remained to be decided, however, how this generalagreement in principle should be defined in a public statement whichcould be made before the departure of the Chancellor of theExchequer; how the Governmenfs action could be so presented to public opinion, both at home and abroad, as to be seen to be neitherinconsistent with their previous economic policy nor prompted byfundamental doubts about the strength of the currency; and how the adjustment of emphasis which it was the Government&apos;s purpose to achieve would best be translated into practical measures which wouldbe adequate to this objective. It would be advisable that thesequestions should be further studied, as a matter of urgency, by asmall Committee of Ministers constituted as follows:  Chancellor of the Exchequer (Chairman).President of the Board of Trade.Minister of Labour.Minister of Housing.Minister of Education.Minister of Power.Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.The Committee should report to the Cabinet early in the following week, in order that the proposed statement of policy might be madeon 19th September.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers proposalto appoint a Ministerial Committee to examine thedisinflationary measures to be adopted and their public presentation.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.
British &apos; 3.   The Minister of Transport said that the National Union ofTransport       Railwaymen had submitted to the British Transport Commission aCommission.    claim for a substantial increase in wages. This claim would be dealt(Previous        with by the normal machinery of negotiation in the railway industry.Reference:      In a recent discussion the Chairman of the Commission, Sir BrianC.C. (57) 56th   Robertson, had expressed the hope that the claim for increased wagesConclusions,    by London bus workers would come to a head first.  He had givenMinute 4.)       instructions that no increase in this case should: be agreed withoutWage Claims    reference to himself.   He also proposed to reject the railway claimduring the negotiations, with the result that it would eventually come before the Railway Staffs National Tribunal.   Sir Brian Robertsonhad asked for an assurance that he would have the support of theGovernment in maintaining this attitude and. in accepting whateveraward was ultimately made by the Tribunal.The Cabinet : Agreed that the Minister of Transport should give theChairman of the British Transport Commission the assurance for which he had asked.Nuclear Power.I.B.R.D. Loan.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 60thConclusions,Minute 6.)4.  The Cabinet had before them: -(i) a memorandum by the  Chancellor of the Exchequer(C. (57) 199) seeking authority to explore the possibilityof a loan from the International Bank for reconstruction and Development (I.B.R.D.) for the United Kingdomnuclear power programme; and(ii) a memorandum by the Minister of Power (C. (57) 202)criticising this proposal on the grounds that it would be disadvantageous and unwelcome to the country.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, as a result of his recent discussions with the President of the I.B.R.D., he believed thatit should be possible to obtain a substantial loan from the Bank for expenditure in local currency and for such an arrangement to beextended into a continuing programme of dollar finance for ournuclear power programme. It seemed clear, however, that a loan of this kind could not be made available without the participation of the New York market. He was aware of the objections to this element in the proposal but they were outweighed by the need to attract capital investment from abroad for our basic industries. Nofirm offer of a loan had, however, yet been made by the I.B.R.D. andhe proposed to hold further discussions with the President of theBank, without commitment, and to report further on the subject.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to explorefurther, without commitment, the possibility of a loan from the I.B.R.D. for the financing of the United Kingdomnuclear power programme and the terms on which sucha loan might be available.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting in the light of the information obtained under conclusion (1) above.Electrical 5.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theIndustry: President of the Board of Trade (C. (57) 193) about the Report ofMonopolies.     the Monopolies Commission on the heavy electrical industry.The President of the Board of Trade said that this report hadcondemned agreements among manufacturers of heavy electricalequipment, relating both to the domestic market and to exports, asbeing against the public interest. Those relating to the domestic market were now a matter for the Restrictive Practices Court, to
which a representative agreement was to be submitted at an early date.It was likely, however, to be a considerable time before the Court&apos;sfindings were made known, and he was liable to be pressed to declarethe Governments decision on the recommendations of theCommission relating to export agreements, which were not within thejurisdiction of the Court. It would be difficult, and might be politically embarrassing, to.set aside these recommendations, whichhad been made after a full examination and were supported by allbut one of the Commission^ members. These considerations,however, were outweighed by the need to maintain the industry&apos;position in world markets. The industry claimed that they were ata disadvantage compared with their European competitors whosedomestic markets were both profitable and protected and were likelyto remain so, despite the provisions of the Treaty of Rome. If theywere to be enabled to compete on equal terms, they must be allowedto enter into, or to extend, arrangements with their European rivalswith a view to securing a reasonable profit in third markets.In discussion it was the general view of the Cabinet that, whileGovernment endorsement of the export agreements in question wouldnot be welcome to Commonwealth countries, the heavy electricalindustry ought not to be placed at a disadvantage in the presentconditions of European competition. On the other hand, to rejectforthwith the findings of the Monopolies Commission might beheld to prejudice the subsequent proceedings of the restrictive practices Court in relation to agreements affecting the domestic market. It would therefore be preferable that any announcement ofthe Government^ views should be delayed as long as possible, andthat in the meantime no action should be taken against agreements of the kind in question. This policy could, if necessary, be defendedby reference to the difficulty of reaching a decision pending the verdictof the Restrictive Practices Court and a more certain assessment of future conditions in European markets.The Cabinet Invited the President of the Board of Trade to be guided bythe points made in their discussion in dealing with the monopolies Commission^ report on the heavy electricalindustry.6. The Cabinet were informed of certain difficulties which had arisen in the development of the Britannia aircraft. There was general agreement that it was important to ensure that this project was completed satisfactorily and that the Government should make their good offices available informally for this purpose.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Transport, in consultation with theMinister of Power and the Financial Secretary, Treasury,to consider what steps might be taken to facilitate the satisfactory final development of the Britannia aircraft.CivilAviation.(previous reference:Conclusions,CC.
