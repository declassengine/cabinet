Malta.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 55thConclusions,Minute 3.)Pensions. 2.   The Prime Minister recalled that on 22nd October the(Previous Cabinet had held a preliminary discussion of the various proposalsReference: for further Government action in relation to pensions and had conclusions agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting. on minute 5) &apos; reflection he had come to the conclusion that, before the Cabinet&apos;discussion was resumed, further work should be done by officials on two of the main alternative courses outlined in C. (57) 211. First,he thought that the Ministry of Pensions and National insurance should study in detail the practical and administrative difficulties of operating a scheme of compulsory supplementation, with special reference to the difficulties of &quot; contracting-out.&quot; Secondly, hesuggested that the Treasury should continue their study of a state scheme of graduated contributions and benefits and should, inparticular, consider the possibility of enlarging the concept of graduated contributions as a means of financing social services.When these studies had been completed a further memorandumcould be prepared as a basis for the Cabinefs resumed discussion ofthis question.The Cabinet Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to arrange for officials to carry out further studies of this problem on thelines indicated by the Prime Minister.Egypt- 3.   The Cabinet were informed that financial discussions with(Previous        representatives of the Egyptian Government had now been resumedp per??7f no j in Rome.   These discussion were exploratory in character.   TheConclusions     Dasis on which the Treasury representative was proposing to proceedMinute 1.) &apos;    was set out in paragraph 4 of Rome telegram No. 695.   It should however be understood that he would not at this stage seek to commitHer Majesty&apos;s Government to any final agreement; and that, inparticular, he would not be authorised to conclude even a provisionalarrangement on the basis indicated in paragraph 4 (e) of thattelegram, viz., releasing some part of Egypt&apos;s blocked sterling balances against the deposit of a corresponding sum by Egypt withsome neutral international body.The Cabinet Noted the basis on which financial discussions were being conducted in Rome with representatives of the egyptian government.1. The Prime Minister said that he was concerned at the courseof the current discussions on future relations between this countryand Malta. The Prime Minister of Malta, Mr. Mintoff, had now putforward further financial demands; and, in addition, there were newaspects of the proposal for political integration which seemed likelyto give rise to serious difficulty. It was possible that Mr. Mintoffmight be seeking a pretext for breaking off the negotiations. If so,it was desirable that our position should be stated to him in terms which would command the approval of Government supporters inthis country. The Prime Minister therefore proposed to prepare, inconsultation with the Colonial Secretary, a written statement of theposition of the United Kingdom Government on the points recentlyraised in these discussions. This could be incorporated in a letter which he would send to Mr. Mintoff.The Cabinet Took note with approval of this statement by the PrimeMinister.
Atomic Energy.(previous reference :CC. (57) 77thConclusions,Minute 5.)Accident atWindscalePlant.4. The Prime Minister recalled that the Atomic energy authority had appointed a Committee, under the chairmanship ofSir William Penney, to investigate thecause of the. accident which had occurred on 10th October at the plutonium plant at wind scale. Thereport of this enquiry had now been submitted. It was a highly-technical document dealing, with the design and operation of a defence installation, and it was written in language whichpresupposed considerable knowledge of the technology of thisparticular plant. The Prime Minister said that, after a careful study ofthe report, he had come to the conclusion that it would not be in thepublic interest to publish it. It had, however, disclosed some defectsof organisation and some shortcomings, in the technical procedures for carrying out the particular operation! which was in progress whenthe accident occurred: He had therefore decided that these matters,together with the general arrangements for safeguarding health and safety, should be the subject of a further enquiry to be carried out under the chairmanship of Sir Alexander Fleck, the Chairman of theImperial Chemical Industries, Limited. Sir Alexander Fleck had agreed to undertake this task, and his report would be prepared ina form suitable for publication.The Prime Minister said that he proposed to present toParliament on 8th November a White Paper which would contain a summary of Sir William Penney &apos;s findings on the cause of the accident, the report of the , Medical Research Council on the precautions taken to safeguard health and safety, and a report bythe Atomic Energy Authority indicating in general terms the natureof the deficiencies disclosed by the accident and recommending thata review should now be made of organisation and procedures with aview to reducing the risk of any similar accident in the future. Itwould be stated in the White Paper that Sir Alexander Fleck had agreed to undertake this review..In discussion there&apos; was general agreement with the course which the Prime Minister proposed to take. It was stated, in replyto questions, that the White Paper would include a detailedexplanation of the reasons why it was improbable that an accidentof this type could occur at Calder Hall or at any of the reactors to be erected under the programme for the production of nuclear energyfor civil purposes.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would present toParliament on 8th November a White Paper on the causes of the recent accident at the plutonium plant at wind scale.Wages Policy.(previous reference :CC. (57) 77thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Prime Minister said that his statement on theGovernments attitude towards wage claims, which he had made inthe debate in the House of Commons on the previous day, hadprovoked relatively little controversy in the House and seemed on thewhole to have been well received by the Press. While he was convinced that the Government should adhere firmly to their policyin practice, he doubted whether they would gain by prolonging publicdebate on it. In the event their policy would be judged by its results;and further political controversy at this stage was unlikely to bringany advantage. He proposed that a short statement should beprepared defining the main elements in the Governmenfs attitude;and that this should be made available for use by Ministers and other government speakers for the purpose, not of prolonging debate onthis question, but of ensuring that consistent answers were given tothe questions which were still likely to be raised.

secret.C. 78 (57)The Cabinet-Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister of Labour, the paymaster-General and other Ministers directly concerned,to prepare a draft statement of the Governmenfs attitudetowards wage claims on the lines indicated by the PrimeMinister.*   541Parliament. 6.   The Cabinet discussed the arrangements for handling theremainder of the Debate on the Address in the House of Commons.They were also informed of the business to be taken in the House ofCommons in the following week.ForeignAffairs.Syria.(previous reference :C.C. (57) 73rdConclusions,. Minute 1.)Suez Canal.(previous reference :C.C. (57) 70thConclusions,Minute 4.)7. The Foreign Secretary said that the Iraq petroleum company (I.P.C.) were proposing to extend the oil pipeline throughSyria at a cost of some  15 millions. The Shell Company had asked whether Her Majesty&apos;s Government would wish them, in viewof their interest in the I.P.C., to support this proposal. Since the project should benefit Iraq and should not prejudice the separateproposals for the construction of an alternative pipeline throughTurkey, there was no reason why we should discourage the shell company from participating in it; and he proposed that they shouldbe advised accordingly.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to inform the shell company that, so far as Her Majesty&apos;s Government were concerned, they were at liberty to support the proposal by the Iraq Petroleum Company for the extension of the oil pipeline through Syria.The Foreign Secretary said that it would shortly be necessary todecide what policy we should adopt during the forthcoming debate in the United Nations on the report of the Secretary-Generalproposing that the cost of clearing the Suez Canal should be recovered by means of a surcharge of 3 per cent, on Canal dues.We should need to discuss our tactics with the French Governmentand to ascertain whether the United States Government would seeobjection to our abstaining on the vote on this proposal. We shouldnot, however, court the risk that our abstention might cause theSecretary-GeneraPs proposals to fail to receive the necessary majority vote and so revive pressure in the United Nations for the whole costof clearance to be borne by the French Government and ourselves.On balance, therefore, it seemed probable that it would be to our advantage to vote in favour of the Secretary-Generafs proposalsrather than to abstain.The Minister of Transport said that this course would beregarded by our own shipowners as a betrayal of their interests.They would be liable either to press for reimbursement of theproposed surcharge or to refuse to pay it. In the latter event, the egyptians might seek to deny them the right of passage of the Canal,and a delicate situation would then arise.In discussion there was general agreement that it would, on balance, be to our advantage that the Secretary-GeneraPs proposals should be approved. Further thought should be given, however, tothe best means of so presenting these proposals to our own shipownersthat they would accept them with the minimum of complaint.
The Cabinet (2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theMinister of Transport, to give further consideration to themanner in which the United Kingdom attitude towardsthe proposals by the Secretary-General of the UtiitedNations for the recovery of the costs of the clearance ofthe Suez Canal might be framed in order to enlist, as faras possible, the support of United Kingdom shipownersfor those proposals.Defence Policy.       8.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the(Previous        Minister of Defence (C. (57) 257) on recruitment for the ArmedReference:       FnrresCC. (57) 54th ^0rCCS-Conclusions, The Minister of Defence said that, if the objective of all-regularMinute 3.)      forces of 375,000 was to be achieved by 1962, the average entry of recruitment for adult long-term recruits would need to be 27,000 a year up to thethe Armed      encj Qf 1952 and 22,500 a year thereafter.   Since April this year the111 &quot; annual rate of entry on long-service engagements for all three services had been no more than 10,000. The latest figures had,however, been more encouraging. The number of recruits inSeptember had been higher than in the corresponding period in 1956,and the provisional figures for October, following the abolition ofthe three-year Army engagement, suggested that the annual rate of long-term engagements might be doubled. But a total increaseof about 50 per cent, in long-term entries would be required if all-regular forces of the planned size were to be achieved. the willingness of men and women to join the Services was influenced bya wide variety of factors and it was difficult to assess the relativeweight to be attached to each of them in present conditions. Withthe agreement of the Service Ministers he had therefore decidedto set up an independent committee under the chairmanship ofSir James Grigg to advise on the long-term measures needed to attractand retain sufficient men in the Forces. In the meantime, someinterim action was needed to stimulate recruitment. He had therefore suggested that Service pay should be increased to restore the ratioto civilian wages established in February 1956 and that variousdisparities and anomalies in allowances should be removed. these measures would cost about  39 millions in 1958-59. In addition itwould be important to show that the problem of providing betterbarracks and more married quarters was being tackled withdetermination. This would involve an annual expenditure of about 10-15 millions. He realised the difficulties of giving any pay increase to the Services at this juncture but he thought it would be impossibleto achieve the objective of all-regular forces if Service pay wassignificantly lower than the average of civilian wages.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that more men werevolunteering for service in the Navy than were required for thepresent planned total of 80,000 in 1962. The Navy would be ableto recruit about 10,000 more volunteers than were at present wantedby that date. In his view the most important factor in recruitmentwas to establish clearly the future roles of the Services and to provide them with good equipment. The necessary volunteers would thenbe forthcoming.The Secretary of State for War said that the number of long-term recruits was at present about 1,200 a month, compared with theaverage of 1,850 a month required if the target figure of an all-regularforce of 165,000 by 1962 was achieved. Delay in tackling theproblem of closing this gap would make it more difficult to achieve the objective and might well increase the ultimate cost. An early announcement should be made of the Governmenfs intention to
improve Service conditions. This might conveniently be done in thecourse of the debate on defence in the House of Commons on thefollowing day. An increase in pay would have a significant effect,at least in the short term. If, however, any increase in pay had tobe deferred in view of the general economic position of the country,it would be the more important to remove the anomalies andinjustices in the system of allowances, particularly those for married men who could not be provided with married quarters. In thelong term, improvements in accommodation would probably havethe greatest effect in stimulating recruitment. Married quarters forthe Army were at present inadequate, and most of the barracks werein a deplorable state. An early start should be made on a programme for improving these conditions.The Secretary of State for Air said that the recruitment of apprentices was satisfactory and there were adequate numbers of re-engagements by men already in the Royal Air Force. Initialentries on long-term engagements were, however, about 25 per cent,below the figure required to achieve the planned size of the RoyalAir Force in 1962. Though in general accommodation in theRoyal Air Force was better than in the Army, some improvementswere needed; and, if the present gap in long-term recruitment wasto be closed, measures on the lines proposed by the Minister ofDefence were necessary.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was doubtfulwhether all-regular forces of 375,000 could be achieved whateverincreases in pay were given. If all-regular forces . could not be recruited, the alternatives would be. either to continue some formof conscription or to reduce the Services&apos; commitments. On the payproposals, he had been disturbed at the premature publication inthe Press of details of the proposals prepared by the Services. he understood that an enquiry was being made into this. Even an interim pay increase for the Services would at this stage undermine the Governmenfs attempt to curb inflation. The most that shouldbe announced publicly was that the question of any pay increaseswas being considered. Decision should be deferred at least untilFebruary, when the extent and effect of the current round of wage claims in industry could be assessed and any announcements aboutincreases in pay could be related to the reshaping of the Servicesand their equipment in the light of the special studies which theDefence Committee had agreed should be undertaken. Some ofthe proposals for adjustments in allowances appeared to be no morethan indirect pay increases. He could not agree to any increases inallowances until there had been further consideration of the needfor them and the amounts involved, had been firmly established.He agreed, however, that some provision should, be made for theimprovement of barrack accommodation and the provision of married quarters, but this should be within the ceiling proposed for the Defence Budget. He was also concerned about the proposalto set up an independent committee. He would have thought thatthis proposal would have been brought to the Cabinet for approval in principle before the Government were committed to it. If such acommittee were to be appointed it would be important to ensurethat their terms of reference made it clear that they were not requiredto consider rates of pay nor, in particular, what rates of pay wouldbe required to achieve all-regular forces of any given size.In further discussion the following points were made:  &apos;(a)&apos;It would be incompatible with the objectives of recruitingall-regular forces to turn away volunteers for the Navy. Furtherconsideration was already being given to the question of adjustingthe role of the Navy in relation to the other two Services as part ofthe special studies initiated by the Defence Committee.
(b) Further consideration might be given to the possibility ofobtaining recruits from oversea territories and particularly from theColonies. In the past such recruitment had been limited by the ruling that units recruited overseas could only be used within theterritory concerned.(c) There was general agreement that any interim pay increase for the Services should be deferred until the beginning of 1958, whenfull information about the Defence Estimates would be available.Doubts were expressed about the advisability of proceeding with thebuilding programmes of the Services in view of the heavy cuts that had recently been made in civilian investment. On the other handsuch a programme, particularly if it were within the agreed ceilingfor the Defence Budget, could be justified as part of the effort toreduce the present armed forces from a total of 750,000 to all-regular forces of about half that size.(d) It would not be possible at this stage to reverse thearrangements which had already been made to set up theindependent committee under Sir James Grigg&apos;s chairmanship. Thefact that such an independent enquiry had been made might be helpful to the Government, if it subsequently became apparent thatsome form of conscription had to be continued owing to a short-fallin volunteers. The terms of reference should, however, be discussed between the Minister of Defence and the Chancellor of the Exchequerand submitted to the Prime Minister for approval.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theGovernment could not at this stage abandon the attempt to provideall-regular forces by 1962. It might, however, be prudent to initiatediscreetly a study of the action which could be taken if it subsequentlybecame apparent that the planned size of the forces could not beachieved by voluntary recruitment. Any interim increase in service pay and allowances should be deferred until the beginning of 1958,when it could be considered in the general context of the defence estimates. Meanwhile, further study should be given to the questionof allowances, particularly those which could be regarded as partof the arrangements for providing adequate accommodation for service personnel. A programme for the improvement of barracks and married quarters should also be prepared. In the course of thedefence debate on the following day it could be stated that theGovernment were studying the question of pay and allowances forthe Services but that no decision had yet been reached, and thatthe Government proposed to go ahead with a steady programme for improving accommodation for the Services. Certain improvements in uniform and clothing were also being considered. A reference in general terms might also be made to the setting up of thecommittee under Sir James Grigg&apos;s chairmanship but the Ministerof Defence should agree the terms of this reference with theChancellor of the Exchequer.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the proposals for increasing Service pay and allowances should be considered further when the fullDefence Estimates for 1958-59 were discussed.(2) Agreed in principle that a programme for improving barrackaccommodation and married quarters for the services should be prepared within the agreed Defence budget and invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and the service ministers, to arrange for such a detailed programme tobe prepared.(3) Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with theService Ministers, to take account of the points noted inparagraphs (a) and (b) above in their studies of the futuredefence programmes-
Cyprus. 9.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Foreign(Previous Secretary and the Minister of State for Colonial Affairs (C. (57) 258)Reference: on a request that the Sub-Commission of the European CommissionConclusions on Human Rights should be granted facilities to visit Cyprus for minute 1.) &apos; trie purpose of investigating Greek allegations that the administrationEuropean 0* tne Isiand was being conducted in a manner which constituted aCommission on breach of the European Human Rights Convention.Human Rights. ^ Foreign Secretary said that it would be difficult for theinvestigators to refrain from concluding, in accordance with theterms of Article 15 of the Convention, that there was in Cyprus astate of emergency or public danger sufficient to justify the impositionof emergency measures. Investigation of the circumstances in whichthe curfew regulations were applied was unlikely to lead to anydamaging disclosures. It would seriously prejudice the presentation of our case in the forthcoming debate on Cyprus in the Assemblyof the United Nations if we refused to afford the facilities sought,and the Solicitor-General had advised that there were no adequatelegal grounds for doing so. Therefore, despite the risks involved,he had come reluctantly to the conclusion that it would be expedient to accord these facilities.There was also a possibility that facilities might be sought at alater stage to investigate allegations of ill-treatment of persons in cyprus. While we remained responsible for law and order in Cyprus,we could not allow these allegations to be the subject of aninternational investigation on the spot. This request, if it were made,must be firmly resisted.The Minister of State for Colonial Affairs said that the colonial secretary was in agreement with the views expressed by the foreign secretary.In discussion there was general agreement that, in a choice ofevils, the course proposed by the Foreign Secretary should beadopted. It would be damaging to our interests in the united nations if we now repudiated our obligations under this human rights Convention.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the proposals in paragraphs 7 (v) and 10 ofC. (57) 258.Tripartite The  Foreign Secretary said that  he  proposed to informConference. jyf Spaak, the Secretary-General of the North Atlantic treaty organisation, who was now in London, that we were still concerned that he should use his good offices to promote a tripartite conferenceon the future of Cyprus in the New Year. He would, however,attempt to discourage M. Spaak from continuing to pursue theproposal for an independent Cyprus as a possible basis of settlement.Our objective must remain to secure the deferment of a decision onthe international status of Cyprus for a prescribed period of years.The concept of a condominium for Cyprus might provide the basisof a settlement for the intervening period; and consideration mightbe given to a proposal that Turkey as well as the United kingdom should retain enclaves in Cyprus for defence purposes.(4) Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to prepare terms ofreference for the independent committee under Sir JamesGrigg&apos;s chairmanship and to submit them for the PrimeMinisters approval
The Cabinet-(2) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to discuss with theSecretary-General of the North Atlantic treaty organisation, on the basis which he had outlined, thepossibility of convening a tripartite conference on thefuture of Cyprus.international labour organisation.(previous reference:CC. (57) 43rdConclusions,Minute 6.)10, The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Labour (C. (57) 259) on the considerations affecting the ratification of four Conventions adopted by the International LabourConference.It was proposed to ratify Convention No. 105 concerning theabolition of forced labour, as the law and practice of the UnitedKingdom were already fully in accord with its requirements. It wasnot practicable to ratify Convention No. 104 concerning the abolitionof penal sanctions for breaches of contract of employment by nativeworkers in dependent territories; but it could be stated that the basic principles of Recommendation 100, concerning the protection ofmigrant workers in under-developed countries, were generally acceptable to the majority of the Governments of our non-metropolitan territories. Recommendation 102, concerning welfarefacilities for workers, could be accepted with reservations.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Labour to present a White Paperannouncing the proposals outlined in C. (57) 259.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,6th November, 1957.
