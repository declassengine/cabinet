Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.The Cabinet were also informed that the Opposition might askfor facilities for a general debate on foreign affairs before theforthcoming meeting of the North Atlantic Council, and that thestate of Parliamentary business would permit of such a debate being held on llth December. In discussion it was agreed that it would be preferable to avoid holding this debate until after the christmas recess though the demand for an earlier discussion might have tobe conceded if it were strongly pressed.SexualOffences.(previous reference:CC. (54) 29thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Cabinet were informed that on 4th December the Houseof Lords were to debate the recommendations made in the report ofthe Committee on Homosexual Offences and Prostitution. It wouldbe convenient if some indication could then be given of the government&apos;s attitude towards the report.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet that, while legislation might be introduced in the current session to give effect to some of the Committee&apos;s recommendations on prostitution, it would not be practicable for the Government topromote legislation at the present time to change the law relating tohomosexual offences. On that subject public opinion was dividedand strong views were held; and there was not a sufficient measureof public support for the Committee&apos;s recommendations to justifythe Government in introducing legislation to give effect to them. Onthe other hand it would be premature for the Government to announce a final decision on this point in the forthcoming debate inthe House of Lords, since Ministers had previously indicated that theywould wish to take account of the general state of opinion in theHouse of Commons before reaching their final conclusion.The Cabinet Authorised the Lord Chancellor to indicate, in the debate in the House of Lords on 4th December, that there wasno early prospect of Government legislation to amend thelaw relating to homosexual offences.Hebrides. 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisterRocket Range Q^ Defence (C. (57) 285) about the facilities required for Service trialsand training with guided weapons.The Minister of Defence said that, in the light of the policy announced in the Defence White Paper, it now appeared that adequate facilities for training with air-to-air and surface-to-air weaponscould be provided, for a period of some five years ahead, by extendingtwo existing ranges on the Welsh coast at a cost of about  2^ millions.Additional facilities in the Hebrides would then be needed only fortraining with surface-to-surface guided weapons and could beprovided at a total cost of about  1-8 millions. These revised arrangements would provide the facilities required for a totalexpenditure of  4 millions instead of the  18 millions which was theestimated cost of implementing the original proposal to establish a range in the Hebrides for all Service trials and training with guided weapons.SECRET52720-4 b 2Joint 1.   The Cabinet were informed that the Joint Intelligenceintelligence      Committee  had  been  brought  within the Cabinet committeeCommittee.      structure so that its services might be more readily available to, Ministers as well as to the Chiefs of Staff.  Arrangements would bemade for a selection of the Committee&apos;s reports to be circulated, as appropriate, either to Ministers generally or to those directly concerned with the subject matter.
In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Although the new proposals might provide adequate facilities for all guided weapons likely to be developed within the foreseeable future, the need might eventually arise for an extendedrange in the Hebrides. This contingency should perhaps be recognised in the public announcement of the revised proposals.(b) Even if the Service Departments were prepared to accept the limitations imposed on the use of the Welsh ranges by the need toavoid endangering shipping, it would be necessary to discuss this aspect of the proposals with the shipping interests in more detailbefore it could be established that these ranges would provide anadequate substitute for facilities in the Hebrides.(c) The planning authorities in Wales should also be given anopportunity to consider whether the revised proposals would be acceptable from the point of view of the preservation of Welshamenities.(d) The decisions on these questions would affect the area of landin the Hebrides to be purchased under the revised plan and thecompensation to be awarded to the crofters. It was undesirable thatthe Government should acquire land for which they had no immediateuse. On the other hand negotiations had already proceeded to apoint at which the Government might be morally committed tocompleting the purchase of all the land for which they had beentreating. The expense involved in the acquisition of the land itself would be relatively small and, if there was any substantial possibility that the limited facilities which it was now proposed to provide in theHebrides might need to be extended within the next few years, itmight be expedient to complete the negotiations for acquiring title tothe necessary land, provided that no pressure was brought to bearon any owner who was unwilling to sell. On this hypothesis thereneed be no question of compensating crofters who would not bedisturbed in their use of the land untiTthe range facilities were extended beyond the limits at present envisaged.(e) The Scottish Land Court would begin to consider the claims of crofters in the near future. Pending any public announcement ofa change in policy, the Court should, if possible, be induced to dealfirst with the claims of those crofters who would be affected by themore limited range which was now proposed.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposals in C. (57) 28J!&quot;(2) Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State forScotland and the Minister of Transport, to consider urgently the points raised in their discussion with a viewto settling those issues which needed to be determinedbefore guidance could be given to the Scottish Land court and a satisfactory ^Parliamentary announcement of theGovernment^ decision could be drafted.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Health (C. (57) 280) and a memorandum by the Minister of Labour(C. (57) 287) about the wage dispute in the National Health Service.The Minister of Health said that the deputation from the whitley council for the administrative and clerical staffs of the national health Service which was due to meet the Secretary of State forScotland and himself in the following week would probably seek toascertain whether the Government would accept arbitration on the wage claim which the responsible Ministers had recently rejected.The Law Officers had advised that, if a dispute between the ministers and the Staff Side was formally reported, the matter could be referred,with the consent of those Ministers, to arbitration under the IndustrialWages Policy.national health Service.(previous reference:CC. (57) 81stConclusions,Minute 2.)
SECRETCourts Act, 1919. It also seemed possible for the Staff Side tosecure arbitration under the Industrial Disputes Order, 1951, if theissue was presented as a dispute between an individual hospitalauthority and their employees. The latter course was, however, opento the objection that the respondents would have no interest inrepresenting the Governments point of view. The balance ofadvantage therefore appeared to lie in conceding arbitration betweenthe Staff Side and the responsible Ministers under the Act of 1919;and he sought authority to inform the deputation, if they pressed for an assurance on this point, that the Ministers concerned wouldconsent to arbitration and would undertake to implement the award.The Minister of Labour said that if, as was not unlikely, the Arbitrator awarded a wage increase of the order of 4 per cent., theeffect on other wage claims would be very damaging. Moreover, itwas constitutionally improper to place upon arbitrators theresponsibility of deciding whether a Minister had been right in hisuse of his Ministerial prerogative. Arbitration should therefore be avoided in the present case, but the staffs should be assured that their claim would be reviewed within a stated period. In order to avoid any impression that wage restraint generally could be relaxed after this interval, the review should be linked with consideration of theproposals contained in the recent report by Sir Noel Hall on thegrading structure of administrative and clerical staffs in the hospital service. These proposals would in any case have to be discussed with the Staff Side, and if the review of the wage claim formed partof those discussions, such increase as the Government might thenfeel able to grant could be represented as only one element in a comprehensive reorganisation of the administrative structure ofthe Service.In discussion it was suggested that, in so far as a reorganisation of this kind was itself liable to entail considerable additional expenditure, it would be preferable that the Government should notimplicitly commit themselves to accepting it without first considering whether the administrative structure of the Hospital Service could be improved by other means at less cost. On the other hand Sir NoelHall&apos;s report had now been published; the Government would therefore be compelled in any case to reach decisions on its recommendations; and it would be tactically advantageous if the disputed wage claim could be subsumed in the discussions with theStaff Side which would precede those decisions.In further discussion it was emphasised that it had already beenmade clear to the Staff Side that the Government did not excludearbitration on the disputed claim if an arbitrable issue was established.The Government should seek to avoid creating the impression thatthey were not now prepared to honour this undertaking, and if theStaff Side pressed for the issue to be referred to arbitration it wouldbe difficult for the responsible Ministers to withhold their consent.But there was considerable advantage in deferring the settlement ofthis claim, if possible, until it had become clear how far, in thelight of the Governmenfs current economic policy, the major industrial unions were prepared to prosecute the substantial wage claims which they had in preparation. The deputation should therefore be strongly urged to accept the Governmenfs suggestionthat their claim should be reviewed in the context of the discussions on the recommendations in Sir Noel Hall&apos;s report; and, if theycontinued to seek a firm undertaking that the Ministers concerned would agree that the issue should be referred to arbitration, theyshould be informed that, if they would submit in writing their owndefinition of the arbitrable issue, the Government would give thematter further consideration.The Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Ministerof Health to be guided, at their forthcoming meeting withthe Whitley Council deputation from the National health service, by the views expressed in their discussion.
Suez Canal.(previous reference;CC. (57) 78thConclusions,Minute 7.)6. The Foreign Secretary said that, as a result of consultationsheld with other interested Governments, it was now clear that weshould find it even more difficult than we had previously thought to abstain from supporting in the United Nations a resolution endorsingthe proposal of the Secretary-General that the cost of clearing the suez Canal should be recovered by means of a surcharge on canal dues. There was some risk that the resolution might not be carriedunless we supported it; and the Governments of the United Statesand France had made it clear that they would not be content for usto abstain from voting.The Minister of Transport said that he had held further consultations with representatives of British shipowners and had warned them that we might find it necessary, for political reasons,to support this resolution. He no longer wished to oppose that course if the Foreign Secretary felt obliged to take it. But he warned the Cabinet that British ship-owners would ask that the extra cost tothem should be reimbursed by the Exchequer and that, if this requestwere refused, some of them might decline to pay the surcharge.In discussion it was agreed that no decision need be taken atpresent on the Governments attitude towards such a claim by british ship-owners. There would be strong arguments against conceding it.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to authorise the UnitedKingdom Representative at the United Nations to vote infavour of the resolution proposing that the cost of clearing the Suez Canal should be recovered by means of a surcharge on Canal dues.Privileges and immunities.(previous reference:CC. (57) 15thConclusions,Minute 7.)commission for technical co-operation in Africa.7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary and the Colonial Secretary (C. (57) 279) proposing that the privileges and immunities set out in the appendix to that memorandum should be extended to the Commission for Technical Co-operation in africa south of the Sahara.The Cabinet Approved the proposals put forward in C. (57) 279.Cabinet Office, SWA,28th November, 1957.
