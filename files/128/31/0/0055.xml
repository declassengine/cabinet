It would be important that Government expenditure next&quot;year should be kept within the total provided in the current year&apos;estimates and that all inescapable increases should be met byoffsetting economies. At the same time the restriction of creditshould be maintained; and, pending a general review of the investment.... programme, no further proposals involving significant increases in public investment should be accepted. Existing methods of creditrestriction had probably been taken very near the limit of what could/ ^ be achieved by voluntary methods. The Government should not seek to interfere with price changes which resulted from recent increases in. : costs; but public employers and the nationalised industries should be encouraged to concede no further increases in wages and salaries,whether direct or indirect, until further notice. Action of this kind would be.more likely to be effective than haphazard adjustments ofthe investment programme at short notice or arbitrary increases in taxation. In addition, however, the general public should be encouraged and assisted to appreciate the connection betweenincreases in costs, particularly wages, and the consequential increases in prices; and for this purpose the Government should adhere to their earlier proposal to establish a new advisory body on wages and prices.Measures of this kind constituted the most appropriate actionwhich the Government could take within the existing framework oftheir economic policy. Indeed, no other course was open to themunless they were prepared to adopt a wholly different approach to theproblem of inflation and to have recourse to such measures as direct control over the monetary system. Control over the supply of money at its source had hitherto been regarded as inconsistent with their political principles. The extent to which such measures would haveto be pressed in order to achieve the desired result was often under-estimated; If they were adopted, there would be pressure to use themin the public as well as in the private sector.&apos;&apos;irThe Minister of Labour said that it would be dangerous toover-estimate the effectiveness of any influence which the Governmentcould exert in wage negotiations. The theory that increases in wagesmerely provoked further increases in prices was not acceptable to thetrade unions, who regarded the former as justified by, rather than thecause of, the latter.  In the light of the new movement of expansion, in the economy and the rising level of profits, it was unrealistic to suppose that the unions would be easily persuaded of the need for:    &quot; . &quot;wage restraint.   In these circumstances it would be unwise to seek to influence public employers and the nationalised industries againstthe grant of any further increases in wages and salaries, especially since levels of remuneration were often fixed by arbitration proceduresover which neither the Government nor the employers had any* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.52050-2 B 2
f ;       4:&apos;.control. It would be undesirable that the Government should be seen to be adopting a partisan attitude in the settlement of wage claihis&apos;orappear to be making common cause with the employers against theinterests of the work-people. Such influence as.the Government could safely exert in this matter should be brought to bear through informalcontacts with the leaders of both sides of industry, through suitablepublic speeches by Government spokesmen from time to time, and through a continuing effort to secure that future wage settlementsshould recognise the need for a reasonable period of wage stabilitybefore fresh claims were put forward and should incorporateprovisions looking to the gradual elimination of restrictive practices.On the other hand, it was urged that it was impossible for theGovernment to adopt a wholly neutral attitude on so critical an issue as the relation between wages and prices. Whatever the methodsemployed, the Government should go as far as possible in thedirection of influencing public employers and the nationalised industries to concede no further increases in wages and salaries andshould, in particular, seek to reassure employers generally that, if they stood firm against claims for such increases, they would have the full support of the Government. It would not necessarily be politicallydisadvantageous if, as a result, labour discontent culminated in astrike. An inter-departmental enquiry into the probable consequences of a strike in one or more of the major industries had recently beencompleted, and the report of this enquiry would be relevant to the government&apos;s attitude towards any labour unrest which might develop during the autumn. Without prejudice to the conclusions ofthis report, however, it could be argued that the risk of a strike mightwell need to be accepted if a more realistic wages policy was to beestablished. At present, neither the employers nor the unions were seriously affected by inflation. It was the relatively small, thoughpolitically significant, section of the community living on fixedincomes which suffered from the continuing decline in the purchasingpower of the pound. In order, therefore, to convince the greatmajority of public opinion of the folly of exaggerated wage claims, itmight be necessary, sooner or later, for the Government to face andovercome a major strike in a case where a claim was wholly anddemonstrably unjustified. Against this contingency, however, itwould be desirable to ensure that the standing inter-departmentalmachinery for dealing with emergencies of this nature was ready for action, if necessary; and consideration might also be given to the most desirable pattern of distribution of supplies of essential commoditiesthroughout the country.Discussion showed that there was general agreement that, in themeantime, while the Government should maintain their practice of notintervening in individual wage disputes, public employers, nationalised industries and private industry should be advised that it was the government&apos;s view that wage increases unrelated to increases in production were damaging to the economy.The suggestion was also made that consideration might now begiven to the possibility of introducing some measures of direct control,both over imports and possibly over the monetary system as a whole.On the other hand, it was argued that control over imports would tendto increase, rather than diminish, the inflationary pressure, while theuse of the Governmenfs power to issue directions to the clearing banks would be so contrary to the economic policy with which theGovernment was identified that it could not lightly be contemplated.Finally, it was recognised that, although Government expenditure should be limited as strictly as possible, it could not be reducedwithout unwelcome consequences, both social and economic. Tosome extent, criticism of the level of Government expenditure wasartificially stimulated by the Press and diverted the attention of thegeneral public from the cardinal issue of wages policy.   It would
2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Transport (C. (57) 170) on the allegations of administrativeincompetence and waste which had been brought against the british transport Commission (B.T.C.) by a Mr. Gethin, one of their formersenior employees.CM. (56) 67thConclusions, The Minister of Transport said that he was satisfied, afterMinute 4.) &apos; discussion with the Chairman of the B.T.C., that the Commission^purchasing policy was . soundly devised and that a report on mr. Gethin&apos;s allegations which the Commission were about to submit to him would effectively disprove the charges of inefficiency and waste.It would, however, be desirable that both the allegations and theCommission^ rebuttal should be submitted to independent scrutiny.He therefore proposed to arrange that the B.T.C. should themselvessuggest, as they were willing to do, that their report should besubmitted to independent verification. This investigation would becarried out by a financial expert of acknowledged standing, and itwould be desirable that his findings should, if possible, be madeavailable to Parliament before the summer recess.The Cabinet were in general agreement with this proposal. Itwould, however, be preferable to avoid any impression that theproposed investigation would be carried out in a perfunctory manner;and it should therefore suffice, at the present stage, merely to announce that the matter would be submitted to independent enquiry.BriJishTransportCommission.(previous reference :perhaps be desirable to take steps to inform the public moreaccurately of the disadvantages which they would suffer if Govern-ment expenditure were drastically reduced and of the extent to whichinflationary pressure was caused primarily by increases in wages notmatched by corresponding increases in output.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that there might be room for an intensification of the restriction of credit in theprivate sector, and the possibilities of action to this end should beconsidered. In particular, the evasion of capital issues control bymeans of &quot; take over&quot; bids should be closely examined. the investment programme should be reviewed in the autumn, with a viewto ascertaining how far it could be extended over a rather longer period than was at present envisaged. The Cabinet would also need to consider whether it would be possible, in the last resort, for theGovernment to withstand industrial unrest on the scale of a widespread strike. In the meantime, however, all possible steps should be taken to encourage the growing awareness on the part ofthe general public of the inflationary risks of successive wage increasesnot matched by corresponding increases in production; and the work-people themselves should be helped to realise that it was in their own interests, and not merely to the advantage of the relatively smallsection of the community which was dependent on fixed incomes, to observe reasonable restraint in claims for increased remuneration.The Government should adhere to their general economic policy; inparticular, they should not relax its pressures as soon as some signs ofdisinflation began to appear.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of C. (57) 168.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider what&apos; further intensification of the restriction of credit in theprivate sector might be possible, particularly in connectionwith &quot; take over &quot; bids.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.
Ma,ta- 3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the(Previous Colonial Secretary (C. (57) 169) about the possible resumption ofReference :      negotiations with the Government of Malta.CC. (57) 43rdConclusions, The Colonial Secretary said that the arrival in London of the minute 9.) Prime Minister, Mr. Mintoff, suggested that the Maltese Governmentwere anxious to find a basis on which negotiations might be resumed.It was desirable that we should respond to any initiative of this kind.If so, however, it would be necessary to consider some modificationof the proposals which we had put forward in April. We must adhere to our stipulation that the United Kingdom Government could not guarantee the attainment of economic equivalence between Malta andthis country. If, however, Mr. Mintoff would accept this fundamentalcondition, we should be prepared to offer some improvement in the wording of the preamble to the proposed economic arrangements, a modest increase in the percentage grants for education and anarrangement for a biennial commission to review economic progress in malta.The Chancellor of the Exchequer expressed some doubts aboutthe wisdom of reopening negotiations on this basis. The proposedpreamble to the statement of the economic arrangements could be interpreted as almost tantamount to a guarantee of economicequivalence. The Maltese Government would concentrate their attention on ensuring that the efforts of any advisory commission to review progress were directed at transforming this implied guaranteeinto a reality.The Lord Chancellor said that, on the details of the new proposals, the proposed amendments to the wording of the preamble. would not affect its substance; the cost of the additional grant for education would amount to million a year for five years, and perhaps a somewhat larger sum thereafter; and the proposed new commission should have only an advisory status. It was essential,however, that the problem of Malta should be considered not in isolation, but in the context of the manifold difficulties which theWestern Powers were currently experiencing in the Mediterranean.There was no certain prospect as yet that stability would be restoredeither in Cyprus or in French North Africa; and in thesecircumstances it was incumbent on us to spare no reasonable effort to promote a settlement with Malta.In discussion there was general agreement that it would be wise to take advantage of the presence in London of the Prime Minister of malta to resume negotiations about the future of the Island.The Cabinet-Authorised the Colonial Secretary to resume negotiationswith the Prime Minister of Malta on the basis outlined inC. (57) 169.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Transport, taking into account the points made in their discussion, to announce inParliament in due course that the report of the british transport Commission on the allegations of administrativeincompetence and waste which had been brought against them would be submitted to independent verification.
