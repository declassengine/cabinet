LocalGovernmentFinance.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 7thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Local Government (C. (57) 24) covering the draft of a statementannouncing the Governments broad conclusions on the review oflocal government finance.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet would wish to consider carefully the terms in which their decision, if it favoured the proposalswhich had recently been under discussion, would be announced. Thatdecision was a grave one, involving major issues of policy; and theCabinet should appreciate the scope and force of the criticism whichthe Governments proposals might provoke.The Minister of Education said that, in his view, the policyimplicit in the draft announcement would be difficult to sustain.It would be impossible for him to maintain a relationship ofconfidence with local educational authorities unless some concessionwas made in educational expenditure as an offset to the present proposals. Moreover, it must be understood that, if these proposals were adopted, his statutory powers of direction would, from 1959onwards, have to be used more frequently and more positively thanat any time since the passing of the Education Act, 1944. If, however,the majority view of the Cabinet favoured the introduction of theproposals, he was prepared, subject to the reservations which he had indicated, to accept this decision.The President of the Board of Trade supported this statement.While he also was prepared to accept the majority view of theCabinet, he had considerable doubt whether it would prove possibleto sustain a policy which ran counter to the trend of development in other countries, where educational administration was becomingJordan. ].   The Foreign Secretary said that, in the negotiations about the(Previous termination of the Anglo-Jordan Treaty, satisfactory progress had reference: been made, with one exception, on all major points of interest to us.C.C. (57) 6th The Jordanian Government wished to publish in the form of a conclusions, declaration the heads of agreement that had already been established,?Minute 2.) and, subject to minor textual amendments, the draft contained in telegram No. 208 from Amman appeared to be acceptable to us sofar as concerned the date of termination of the Treaty and thearrangements for the withdrawal of British troops. The declaration would, however, contain no mention of over-flying and staging rights for aircraft, as this matter had not yet been raised in the negotiations.It was important that, agreement in principle having been already reached on most matters, we should not subsequently find ourselvesprecluded from raising the question of over-flying rights. he therefore proposed to instruct H.M. Ambassador at Amman to try to ensure that a suitable reference safeguarding our interests in thisrespect would be included either in the proposed declaration or ina separate exchange of letters. In the latter event it would be preferable that we should be free to publish the letters, since theultimate agreement on the question of over-flying rights would in anycase have to be published as part of the final Exchange of Notesending the Treaty.The Cabinet (1) Approved, subject to minor amendments, the draft declaration in telegram No. 208 from Amman, setting forth the heads of agreement established in thenegotiations with the Jordanian Government on thetermination of the Anglo-Jordan Treaty.12) Agreed that H.M. Ambassador at Amman should be instructed to press for satisfaction on the question ofover-flying and air-staging rights, with a view to theinclusion of a suitable reference to this subject either in theproposed declaration or in a separate exchange of letters.
progressively more centralised. This tendency was particularly important in higher education in science and technology, which couldonly be satisfactorily organised on a basis transcending the arbitraryboundaries of local education authorities.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that he felt grave doubtboth about the proposed re-rating of industry and about the introduc-tion of a general grant in place of specific grants. The theoreticalattractions of these proposals was clear; but, in practice, theirconsequences were likely to prove unwelcome in later years. Hewas particularly concerned about the probable effect on education in Scotland; and he associated himself with the views expressed bythe Minister of Education and the President of the Board of Trade.The Minister of Agriculture said that he too was sceptical aboutthe ultimate value of these proposals. They represented an attemptto reverse a trend of development which was probably by nowirreversible. He feared that local authorities had become, for practical purposes, agents of the central government; and that anyattempt to restore to them a status of relative independence whichthey had now largely forgotten was not likely to result in benefits to local government commensurate with the political criticism which the proposed changes would provoke. Nevertheless, withthese reservations, he was prepared to accept the majority view of theCabinet.On the other hand it was strongly argued that the proposals before the Cabinet offered the only opportunity of providing localauthorities with a fresh incentive to economic administration andof infusing greater life and reality into local government. in education, current expenditure, as distinct from capital investment,was extravagant and, in order to bring it under control, theGovernment would be compelled either to substitute a general grant for specific grants or to modify the percentages of the latter. Therewas little doubt that the former approach would constitute a greaterstimulus to economy and would be more effective in restoring tolocal authorities a desirable sense of responsibility. The Governmentcould no longer justify a position in which local authorities appearedto be independent but were in fact compelled to rely, for the greaterpart of their income, on grants from the Exchequer and were, as aresult, subject to an excessive degree of control. It should be possibleto rectify this anomalous situation without endangering thecentralised control which, at least in&apos; certain parts of the educationalservice, might well be desirable. From this point of view theproposals under consideration were consistent with the Governmentspolitical philosophy; and they were likely to be welcomed both bythe Governments supporters in local government and by those officers of local authorities who had at heart the genuine interestsof healthy and vigorous local admnistration.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theproposals before the Cabinet were clearly debatable, both on their merits and in terms of political advantage. Moreover, if they were introduced, the consequential legislation would make heavy demands upon the legislative time likely to be available in the 1957-58 session.Nevertheless, the majority view of the Cabinet clearly favoured theirQdot)tion.The Cabinet then turned to consider the draft, announcementappended to C. (57) 24. In discussion the following points weremade:  (a) It would be desirable to illustrate in more statistical detail the extent to which the financing of local expenditure as a whole had come to be increasingly dependent on grants from the Exchequer.(b) The announcement was likely to provoke questions aboutthe extent to which the Government would allow local authoritiesto retain the product of the proposed re-rating of industry and freighttransport to 50 per cent, of the net annual value.  It would be
5 CC. 9 (57)necessary to maintain at the outset that the whole of this productshould accrue to the Exchequer, but to be prepared to make some concession during the subsequent negotiations with the localauthorities.(c) Questions might also be expected about the Governmentslonger term intentions on the re-rating of industry and freighttransport. It was probable that industry could absorb, without greatdifficulty, the measure of re-rating now proposed; and it was forconsideration whether, if some compensating tax relief couldsimultaneously be granted, the re-rating of industry and freighttransport should not be established from the outset on a basis of100 per cent, of the net annual value. On the other hand the revaluation of house property in 1961 would impose a heavy additional rate burden on householders; and it was desirable tohold in reserve, as a possible means of easing that burden to someextent, any increase in the re-rating of industry and freight transportbeyond that now proposed. Questions on this point should thereforebe dealt with in such a way as to preserve for the Government themaximum freedom in subsequent action.(d) The general tone of the announcement should be modified in order to indicate that the main purpose of the governments proposals was less to secure economy in local expenditure than togive local authorities greater financial responsibility and, by providingthem with more scope for initiative and independent action, to restorelife and vigour to local government. In particular, paragraph 6 ofthe draft should be revised in order to remove the impression that,as a result of the Governments proposals, local authorities mightadopt a more parsimonious attitude towards the social services.(e) It should be made clear that specific grants would be retainedonly in those cases where the nature of the service involved made itinappropriate for the Exchequer contribution to its financing to besubsumed in the proposed general grant. It was suggested, in thisconnection, that technical education should, from the outset, be specifically excepted from the scope of the new proposals, on theground that it was essentially a service which transcended the boundaries of local education authorities and could therefore, besuitably financed only by means of a specific grant. On the otherhand, it was argued that it would be unwise to make any concession on a point of this kind before negotiations with the local authorities had started. It would be for consideration at a later stage whetherthe particular claims of technical education, if pressed by the localauthorities, could be singled out for exceptional treatment withoutestablishing a dangerous precedent in respect of other services.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposals for the reform of localgovernment finance outlined in CP. (56) 282.(2) Authorised the Minister of Local Government to announcethese proposals to Parliament in the terms of the statement annexed to C.(57) 24, as amended in the light of their discussion.Parliament. 3.   The Lord President said that there was a tendency forAmendments to Departments to be unwilling to accept amendments tabled in the bills in the      House of Lords to important Government Bills  which wereHouse of Lords introduced in that House, although the same or similar amendments&apos; were accepted later when the Bill had reached the House of Commons.Neither Government supporters nor Opposition Peers in the Houseof Lords could be expected to maintain interest in legislative workif the House, in considering Bills, was not permitted to debateamendments which were in themselves acceptable.The Home Secretary said that, with this in mind, he had already arranged for a suitable proportion of the amendments to the Shops
Cabinet Office, S.W.1.8th February, 1957.Bill, which had been introduced in the House of Lords, to be tabledwhile the Bill was in progress through that House.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that it was desirable that a suitable proportion ofacceptable amendments to Government Bills introduced in the House of Lords should be tabled in that House.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to advise Ministers in chargeof Government Bills accordingly.
