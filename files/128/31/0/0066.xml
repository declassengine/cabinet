52360-1&apos; I&apos;..,&apos;&apos;.&apos;.-. CC. 66 (57)Supply of 1.   The   Cabinet   had   before   them   memoranda   by   theVaccines.        Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Health (C. (57) 196 and 197)Poliomyelitis,   about the supply of vaccines against poliomyelitis and the Asian typeof influenza.The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Health, said thatvaccination against poliomyelitis was at present being offered to children up to the age of ten. There was a strong case on medical grounds for extending the offer to children Up to the age of fifteenand to expectant mothers. In order to secure sufficient supplies toenable the numbers involved to be vaccinated by the summer of 1958,the limited supply of vaccine of British manufacture should be supplemented by the import, as a temporary measure, of up to 5,000litres of Salk vaccine from Canada and, if necessary, from the UnitedStates.In discussion there was general agreement with these proposals.But in view of the residual risk which might still attach to the use ofthe Salk vaccine and the Governmenfs previous decision not to import it, the presentation of this decision would require carefulconsideration. It would be inadvisable that the public announcement should omit any reference to the unfortunate incident in 1955 whenthe use of the Salk vaccine in the United States had resulted in severaldeaths and a substantial number of cases of poliomyelitis. this incident was, indeed, one of the main reasons for the refusal of theGovernment hitherto to endorse the administration of the Salkvaccine in this country. Their present decision to import it could bejustified by the facts that in the last two years the means of testing ithad been improved; that it had been reduced in strength and had been used in America and in Canada without further mishap; and that each batch of imports would be subjected to further tests in thiscountry before being used. No person could be compelled, however,to be vaccinated with the Salk vaccine against his, or his parents&apos;,wishes; and the administrative arrangements should allow parents; to refuse the Salk vaccine if they preferred to wait until the Britishvaccine was available.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) The vaccine should be imported under Crown privilege(although the use of this term should be avoided) in order to obviatethe need to license it under the Therapeutic Substances Act. a licence under that Act would imply a degree of confidence in thepurity and potency of the vaccine which the Governmenfs medicaladvisers were unable to endorse. Importation under Crown privilege,on the other hand, would enable the Government to arrange forfurther testing of the imports before they were used.(b) Some 15 per cent, of present British production was nowbeing exported. This could, however, be justified on the grounds that the arrangement provided the basis of a valuable potentialexport trade, that the exporters were not subject to control and thatthe major part of the supplies exported was directed to countries,including other members of the Commonwealth, in which the incidence of poliomyelitis was more severe than in the UnitedKingdom.The Cabinet:-^-   ,   , -  .   -..(1) Approved the proposals in C, (57) 196,(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, inconsultation with the Minister of Labour and theParliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Health, to submit to the Prime Minister the draft of a public announcementof the Governmenfs decision.
The EconomicSituation.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 55thConclusions,Minute 1.)*2. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the PrimeMinister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (57) 194 and 195)about the economic situation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the reserves of gold and dollars had fallen by more than $200 millions in August andwould probably fall by as much again in September. These losses were partly due to speculation resulting from the devaluation of the franc and the present under-valuation of the Deutschmark; and thisspeculation Would be aggravated unless the Government were seen to be taking effective steps in support of sterling. He intended tomake plain, at the forthcoming meeting of the international monetary Fund (I.M.F.) in Washington, the Governmenfs intentionto maintain the present sterling-dollar rate of exchange at $2-80.But if this statement was to be effective, it was essential that he shouldbe able to announce, before he left for Washington, the correctivemeasures which the Government intended to take. The key to theproblem lay in restricting the supply of money. Ministers hadalready been asked to hold civil expenditure next year within thisyear&apos;s limits; defence expenditure for 1958-59 would have to be heldbelow a ceiling of  1,450 millions; and the utmost economy would need to be exercised in local government expenditure. His main proposals, however, were directed to restricting the flow of moneyinto investment, both in the public sector and in the private sector.Investment in the public sector should be limited to  1,500 millions in each of the years 1958-59 and 1959-60, involving a reduction of10 per cent, on the present programmes. In the private sector steps should be taken to ensure that bank advances were held some 5 percent, below the level reached in the preceding years. The means bywhich this objective might be achieved would require furtherconsideration in view of the limited statutory powers available tothe Government. In addition a further check should be imposed on consumption, preferably by an intensification of the restrictions uponhire purchase credit. The deposit for motor vehicles might be raised from 33  per cent, to the previous level of 50 per cent, and the twenty-four months&apos; repayment period for all goods might be reduced toeighteen months.The Home Secretary said that the price stability which hadcharacterised the period 1953-54 had been achieved as a result of the recession in 1952, the imposition of severe import restrictions, anincrease in the Bank Rate, and the provision of fresh incentives. Inpresent circumstances there could be no question of creating an artificial recession. Nor would it be appropriate to impose freshrestrictions on imports, although we should reserve our freedom todo so if, in the last resort, the balance of payments so required.Nevertheless, the proposed curtailment of investment was bound tobe criticised as jeopardising the future growth of output; and it was for consideration, therefore, whether consumer demand should be restricted rather more sharply than was suggested. Moreover, itwould be desirable that, before final approval was given to theInfluenza. The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Health, said that, sincesupplies of vaccine for use against the Asian type of influenza wouldbe limited in the near future, the output should be acquired by theGovernment in order that vaccination might be made available for hospital staffs, general practitioners and local health authority staffs,with a view to ensuring the continuance of essential health services in any epidemic of this kind.The Cabinet:-(3) Approved the proposals in C. (57) 197.
CC. 66 (57)suggested reduction in finance for investment, the implications interms of individual investment programmes should be more closelyexamined. A further adjustment of the Bank Rate might also benecessary for psychological reasons.The President of the Board of Trade doubted whether theproposals were adequate to the real problem. We were confrontedboth by the need to stabilise prices and by the need to reinstatesterling as a currency worth holding. If it were not for our inter-national banking liabilities, the disinflationary measures now proposedmight suffice to maintain the present exchange rate. In fact, however,the low level of our reserves in relation both to our earnings and tothe sterling balances made it doubtful whether any politically tolerablemeasures of the kind now contemplated could enable the rate to beheld. The impact of merely maintaining investment at the present level and reducing bank advances by 5 per cent, would be relativelyslight in view of the scale on which credit was being made available by other sources such as the building societies and the insurance companies. On the other hand, any really drastic reduction in thescale of investment would have serious results in the longer term.The fundamental problem was that international exchange rates werenot in a state of equilibrium. Some adjustment would probably prove to be essential, and we might be wiser to rely on such an adjustmentfor the solution of our problems. If so, we should make the necessarydispositions now.The Minister of Labour said that the index of retail prices would shortly show a fall of about a point. Moreover, unemployment wastending to rise while the number of unfilled vacancies was declining.These were encouraging signs. Nevertheless, the need to take actionin defence of sterling was clear, although the efficacy of the measures proposed and the speed with which they would take effect wereperhaps open to question. In particular, the suggestion that unemployment might need to rise to a level of 3 per cent, implied that, on average, some 700,000 people would be thrown out of work,a figure which might rise to about one million at the peak period ofthe year. The political implications of so sharp a rise in unemploy-ment could be serious. Moreover, it was doubtful whether the merecreation of unemployment would necessarily weaken the bargaining power of the trade unions. With these reservations, however, he supported in principle the proposals put forward by the Chancellorof the Exchequer. :The Minister of Housing said that, although he accepted, inprinciple, the need for action on the lines described by the Chancellorof the Exchequer, the proposed adjustment of the investment programme would have a serious effect on housing, particularly in the context of the Rent Act. A reduction in house building on the scalesuggested could probably not be achieved without the imposition ofa statutory building control. Moreover, it would be impossible forthe Government to carry out their pledge on slum clearance. It wasthe more important, therefore, that the reductions in investment should be generally spread: otherwise local pockets of severeunemployment might develop.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) The adoption of a floating exchange rate for sterling inpresent circumstances would imply, in effect^ its devaluation. Itwould imply also a policy of full convertibility; and to make sterlingfully convertible at a time when the Exchange rate was underpressure could have very serious consequences.(b) Hire-purchase credit constituted only a very small percentageof consumer expenditure. Further measures of restriction would,therefore, have little effect on consumption, while being at variance
with the Governmenfs recently declared intention tc stabilise hire-purchase terms on the present basis and imposing a fresh handicapon our export trade by weakening its home base.(c) The forthcoming reduction in defence expenditure shouldexert a powerful disinflationary effect.(d) Successful resistance to wage claims would do much tore-establish confidence in sterling. A critical case would shortly arise in respect of the British Transport Commission.(e). There might be advantage in reactivating the British Produc-tivity Council, to whose support the trade unions were already committed.(/) It would be desirable to consider whether fresh arrangements should be made to assist the Government not merely to take decisionsof policy on matters involving economic judgment but also to assessmore precisely the impact of various alternative courses of action.The Prime Minister said that the Government were confronted with two problems, the stabilisation of prices and the protection of sterling until it became possible to attempt an objective approach toa general realignment of world currencies. These were separateproblems, although action directed to one of them might wellcontribute to resolving the other. The proposals before the cabinet would need further consideration from this point of view. It wouldalso be helpful if the implications of the proposed curtailment of investment could be explored more fully with the Ministers primarily concerned, and if the methods by which bank advances would be restricted could be defined in greater detail.The public presentation of any measures on which theGovernment might decide would need careful consideration. Itwould be important not to dramatise the situation and to avoid any suggestion that the Government were unduly alarmed by recent developments. Our aim should be to establish general confidence that the Governments measures were in full conformity with theirpolicy of applying stimulus or restraint to the economy as circumstances required and effecting such adjustments by means of moderate and sustained pressure rather than by abrupt changes ofpolicy.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Ministers primarily concerned, to arrange for a more detailed examination of the implications of the proposedrestriction of finance for public sector investment.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider by whatmeans the proposed curtailment of bank advances mightbe most effectively achieved.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting,in the light of the result of the action taken underConclusions (1) and (2) above.3. The Home Secretary said that he proposed shortly to make an Order authorising a sixpenny surcharge on London taxi farespending a general review of the charging arrangements. With theexception of the temporary surcharge authorised during the recentpetrol rationing, taxi fares in London had remained unchanged since195.1.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.10th September, 1957.London TaxiFares.
