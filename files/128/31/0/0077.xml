Wages Policy.(previous reference :CC. (57) 74thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Cabinet had a general discussion on wages policy, withparticular reference to the machinery for settling wage disputes. Itwas emphasised that arbitration was commonly regarded as a meansof obtaining a settlement in a contest between management andlabour in the industry concerned without reference to the economic interests of the community as a whole. But in present inflationarycircumstances the cost of such settlements was defrayed, not by either of the parties to the arbitration, but by the consumer, in the form of higher prices which gave renewed stimulus to the inflationary pressure. The interest of the consumer was normally neitherrepresented at an arbitration nor taken into account in the settlement.If the Governmenfs disinflationary policies were to succeed, it was important that arbitration tribunals should give due weight to thenational interest as well as to the sectional interests of the partiesto the dispute, and that public opinion should comprehend thatthe financing of wage increases by means of rising prices or deficitsmade good by the Exchequer was to the ultimate advantage of nosection of the community. If tribunals could not be inducedthemselves to develop the practice of taking the public interest intoaccount, it might eventually prove necessary to provide for the directrepresentation of the interest of the consumer at arbitration hearings.Such a course would present considerable difficulty; but it was desirable, in order that the possibility might be further examined,that the Cabinet should be informed in more detail of the present arrangements for settling wages by arbitration or conciliation.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Labour to circulate a memorandumreviewing, in terms of constitution, functions and terms ofreference, the existing machinery for settling wage disputes.administrative veTribunals.(previous reference:CC. (57) 51stConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Cabinet had before them two memoranda by the LordChancellor (C. (57) 251 and 254) reviewing the recommendationsof the Committee on Administrative Tribunals and Enquiries the&quot; Franks Committee &quot; and recommending the line which should betaken in the forthcoming Parliamentary debate on the report of that committee.The Lord Chancellor said that the Committee of Ministers whohad examined the recommendations of the Franks Committee had given due weight to the primary considerations that, whateverchanges in procedure were adopted, the Government must continueto be able to discharge their responsibilities effectively, that excessivedelay in settling cases should be avoided, and that a just balanceshould be established between the respective interests of the citizenand the community. Nevertheless, the Committee had found nodifficulty in endorsing, without major qualification, some three-quarters of the recommendations in the report, including thoseprincipal recommendations which proposed the establishment of advisory Councils to supervise the activities and procedures of tribunials, and other recommendations which prescribed the principles which should govern the procedure to be followed both beforetribunals and in enquiries. It was proposed that only four of theninety-five recommendations in the report should be rejected. Therecommendation that legal aid should be provided for appearancesbefore tribunals could not be accepted, and the recommendation that parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed that the business of the Houseof Commons in the first week of the new session would be devotedto the Debate on the Address, which would be continued into thesecond week.
costs should be awarded more generously presented considerabledifficulty. This matter would need to be referred to the Council onTribunals. The proposal that Ministers should be under an obligation to provide a statement of policy related to each casecoming to a hearing was unacceptable as it stood. Therecommendation which was addressed to the procedures to beemployed by the Service Departments in acquiring land was alsounacceptable; but it had been possible to devise a compromise proposal which was in general conformity with the principlesenunciated in the report.The Minister of Housing said that, while it would be impracticable to provide, as the report recommended, a statementof Ministerial policy related to each case coming to enquiry, he intended to take steps to make more generally known the policies which he was pursuing in particular matters. Although therecommendation that an appeal should be provided against thedecision of Rent Tribunals was acceptable in principle, there wouldbe no advantage in undertaking to give early effect to thisrecommendation since it should be possible to discontinue thesetribunals during 1959. If this proved impracticable, consideration would be given to transferring their jurisdiction to the County Courts.Finally, certain individual points in the summary of conclusionsannexed to C. (57) 254 would need more detailed consideration beforethe Governmenfs policy could be publicly announced.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) It was agreed that the proposal that Ministers shoulddelegate their powers of adjudication in minor cases should be rejected as inconsistent with the proper discharge of ministerial responsibility.(b) In regard to the acquisition of land by the service departments, the Franks Committee had been anachronistic in attempting to base their proposals on a distinction between peacetimeconditions and an approaching emergency. It was proposed, as analternative course, that the individual owner or occupier should beprovided with a statutory right of objection and a right to a privatehearing conducted by an independent person appointed by the LordChancellor, or, in Scotland, by the Secretary of State. This proposal was acceptable to the Service Departments.(c) No undertaking should be given in debate that the award of costs would be considered sympathetically in certain types of case.(d) It could be stated that the recommendations in the reportrelating to the functions of the County Agricultural ExecutiveCommittees and the jurisdiction of agricultural tribunals were acceptable in principle, despite the fact that the prospective legislation to amend the Agriculture Acts would make it unnecessary to givedirect effect to some of these recommendations.(e) A decision not to appoint a separate Council on Tribunalsfor Scotland could be justified on the grounds that the majority of tribunials were common to Great Britain as a whole and that it was desirable to avoid either the risk of divergent practices or the needfor joint sittings of two Councils. Within the single Councilexclusively Scottish matters could be entrusted to a panel of Scottishmembers.(/) A considerable proportion of the acceptable recommenda-tions in the report could be put into effect by administrative action.For the rest, Parliament should be informed that consideration wasbeing given to the introduction of legislation in due course. TheGovernment should remain uncommitted, however, on the timing ofthis legislation since, apart from the Bill which would be requiredto provide for the establishment of a Council on Tribunals, it was unlikely that time would be found in the forthcoming session forfurther legislation concerned exclusively with the recommendationsof the Franks Committee.
4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Power (C. (57) 252) about the Britannia aircraft.The Minister of Power said that he was in a position to submitan interim report from the Committee which the Cabinet hadconstituted under his chairmanship to examine what further steps could be taken to ensure the satisfactory development of theBritannia aircraft. If a solution of the icing problems could be foundonly in a major re-design of the air intake of the engine, it would be some time before the future of the aircraft could be predicted withany certainty. Recently, however, an alternative approach to theproblem had been adopted, and there was good reason to hope thatflight trials, to be held in the near future, would establish, by aboutthe middle of December, that the technical problems could be overcome more rapidly than had originally been feared. In the lightof this possibility, it would be reasonable that both the Governmentand the British Overseas Airways Corporation (B.O.A.C.) shouldtake steps to relieve the immediate financial embarrassment of the bristol Aeroplane Company. It was therefore proposed that certainpayments by the Government to the Company should be accelerated,that the levy payments owed by the Company to the Governmentin respect of the Governmenfs expenditure on the development ofthe Britannia aircraft should be deferred, and that the Governmentshould meet the cost of testing the new air-intake system which was expected to solve the icing problems in the near future. TheChairman of B.O.A.C., for his part, had agreed to recommend to hisBoard that, pending the results of these tests, the Corporation shouldcontinue to accept further deliveries of Britannia aircraft up to theend of the year and that, without prejudice to subsequent claims on both sides, they should make certain payments on account to theCompany in respect of former flying trials and of certain sumspreviously withheld. These arrangements should enable theCompany to confine their overdraft within the limit specified bytheir bankers until the results of the tests of the new air-intake systemwere known. It would then be necessary for the Government to review the situation afresh in the light of these results and to decide what further action might be necessary. The Committee of ministers which had been dealing with this question should therefore remainin being, in order to keep the situation under review and to reportagain to the Cabinet as necessary.In discussion there was general agreement with this course ofaction.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (57) 252.Civil Aviation.BritanniaAircraft.(previous reference :CC. (57) 73rdConclusions,Minute 2.)CC. 77 (57)(g) The implementation of these proposals would make it moredifficult to give effect to the Governmenfs policy of progressivelyreducing the numbers of Government staffs.(h) Parliament should be informed that the question ofcompensation, on which the Franks Committee had commented, wasunder consideration but that immediate action on this complexmatter could not be expected.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed, subject to any necessary re-examination of points of detail, the conclusions in C. (57) 25.1 and 254 on therecommendations of the Committee on administrative tribunals and Enquiries.(2) Invited the Home Secretary and the Attorney-General to be guided in the forthcoming Parliamentary debate by theconclusions set out in these memoranda and by the points made in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion.
The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, whileit was not inappropriate that a Government should seek to strengthenits reserves by borrowing from abroad oh its own general credit, itwas more objectionable that it should attempt to do so on thesecurity of specific assets of national value. While the case for contracting a dollar loan was, in principle, a strong one, thearrangement could be contemplated only if certain conditions werefulfilled. In particular, the loan should be essentially a transactionbetween the public undertaking concerned and the lenders, of whomthe Bank should be the major partner and the market issue should contribute as small an element as possible.   Moreover, it shouldNuclear Power. 5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theI.B.R.D. Loan. Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (57) 253) about the possibility of(Previous contracting a loan from the International Bank for ReconstructionReference: and Development (I.B.R.D.) to assist in financing the UnitedConclusions7111 kingdom nuclear power programme.Minute 4.) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had ascertained that the I.B.R.D. would be willing to make a loan of $50 millions for local currency expenditure incurred in connection with the nuclear power programme, provided that this loan was matched by a market issue of the same order in New York. It might alsobe possible to arrange for similar loans in succeeding years, varyingin amount according to the circumstances of the time. In the lightof our liabilities in respect of external debt service over the years immediately ahead, we should not neglect any opportunity toincrease our reserves; and a loan on the terms which the I.B.R.D.were prepared to contemplate would represent a valuablereinforcement of our capital resources.The Minister of Power said that there could be no guarantee that the initial loan would be followed by similar loans in subsequent years; and it would be unwise, for the sake of an initial loan of only$100 millions, to acquiesce in an arrangement which would be liableto be interpreted as implying that we were surrendering our advantage over the United States in terms of civil nuclear powerdevelopment and would aggravate the public disquiet, which was already evident, about the possible effects on our nuclear power programme of the recent economies in public investment. The loanwould not satisfy the normal criterion that borrowing from abroadshould increase our productive resources by meeting the foreign exchange content of an investment programme or financing thesupply of technical information which we could not otherwisecommand. We did not need to obtain from the United States eitherequipment or technical information for our nuclear power programme; and the proposed loan would therefore imply that, inorder to increase our liquid reserves, we were prepared to pledge anational asset which was of unique value from the point of view ofBritish prestige abroad.In discussion it was agreed that a loan of the kind now contemplated would provoke a critical reaction from public opinion in this country, particularly in so far as it comprised a market issue in New York. On the other hand the reinforcement of our reserveswas now one of the foremost objectives of the Governmenfseconomic policy and constituted the criterion by which financialopinion abroad would judge whether that policy was likely to succeed in maintaining the value of sterling. It would be unwise to shrinkfrom the decisions which this policy required merely because theywould evoke some public criticism. Moreover, the new conception of the inter-dependence of the United Kingdom and the UnitedStates, which had emerged from the recent discussions between thePrime Minister and President Eisenhower in Washington, should reduce to some extent the force of the objections which might otherwise have been urged against the proposal.
LondonTrafficCongestion.Park LaneScheme.(previous reference :C.C. (57) 14thConclusions,Minute 10.)6. The Minister of Transport said that, after further reflectionon the scheme for major road improvements in the neighbourhoodof Hyde Park, he was satisfied that a solution of the traffic congestion in this area of London would become impossible unless the proposedworks were put in hand as rapidly as possible. The scheme, whichthe Cabinet had already endorsed in principle, had been approvedby the Road Research Laboratory; and it should be possible to overcome most of the objections which the Royal Fine ArtsCommission had raised on grounds of amenity.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the original estimateof  1? millions for the completion of this scheme had now risen tosome  4-5 millions. It was for consideration whether our present economic circumstances constituted an opportune moment forembarking on a project of this magnitude. It was also open to question whether the Government^ reputation with the general public would benefit from the dislocation of traffic which would undoubtedly characterise the first year or two of the work beforethe scheme could yield any tangible advantages.In discussion it was agreed that, in view of the rate at which the traffic in the Hyde Park area was likely to increase, the balance ofadvantage lay in proceeding with the proposed scheme with theminimum of delay and that the general public would be less critical of the temporary dislocation of traffic if they had reason to hope thata significant relief of the general congestion in this area was in prospect.The Cabinet Agreed that the scheme for major road improvements to relieve traffic congestion in the neighbourhood of Hyde Parkshould proceed and that the necessary legislation shouldbe introduced in the forthcoming session.Agricultural 7.   The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the proposalsPolicy. in c. (57) 240 for the amendment of the Agriculture Acts and the(Previous       Agricultural Holdings Acts.Reference:C.C. (57) 75th The Minister of Agriculture said that the balance of argumentConclusions, was clearly in favour of proceeding with legislation for this purpose.Minute 3.) Despite the preference which the farmers&apos; organisations had expressed for the continuance of the present arrangements, it wouldbe impracticable to refrain from giving effect to the recommendationsof the Franks Committee on the functions of the County AgriculturalExecutive Committees and the jurisdiction of agricultural tribunals.Such action would, in any event, entail substantial amendment oftake the form primarily of a bond issue and should comprise theminimum of equity participation which might diminish our owncontrol over our nuclear power programme. The possibility of a revised arrangement of this kind should be explored further with theI.B.R.D.; and the Cabinet should also be informed whether fresh legislation would be needed to empower the Central electricity authority to contract a loan of this kind.The Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to examine thepossibility of revising, on the lines indicated by the PrimeMinister, the terms on which a loan might be obtainedfrom the International Bank for Reconstruction andDevelopment for the United Kingdom nuclear power programme.
Part II of the Agriculture Act, 1947. Moreover, the county committees were averse from undertaking the responsibility, whichwould then devolve on them, of conducting the prosecution of farmers before an independent tribunal, and Government supporters would prefer that the disciplinary powers should be repealed outright.As regards security of tenure, it would be wise to take advantageof the unexpected measure of agreement between farmers and land-owners which it had been possible to promote, particularly since theproposed legislation would make only a relatively slight readjustmentas between landlord and tenant. As regards rents, no valid objectioncould be raised against the proposal that they should be assessedon the basis of open market values. In that event agricultural rentsmight rise from an average of 50 per cent, above pre-war levels toan average of possibly 150 per cent, in excess of those levels, ascompared with a general rise in agricultural costs of some 300 percent. The proposals concerning security of tenure and rents wouldexcite little controversy between the agricultural interests directly affected. It had long been recognised that some adjustment of the agriculture legislation of 1947-^49 was overdue, and the amendments which he contemplated would be welcomed by government supporters.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in general agreement that it was both desirable and practicable to proceed with the comprehensive legislation proposed. Greater freedom for thelandowner as regards security of tenure and the level of rents couldbe expected to promote the efficiency of farming to an extent whichwould outweigh the additional cost which would fall upon theExchequer as a result of the fact that increased rents would, incertain cases, qualify for recovery in the annual review of farm prices. Provided that the criterion of open market value wasinterpreted with reasonable discretion, there was not likely to beany considerable opposition by the interests primarily affected to the government&apos;s proposals on agricultural rents.While the proposal to amend the existing law governing the succession to, and bequest of, agricultural tenancies in scotland would be energetically resisted by Scottish farmers, the GovernmenfsScottish supporters would be no less critical if the opportunity wasnot taken to remove the anomaly which the Agricultural HoldingsAct had inadvertently introduced into the law in this matter.The Cabinet Authorised the Secretary of State for Scotland and theMinister of Agriculture to prepare legislation, for introduction in the forthcoming session, to give effect to theproposals in C. (57) 240.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,31st October, 1957.
