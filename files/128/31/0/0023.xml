BermudaMeeting.(previous reference:CC. (57) 22ndConclusions,Minute 3.)3 CC. 23 (57)1. The Home Secretaryreadto the Cabinet telegram No. 92from the United Kingdom Delegation, Bermuda, in which the PrimeMinister summarised the main results of the discussions which heand the Foreign Secretary had held with President Eisenhower andMr. Dulles, and expressed his satisfaction at the progress which hadbeen made towards restoring the traditional relationship between thetwo countries.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary to send, on their behalf, a message of warm congratulation to the Prime Minister andthe Foreign Secretary on the outcome of the BermudaConference.Parliament. 2.   The Home Secretary informed the Cabinet of the business to be taken in the House of Commons in the following week. he pointed out, however, that it might be necessary to modify theseprovisional arrangements to accommodate a debate on the BermudaConference on 1st or 2nd April.Industrial 3.   The Minister of Labour said that there was good reason toDisputes.        hope that an early settlement of the dispute in the shipbuilding(Previous.        industry would be reached on the basis of a wage increase which reference:       might be no higher than 5 per cent., and that, as part of this settle-C.C. (57) 22nd   ment, the unions would undertake to promote no further wage claims,Conclusions,    either nationally or locally, for a period of at least a year and would minute 1.)       give satisfactory and precise assurances about productivity and restrictive practices.   A similar type of settlement might prove acceptable in the dispute in the engineering industry.   The unions would be pressed to give a comparable undertaking not to promotefurther wage claims for a period of at least a year; but it might not bepossible to obtain from them as detailed assurances on productivityas had been secured in the shipbuilding industry.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Minister of Transport said that the settlement of therailways dispute would probably follow broadly the pattern of theagreement reached in the shipbuilding industry, and the british transport Commission would seek to obtain correspondingassurances about productivity and the maintenance of wage stabilityfor a period. The new policy of the Transport Commission was to charge what the traffic would bear; and, although some railway charges would inevitably rise, the increase in wages should not befollowed by a general increase in charges of a kind which would destroy the value of the new assurances about productivity.(b) The Minister of Power said that the settlement would be reflected in an increase in the price of coal which would in turnreact further on railway costs. The result would be a renewedstimulus to inflationary pressure, which was to be deplored. It might,in any event, be necessary to allow the nationalised industries toincrease their prices to some extent, in order to reduce the scale oftheir borrowing.(c) Production in the motor-car industry had fallen and somerise in car prices was probably inevitable. The manufacturers, ifconfronted with increased charges for coal and steel and an increasein wages as a result of the engineering settlement, would welcomeguidance from the Government on the question whether they should raise their prices sufficiently to cover these additional costs as well.While it was inappropriate that the Government should expressany view on the price policy of an individual industry, it was
satisfactory that there were some indications that responsible trade5union leaders were beginning to doubt the wisdom of regarding theengineering industry, for purposes of wage bargaining, as a singleComprehensive Unit arid were likely to exert their influence in thedirection of devising a more selective basis for future wage negotiations.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the statement by the Minister., of Labour.. (2) Invited the Minister of Labour to keep the Prime minister informed of further progress in the negotiations in the shipbuilding and engineering industries.Cyprus. v: 4.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Colonial(Previous Secretary (C. (57) 77) classifying the principal powers under the reference: emergency regulations in Cyprus into those which should still beC.C. (57) 22nd retained for a period and those which could nOw be relaxed or conclusions, surrendered. They also had before them telegrams Nos. 52 and 53Minute 2.) from the Governor of Seychelles, Foreign Office telegrams Nos. 125and 126 to the United Kingdom Delegation, Bermuda, and telegrams nos. 88 and 89 from the United Kingdom Delegation, Bermuda.The Colonial Secretary said that Archbishop Makarios was now prepared to make an appeal to EOKA to declare the cessation of their:jI;.: operations &quot;given that the British Government will show a spiritof understanding &quot; by abolishing simultaneously the present stateof emergency, and by declaring an amnesty for all political offences.The Archbishop had subsequently made; it clear that, while he recognised the inconsistency between this, wording and his earlierundertaking to attach no reservations to his appeal, he was not:.. ,prepared to modify the text, partly because in the process of breaking the present deadlock both parties must be prepared to make concessions, and partly because a completely unconditional appeal for the cessation of EOKA terrorism might be interpreted by Cypriotopinion as an attempt on his part to secure his own liberty without regard to the interests of Cyprus.The Prime Minister had been informed of the terms of the archbishop&apos;s appeal and of the relaxations of the emergency regulations which the Governor of Cyprus was in any event preparedto make. These relaxations, although substantial, were not equivalentto the final termination of the state of emergency which the archbishop had in mind, since it would be necessary to retain for afurther period certain powers of arrest, search, detention, &amp;c. Inreply the Prime Minister had expressed the view that, on balance,the advantages of releasing the Archbishop would outweigh the disadvantages provided that it was made clear that there was nobargain between the Archbishop and Her Majesty&apos;s Government andthat it rested with the latter alone to decide when the state ofemergency should be brought finally to an end. The Prime minister had suggested that the announcement of the Governments decision should therefore be confined mainly to a statement that, althoughthe Government regarded the Archbishop&apos;s reply as unsatisfactory,the situation in Cyprus had improved sufficiently to enable them totake a liberal view of the conditional appeal which he had made;that he would accordingly be released as soon as a passage was available; and that, while there could be no question of an immediateabolition of the state of emergency in Cyprus, the emergency regulations would be.relaxed as and when, in the judgment of theGovernor, circumstances allowed.
In discussion it was argued, that, while a statement on thelines suggested by the Prime Minister would avoid any impression that the Government were prepared to bargain with the Archbishopabout the terms of his release, it might be regarded as giving undueprominence to the Archbishop and placing so little emphasis on the relaxation of the emergency regulations as to risk sacrificing theopportunity to reconcile uncommitted opinion in Cyprus and causingus, when the regulations were in due course relaxed, to appear to be acting under pressure. The draft of the proposed announcement should perhaps be reconsidered from this point of view. It was,however, recognised that, if the Archbishop was not released as soonas his appeal was made public, public opinion would react againstthe Government and the forces of terrorism in Cyprus would be considerably strengthened. &apos;The Lord President said that he was very doubtful of the wisdom of releasing Archbishop Makarios on the strength of a conditionalstatement. The relaxation of security measures which we already had in mind would not constitute a final termination of the state ofemergency, and it would be Open to the Archbishop, once he hadregained his liberty, to withdraw his offer on the ground that theconditions which he had specified had not been fulfilled, Publicopinion would then exert considerable pressure on the Governmentto avoid a resumption of violence: in Cyprus and we should be compelled to make successive further-concessions to the Archbishopuhtil the initiative would pass completely Into his hands.Moreover, the Archbishop&apos;s appeal referred, with approval, tothe statement by the Greek Government that they would not be willing to take part in a discussion of the Cyprus problem within theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and that talks shouldbe resumed directly between the United Kingdom Government andthe people of Cyprus in pursuance of the resolution of the united nations. In taking this attitude the Archbishop was claiming tonegotiate direct with the United Kingdom Government as the. chosenspokesman of Cypriot opinion. If we appeared to concede thispoint to him, we should sacrifice the advantages which might result from our attempt to deal separately, in NATO, with the internationalaspects of the Cyprus problem and we should give grave offence toour Turkish allies.The Lord President said that for these reasons he was unable to associate himself with the proposal that Archbishop Makarios should now be restored to liberty. The right course would be to make itclear that we were prepared to relax the present security measures tosome extent but not, in present circumstances, to bring the state ofemergency in Cyprus completely to an end. If Archbishop Makarioswas not willing to issue his appeal on this basis, he should continueto be detained in Seychelles on the understanding that, if hereconsidered his attitude, we should be prepared to implement our undertaking to set him at liberty, though not to allow him to returnto Cyprus for the time being.In discussion the following points were made-fa) Although we had made good progress in repressing terrorismin Cyprus, previous experience suggested that the final stages of a campaign of this nature were liable to be costly and protracted; andan imaginative gesture such as the release of the Archbishopappeared to offer the only prospect of ending the present deadlockwithout incurring a permanent legacy of bitterness and frustration. Itmight therefore be wise, in our statement of policy, to place the emphasis on our success in overcoming EOKA and on our ability, asa result, to take the generous initiative of releasing the Archbishop inspite of the conditional nature of his appeal. We should take pains tobe seen to be acting from a position of strength, while maintaining inforce a sufficient number of the emergency regulations to enable us
to keep the situation in Cyprus under control and deferring further discussions with the Archbishop, if possible, untii the conciliationprocedure of NATO had made some progress.(b) It might be desirable to defer the announcement of theGovernments intentions until the Prime Minister had returned. On: the other hand, although it would be inexpedient to publish the archbishop&apos;s appeal in advance of a statement of policy by theGovernment, the text of the appeal could not be withheld from public knowledge for more than a day or two.(c) Telegram No, 53 from Seychelles made it clear that the archbishop felt that, in his appeal, he had already gone further than was consistent with his position as leader of the Greek Cypriots.There was no hope, therefore, of persuading him to withdraw theconditions which he had attached to his appeal. In thesecircumstances it was for consideration whether we should publish the text of his appeal and undertake to consider releasing him after aperiod of a few months in which it would be possible to assesswhether EOKA had definitely abandoned their campaign of violence.Certainty on this point would never be possible, however, so longas we ourselves felt it necessary to maintain security measures onthe scale necessary for the protection of Our troops and themaintenance of public order in Cyprus. On the other hand, toabandon such measures and to proclaim a truce between theoperations on both sides would give EOKA the opportunity ofreorganising their forces and obtaining fresh supplies of arms.Moreover, the Archbishop had made it clear that, in his view, thenecessary action by himself and by the United Kingdom Governmentshould be simultaneous; and if we accepted his appeal but deferred for a time the implementation of our own undertaking to set him at liberty, he would be in a position to declare that we had obtainedhis statement by false pretences. If, however, we released him whenhe issued his appeal and relaxed certain of our security measures atthe same time we should provide convincing evidence of our good faith and should probably succeed in mobilising public opinion, bothin Cyprus and throughout the world, in favour of a cessation of violence and of a reasonable approach to the solution of the cyprus problem.(d) The Archbishop&apos;s appeal appeared also to be dependentupon our willingness to grant an amnesty for all political offences.The precise scope which the Archbishop envisaged for such an amnesty was not, however, certain. He had indicated, during earlier discussions before his detention, that he would be prepared to excludeindividuals who were responsible for the death of others; and opinion in Cyprus would probably tolerate, even after the release of the archbishop, the execution of any person found guilty of murder.But execution in respect of any offence falling short of murder wouldprobably provoke a violent reaction in Cyprus if, as soon as the archbishop was released, terrorism appeared to cease. Much would depend, therefore, on the extent to which it proved possible for theGovernor to exercise clemency in the case of outstanding capitalsentences, and on the date by which it might prove possible to grantan amnesty. If sufficient evidence was available that terrorism hadgenuinely ceased as a result of the Archbishop&apos;s release, it might be expedient to declare an amnesty after a few weeks.(e) In the opinion of H.M. Ambassador at Ankara the TurkishGovernment were exercised less by the prospect of the release ofArchbishop Makarios (provided that he did not return to Cyprus)than by the possibility that, after his release, he would have to beadmitted to formal discussions with the United KingdomGovernment, thus jeopardising the recent initiative by NATO. the resumption of constitutional discussions would not, in itself,necessarily alienate the Turkish Government since, if they succeeded,they would facilitate the implementation of Lord RadcliftVs proposals
- 7 CC. 23 (57)which the Turkish Government had already accepted in principlewhile, if they failed, it might be necessary to resort to a partition ofthe island which would also be not wholly unwelcome to Turkey.But it would probably be essential, if the Turkish Government werenot to be gravely offended, that in any discussions of this kindArchbishop Makarios should be treated as merely one among severalspokesmen of various sections of Cypriot opinion. It Would bedesirable that, before the Cabinet reached a final decision, the viewsof the Turkish Government on this point should be formallyascertained.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange that the views whichhad been expressed in their discussion should be reportedto the Prime Minister and that he should be informedthat the question was to be further discussed at a meetingof the Cabinet on 26th March.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to communicate to the PrimeMinister the draft of an announcement of the Govern-ment&apos;s policy revised on the lines suggested in their discussion.(3) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs(Mr. Ormsby-Gore) to instruct H.M. Ambassador atAnkara to obtain the views of the Turkish Governmenton the terms of the appeal by Archbishop Makarios andon the action which Her Majesty&apos;s Government had underconsideration.Malta.(previous reference:CM. (56) 59thConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theColonial Secretary (C. (57) 76) submitting for approval proposals about the provision of economic assistance to Malta within the framework of the proposed constitutional arrangements forintegrating Malta with the United Kingdom.The Colonial Secretary said that the Prime Minister of Malta,Mr. Mintoff, had put forward, during discussions in February,proposals for attaining parity in wages, social services and subsidieswhich would have involved the United Kingdom in expenditure ofthe order of  20- 30 millions a year, equivalent at present prices toan annual grant to Malta of  100 per head of population. Theseproposals were wholly unacceptable and, after consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, he had put forward more realisticcounter-proposals for financial assistance in connection with bothcapital development and current expenditure in Malta which might cost some  6 millions a year in the first quinquennial period. Thesecounter-proposals would fairly reflect the unique constitutional status of Malta under Mr. Mintoffs proposals for integration with theUnited Kingdom. If Mr. Mintoff rejected them and the constitutionaldiscussions broke down as a result, the Government would have thesupport of public opinion in this country.The Cabinet endorsed the proposals in C. (57) 76. The Ministerof Defence said that the revised defence programme would probablyinvolve a significant curtailment of Service expenditure in Malta.The Cabinet Authorised the Colonial Secretary, in consultation as necessary with the Lord Chancellor, to proceed on the lines proposed in C. (57) 76 in negotiating with the Prime Ministerof Malta on the question of economic equivalence.
-National/ - 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theInsurance. Minister of Pensions (C. (57) 75) on the recommendations of the(Previous National Insurance Advisory Committee about the payment of deathReference: grant under the National Insurance Scheme.         ;lThe Minister of Pensions said that the Advisory Committee hadbeen concerned, in their recommendations, to remove certainanomalies which had developed in the administration of this grant.They proposed that its payment should no longer be restricted bycontingencies of various kinds, but that it should be regarded as a straightforward benefit, payable on death to the next of kin or tothe executors. This was a reasonable proposal to which effect couldbe given by an amendment to the National Insurance Bill at presentbefore Parliament. It was for consideration, however, whether on grounds of public policy, the Advisory Committee&apos;s recommendation that the grant should be paid in respect of the deaths of illegitimatechildren should be adopted.The Cabinet were of the opinion that all the recommendationsof the Advisory Committee should be accepted.The Cabinet , Authorised the Minister of Pensions to give effect to therecommendations of the National Insurance AdvisoryCommittee about death benefit by way of amendment tothe National Insurance Bill at present before Parliament.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,25th March, 1957.CC. (57). 13thConclusions,Minute 2.)Death Grant.
