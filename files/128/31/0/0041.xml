9)hiHouse of Lords 2. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the LordReform. President (C. (57) 110) and the Minister of Education (C. (57) 111)(Previous        about the reform of the House of Lords.CM^56?i04tb       The Lord President said that he nad regretfully come to the&apos; \ . conclusion that, in present circumstances, it would be wiser to adoptone conclusions, &amp; ^ess ambitious measure of reform than that envisaged in thetimUc &quot; comprehensive scheme originally proposed by Lord Salisbury. Hesuggested that legislation should be confined to making such changesas would remove the immediate dangers to the effective functioning of the Upper Chamber. For this purpose the Bill should authorisethe creation of life Peers, without any limitation on the numbers tobe created, and should take power to confer life Peerages on womenas well as on men. At the same time, arrangements should be madeto enable Peers to claim up to  4 or  5 a day for expenses incurred inconnection with attending the House of Lords. It was also forconsideration whether the House should not be invited to adopt newStanding Orders, on the lines of those recommended by the SwintonCommittee, requiring Peers who did not wish to attend the House toapply for leave of absence.The Minister of Education said that he agreed that a limited measure of reform on the lines indicated by the Lord President wouldbe preferable to the more comprehensive scheme which lord salisbury had favoured. It would be desirable, however, that thescope of the Governmenfs proposals should be sufficiently wide todeal also with the problems arising from the automatic hereditarysuccession to a Lordship of Parliament, a principle which the Houseof Lords had expressly disclaimed, and from the existing incapacityof a Peer to become or to remain a Member of the House ofCommons. He therefore proposed that the Bill should provide thata hereditary Peer should not automatically succeed to a seat in theHouse of Lords, but that the Crown should be empowered to issue to such a Peer, on his succession, a Writ of Summons entitling himto be a Lord of Parliament. The Bill should also provide that ahereditary Peer who received such a summons should not be disqualified thereby from election to the House of Commons, providedthat, if he accepted nomination as a candidate, he should not beentitled to sit or vote in the House of Lords during the life of the parliament in respect of which he had accepted nomination.In discussion there was general agreement that the limitedscheme of reform proposed by the Lord President was a moderateand practical proposal which should enable the Upper House to operate more effectively, without necessitating prolongedParliamentary debate on the more controversial principle of hereditary succession. For this reason it would be wiser to exclude from the Bill, as published, any supplementary proposals of the kind which the Minister of Education had suggested. There would be certain advantages in combining the Bill with an arrangement whereby the House of Lords would seek to secure, by means of newStanding Orders, a voluntary limit on the number of hereditary Peerswho might be expected to attend regularly the sittings of the House.Standing Orders of this kind would be a convenience to those Peerswho felt unable to take the Oath: and they would also assist inrebutting the probable criticism by the Opposition that the government&apos;s proposals were designed to perpetuate a majority forthe Conservative Party in the Upper House. On the other hand, theymight appear to reintroduce, to some extent, the principle of selection51570-5 B 2Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
from hereditary Peers which had been one of the most arguablefeatures of the more comprehensive scheme of reform, and theywould therefore be liable to be misrepresented as enabling the government&apos;s supporters, who would inevitably remain, for sometime, in a majority in a reformed House of Lords, to consolidate and strengthen their control over the Upper House. While, therefore,there would be no objection to the House of Lords, if they so wished,subsequently adopting revised Standing Orders of the kindrecommended by the Swinton Committee, it would be preferable thata proposal of this kind should not form part of the Governmenfsown scheme of reform.Discussion then turned to the procedure to be adopted for theintroduction of this scheme. Lord Salisbury and Lord Samuel were known to be anxious to initiate a debate on the reform of the Houseof Lords wthin the next few weeks. If the Governmenfs proposals were initially made public in the course of this debate but were notfollowed by legislation until the next session, the interval might beused by the Opposition, particularly at their annual Party Conferencein the autumn, to press for a more comprehensive scheme of reformor perhaps for the complete abolition of the House of Lords.Although the leaders of the Opposition might privately welcome any proposals which would ensure a reasonable reform of the upper house with the minimum of scope for controversy, they could not beexpected to be either able or willing to control those of their supporters who would favour a more drastic approach to thisquestion. It would be preferable, therefore, that the Governmenfslegislation should, if possible, be passed in the current session. Thiscourse would have the additional advantage that the Governmentwould probably need, in any case, to announce before the summer recess their proposals for increasing the remuneration of Membersof Parliament and junior Ministers; and, if the legislation for thispurpose could be introduced at much the same time as the Bill to reform the House of Lords, the Government could claim that theywere taking comprehensive action to secure, by a combination of practical measures, an improvement in the efficient functioning ofboth Houses of Parliament.On the other hand, the legislative programme for the remainder of the current session was already very heavy; and, even though theBill to reform the House of Lords would be a short and simplemeasure, it might provoke more debate than the Parliamentary time-table, as at present planned, could accommodate. If, on examination,this proved to be the case, it would be necessary to seek to persuade the sponsors of the forthcoming debate in the House of Lords toagree that this debate should be deferred to the end of the session,after the summer recess. This course would entail the disadvantagethat if, as was probable, it proved necessary for the Governmentto introduce, before the recess, measures to improve the remuneration of Members of Parliament and junior Ministers, it would be appropriate that their proposals as regards remuneration for Peersshould be disclosed at the same time; but, if these proposals werenot accompanied by any scheme for the moderate reform of theUpper House, there would be an increased risk that a more drasticscheme of reform would be canvassed at the Labour Party Conferencein the autumn.If, however, it proved impossible to persuade Lord Salisbury andLord Samuel to defer the forthcoming debate in the House of Lordsuntil after the summer recess, it would be necessary for theGovernment spokesmen in that debate, while undertaking to considerthe suggestions which would be advanced, to refrain from indicating the nature of the proposals which the Government themselves had inmind. In view of the obvious disadvantages of this course thepossibility of enacting the Bill recommended by the Lord Presidentbefore the summer recess should be urgently re-examined.
Further consideration should also be given to the scale ofpayments proposed for Peers, in the light of the fact that it might prove difficult to accept a daily payment as high as  4 or  5 as beingequivalent to no more than expenses necessarily incurred in attending the sittings of the House and, therefore, exempt from income tax.The Cabinet (1) Approved, in principle, the proposals for the reform of theHouse of Lords contained in C. (57) 110.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to examine, as a matter of urgency, the possibility of providing time in the legislative programme before the summer recess for a Bill to giveeffect to these proposals.(3) Invited the Lord President, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to give further considerationto the scale of payments proposed for Peers, in the lightof the possible liability of such payments to income tax.3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and the Minister of Labour (C. (57) 121) covering a further report by officials on the proposed Advisory Council on price Stability.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, despite the risks which might be involved in the creation of an Advisory Councilof the kind proposed, it was essential that the Government shouldtake a fresh initiative in attempting to solve the problem of reconciling full employment and price stability; and no courseoffered a better prospect of constructive results. While it wouldbe advisable that the Council should be an experimental body, itshould be given a reasonable expectation of life if it was to be ableto make the contribution which was expected of it. Its members should therefore be appointed for at least three years.Precise terms of reference were essential, if the Council was notto be free to survey the whole field of economic policy. In the lightof the Cabinefs earlier discussion and the importance of emphasising the positive aspect of the CouncfTs activities, the terms of reference might be as follows:  &quot; Having regard to the desirability of securing increasedstandards of life based on expanding production and stable prices,to keep under review changes in productivity, prices and the levelof incomes (including wages, salaries and profits), and to report fromtime to time on the significance of such changes.&quot;The first exploratory consultations with industry should beundertaken by senior officials. If the outcome of these discussionswas favourable, the proposals might be launched in more formalconsultations between Ministers and the three sides of industry.The Prime Minister said that if the period of appointment wasprescribed merely for the individual members, with power ofrenewal, the life of the Council itself might be left indeterminate.As regards the terms of reference it would be wise that they shouldmention full employment specifically, since its exclusion might invitethe suspicion that the Government intended to adopt a severelydeflationary policy as the means of achieving economic equilibrium.From this point of view, alternative terms of reference might read:  &quot; Having regard to the social desirability of maintaining full employment and securing increasing standards of living based onstable prices, to make periodical reports on the relation between theexpansion of production and the level of earnings, whether in theform of wages, salaries or profit margins.&quot;Wages and prices.(previous reference:CC. (57) 39thConclusions,.Minute 1.)
Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in agreement withthese proposals. It was suggested, however, that the body might beentitled a Commission rather than a Council; that the word&quot;advisory&quot; might be omitted from its description; and that itmight be known as the Commission on Production and Incomes.It was agreed that these suggestions should be further examined.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Labour,would arrange for further examination of the suggestions which had been made, during their discussion, about the title of the proposed advisory body.(2) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerof Labour, subject to Conclusion (1) above, to arrangefor exploratory discussions between senior officials and representatives of industry for the purpose of ascertaining the reactions of both sides of industry to the proposal tocreate such a body, and to report to the Cabinet.4. The President of the Board of Trade said that the PotatoMarketing Board, with the support of the National Farmers&apos; Union,were urging that a countervailing duty should be imposed, underthe Customs Duties (Dumping and Subsidies) Act, on imports ofnew potatoes from France which, for the second year in succession,were to receive a special export subsidy from the French Government.In consequence of the milder weather this year the season for newpotatoes had opened earlier than usual; the market price had alreadyfallen to about half the level in the previous year; and the Frenchsubsidy, while no longer directed, as in 1956, exclusively to the promotion of exports to this country, had been raised to a point where it was equivalent to about one-third of the current market,price. Although it was unfortunate that, at a time when we were concerned to secure the collaboration of the French Governmentin developing a free trade area in Europe, we should be forced toconsider imposing a countervailing duty on imports from France,there was no doubt that our own producers would be damaged bythe French subsidy and would look to the Government for protection.The French Government had been warned that, unless they withdrewthe subsidy, we should have no alternative but to impose acountervailing duty on 20th May. The French Ambassador inLondon had recommended that we should send an official to Paristo explain our position to the French Government.The Cabinet Authorised the President of the Board of Trade, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister of Agriculture, and subject to the approval ofthe Prime Minister, to make an Order on 20th May underthe Customs Duties (Dumping and Subsidies) Act, 1957,imposing a countervailing duty on imports of subsidisedFrench potatoes, if further efforts to induce the FrenchGovernment to withdraw the subsidy proved ineffective.commercial policy.(previous reference :CC.
