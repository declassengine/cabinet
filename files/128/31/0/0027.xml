Singapore.(previous reference :CC. (57) 15thConclusions,Minute 3.)3 CC. 27 (57)The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the colonial secretary (C. (57) 78) about the current negotiations on a newconstitution for Singapore.The Colonial Secretary said that he had been able to reach agreement with the Singapore delegation on all matters which theCabinet had considered to be fundamental, with two exceptions. Wehad proposed that we should be entitled to determine unilaterallywhat questions could properly be dealt with by the Internal security council, and that the United Kingdom representative should beempowered to require The Queen&apos;s representative to reserve for her majesty&apos;s pleasure any legislation which appeared to him to affect our ability to discharge our responsibilities for external affairs and defence. In each instance the Singapore delegation had claimed that,if they were to concede these stipulations in the form in which wesought them, they would expose themselves to the charge that theyhad agreed to the perpetuation of Colonial rule. They had therefore proposed that it should be for the Internal Security Council itself todecide whether a matter in dispute was a matter of internal securitywith which the Council could properly deal, and that the power of theUnited Kingdom&apos;s representative to require legislation to be reservedfor The Queen&apos;s pleasure should depend upon its being established,if necessary by a ruling of the Internal Security Council, that the issues involved were genuinely issues of defence and external affairs and not issues of internal security. In return for this proposedlimitation of our power of veto they had offered to incorporate inthe constitution additional sanctions compelling the Government of singapore to meet any requirements of the United KingdomGovernment which were shown to relate genuinely to defence and external affairs; and they had also proposed that, if the Governmentof Singapore failed to meet the obligations imposed on them either by a vote of the Internal Security Council or by a United Kingdomrequirement in the field reserved to us, the United kingdom representative should be empowered to require The Queen&apos;representative to make an Order, having the force of law, to ensurethat the obligations were met.As a result of these counter-proposals we should lose theunilateral veto which we had hoped to retain over the proceedings inthe Internal Security Council, and the effective decision in that council would be transferred to the representative of the Federationof Malaya who would enjoy a casting vote. Nevertheless the interestsof the Federation were likely to coincide with our own and it was probable that conservative elements would remain in power in malaya for a considerable time to come. We might therefore berisking relatively little if we accepted the proposals of the Singaporedelegation, while if we rejected them we should sacrifice the advantageof a settlement with good will. The Singapore delegation, which included the leader of the People&apos;s Action Party, comprised all the elements favourable to us in Singapore who were likely to command a majority there. If we failed to reach agreement with this delegationwe should be unable to achieve a satisfactory settlement with themore extreme elements who would replace them.In discussion the view was expressed that the weakening of ourdirect authority which was inherent in the counter-proposals of the singapore delegation carried potentially grave risks, particularly inconnection with any Bill affecting the functions of the police. It wasa major decision, profoundly affecting the interests of several members of the Commonwealth, to accept an arrangement underwhich our effective control of our last major base in the Far east would become dependent on the continued existence of a sympatheticGovernment in Malaya. It could be argued, from this point of view,that we should insist on an unqualified right to reserve legislation forHer Majesty&apos;s pleasure as we had done under the constitution ofNorthern Ireland.   On the other hand, we should be retaining in
Singapore, as we had not in Northern Ireland, the ultimate power to suspend the constitution itself; and, although it would be preferable to exercise that power with the support of the Internal security council, our rights of suspension would, juridically, be completelyunfettered. Moreover, the proposals of the delegation merelyreflected a continuance of the present state of affairs in Singapore.It had not recently been politically feasible for the Governor to contemplate reserving a Bill and he had had to rely, in the last resort,on the power to suspend the constitution. In a bona fide dispute inthe Internal Security Council, on which differing opinions mightlegitimately be held, we could reasonably count on the support ofthe Federation representative; while, if the dispute was motivatedby political considerations, the situation would, in any event, be onewhich could be dealt with only by the suspension of the constitution.There was no easy solution to the political problem of maintaining aBritish base in a remote territory peopled by an alien community, andif there was any prospect of achieving this objective by consent it wasin our interest to take advantage of it.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (57) 78.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,1st April, 1957.
