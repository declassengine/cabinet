Parliament.Wales.. -(previous reference:CC. (57) 4thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (C. (57) 284) outlining proposed modifications in theadministration of Welsh affairs.The Prime Minister said that there were no grounds for accepting the recommendation of the Council for Wales and Monmouthshirethat a Secretary of State for Wales should be appointed with executive responsibilities similar to those of the Secretary of Statefor Scotland. But it&quot; would be desirable, in order to allay Welshdisquiet, that a Minister of State for Welsh Affairs should beappointed and that further measures of administrative devolutionshould be introduced.The Minister for Welsh Affairs said that he supported theseproposals. In addition, he proposed to constitute a committee in wales to keep under review the economic interests of the Principality.Welsh opinion would regret the rejection of the more far-reachingrecommendations of the Council for Wales and Monmouthshire, butthe announcement of the measures proposed by the Prime minister would go some way towards allaying the sentiment of separatism in wales recently reinforced by the Liverpool Corporation Bill whichwould involve the flooding of the Tryweryn Valley in Merionethshire.The Governmenfs proposals would, however, carry even greaterconviction if they were accompanied by an announcement that responsibility for Welsh affairs would henceforward be entrusted to a minister with the status of Secretary of State.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in general agreementwith the proposals in C. (57) 284. Devolution of the functions of theMinister of Agriculture had already been carried as far as was practicable, subject to further review in the case of certain technicalservices. The administration of education was already in the handsof the local education authorities, and informed opinion in Walesrecognised that the interests of Welsh education would be betterserved if the Permanent Secretary of the Welsh Department in theMinistry of Education remained based on London rather than onCardiff. Nevertheless it would be desirable to work graduallytowards according a higher status to his office in Wales. Similarly,although there was little scope for local co-ordination of the functionsof the Ministry of Transport in Wales, the Minister should arrange to be represented in the Principality by a resident official of appropriate rank.Opinion was divided on the question whether, in addition to theappointment of the proposed Minister of State, the Minister for welsh affairs should be accorded the status of Secretary of State. It was undesirable in principle that an additional Secretary of State shouldbe appointed if the wide constitutional powers attaching to that office were not in fact needed for the discharge of the functions involved.The arrangement would rapidly be seen to imply no effective changein the administration of Welsh affairs and could be expected, for thisreason, to generate fresh pressure for the Secretary of State to be invested with executive responsibilities comparable with those of theSecretary of State for Scotland.   On the other hand public opinion52720-5b 21. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the, following week.If the forthcoming meeting of the North Atlantic Council was completed by 19th December, it would be possible to hold on that day the debate on foreign affairs which the Opposition wished tohave before Christmas. If not, a short debate could be arrangedon 20th December before Parliament adjourned for the recess.
Wages Policy.(previous reference:CC. (57) 82ndConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C. (57) 286) and the Minister of Labour (C. (57) 264)on wages policy.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Governmentshould adhere firmly to the economic policy which they had adopted and need take no further initiative for the time being. Nevertheless,they should avoid committing themselves in public statements to maintaining existing methods of arbitration and collective bargaining.If the awards of arbitrators proved to be more generous than couldbe justified in current economic circumstances, it might be necessaryto contemplate some modification of the present system of wagenegotiation; and officials should examine the suggestions which hehad made in this connection in his earlier memorandum (C. (57) 103).The Minister of Labour said that historically the function ofarbitrators was limited to the settlement of such disputes as were brought before them. Although it might be desirable that, in reaching their decisions, they should have regard to broadconsiderations of the public interest as well as to the merits of theindividual claims in dispute, it would be inadvisable that theGovernment should seek to bring any influence to bear on them forthis purpose apart from the general pressure of public opinion which government spokesmen could help to create.In discussion, some doubt was expressed about the wisdom ofthis course. It was the declared policy of the Government to allowdisputed wage claims to go to arbitration and, in those cases wherethey were themselves a party to the dispute, to accept the arbitrator^award. But arbitrators were liable to take a narrow view of their proper function and to feel that, in the absence of authoritativeguidance, they were not competent to take account of considerations of national economic policy in reaching their decisions. As a result,their awards might tend to be excessive and, in so far as they couldnot be absorbed by economies, would increase the demands on theExchequer. Moreover, the Government would appear to be allowingtheir own policy to be frustrated by their reluctance or inability to adapt the machinery of wage negotiation to the needs of current economic circumstances. It was for consideration, therefore, whethersteps should be taken to review this machinery and, in particular, tosecure that the public interest was specifically represented atarbitration hearings.On the other hand arbitrators would not be willing to accept anyfurther advice from official sources, apart from such impartialguidance as might be supplied by the periodical reports of the Councilon Productivity, Prices and Incomes. Nor could the government hope to control, in terms of wage settlements, more than a verysmall sector of the economy. It was unrealistic to envisage a wages policy which could be universally applied and effectively enforced.in Wales would attach considerable importance to the status of theMinister responsible for Welsh affairs, particularly since the LabourParty had already announced that they favoured the appointmentof a Secretary of State for Wales.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals in C. (57) 284.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would give furtherconsideration, in the light of the points made in their discussion, to the question of recommending theappointment of a Secretary of State for Welsh affairs.
4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Prime Minister(C. (57) 269) on the transaction of Government business.The Prime Minister said that the suggestions in this note were designed to reduce the growing burden on Ministers and to promote the more efficient discharge of the Governmenfs functions. It was particularly important to secure brevity in memoranda for theCabinet and Cabinet Committees. It was also desirable that ministers should seek to limit the social responsibilities which they accepted,on the lines which he had indicated in his note.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of C. (57) 269.The problem of wages must be approached empirically, each casebeing dealt with in the light of the relevant circumstances. Providedthat the pressure of monetary policy was maintained, the existing machinery of wage negotiation would be found to be adequate.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that certainissues needed more detailed examination. The concept of arbitration,for example, embraced not only the traditional method whereby wagedisputes were voluntarily submitted to an impartial adjudicationwhich was not legally binding on the parties but also the more recentprocedure provided by the Industrial Disputes Order, 1951, whereby the ruling of the arbitrator automatically became an implied term ofthe contract between the parties. It was for consideration how far this system might need to be modified in the light of the fact thatthe discipline of the price mechanism, which had formerly ensuredthat wage disputes would, in general, be settled on a reasonablebasis, was no longer effective. Was it possible for the Government to prescribe a wages policy applicable throughout the community as awhole or to encourage both sides of industry to adopt a policy ofthis kind? Alternatively, should the Government take steps toensure that arbitration tribunals were adequately informed about theeconomic considerations involved in disputed wage claims, either by means of the reports of the Council on Productivity, Prices and incomes or by some other method? Moreover, what changes in the whitley machinery might be justified in current circumstances. Itwould assist the Cabinefs further discussion of wages policy if theprinciples involved in these and related issues could be clarified, andhe would arrange for them to be further studied as rapidly as possible.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, that the Prime Minister would arrange for officials to examine, as a matter of urgency, the major issues of wages policy which had emerged during their discussion.
