1. The Prime Minister said that the Meeting of commonwealth prime Ministers, which had held its final session on 5th July, hadbeen a success. There had been no question of recrimination againstthe United Kingdom in connection with the events of the preceding year; indeed, there appeared to be a general recognition that in recent months the situation in the Middle East had considerably improved.Moreover, the Meeting had perhaps contributed to a certainrelaxation of tension between India and Pakistan; and its value hadbeen increased by the attendance of the new Prime Minister ofCanada, who had emerged as a man of considerable strength ofcharacter and purpose.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the success of theMeeting owed much to the skill with which the Prime Minister hadguided the discussions. The Prime Minister of Ghana had been particularly impressed by the spirit in which the Meeting had been conducted.In discussion it was suggested that the proposal of the PrimeMinister of Canada to increase the volume of trade between theUnited Kingdom and Canada offered potential opportunities whichthe United Kingdom should not neglect. A fresh appraisal of our proposals for the establishment of an industrial free trade area inEurope would need to be made in the light of the results of theMeeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers; and this review would need to take full account of the initiative by the Government ofCanada.Meeting ofCommonwealthPrimeMinisters, 1957.Foreign Affairs.Persia.(previous reference:CC.

The Foreign Secretary said that Persia had recently suffered a severe earthquake and that it would be desirable that the UnitedKingdom should make available such assistance as was possible,primarily in the form of tents and surgical equipment. He would discuss the scale of such assistance with the Chancellor of theExchequer.The Foreign Secretary said that the recent changes in theGovernment of the Soviet Union appeared to mark the elimination of the more reactionary forces. This would not necessarily resultin a change in the ultimate aims of Soviet foreign policy. Nor should it be assumed that the new regime would be any more stable thanits predecessor. Mr. Krushchev appeared to have emerged as the dominant personality for the time being; but he was of anunpredictable temperament and might no longer be restrained as effectively as hitherto by the need to compromise with points of view which differed from his own.It was for consideration whether, in the light of these changes,some action should be taken to ensure that a more representativeselection of Members of Parliament would take advantage of the invitations to visit the Soviet Union which were issued from time totime by the Soviet Government. It was also for consideration whether the Government should take steps to secure full publicity in this country for the report on events in Hungary by the SpecialCommittee of the General Assembly of the United Nations.In discussion it was agreed that, while no action should be takento encourage Members of Parliament to pay more frequent visits tothe Soviet Union, they should not be inhibited from doing so. Itwould be undesirable that the United Nations report on Hungaryshould be made the occasion of Government propaganda against theSoviet Union. It would be preferable to allow this document, whichwould be on sale to the general public, to speak for itself.
Irish Republic 3.   The Home Secretary said that the action of the Prime(Previous Minister of the Irish Republic in interning certain terrorists wasReferences: greatly to be welcomed.

The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ordnance       Minister of Supply (C. (57) 153) on the Royal Ordnance Factories.The Minister of Supply said that the reduction in the numberof Royal Ordnance Factories would have to be carried out in two stages. A preliminary assessment of the probable future demands from the Services indicated that at least seven of the existing twenty-three Royal Ordnance Factories would no longer be required. the capacity of the sixteen remaining factories would still be in excess of requirements, but the extent of the surplus could not be preciselydetermined until the Services had formulated their long-termprogrammes in the light of the current defence review. He therefore proposed that an early announcement should be made about the intended closure of the Royal Ordnance Factories at Swynnerton,Thorp Arch, Maltby and Irvine, where dismantling work would beginimmediately. In view of the uncertainty which had existed for sometime about the future of the tank factory at Dalmuir, theannouncement should also state that this factory would be closed down on the completion of the present programme late in 1958.The factories at Wigan and Poole would not be closed down until1959-60, and the announcement about their closure could thereforebe deferred until the further review had been carried out. TheLabour Party were likely to argue that these factories should beretained in State ownership and used for the production of civilequipment as in the years immediately after the last war. The royal ordnance Factories were not, however, equipped or organised for civil production, and it would be preferable to dispose of the siteswherever possible to industrial concerns. A limited amount of civil work might be undertaken when it would help to keep in being a nucleus of skilled labour required for an established defence needor when available capacity could be used to supplement a shortage in industry.In discussion there was general support for these proposals.Pressure for the retention of the factories for civil work should be resisted, since experience in the years after the last war had shownDisarmament. The Foreign Secretary said that the representative of the Soviet(Previous        Union on the Disarmament Sub-Committee had virtually rejectedReference:      the disarmament proposals which had been tabled by the UnitedC.C. (57) 46th States, the United Kingdom, Canada and France on 2nd July.  TheConclusions.)   Soviet Union would undoubtedly continue to press their proposalfor the immediate and unconditional suspension of all nuclear tests;and, if the deceptive simplicity of this proposal was not to attractundue attention, it would be undesirable to afford an opportunity for more than one Parliamentary debate on this subject before the summer recess.In discussion it was agreed that any Parliamentary debate on disarmament should, if possible, be deferred until the penultimateweek before the summer recess.
Aircraft 5.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the MinisterIndustry.        Qf Supply (C. (57) 154) and the Minister of Civil Aviation (C. (57) 159)about the future of the aircraft industry.The Minister of Supply said that the aircraft industry resembledthe nuclear power and electronics industries in that it had been the recipient of very considerable Exchequer assistance for researchwhich, though intended primarily for defence purposes, had been ofgreat benefit also to the civil sector of the industry. But, whereas the need for military research in nuclear power and electronics would continue, it would henceforward be reduced in the aircraft industry,which would then be faced with the problem of financing the researchwhich would continue to be necessary for civil purposes.   Somethat the Royal Ordnance Factories could not economically undertakecivil work except, to a limited extent, on sub-contract from industrial concerns.The Government were likely to be criticised for closing the filling factory at Swynnerton, since there would be difficulty in findingalternative employment for the labour displaced owing to the high rate of unemployment which already existed in the Potteries. Itwould, however, be uneconomic to close, instead of Swynnerton, the filling factory at Glascoed which was a more efficient productionunit. The arrangements recently agreed for providing financialassistance when workers had temporarily to be transferred from areas where unemployment arose suddenly would help to mitigate theeffects. It might, however, be necessary to consider further help for the industries in the Potteries. There would also be criticism of the decision to close the explosives factory at Irvine, but this criticism would be reduced if North Ayrshire were retained in theschedule of Development Areas.The inclusion of two of the three Scottish Ordnance factories in a first list of five factories to be closed would create an unfortunateimpression in Scotland. Discussions were taking place about thetransfer of the tank factory at Dalmuir to an industrial concern.An announcement about this transfer should, if possible, be made atthe same time as the announcement about the closure of the factory.The effects would be further mitigated if the initial announcementalso referred to the intended closure of the factories at Wigan andPoole. Although a reference to closures which would not take place for some two years would increase the risk that political pressure would build up against the decisions, it was reasonable that theGovernment should give as much advance notice as possible to their employees and should allow the maximum of opportunity for theconsideration of possible alternative uses for the factories. the initial announcement should, therefore, refer to all the seven factories.It would be desirable to expedite decisions about the closure offurther factories in order to obtain the economic benefits of the reductions in the effort at present devoted to defence. These furtherclosures would need to be discussed with the Services when their long-term programmes had been settled; but further announcementsshould be possible early in 1958.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the initial announcement about the intendedclosure of Royal Ordnance Factories should cover the seven factories listed in paragraph 4 of C. (57) 153.(2) Invited the Minister of Supply to consult the Secretary ofState for Scotland, the President of the Board of Tradeand the Minister of Labour about the terms of this announcement.(3) Subject to the modification recorded in Conclusion (1),approved the proposals in C. (57) 153.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,9th July, 1957.continuing Exchequer assistance, therefore, appeared to be inevitable,partly because the industry would collapse without it, partly becauseits competitors in other countries were supported by State action ofvarious kinds, and partly because the volume of research which was essential to maintain an efficient and progressive industry was beyondthe capacity of any one firm or group of firms.The industry must clearly be encouraged to contract to a sizecommensurate with the reduced military requirement. But if, atthe same time, its civil sector was to expand, the Government should seek to ensure that it would receive adequate initial orders byco-ordinating the aircraft requirements of RAP. transport command and the Airways Corporations, and should continue tobear, though increasingly on the civil rather than the defence Budget,the cost of research and experimental work.The Minister of Civil Aviation said that, although the mainsource of future orders for the industry would continue to berepresented by Transport Command and the two airways corporations, the Britannias already ordered for transport command woud suffice until the 1970&apos;s, while the two Corporationshad also placed orders for the main aircraft which they were likelyto need during the next few years. As a result, no major orders couldbe foreseen in the immediate future which would enable the aircraft industry to sustain the research and development work which wouldbe necessary if the latest technical advances in aerodynamics were tobe fully explored.In discussion it was suggested that the world demand for civil aircraft during the next ten years was likely to be very considerable.The United Kingdom aircraft industry would, therefore, need tobecome predominantly an export industry. As compared with its main competitor in the United States, it would enjoy the advantage that skilled labour costs, which constituted a high proportion of thetotal costs of production, were appreciably lower in the UnitedKingdom than in the United States. It was all the moreimportant that research should be adequately financed byone means or another; and this problem should be examined in the light of the contention by the aircraft industry that it was inadequately supplied with working capital andenjoyed less favourable credit facilities for oversea sales than its competitors. On the other hand, although exports of aircraft mightbe expanded on a very considerable scale, a realistic survey of the potential markets would be essential. Moreover, any government contribution to the research involved would need to be carefully considered in the light of the other demands on our investmentresources.The Prime Minister said that the problems involved in thismatter were so important and so complex that they should be thesubject of a special enquiry, which would need to consider how agreater concentration of effort might be secured within the industryand how far a Government contribution to the research facilities of aircraft firms would be justified in the light of a realistic appraisalof the export markets likely to be open to them during the next tenyears. The precise nature and scope of this enquiry should beconsidered in the first place by the Chancellor of the exchequer in consultation with the Ministers concerned.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to confer with theMinisters principally concerned on the scope and natureof an enquiry into the future of the aircraft industry, andto report their conclusions to the Prime Minister.
