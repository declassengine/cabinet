government expenditure.social services.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 5thConclusions,Minute 2.)*1. The Cabinet resumed their discussion ofGovernment expenditure by the Chancellor ofmemoranaa onthe Exchequer(C. (57) 16), the Minister of Education (C. (5.7) 19), the Minister ofNational Insurance (C. (57) 20) and the Minister of Health (C. (57) 17).The Prime Minister said that if, in accordance with the general sense of the Cabinefs earlier discussion, the charge for welfare milkwas increased from \\d. to Ad. and some small increase was made inthe charge for school meals but no change was made in respect oforange juice, cod liver oil and vitamins, the saving of expendituremight amount to about  15 millions. In order to increase this figure to the total of  40 to  50 millions, which was the minimum target for economies in Government expenditure in 1957/58, it would benecessary either to restrict the scope of the dental service to persons under twenty-one and expectant mothers, or to withdraw the family allowance for the second child, with some increase for the third and subsequent children, or to introduce the contributory principle intothe National Health Service in the form of a separate contribution,which would be higher than the fraction of the National insurance contribution at present attributable to the Health Service. a curtailment of the scope of family allowances coupled with increases in the charges for welfare milk and school meals would be interpreted as an attack on the social services devoted to child welfare. On theother hand, the principle of insurance was now accepted by the bulkof the population, and the introduction of a separate contributoryelement into the National Health Service would probably be acceptable to public opinion. In order to achieve a significanteconomy in Government expenditure, it would be preferable to rely on a new and flexible arrangement in this field rather than on a seriesof small economies in the rest of the social services.It was for consideration, therefore, whether that element in theNational Insurance contribution which was attributable to theNational Health Service should now be separated off, the national insurance contribution itself being reduced correspondingly by 10dA specifically National Health contribution would then be introduced at a figure of Is. 6d., the net increase in the liability of contributorsbeing Sd. The scheme should be compulsory; and, althoughemployers could not be expected to contribute, they should berequired to accept the responsibility for collecting contributions. the yield might be in the region of  30 millions a year; and this sum, withthe product of increased charges for welfare milk and school meals,would together secure the total savings desired in civil expenditure.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that economies confined to increases in the charges for welfare milk and school meals wouldbe regarded by public opinion, both at home and abroad, as a whollyinadequate contribution to the reduction of the prospective Budgetdeficit unless they were accompanied by a separate contributoryscheme for the National Health Service and by firm action to bringunder closer control the grant-aided expenditure of local authorities.The introduction of the contributory principle into the national health Service would have great advantages. But the whole range of social services would shortly have to be overhauled, and the financing of the National Insurance Fund in particular would haveto be reviewed. It would therefore be necessary that the legislationintroducing the new contribution to the National Health service should be so drafted as to disallow amendments which might provokedebate about the range of National Insurance benefits before theGovernment were ready to announce their policy for the future ofthe National Insurance Fund.The Minister of National Insurance said that, even if further examination showed that it was possible to draft the necessary* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
legislation as restrictively as the Chancellor of the Exchequer had suggested, the establishment of a contributory National health service was open to certain practical objections. The problem of enforcement would be difficult in the case of elderly people who werenot liable to pay National Insurance contributions, and also in thecase of self-employed persons. Moreover, although a separate andidentifiable National Health contribution should, in theory, serve torebut any argument that the National Insurance contribution wasbeing raised without any proportionate increase in benefits, theaverage man did not distinguish between the two elements in hisNational Insurance contribution which were attributable to theNational Insurance scheme and to the National Health Servicerespectively. If he was required to pay an extra Sd. for the latterservice, nothing would convince him that, since his contributionliability as a whole was being increased, he was not entitled to expecta commensurate improvement in his National Insurance benefits.By the following year a deficit of some  40 millions would emergeon the National Insurance fund. By 1970-71, if no action was takenin the interim, this deficit would rise to  450 millions. It would bedifficult enough, by adjustment of the National insurance contribution, to keep this deficit under control while at the sametime granting the increase in National Insurance benefits which was becoming inevitable. He thought it doubtful whether it would be wise to complicate this issue by introducing a separate contribution in respect of the National Health Service.The Minister of Health said that he agreed with the proposalto increase the charges for welfare milk and for school meals. Hewould also have been ready to accept an increase in the charge fororange juice, cod liver oil and vitamins, which were taken up to theextent of only some 30 per cent, of entitlement. It was, however,true that this economy would be resented as a further attack on thenutritional standards of children; and that we were, in any case,committed to accepting supplies of orange juice from the West Indiesup to 1960. He was, therefore, content that the charge for orangejuice, cod liver oil and vitamins should not be increased for the timebeing.The introduction of a separate contribution for the national health Service would present administrative difficulties, and it mightbe wiser merely to increase the existing fraction of the national insurance contribution which was attributable to the National health service. If, at at the same time, the insurance stamp could be over-printed or divided in some way which clearly illustrated its contribution to two distinct services, it should be possible to securethe advantages of the new proposal without the administrativecomplications which would otherwise be involved.In further discussion there was general agreement that theNational Health Service should now be established on a compulsorycontributory basis. It would be psychologically valuable that thebenefits received under the National Insurance Scheme and theNational Health Service should be seen to be financed by two separatecontributions, provided that the administrative difficulties could be overcome. It would be necessary, however, to consider the impact of this change and of the increase in the charges for welfare milk and school meals on a public opinion which would shortly face theprospect of a rise in controlled rents by amounts which might, at themaximum, reach 75. 6d. a week. In these circumstances it wassuggested that it might be wiser to make no change in the charge for school meals; to confine the increase in charges to welfare milk,orange juice, cod liver oil and vitamins; and to provide that theNational Health Service contribution should, from the outset, be2s. rather than Is. 6d.
sLocalGovernmentFinance.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 4thConclusions,Minute 7.)The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that, subject to further examination ofthe administrative implications, the contributory element in the financing of the National Health Service should beextended.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Minister of National Insurance and the Minister ofHealth, to arrange for further consideration to be urgentlygiven to the administrative problems entailed in thisdecision and to the scope of the legislation which wouldbe necessary.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion at a later meeting.*2. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of memoranda on local government finance by the Lord Privy Seal (CP. (56) 282), theformer Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. (56) 287) and the formerPresident of the Board of Trade (CP. (56) 289), together with amemorandum by the Minister of Education (C. (57) 21).The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that theproposal to substitute a general grant for the present system of specific grants could not be considered as an attack on the education services.It was no part of the proposal that the cost of education to theExchequer should remain fixed at its present level. Nevertheless, anarrangement under which the Exchequer undertook to meet 60 percent, of the cost of a service, irrespective of its amount, contained no adequate incentive to economy. While there might be no grossextravagance in the education services, there was undoubtedly scope for savings; and the introduction of a general grant would providethe necessary stimulus for this purpose. The change proposed was an essential step in putting the financing of local government on toa sound footing. It was expected, and would be welcomed, by government supporters who were active in local government, andthere was evidence that there would be support for it in localgovernment administration generally. The loss of rate income whichwould be sustained by some local authorities would be mitigatedinitially by the transitional arrangements which were proposed, andwould not assume significant proportions until after 1961, when afurther review of the rating structure would in any event be necessary.As regards the re-rating of industry he sought authority to makea statement during the Second Reading Debate on the Rating and valuation Bill on 7th February to the effect that, in the Governmenfsview, rating finance would not have been placed on a sound basis untilall properties were assessed for rating at their full current value, andto foreshadow further legislation on this subject.The Minister of Education said that he must rest on thearguments which he had advanced previously. Salaries and standingcharges accounted for at least 60 per cent, of the total expenditureon education. In view of the continuing pressure which the Govern-ment must still exert to secure an improvement in pupil-teacherratios, it would be illusory to think that the education services couldbe made to yield any substantial savings. The consequence of introducing a general grant would be that effective control of educational policy would be transferred from the Minister ofEducation to the local authorities.   This would be retrograde.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that in Scotland theeffects of the proposal would be concentrated on education; for, ofa total grant of  36^ millions, education accounted for  33 millions.The introduction of a general grant would yield no substantial savings, while it would make it impossible, unless new means of enforcement were devised, for the Government to ensure in future* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
that their educational policies were effectively carried out in Scotland.The decline in the vigour of local government was due to the fact thatin present circumstances the most competent people could no longerafford to give their time to it; and the present proposal would notin any way help to remedy this.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the proposal for ageneral grant should be considered not in isolation but as an integralelement in his programme for securing the measure of control overpublic expenditure which was necessary to maintain confidence in sterling. For this purpose it was necessary that he should be able to demonstrate that steps had been taken, not to reduce the expenditureof local authorities by drastic cuts in the scale of their services, butto bring that expenditure under more effective control. Localauthorities would undoubtedly exercise greater prudence in financingservices which they would be required to sustain out of their own resources, and the proposed change should represent an important contribution towards restoring the vitality of local government. Itwas desirable that a statement outlining reforms on the linesadvocated by the Minister of Housing and Local Government shouldbe made in advance of the announcement of his own proposals whichhe expected to make on 18th February.The Home Secretary said that, with the prospect that Exchequerexpenditure on education would rise by  150 millions by 1961, theneeds of the Governments economic policies were paramount, andthe expenditure on this service must be brought under more effective control. The alternative course, which would be far more difficult,would be to revise the percentages of the existing specific grants.In discussion it was suggested that, if the main justification for introducing a general grant was that it would yield significant savings,it was clearly doubtful whether it would, in fact, have any such effect;while, as it would bear primarily on education, it would expose theGovernment to the charge that they were pursuing a course whichwas inconsistent with their declared aim of creating an OpportunityState. Moreover, the introduction of a general grant would intensifypressure on the rates, which were even more unpopular than taxes.On the other hand there was strong support for the view that theintroduction of the proposed new system would do much toencourage a sense of independence among local authorities and to restore vigour and enterprise to local government. In view of theextent to which it had been possible to influence the housing policyof local authorities by means of advice and encouragement, thesubstitution Of a general for a specific grant should not in itself makeit impossible to continue to exercise effective central control overeducational policy.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, in his view, the re-rating of industry on the basis proposed would not bean insupportable burden on industry in present circumstances, andthe Government should announce their intention to legislate for thispurpose. No decision need be announced, for the time being, aboutthe disposal of the additional rate income which this would yield. Inview of the fact that the Government were pledged to pursue an expanding educational programme, the proposed general grantpresented more difficulty. But the percentage system had been introduced at an earlier period to counteract an unduly parsimoniousapproach by local authorities towards education and other services.This danger had now been removed, and the more pressing need was for the Government to be able to demonstrate that they wereexercising effective Control over public expenditure. The proposed change should, however, be represented not so much as a means of reducing expenditure on local services but rather as a redistribution of financial responsibility between the central Government and thelocal authorities which would be to the benefit of both parties.   In
6lParliament.Members&apos;Fund.(previous reference:CM. (56) 48thConclusions,Minute 8.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (57) 11) recommending that legislation should be introduced to authorise the Exchequer to makea grant of  10,000 annually to the House of Commons Members&apos;Fund, beginning in the financial year 1957-58.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the plight of someformer Members of the House of Commons attracted widespreadsympathy. The Exchequer grant which he now proposed wouldenable both the rates of benefit and the income limits to be raised to more satisfactory levels. These arrangements were acceptable tothe Trustees of the Fund.In discussion there was general agreement with this proposal, onthe understanding that its announcement would be timed to coincide with that of improvements in the remuneration of Members ofParliament and certain professional classes. It was suggested,however, that it might be held to be inconsistent with the purpose ofthe Exchequer grant that benefits paid out of the Members&apos; fund should henceforward be liable to income tax. The Chancellor ofthe Exchequer said that, although he would give further considerationto this point, the case for exempting these payments from incometax would have to be examined in relation to the corresponding claims of other people living on small fixed incomes.The Cabinet Approved, subject to the points made in their discussion, theproposals in C. (57) 11.Ghana.(previous reference:CC. (57) 6thConclusions,Minute 7.)IndependenceBill.4. The Commonwealth Secretary said that, in the debate onthe Ghana Independence Bill in the House of Lords that day, it wouldbe necessary for Government spokesmen either to press for theretention of Clause 3 of the Bill (thus excluding Ghana from future operations of the Colonial Development Corporation) or to accepta compromise proposal that Clause 3 should be omitted from theBill but that, pending the completion of the Governmenfsinvestigation of the problems involved in financing futured development in the Commonwealth, the Corporation should bedirected to refrain from financing any new schemes of development in Ghana. Examination of the latter proposal had shown that itwas open to serious legal objection. There was, therefore, no alternative to the retention of Clause 3 of the Bill, and it would benecessary for Government spokesmen to speak accordingly in the debate.The Cabinet (1) Took note of this statement.view, however, of the difficulties which this matter presented, theCabinet would no doubt wish to defer their final decision until it couldbe taken in the context of the draft statements in which it would be announced.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government to circulate a draft statement of the Governmenfs policy on local government finance.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to circulate the draftof a passage about local government expenditure whichmight be included in his statement on 18th February.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion at a meeting later in theweek.
Broadcasting.Party political broadcasts.(previous reference:CM. (55) 40thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Home Secretary said that the Independent television authority (I.T.A.) had proved unwilling to accept an obligation torelay party political broadcasts transmitted by the British Broad-casting Corporation (B.B.C.), and had proposed an alternative typeof broadcast which was unacceptable. The B.B.C. considered thatthe I.T.A. would obtain an unfair advantage if both organisationswere not required to accept an identical obligation to transmit party political broadcasts, and the Opposition leaders in the House ofCommons had suggested that amending legislation to this effect should be introduced. There were objections to legislation of thiskind, and it would be better that further efforts should be made to persuade the I.T.A. to relay party political broadcasts transmitted by the B.B.C.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary to continue his efforts to persuade the I.T.A. to relay party political broadcaststransmitted by the B.B.C.Suez Canal.BritishEvacuees.(previous reference:CC. (57) 4thConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The Prime Minister read to the Cabinet the draft of astatement which he proposed to make in the House of Commonsabout the establishment of an Anglo-Egyptian Resettlement board to supervise the arrangements for the relief and resettlement of Britishsubjects evicted from Egypt.In discussion various amendments were discussed and accepted.The Cabinet Approved the draft statement, subject to the amendmentsagreed during their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,5th February, 1957.Independence The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it had been suggestedCelebrations.    that  55,000 should be made available to pay for the United kingdom contribution to the independence celebrations in Ghana.   Of this sum some  35,000 was required for a fly-past by Valiant aircraft.It seemed doubtful whether expenditure on this scale was necessary or justifiable.In discussion it was pointed out that both the United Statesand the Soviet Union proposed to send the most modern types of aircraft to take part in these celebrations, and that it would be embarrassing if this country was not represented on a comparablescale. It should, however, be possible, without damage to our prestige, to eliminate the rest of the proposed expenditure.The Cabinet (2) Agreed that the United Kingdom contribution to theindependence celebrations in Ghana should include afly-past by Valiant aircraft.
