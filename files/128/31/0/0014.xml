3 CC. 14 (57)Western 1.   The Foreign Secretary said that our proposals for theEuropean reduction of our forces in Europe had been received withoutUnion. enthusiasm by the other member countries of Western European(Previous Union (W.E.U.); but they would probably be accepted if the reference: reductions were limited to 13,500 in the financial year 1957-58 andC.G. (57) 13th a similar number in 1958-59.   The additional cost involved would conclusions, be  3. millions, of which  2 millions would be DeutschmarkMinute 5.) expenditure.In discussion it was agreed that a settlement by consent, even at a cost of an extra  3 millions, would be preferable to a unilateral-breach of the Treaty. The settlement should, however, be clearlyexpressed as resting on an assumption that the German contributionto the local cost of our forces in Germany would amount to 50 millions for 1957-58 (with an appropriate contribution in thefollowing year) and it should be communicated privately to theSupreme Allied Commander, Europe, and the Secretary-General,North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, before the discussions in W.E.U.were resumed.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to prepare instructions forthe United Kingdom Permanent Representative on theNorth Atlantic Council on the lines discussed and to submitthem for the Prime Ministers approval.Israel. 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that, in view of the situation(Previous        in the General Assembly of the United Nations, the prospect of an reference:      early withdrawal of Israeli forces remained uncertain. The resolutionCC. (57) 13th   which the Canadian Government had it in mind to propose had notConclusions,    yet been finalised; and there was still some risk that a United StatesMinute 3.)       resolution, which would be less satisfactory than the Canadianresolution, would be brought forward.  The chief danger, however,remained the possibility of an Afro-Asian resolution invokingsanctions against Israel.   If such a resolution was tabled the older members of the Commonwealth would probably vote against it.We ourselves could not easily adopt any different course withoutoffending public opinion in this country.  On the other hand, a vote against a resolution of this kind might seriously damage our relationswith the Arab States.   The decision on this point, if it eventuallyhad to be faced, would therefore be a very difficult one.   But thelatest reports from Washington offered some hope that an agreement might be reached between the United States and Israel which wouldextricate us from this dilemma.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.Suez Canal.(previous reference:CC. (57) 12thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Foreign Secretary said that further examination of theproblem which would arise in connection with the payment of port(as distinct from canal) dues when the Suez Canal was open had suggested that the wisest course would probably be to pay such duesin transferable sterling. For this purpose a separate account would need to be opened, the existing No. 1 and 2 Accounts remainingblocked.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement.
4. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Energy.       5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Power (C. (57) 43) proposing a revision of the nuclearie.     power programme.The Minister of Power said that, if we were to keep pace witha demand for electricity which was increasing at a rate of 7 per cent,llth per annum, the total electricity output capacity installed by 1970ns, would need to be of the order of 51,000 MW. There Was no prospect5-) that supplies of coal would match an acceleration of demand at this rate, and since it would clearly be unwise, from every point of view,to rely too heavily on oil-burning plant, a considerable expansion ofthe existing nuclear power programme was indicated. It should bepossible to install a total nuclear output capacity of 12,000 MW. by1970; and the first step in this direction should be to plan for thecreation of a nuclear capacity of 5,000 to 6,000 MW. by 1965.Although the capital cost of this programme would be about  770millions more than that of a comparable programme based on: conventional power stations, the resultant saving of coal should beof the order of 18 million tons a year by 1965. The unit cost ofelectricity from the earliest nuclear power stations might prove to be slightly higher than that from conventional stations; but technical development, which might be expected to be rapid, should succeed in eliminating this excess cost.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) While the maximum expansion of the nuclear power programme was desirable in principle, the future investment whichit implied, when added to the forward investment programmes of theother basic industries, would make heavy demands on manpower,money and materials in the early 1960s. Even if the nuclear power programme was given a high priority, it might not be possible to accommodate it within the total of investment resources likely tobe available unless other programmes were curtailed. It wastherefore desirable that a comprehensive review should be made ofthe probable demands upon the economy in the period up to 1965(particularly from the point of view of the competing claims ofdefence and the basic industries) which would provide some indication of the rate at which the expanded nuclear power programme shouldbe implemented if it was not to involve arbitrary adjustments in the programmes of other industries or to overstrain the economy. Inthe meantime it would be important to emphasise, in the proposed announcement about the nuclear programme, that the actual amountof nuclear capacity to be installed by 1965 would be subject to theresults of technical experience and development as planningprogressed, including the trend of capital costs, and to the availability of physical and financial resources.(b) The proposed new programme would represent an important contribution to the developing needs of an economy which was rapidly substituting mechanised operation for many processeshitherto effected by hand. But a more highly mechanised industrial organisation itself implied a greater demand for imports. It was by no means certain whether we should be able to finance this expansionof imports by a corresponding expansion of exports, especially if no significant export of nuclear products and techniques could beexpected until 1965. As a corollary to an expanded nuclear power programme it would therefore be necessary, by one means or another,to continue to restrain consumption in order to stimulate the essentialexpansion of exports. Given restraint on consumption, personalsavings should be available to finance investment on the scale proposed. But, without savings of this order, all the investment programmes of the basic industries would be in jeopardy.
(c) It could be argued that, in view of the rapidity of technical development in nuclear energy and the possibility that the earliesttypes of nuclear plant would be economic only when used on baseload, the initial stage of the new programme should be implementedon a more modest scale, allowing for a more rapid expansion in theyears after 1965. On the other hand, the final decision on the amountof nuclear capacity to be commissioned by the end of 1965 need notbe taken for another eighteen months or two years, and planningduring this period would be adapted to fresh technical developmentsas soon as they became available.(d) The proposed expansion of the civil nuclear power programme would not involve any conflict with the military nuclearprogramme as at present planned.(e) An expansion of the nuclear power programme on the scale proposed would probably involve considerable disturbance to the amenities of the countryside. If this was not to create a fresh publicoutcry on each occasion&quot; when a new nuclear power station wasinstalled, it should be made clear, at the very outset of the new programme, that some loss of amenities was the unavoidable price which had to be paid if the needs of the economy over the nextfifteen years were to be met. At the same time, however, care shouldbe taken, in planning and siting the new stations, to operate the revised procedure for securing planning consent which the Ministerof Power proposed in such a way as to restrict to the minimum the inevitable reduction of amenities. In particular it would bedesirable to give notice of the construction of new stations by publicadvertisement.The Cabinet (1) Approved the revision of the nuclear power programmeproposed by the Minister of Power.(2) Authorised the Minister of Power to announce the new programme by means of a statement in the House ofLords, in the terms of the draft annexed to his memo-randum, concurrently with a similar statement by the paymaster-General in the House of Commons, at anearly date.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for a review of the probable demands upon the economy,particularly in terms of defence and the basic industries,in the period to 1965.Public 6.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ChancellorService. of the Exchequer (C. (57) 42) proposing increases in the remuneration(Previous of Ministers and Members of Parliament and in the salaries paid in reference: certain other public and semi-public services. They also had beforeC.C. (54) 82nd them a memorandum by the Minister of Pensions (C. (57) 47) on theConclusions,    timing of any announcement on this subject.Minute 6.) Tne chancellor of the Exchequer said that, on the hypothesisSalaries. that some increase in public service salaries was now overdue, no more opportune moment for making the necessary adjustments was likely to occur. So far as possible, his proposals should be agreed with the Opposition and announced in a single comprehensive statement. The salary of members of the House of Commons shouldbe raised to  1,750 a year (the existing sessional allowance being withdrawn) and an expenses allowance of  3- 5 a day the actualfigure being a matter for discussion- should be paid to Peersattending the House of Lords. Ministers should be entitled to drawall the increased Parliamentary salary, or the greater proportion of&apos;  it; and some increase, in the Ministerial salaries of senior Ministers
would be both justified on merits and necessary to provide sufficientlatitude for raising the salaries of junior Ministers. The actual scale of Ministerial salaries might be between the minimum and themaximum limits set out in the Appendix to his memorandum. If,however, the figure of  8,250 for a senior Minister in the House ofCommons was too high, an alternative approach lay in limiting theincrease in Ministerial salary more stringently and in restricting theamount of Parliamentary salary which such a Minister might draw.For example, if the increases in both Ministerial and Parliamentarysalaries were confined, in such a case, to  1,000, a senior Minister inthe House of Commons would receive  7,000. But whatever schemewas adopted, it should seek to reduce to a minimum the disparity between the salaries of Ministers in the House of Commons and theHouse of Lords respectively.The Home Secretary said that priority should be accorded toan improvement in the salaries of junior Ministers and in the attendance allowance for Peers. It would only be justifiable toincrease the pay of members of the House of Commons if these twoclaims could be met at the same time. But it was doubtful whetherthis was an opportune moment for announcing increases in publicservice salaries. It had been decided to defer action when the matter was last considered in the previous summer,; the economic situation had not improved in the meantime; and the Government were nowconfronted with the need to withstand a number of pressing salaryclaims, including those of doctors and dentists. In these circumstances it would be difficult to justify any significant increase in the ministerial salaries of senior Ministers, although they might be allowed to draw their full Parliamentary salaries.The Prime Minister said that he was disquieted by the possibility that Ministers might appear to be awarding themselves a large increase in salary, and he shared the view that a substantial increasein the salaries of senior Ministers could not be defended. Analternative solution might be that the salaries of senior ministers should remain, as at present at  5,000; that the salaries of the paymaster-General and junior Ministers should be fixed at  3,000;that the salaries of Parliamentary Secretaries should be raised to 2,000; but that all Ministers should be permitted to draw, inaddition,  1,000 of their Parliamentary salary.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in favour of seeking a solution to the problem of Ministers&apos; salaries on the basis of a compromise between the proposals outlined by the Prime Ministerand those put forward by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It was,however, recognised that a Minister who was a Peer would not beable to draw the proposed Parliamentary allowance for Peers inaddition to his Ministerial salary, and that further consideration would need to be given to means of reducing the disparity in ministerial remuneration in the two Houses. A solution could notbe found, consistently with the impartial administration of the incometax, by legislation to exempt from tax some element in a salaryrelated to the performance of Ministerial duties.In further discussion the following points were made (a) There would be no advantage in introducing, as an alternative to an increase in the salary of members of the House of Commons, aseparate allowance to cover the cost of secretarial assistance. this solution, which had been rejected by all previous Select Committeeswho had considered the matter, would not commend itself to theHouse of Commons, and would be of doubtful application to aMember who did his own secretarial work.(b) An allowance of  4 or  5 a day for Peers attending theHouse of Lords would represent some relief to Peers, but it couldbe argued that the needs of those Peers who devoted themselves tothe work of the House of Lords would not be met by such an
South-West 7.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theAfrica Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (57) 50) recommending that, subjectCompany. to the outcome of negotiations currently in progress, consent shouldbe given to the transfer of control over the South-West AfricaCompany (S.-W.A.C.) from the United Kingdom to an American-controlled company, the Tsumeb Corporation Ltd., and to thetransfer of the domicile of S.-W.A.C, for tax purposes, from theUnited Kingdom to South Africa.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, this transactionshould not operate to the disadvantage of the United Kingdom. Itwould be equivalent to a dollar investment in the sterling area, ofthe kind which we were anxious to encourage. It was essential, ifthe economic development of the Commonwealth was to proceed ata satisfactory rate, that American interests should be induced to investin the sterling area, and doubt would be cast on the sincerity of our desire for American capital if consent to this transfer was refused.Moreover, the Tsumeb Corporation had given an undertaking thatvanadium would continue to be mined for sale to the UnitedKingdom for sterling; and the transaction was acceptable to theSouth African Government. It would be difficult to find grounds forresisting the transfer of domicile, and the loss of revenue would notsignificant.The Prime Minister said that he was not entirely satisfied thatthis transaction was in our interests. Genuine dollar investment inthe Commonwealth was to be welcomed. But a transaction which amounted to no more than a &quot; take-over bid,&quot; with no guarantee thatit would be followed by fresh investment, should be examined very closely. The proposed transfer of domicile was also objectionable,inasmuch as it might make it possible for an American purchaser toallowance. The payment of a salary to these Peers was now desirableif the House was to continue to function effectively. On the otherhand the introduction of salaries for Peers would be open to considerable criticism.(c) The proposed level of salaries for the chairmen of area boards in the nationalised industries, who were now increasinglyappointed by promotion from within the industries, might needreconsideration in comparison with the proposed levels of salaries for university staff.(d) The proposed salary scales for the Lower Judiciary hadalready been discussed and could be accepted.The Cabinet briefly discussed whether the balance of advantage lay in giving effect to the proposed salary increases, when they hadbeen finally agreed, at an early date, or in deferring them for a further period. An early announcement of increases in public service salarieswould be less likely to provoke fresh wage claims than a similarannouncement made later in the year. On the other hand, anannouncement in the near future would reinforce the growingpressure for some improvement in retirement pensions and national assistance scales. It would also make it more difficult to resist an interim award to doctors and dentists.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange forfurther examination of the proposed increases in publicservice salaries in the light of the views expressed during their discussion.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a later meeting.
NorthernIreland.AgriculturalGrant.(previous reference:CM. (56) 57thConclusions,Minute 4.)8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (57) 46), proposing that the system whereby a lump sum grant had been paid annually to the Government of NorthernIreland, for disbursement as partial compensation to Northern Irishfarmers for their remoteness from their main market in Great Britain,should be replaced by new arrangements under which the annual payment would be fixed in advance for the next five years, the size of the payment thereafter being settled after a review in the fourthyear.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that although there was some risk that arrangements of this kind would have to be prolongedindefinitely, the statutory power to extend them after the first fiveyears would be permissive, not mandatory. On that basis, and inview of the special circumstances of Northern Ireland, the proposals were not unreasonable.The Cabinet-(.1) Approved the new arrangements for providing special assistance to agriculture in Northern Ireland.(2) Authorised the inclusion in the forthcoming Agriculture bill of a provision to enable the annual payment to theGovernment of Northern Ireland for agriculture to beborne on the Votes of the Ministry of Agriculture.MUford Haven. 9. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Transport (C. (57) 44) seeking authority for legislation in the forthcoming Session to establish a conservancy authority forMilford Haven.The Minister of Transport said that Milford Haven was the onlysouthern harbour in Great Britain capable of accommodating tankersof 100,000 tons and cargo vessels of corresponding size which werebeing introduced for the transport of iron ore. It should thereforebe rapidly developed. He had set up a Committee, representing the oil companies and other interests concerned, to deal with theImmediate problems involved in developing the port; but it was important that a conservancy authority should be established toassume permanent responsibility for controlling the increasing traffic.This authority would be financed by user interests, and no Exchequerexpenditure would be involved. As the oil industry was likely tobecome increasingly dependent on the use of large tankers of 60,000-v 100,000 tons, urgent consideration would also need to be given toaccommodating larger vessels at ports elsewhere along the coast.realise a profit as the result of a concession which would be refusedto any British purchaser of the company. The proposal should therefore be re-examined, and it might be desirable to appoint a small committee of Ministers to consider the basis on which transactionsof this kind should be dealt with.; The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would discuss further with the Chancellor of the Exchequer the issues involvedin the transfer of control of the South-West AfricaCompany to American interests.
10. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofTransport and the Minister of Works (C. (57) 40) recommending thatthe scheme for major road improvements to relieve traffic congestionat Hyde Park Corner, Park Lane and Marble Arch, should now be approved. The Cabinet also had before them a memorandum bythe Lord President (C. (57) 45) supporting this proposal and urging that the construction of the proposed east-west tunnel should proceedsimultaneously with work on the remainder of the scheme.The Minister of Transport said that the proposed scheme hadbeen thoroughly re-examined in order to take account of theobjections which had been raised in the Cabinefs earlier discussion.The Minister of Works and he were now satisfied that the original scheme, with certain modifications, represented the most satisfactory solution of the problem of traffic congestion at Hyde Park Corner.It would involve no interference with the Decimus Burton screen,and the north-bound traffic would be accommodated on a new road which would replace the East Carriage Drive and would make theminimum encroachment on the Park. It would not be possible to dispense with the proposed subsidiary roundabout at HamiltonGardens without substituting a tunnel under the Gardens. Theeast-west tunnel at Hyde Park Corner would probably prove necessary in time, but its construction would not be undertaken untilthe need for it had been further demonstrated. The London CountyCouncil had accorded the highest priority to the Park Lane scheme.The Government would be exposed to serious criticism if the relief of traffic congestion there were further delayed and he thereforesought authority to proceed.The Minister of Housing, supporting this proposal, said thatthere was no ideal solution to this problem, but the scheme underconsideration was the best which could be devised. He hoped thatclose contact would be maintained with his Department on theamenity aspects of the project.Discussion showed that the Cabinet continued to entertainmisgivings about the proposed scheme. It was argued that analternative scheme, limited to the construction of an east-west tunnel,might afford adequate relief for traffic congestion at Hyde ParkCorner with less damage to amenities. Moreover, the expenditure involved might be better employed in carrying out an important roadscheme in an industrial area, for which it might be possible to urgegreater priority. The Cabinet were informed, however, that it wasthe north-south, rather than the east-west, traffic which was mostlyresponsible for the congestion at Hyde Park Corner, and the east-west tunnel would make no contribution towards facilitating the flow of this traffic. On the question of relevant priority, traffic was more congested at Hyde Park Corner than at any other place inthe country.London traffic congestion.Park LaneScheme.(previous reference:CM. (55) 34thConclusions,Minute 4.)The Minister of Power and The Minister for Welsh Affairs saidthat they welcomed this proposal. It would be helpful, in securingthe support of Welsh opinion, to lay emphasis on the fact that theproposed arrangements were being made in consultation with theMinister for Welsh Affairs. It was also important, in order to avoidpressure for similar projects to be undertaken elsewhere, to emphasise that no Exchequer expenditure would be involved in the milford haven project.The Cabinet Approved the proposal put forward in C. (57) 44.
It was agreed that, in view of these considerations, there was no alternative to approving the proposed scheme. The appropriate timefor starting work on it would, however, be a matter for separate consideration.The Cabinet Approved in principle the proposed Park Lane scheme as described in C. (57) 40.Cabinet Office. S.W. 1,28th February, 1957.
