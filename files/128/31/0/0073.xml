ForeignAffairs.Syria.(previous reference:CC. (57) 68thConclusions,Minute 2.)Egypt.(previous reference:CC. (57) 38thConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The Prime Minister said that the Government of the soviet union had recently sent letters to Socialist leaders in the member countries of the North Atlantic Alliance, accusing the United Statesand the United Kingdom of preparing to intervene by force in theMiddle East. These letters, which would probably be made public in the near future, might well be designed to divert attention fromthe Soviet Union&apos;s own designs against Jordan and Iraq.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the resumed financial discussions with representatives of the Egyptian Government in rome had been temporarily suspended, since the Egyptianrepresentatives appeared to have misunderstood the basis on &quot;whichthe discussions had been arranged and would need to return to Cairofor fresh instructions.Civil 2.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the MinisterAviation. Qf Supply and the Minister of Civil Aviation (C. (57) 228 and 233)Britannia about the serious problems which had arisen in the development of aircraft. the Britannia aircraft.(Previous The Minister of Supply said that, although the Bristol AeroplaneReference: Company had been ill-advised in permitting the Britannia aircraftCC. (57) 67th to be put into operation prematurely, a considerable share of theConclusions, blame must rest on the British Overseas Airways CorporationMinute 6.) (B.O.A.C.) for indulging in public criticism of this aircraft as soonas it was known to be technically defective in certain respects. TheCorporation had a special obligation, as a monopoly purchaser, topromote the sale of British aircraft, and further progress towardsovercoming the technical and financial difficulties which had arisen in connection with the Britannia aircraft would depend largely ontheir willingness to adopt a more co-operative attitude and publiclyto express their confidence that these difficulties could be surmounted. It was important that the Government should exercise their influence to that end, even to the extent, if necessary, ofwithholding dollars from B.O.A.C. for the purchase of american aircraft. It would also be necessary to&apos; give separate consideration,as a matter of urgency, to ways of ensuring the immediate solvencyof the Bristol Aeroplane Company by accelerating payments whichthe Government were due to make to the Company and retardingpayments which the Company were due to make to the Government.The Minister of Civil Aviation said that a convincing case couldbe made out for the attitude which B.O.A.C. had adopted and hecould not accept the view that a large share of the blame should be attributed to the Corporation. In any event, the technical andfinancial problems to be solved were complicated and urgent, and he recommonded that the matter should be referred back to theCommittee of Ministers who had previously considered the problem,in order that agreed recommendations might be submitted to theCabinet.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in agreement with thisview.The Prime Minister said that the Committee of Ministers should base their deliberations on the assumption that the failure of theBritannia project and the collapse of the Bristol Aeroplane Companymust be averted, unless these objectives could only be achieved atwholly disproportionate cost. With this purpose in view, the needfor Government participation in the project should be considered on purely practical grounds. The Minister of Power should act as chairman of the Ministerial Committee and the Minister of labour should be added to its membership.
The Cabinet Invited a Committee of Ministers consisting of Minister of Power (Chairman);Minister of Labour;Minister of Civil Aviation;Minister of Supply;Financial Secretary, Treasury;to consider, in the light of their discussion, what further steps would be necessary and justified to ensure the satisfactory development of the Britannia aircraft.3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (C. (57) 230) on the economic situation.The Chancellor of Exchequer said that over the previous twomonths the gold and dollar reserves had fallen by  185 millions toa figure of  660 millions, which was two-thirds of the level at whichthey had stood at the end of 1954. Financial opinion abroadappeared to be satisfied, for the moment, that the Government were determined to enforce the policies which they had adopted tosafeguard sterling; but any weakening of those policies would resultin renewed pressure on the reserves. It was satisfactory that recent discussions between Commonwealth Finance Ministers at MontTremblant had revealed a greater realisation of the need to substitute a common policy for an indiscriminate running down of sterling balances.In discussion it was suggested that the reduction in our externalliabilities represented by the drawing-down of the sterling balanceswould be largely offset by the increase in our liabilities to theInternational Monetary Fund and the Export /Import Bank. Ourprimary aims, therefore, must be to repay the amounts which we hadborrowed and to rebuild the reserves; and, from this point of view,we were in no position to lend abroad ourselves. On the other handpolicy must take practical considerations into account. It hadalready been proposed that, in appropriate cases, we should fortifythe reserves by borrowing in the United States, and it was not practicable, beyond certain limits, to restrict investment in commonwealth countries. In the meantime we should adhere firmlyto the economic policies which had now been adopted, in theconfidence that a reasonable degree of disinflation in the economy would provide the most powerful reinforcement of sterling whichcould be devised.The Cabinet Took note of C. (57) 230 and of the points made in discussion.EconomicSituation.(previous references :CC. (57) 68thConclusions,Minute 3 and cc. (57) 71stConclusions,Minute 1.)wages policy.(PreviousReferenceCC. (57)Conclusions,Minute 1.)71stNational health service wage negotiations.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (57) 231) on wages in the national health Service.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the ManagementSide of the Whitley Council for the clerical grades in the national health Service had offered a wage increase of 3 per cent., despite thefact that the Minister of Health had advised them to the contraryand had informed them that, if this offer was made, he would notnecessarily implement it. The decisions of the Council were notoperative without the Ministers formal approval, and it would be consistent with the Governmenfs policy that on this occasion theMinister should refuse to approve the agreed rates of pay.
The Minister of Health said that this agreement had beenreached in the normal course of Whitley Council negotiations andhe would find it difficult to refuse to implement it unless theGovernment were proposing to refuse to sanction any wage increases,by whatever means they were determined. It would be particularly difficult to justify a refusal to implement the agreement if the currentwage claim by the railwaymen was taken to arbitration and theaward of the tribunal was put into effect with the approval of theGovernment. In the case with which he was concerned there hadbeen no disagreement and, as a result, no issue that could be referredto arbitration. But it would be very difficult for him to takeadvantage of this situation and to refuse to implement a wage increase which had been agreed by both sides of the Whitley Council.The Minister of Labour said that, although he shared the viewof the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the issue of policy, it wouldbe unwise to seek to enforce this policy by methods which would undermine the Whitley Council structure. It might be preferable that the Minister should offer to reconsider the matter in January,by which date twelve months would have elapsed since the lastincrease was granted to these grades and it would be possible to assess the claim in relation to the further rise in the cost of living whichwould inevitably occur in the next few months.In discussion there was general agreement that it would be expedient to avoid a direct conflict between the Government and aWhitley Council; for this, if misrepresented as indicating &quot;that theGovernment had rejected the established procedures of wagenegotiation, could have a damaging effect on the larger wage claims which would come forward for consideration in the near future. Onthe other hand, it was unsatisfactory that a Whitley Council shouldbe free to reach agreement on a wage claim of this type despite thefact that the management side bore no financial responsibility for implementing the agreement. From this point of view it might be wiser to reject at the outset some wage claim in the public service which fell clearly within the authority and the responsibility of theGovernment.In further discussion it was suggested that this problem shouldbe considered in relation to other pending wage claims of a similarnature. It might be advisable that the Government should issue inthe near future a general statement defining their attitude towardswage claims both in those cases, such as the National Health Service,where they had a direct responsibility for fixing the levels of remuneration, and in those cases, such as the nationalised industries,where their influence was more indirect. A memorandum on thissubject should be prepared for early discussion by the Cabinet. Itshould list the outstanding wage claims in the public service and the nationalised industries; it should indicate how far the responsible ministers were empowered to issue directions to the nationalised industries on the treatment of wage claims; it should deal with the related issues in the case of local authorities whose wage settlementsimposed a considerable burden on the Exchequer; and it should include the draft of a general statement on wages policy which mightbe issued by the Government.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, after consultationwith the Minister of Labour and the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, to circulate a memorandum on wages policy on the lines indicated in the discussion.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at anearly meeting.
Education. 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCapital Minister of Education (C. (57) 229) on educational investment in expenditure.     1958-59 and 1959-60.(Previous j*ne Minister of Education said that, while he was prepared to reference:      accept a restriction of educational investment which would maintainCC. (57) 68th the level of expenditure in 1958-60.at the 1957-58 level, even this conclusions,     degree of restriction, which would reduce the total expenditure inMmute 3.)      those two years by  8 millions, would necessitate a return to rationing of minor projects and the deferment of some projects for ruralreorganisation.   If, however, a further reduction was essential, hewould be reluctantly prepared to reduce planned investment in1958-60 by  11 millions, involving a more drastic cut in expenditureon minor works together with a temporary embargo on the building of new rural secondary schools.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, with the exceptionof education, the economies in capital expenditure for which he had asked had now been agreed with the Ministers concerned. Thealternative reductions offered by the Minister of Education would secure economies of only A\ per cent, or 6-^ per cent, respectively in capital expenditure on education in 1958-60. The ministers concerned with other capital programmes had accepted more drasticreductions, and it was necessary that educational capital expenditurein these two years should be reduced by about  20 millions, or 11 percent., if the Government were to achieve their declared aim ofstabilising public investment in 1958-60 at the level of theexpenditure in 1957-58.In discussion it was emphasised that a reduction of  20 millions would mean a delay in the fulfilment of the programme for technical education and a reduction in the minimum programme of school places needed for the growing number of children and for new housing areas. It would be most unfortunate that children shouldbe kept out of school and that the expansion of technical education should be retarded by economy measures on this scale. Moreover,these measures would be superimposed on the substitution of theproposed general grant for the specific education grant, which was strongly opposed by educational opinion generally.On the other hand, the reductions in other types of capitalexpenditure would be no less unwelcome to public opinion. in housing the reduction would be of the order of 16-17 per cent., andwould aggravate the disquiet which was already being aroused bythe prospect of the entry into force of the Rent Act in October 1958.Moreover, local authority opinion in general, as distinct from theeducation committees of local authorities, would expect education to bear its fair share of the unavoidable economies and to accept areduction in minor educational works and lower standards of school building as a contribution to the retrenchment to which all interests were being required to submit. The Government had committed themselves in the national interest to a policy of restricting capitalexpenditure; and it would be unwise that this particular type of investment should be granted preferential treatment.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that themeasures which the Government had in mind should be presentednot as a reduction in capital expenditure but as an attempt to spreadthat expenditure over a slightly longer period. It would also be wise toavoid, as far as possible, comparisons between the relative sacrificeswhich were being demanded from different interests. Nevertheless,it was undesirable that the reduction in educational capitalexpenditure should be greater than the reductions in other types of investment. If the economy to be achieved in the period 1958-60was set at  15 millions, this would represent a fall of no more than
h aSECRET 7      **y JC.C. 73 (57)about 8 per cent, and would constitute a reasonable decision whichthe Government could defend.The Minister of Education said that he would wish to consider in greater detail the implications of a reduction of the order of 15 millions.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to give furtherconsideration, in consultation with the Minister ofEducation, to the proposal that educational capitalexpenditure in 1958-60 should be reduced by  15 millions.House of Lords 6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordReform. Chancellor (C. (57) 227) seeking, on behalf of the Commonwealth(Previous        Secretary, the views of the Cabinet on two questions which were reference:      likely to be raised during the forthcoming debate on House of LordsC.C. (57) 59th reform.Conclusions,Minute 4.) The Lord Chancellor said that, although it had originally been proposed that the Bill to be introduced in the 1957-58 Session shouldbe limited to the creation of life Peerages, it appeared to theCommonwealth Secretary and himself, on reflection, that it wouldbe difficult to defend the exclusion of hereditary Peeresses in theirown right. It might, therefore, be appropriate that, if the claims of hereditary Peeresses were pressed in the forthcoming debate,Government spokesmen should be authorised to undertake that full consideration would be given to their position in connection with theproposed legislation.Similarly, it had originally been envisaged that the Bill shouldnot include a provision to enable Members of the House of Commonswho succeeded to hereditary Peerages to renounce their rights to sitand vote in the House of Lords, whether for their lifetime or forsome shorter period. The House of Commons, however, would belikely to favour the inclusion of a provision of this kind, and it mightbe undesirable to oppose any pressure to this end which might develop. On the other hand, it would probably be impossible tosecure the insertion of a renunciation clause in the Bill unless its long Title was so widely drawn as to admit a large number of other less desirable amendments. The balance of advantage, therefore,appeared to lie in introducing the Bill in the House of Lords witha strictly limited Long Title, to accept the risk that it might prove impossible to secure the insertion of a renunciation clause in theHouse of Commons and, in that event, to offer to bring in anotherBill in order to meet the possible wishes of the House of Commons onthis point.In discussion there was general agreement that it would be preferable to adhere to the Governmenfs original intention tointroduce a Bill strictly limited to the creation of life Peerages. Thisshould be a relatively simple and non-contentious Bill, and any extension of its scope would be liable to precipitate discussion on more elaborate schemes for the reform of the House of Lords whichthe Government would not favour. It would also be inexpedientthat the Government should appear to be envisaging any extensionof the hereditary principle. No encouragement should, therefore, begiven to the suggestion that hereditary Peeresses should be dealt within the forthcoming legislation, although, if pressure in their favourdeveloped during the discussion of the Bill in the House of Lords,it would then be for consideration whether an amendment to this effect should be conceded.
The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Chancellor to arrange that government spokesmen in the forthcoming debate on House of lords reform should refrain from committing the Government,at that stage, to give sympathetic consideration to theclaims of hereditary Peeresses to sit in the House ofLords.(2) Agreed that the Bill should be introduced with a strictly limited title, even though it might prove impossible tosecure the insertion of a renunciation clause in the Houseof Commons at a subsequent stage.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,15th October, 1957.SEORET
