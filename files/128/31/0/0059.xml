3CC. 59 (57)mevxmmivat     fcrflti. rThe Foreign Secretary said that, as a result of the visit to(Previous        London of the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Dulles, it seemedReference;      likely that the present phase of the disarmament discussions couldConclusions      be -completed by the tabling of agreed proposals  by the fourMinute 4) &apos;     Western&apos;Powers, after which it was hoped the Sub-Committee wouldbe adjourned.   Mr. Dulles agreed that our purpose must be to putfoi vvard practical proposals, particularly in regard to inspection, asa test of the willingness of the Soviet Union to collaborate in makinggenuine progress in disarmament.In discussion it was suggested that the Soviet Union were of&apos;enable to secure more favourable publicity for their disarmamentproposals than the Western Powers, whose altitude, being dependentOn the establishment of agreement between them, appeared to bemore cautious and hesitant. It was particularly important, therefore,that public opinion should be assisted to appreciate the value of theWestern proposals which had now been agreed. It would be appropriate that, when the Sub-Committee adjourned, the ForeignOffice should issue an announcement containing a simplified version of those proposals; and it would be advantageous if Mr. Dulleseould be induced to collaborate in a joint public statement of the aims of the two Governments in this matter.The Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, to ensure thai thedisarmament proposals of the Western Powers received,effective publicity.Cyprus ,    *2.  The Cabinet had before them a note by the Prime Minister(Previous (C. (57) 178) covering memoranda on the arrangements for a further reference: international conference on the future of Cyprus, the delineation ofCotcIusPns2nd ^e enc^aves tP remain under exclusive British sovereignty and theMinureS,i)I1S&apos; main constitutional issues which would arise under a condominium.International conference the Foreign Secretary said that the Turkish Government seemed likely to accept the proposal for a further international conference,to discuss the international status of Cyprus and to test the praticability of the various solutions of this problem. TheSecretary-General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation(NATO) had also indicated that he would be willing to attend sucha conference. The reaction of the United States Government was uncertain; but he would seek to persuade the United States Secretaryof State, during his visit to London, of the advantages of such aconference and of the value of United States assistance in persuading the Greek Government to participate. If we were to secure Greekparticipation we must allow the Greek Government enough timeto consider our invitation with care and we must endeavour to convince them that it represented a genuine attempt on our part totake a fresh initiative towards finding an acceptable solution.Enclaves of British territory in discussion it was suggested that it might not be easy to defend the retention of so large a number of dispersed enclaves of territory under exclusive British sovereignty as was indicated in the mapattached to C. (57) 178. It was for consideration whether we shouldnot restrict our demand for exclusive sovereignty to two oi three off the most important enclaves, retaining control over the oihei* Previously recorded as ;i Confidential Annex.

The precise means by which we should do so could be left for subsequent definition, except in the^xase? of the enclaves atAkrotiri-OBpiskopi and Dhekeiia-Pergamos where we should explicitlystipulate :that exclusive British sovereignty) i&amp;ustbe maintained.Meanwhile;!further consideration should&apos;beigiven:to the arguments for and against a system&apos; of leases in perpetuity:as the basis of ourauthority in&apos;the other areas over which- we isfaouldwish to retain control.&apos;Constitutional.. IssuesTherfe was general agreement that the ^arrangements outlinedirt Appendix C&apos;. to C. (57) 178 constituted a reasonable basis of negotiation if genuine goodwill-between the threeico-domini could beassumed and the co-operation of the local inhabitants could be assured.  In discussion the following-points were: made:  (a) If the co-domini &quot;were unable to agree on the selection ordismissal of a Governor, this task should be remitted, not to NATO,but: to certain specified Powers, who might perhaps be the Powersconstituting NATO for the time being.(b) The arrangements envisaged for the defence of Cyprus were acceptable in principle; but it would not necessarily be easy to persuade NATO to accept responsibility for the defence of an islandincorporating enclaves of British territory from which we might wishto act otherwise than under NATO itself, e.g., under the Bagdad Pactor in defence.;of our own interests.(c) In relation to internal security there would be advantage inan arrangement whereby the three co-domini would give standingauthority to the Governor to act in his own discretion both in anemergency, when there was not time to consult the three co-domini,and in any case in which he was unable to secure agreement betweenthem. : The precise limits of such independent action should be examined in greater detail in due course.. (rf).The. economic aspects of a condominium would need furtherconsideration, particularly as regards commercial policy.In further discussion, however, it was emphasised that, althoughproposals on these lines might initially command the acceptance ofthe three Powers and of the local inhabitants of the island, there could be no guarantee that disorder would not subsequently reviveand that the Constitution would not then break down. In that event we must, be prepared either to re-establish British sovereignty overthe whole island by a deliberate act of international policy or (osurrender our share of the joint sovereignty over the island, otherthan the enclaves of British territory, even if this involved denouncingthe Treaty which had established the Constitution. It would be premature to disclose at this stage that we contemplated such a surrender of sovereignty in the event of a complete breakdown ofthe Constitution, since the Turkish Government would refuse toco-operate in bringing the new arrangements into effect if theysuspected us of harbouring any such intention. Nevertheless, furtherconsideration should be given to this possibility. It might also bedesirable to enlarge the Dhekeiia-Pergamos enclave to include thewhole of the Cape Greco peninsula south of Famagusta as a meansof ensuring that, in the last resort, we should have at least twosubstantial areas of territory under exclusive British sovereignty to
Betting and 3. : The Cabinet had before them a &quot;memorandum by the HomeGaming Secretary (C. (57) 179) about the Betting and Gaming Bill.(Previous 1&apos;      &apos;Reference: The Home Secretary said that the Government had undertakenCC. (57) 45th in March 1956, to introduce as soon as possible a Bill to give effectConclusions, to the main recommendations of the Royal Commission which had minute 4) considered this matter. In addition, there was a strong case on merits for reforming a branch of the law which, in its present unsatisfactory state, provided considerable scope for the corruptionof the police. On the other hand there was no united body of support for this measure among Conservative Members ofParliament, and it was certain that strong opposition to it would bevoiced in the country. Moreover, a provision would probably beinserted in the Bill by the House of Lords to give effect to a proposal! of the Jockey Club that the proceeds of betting should be subjected to a special tax for the benefit of racing; and such a provision would greatly extend the area of controversy when the Bill came back tothe House &quot;of Commons. The bookmakers, however, were themselves considering the practicability of a voluntary levy on the proceeds of betting for the furtherance of horse racing; and thequestion of proceeding with the Bill might be deferred to await the outcome of further negotiations on this aspect of the problem.\ In discussion there was general agreement that the widespreadevasion of the existing law on betting was tending to bring the lawinto contempt and to undermine the discipline and morality of thepolice. Moreover, it was recognised that if the proposed legislation was not undertaken in the forthcoming session there would be no time for it in the final session of the present Parliament.On the other hand, there appeared to be little prospect ofsecuring the successful passage of legislation which would raise manycontentious issues and might be unacceptable to non-conformistopinion. If the existing law needed to be amended, it might be preferable to adopt a more radical approach to the problem by making the totalisator the only legal method of betting and securingthereby a regular source of income for bloodstock breeding on whichthe betting industry depended.-which we could, if-necessary, withdraw.   The advantages of such.   uaction wOuld-need^to be-weighed.against&apos;the fact that the enlarged,; ^enclave would contain a substantial number of Turkish inhabitants; 50nd!some,of the most productive-land in the island.The Cabinet -(1) Took note of C.
