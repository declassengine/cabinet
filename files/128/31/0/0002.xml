3 CC. 2 (57)Foreign Affairs. 1. The Foreign Secretary said that his recent visit to Rome hadItaly.  , been of value.   He had received a cordial welcome and had heldsome useful discussions. He had been impressed by the extentto which members of the Italian Government understood andappreciated the objectives of the Anglo-French operation against egypt.The Cabinet (1) Took note of this statement.Germany. The Foreign Secretary said that, in view of the forthcoming(Previous        elections in Western Germany, it was desirable that discussions on reference:       German reunification should now be resumed, between the united cm. (55) 41st   States, United Kingdom, France and Germany, at the point whereConclusions,     they had been left at the end of the second Geneva Conference.Minute 8.)The Cabinet (2) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to arrange for the resumption of discussions with the United States, Franceand Germany on the reunification of Germany.Jordan. The Foreign Secretary said that a note offering to discuss the(Previous        future of the Anglo-Jordan Treaty had been sent to the government reference:      of Jordan in pursuance of the Cabinefs decision of 15th January.CC. (57) 1st     It now appeared, however, that Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria had conclusions,     undertaken to give to Jordan financial assistance equal to the BritishMinute 3.)       subsidy and that, in view of that undertaking, Jordan was likely to repudiate the Treaty. In order to reduce the embarrassment to whichthis would give rise, he now proposed that our offer to discuss thefuture of the Treaty should be made public, and that we should at thesame time send a further private note asking the Government of jordan to begin negotiations forthwith for the termination of theTreaty.   It might be expedient to continue the subsidy for a short period while these negotiations were in progress, so that we couldremove the valuable stocks of Service equipment which we held in jordan.   Equally, in order to discourage Jordan from leaving the sterling area, our contribution to the Jordan development loan shouldnot be prematurely discontinued, at least until it was clear whetherEgypt and Saudi Arabia were prepared to give continuing effect totheir offer of financial assistance.The Cabinet (3) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to arrange for thepublication of our earlier offer to discuss with theGovernment of Jordan the future of the Anglo-jordan treaty, and to inform the Government of Jordan that we wished to begin forthwith negotiations for the terminationof the Treaty.Iraq.(previous reference:CM. (55) 30thConclusions,Minute 9.)The Foreign Secretary said that, now that the proposed loan ofHunter IV aircraft to Iraq had lapsed, H.M. Ambassador at Bagdadwas urging that the Government of Iraq should be supplied withHunter VI aircraft, partly for payment and partly by way of gift.The Commonwealth Secretary said that Pakistan was simul-taneously pressing her demand for arms. It was important thatsuch arms as we could make available should be apportioned fairlybetween members of the Bagdad Pact.The Cabinet (4) Agreed that the supply of arms to members of the bagdad pact should be considered by the Defence Committee.
2. The Prime Minister said that the precedents did not requirethe new Administration to seek a vote of confidence from the Houseof Commons, and he did not propose to do so. It was open to theOpposition, if they so wished, to try to carry a vote of censure.The Home Secretary proposed that the House of commons should proceed during the current week with the business whichthe previous Government had announced before the recess. Inaddition the House would need to deal with the report of theCommittee of Privileges which had considered the commentspublished in the Sunday Express on the scale of petrol allowances for Members. He proposed to move on 23rd January a motionsummoning the Editor of this newspaper to attend at the Bar of theHouse on 24th January when, unless he had meanwhile offered asuitable apology, he would be reprimanded by the Speaker.*3. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the economicsituation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the position was stillgrave, especially as we had now mobilised nearly all the support forsterling which we could command and had very little in hand withwhich to meet any further crisis. In these conditions it might prove impossible to maintain the stability of the currency if the Budgetshowed the overall deficit of over  500 millions which was at presentforecast.   The most urgent need was to achieve, either by a sharp* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.The Foreign Secretary said that, if we adopted the earliersuggestion that the United Nations should be invited to sendobservers to patrol the frontier between the Aden Protectorate andthe Yemen, the observers might include representatives of the soviet union and of Czechoslovakia. Moreover he felt, on furtherreflection, that an offer to accept United Nations observers in this area might be interpreted as a sign of weakness. On balance,therefore, he proposed to take no action in the United Nations forthe time being, apart from forwarding to the Secretary-General andcirculating to the Security Council a statement of bur case againstthe Yemen, and to concentrate on inducing the Yemenis to attend the proposed meeting for the delineation of the frontier.The Cabinet (5) Took note of this statement.The Foreign Secretary referred to the increasing public concern about the position of British subjects evicted from Egypt, includingformer employees of the Egyptian Government who could normallyhave expected a pension for past services. It was important thatthese people should receive generous treatment, and the whole issuemight need early consideration by Ministers.The Home Secretary said that he had already given some thought to this subject, as a result of which he agreed that decisions ofpolicy would shortly be needed.The Cabinet (6) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the foreign secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to arrangefor urgent consideration to be given to the claims ofBritish subjects evicted from Egypt.
increase in taxation or by a drastic reduction in expenditure, suchmeasure of Budget retrenchment as would safeguard the parity of sterling. No significant increase in taxation could be contemplated indeed, it must remain the objective to reduce taxation if possible.The necessary relief to the Budget must therefore be achieved by reductions in expenditure in each of the three main fields of defence,the civil Estimates, and public investment.Defence expenditure, forecast at  1,550 millions in 1957-58,should be reduced by  100-200 millions, including a saving of atleast  100 millions on production and research where the currentoutlay was equivalent to the entire expenditure on investment in the nationalised industries. The nation could no longer afford such a level of expenditure on defence production; and it was urgently necessary to reduce the demands which it imposed, in terms both ofmaterials and skilled manpower, on the engineering industries. the apparent cut would need to be even greater than  100 millions inorder to meet the cost of compensation payments for cancelledcontracts, although not all this expenditure would be incurred in1957-58.Economies of this magnitude would not be acceptable to publicopinion without some corresponding reduction in civil expenditure.Here the target should be a cut of  50 millions, of which theNational Health Service must bear a large proportion. He wasaverse from securing small economies by minor reductions in the standards of the Service; nor did he favour the proposal that the contribution from National Insurance should be raised by an increaseof one shilling in the Insurance stamp. He would prefer to eliminatealtogether some less essential service. The total abolition of the dental service for adults, for example, would yield a saving of about 25 millions. Some further economy must be made in expenditureon civil defence. As regards public investment, this was likely to amount, in the forthcoming financial year, to  500 millions forGovernment account and  630 millions for the nationalised industries. It was difficult, and undesirable, to cut back at short notice capital expenditure on schools and hospitals; but the capitalexpenditure of the Post Office might be reduced by  20-30 millions.He accepted in principle the need for a continuing high rate of investment by the nationalised industries. But, without appearing to retard the impetus of investment as a whole, he would hope to achieve a reduction of  30-40 millions in this expenditure in theforthcoming year. For this purpose it would be necessary to examine whether capital development by the nationalised industries was wiselyconceived and economically carried out, and how far someproportion of this expenditure should be financed by the industries themselves. He proposed to discuss these matters with the Ministerof Transport and the Minister of Power.In the course of a general discussion the following points weremade:  Defence. (a) The Minister of Defence said that, as a result of the reviewalready in progress, he expected to be able to make very substantialcuts in defence expenditure if the Government and the nation wereprepared to accept the decisions of policy which these economieswould entail. They would be related, however, to a long-termpattern of forces and equipment which should not be sacrificed tothe need for economies in the immediate future.The Lord President emphasised that, notwithstanding the needfor economy, we should maintain production of those types of weapons and equipment which alone, in present circumstances,assured our status as a world Power.National Health (b) The Minister of Health said that, of the increase of  45Service. millions in his Estimate for the forthcoming year, 70 per cent, was attributable to rising costs, and especially to wage increases. Thecost of the National Health Service would still be absorbing a smaller
Housing.General.proportion of the national income than previously. If some economy was essential he was disposed to prefer an arrangement whereby theNational Insurance scheme would incorporate a contribution towardsthe National Health Service, especially as the contribution which theNational Insurance Fund now made to the Service had remainedstationary at  36 millions for nearly a decade despite increases in therates of contribution to the Fund. The total abolition of the dentalservice for adults would be a more drastic step, which he would needtime to consider.The Minister of Pensions said that the rates of National insurance contribution were already 6s. 9d. and Ss. 5d. a week for employed and self-employed persons respectively, and any increase in income which the National Insurance Fund might receive by way of increasein the contribution should be devoted primarily to reducing the rising deficit which otherwise confronted the Fund and to providingfor some slight improvement in benefits. Little, if anything, would remain to reinforce the National Health Service, unless the con-tribution was raised to a level which would be politically unrealistic.Moreover, a contribution levied on employed persons would be of limited value in helping to finance the National Health Service, as avery substantial proportion of the population the old, the young,and the married women-would still make no payment under sucha system.Civil Defence. (c) The Home Secretary said that expenditure on civil defence had been cut from  70 millions to  28 millions and, as this expenditure represented mainly the cost of manpower, it would bedifficult to find scope for additional cuts. He would, however,consider the possibility of achieving some further reduction in capitalexpenditure.Nationalised (d) The Minister of Power said that the nationalised industriesIndustries. seemed to have been exempted from the normal obligation ofcommercial, enterprises to finance their own development so far aspossible out of their own resources.. Moreover, it was doubtfulwhether these industries could accumulate a surplus for the purposeof financing capital development without provoking a claim from thetrade unions that the surplus should be distributed as increased wages.Nevertheless, he felt that the aim should be to make the nationalised industries conform to the practice of other business enterprises inregard to capital development, and he proposed to consider how this might be achieved.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he recognised thepossible conflict between the Government^ policy of maintaininggeneral stability of prices and the need of the nationalised industries to raise their prices sufficiently to provide a surplus for capital development. Nevertheless, he thought it important in principle thatthese industries should finance their own development as far &quot;aspossible, and a balance of advantage would have to be struck ineach case. It was essential, in any event, to reinforce the procedure for ensuring that the country obtained full value for the very largeinvestment by the nationalised industries.(e) On the question whether measures of economy in expendituremight need to be reinforced by building controls, it was pointed outthat effective steps had already been taken to discourage housingdevelopment by restrictions on credit and higher rates of interest, andthere seemed to be little need to reinforce these measures for the timebeing. Expenditure on private and public housing would probablyfall by  40 millions in the forthcoming year.(/) It was important that some attempt should, if possible, bemade to reduce the burdens falling on the middle class, including the substantial number of people whose incomes did not reach the surtaxlevel. Relief could be given in a number of ways at little cost tothe Exchequer if it were politically possible to provide it. Conversely,
Cyprus. 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Minister(Previous of State for Colonial Affairs (C. (57) 4) proposing that a statementReference: should be made about the outcome of the recent discussions whichCM. (56) 102nd officials had held with Archbishop Makarios on Lord Radcliffe&apos;conclusions,    constitutional proposals for Cyprus.Minute 1.) jne prime Minister said that the Government would beaccording undue prominence to the Archbishop if a lengthy statement about these discussions was issued before the reassembly ofParliament. It would be enough to make a short statement when parliament met, in answer to a Question, deploring the Archbishop&apos;attitude and expressing the hope that he would reconsider it.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in agreement with thisview. The alternative drafts annexed to C. (57) 4 conveyed theimpression that there was no prospect of breaking the deadlock whichhad been reached, in spite of the fact that the Archbishop had given some indication that, if he were free, he would use his influence to end terrorism in Cyprus. This point would be seized upon by publicopinion, and it was the more important that it should be made clear in the announcement that the way remained open for further discussions should the Archbishop choose to co-operate.any significant curtailment of the National Health Service, such asthe abolition of the dental service for adults, would bear hardly onthe middle class, who had probably derived greater benefit from the health Service than any other section of the community.Parliamentary (g)   it would not be easy to achieve reductions in expenditureProcedure. of the order now envisaged before the Estimates were due to be, presented. An enquiry should therefore be put in hand at onceabout the extent to which Supply procedure would permit theGovernment to proceed, at least for Service Votes if not for civil estimates, by introducing a Vote on Account which would secure an adequate supply of interim finance without disclosing the totalsof the Votes, which would not be published until final decisions ofpolicy had been taken. It would be necessary to consider the probableimpact of this abnormal procedure on public opinion both in thiscountry and abroad.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thedefence and social services, however desirable they might be in themselves, would be of no avail if the attempt to sustain them atunrealistic levels resulted in a collapse of the economy. If thenecessary retrenchment in expenditure could be achieved, the nationcould reasonably look forward to better times when the immediatecrisis had been overcome and the massive programmes of investmentbegan to bear fruit. The problem of achieving the essentialeconomies in the short-term must be solved in such a way as not to prejudice the formulation of sound policies for the long-term,especially in the case of defence. But both defence and the social services must make a significant contribution.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider, inconsultation with the Home Secretary, the Minister ofDefence and the Chief Whip, what modifications in theParliamentary procedure of Supply might be desirable and feasible to meet the problem created by the need to achieve significant short-term economies in government expenditure.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider further,in consultation with the Ministers concerned, proposalsfor achieving savings in expenditure of the order whichhad been discussed.
The Cabinet-  -Invited the Foreign Secretary and the Minister of State for colonial Affairs to concert, in the light of their discussion,the terms of an answer to be given on 23rd January to a parliamentary Question about the recent discussions withArchbishop Makarios.5. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of theCabinet (CP. (57) 10), covering a summary of a report by an inter-departmental working party on the development of coal resources in the African Commonwealth. It emerged from this report thatthere could be no certainty of a continuing requirement for the import of coal into the United Kingdom over the next ten years, and thatany development of coal resources in Africa based on the expectation of a continuing market in the United Kingdom would involve a riskwhich, in terms of the probable price and quality of African coal,could not be justified.In discussion it was suggested that further thought would need to be given to the best means of presenting these conclusions toParliament, especially as they were unlikely to satisfy those Membersof Parliament who favoured the development of coal production in africa.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Power to arrange for furtherconsideration to be given to the most appropriate methodof presenting to Parliament the conclusions of the working party on the development of coal resources in Africa.6. The Minister of Transport said that in a recent arbitrationa 3 per cent, increase in wages had been awarded to those railway workers who were members of the Associated Society of locomotive engineers and Firemen (A.S.L.E.F.). The National Union of railwaymen (N.U.R.) had deferred submitting a comparable claim;but the implementation of the arbitration award was dependent onthe agreement of the N.U.R., who were not prepared to accept anincrease of only 3 per cent. If the British Transport commission were not prepared to offer an increase higher than 3 per cent., itwas possible, though not very probable, that the N.U.R. would resort to strike action. On the other hand, if any higher increase (e.g., of3\ per cent.) were conceded to the N.U.R., it would have to beextended to A.S.L.E.F. The Transport Commission had soughtguidance from the Government on this issue.In discussion it was suggested that, if the N.U.R. took their claimto arbitration, they would probably secure some improvement ona 3 per cent, increase, since the awards of arbitration panels were now being closely related to movements in the cOst-of-living index.It might therefore be advisable to settle as rapidly as possible withthe N.U.R. on a compromise increase of 3\ per cent, rather thanrisk an arbitration which might award an increase of 4 per cent, oreven more.On the other hand, it was urged that employers in theengineering industries were now determined to resist unreasonableapplications for wage increases. If the Transport Commissionoffered to compromise on this issue, their determination would bereduced. It might therefore be better to allow the N.U.R. claimto be taken to arbitration than yield voluntarily to pressure from therailway unions.
In further discussion it was suggested that the chief risk lay ina public rejection of an offer by the Transport Commission. TheCommission should therefore ascertain privately whether the N.U.R.would accept an increase of 3-J per cent. If they would not, theCommission should stand on their offer of 3 per cent., accepting boththe risk that the N.U.R. might take strike action and the moreprobable risk that they would take their claim to arbitration and perhaps secure an increase higher than 1\ per cent.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Transport to inform the british transport  Commission  of  the  Government^  view  asindicated above.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,22nd January, 1957.
