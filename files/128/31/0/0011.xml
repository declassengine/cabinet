rent restriction.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 4thConclusions,Minute 3.)The Minister of Housing said that this was a question whichwould arise primarily in relation to the houses of lower value as theywere gradually released from control. In those cases the law relatingto security of tenure might well be amended and brought up-to-date,and he proposed to discuss with the Lord Chancellor what action might be taken for this purpose.(c) It was agreed that the balance of advantage lay in announcing the Governmenfs proposals and in tabling the necessary amendments to the Bill as soon as possible.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals in C. (57) 32.(2) Invited the Minister of Housing to settle, in consultation withthe Chief Whip, the arrangements for announcing the government&apos;s intentions and for tabling the necessary amendments to the Rent Bill.(3) Invited the Minister of Housing to consult with the LordChancellor about the provision of greater security of tenure for tenants of rented houses.51159-111. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Housing(C. (57) 32) recommending certain changes in the provisions of the rent Bill dealing with the decontrol of houses of higher value.The Minister of Housing said that in its present form the bill would deprive the tenants of these houses not merely of theadvantage of a controlled rent but also of all security of tenure, after a short period of notice. This had created disquiet among government supporters and it had been represented that, because ofthe continued shortage of middle-class housing, the Bill should be amended to provide security of tenure for some period varyingbetween three and seven years. While there was no justification, oneconomic or political grounds, for postponing the effective decontrolof these properties until after the next General Election, he shared the opinion of his predecessor that the present provisions of the bill were unduly harsh. Landlords and tenants should be given more time and incentive to reach agreement, on the conditions of newtenancies. This could be secured by increasing from six to fifteen months the period of notice to raise rents or to obtain possession,while providing that new tenancy agreements for terms of not lessthan three years might, if agreed between landlord and tenant, comeinto effect, as soon as they were concluded. It was also proposed to prohibit the exaction of a premium for a new tenancy for a period ofthree years after the passage of the Bill.The Minister of Defence supported these proposals. It was particularly important that it should be made illegal to require apremium, and that landlords should be required, in serving notice ontheir tenants, to inform them of their rights under the Bill.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) It could be argued that a period of fifteen months&apos; notice wasunduly generous; and that a period of one year would be bothadequate in itself and a clear indication of the Governmenfs intentionto adhere firmly to the main principles of the Bill. It was generally felt, however, that the proposed period of fifteen months should beaccepted.(b) It was undesirable that the tenants of houses which would befreed from control should revert to the execessive insecurity of a weekly tenancy, and the opportunity might be taken to provide fora minimum security of tenancy of, perhaps, three months.
Farm price review(previous reference:C.C. (57) 10thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Agriculture (C. (57) 35) covering a schedule of changes in price guarantees and production grants designed to increase the total value of the guarantees by  8 millions.The Minister of Agriculture said that he remained of theopinion that any settlement which awarded an increase of less than 15 millions in farm price guarantees would endanger the improvedrelations between the Government and the farmers which had been created by the new system of long-term guarantees. An increase of 15 millions would reflect a rise of no more than l\ per cent, in the selling prices of farm products a rise which was not out of scale withthe price increases of non-agricultural commodities. In relation tothe increases of  28 millions and  25 millions which had beenconceded by the awards of the two previous years an increase of only 8 millions was unlikely to be acceptable to the farmers, especially since its distribution among commodities, as illustrated by theschedule to his memorandum, would not suffice to maintainprofitability on any of the items in which an increase of production was desirable. If, therefore, the Cabinet adhered to their decision to limit the increase to  8 millions, he was strongly of the opinion thatthis offer should be made at the outset of the negotiations as a singlefigure and defended by reference, not to the increases which it would permit in the prices of individual commodities, but rather to the factthat in a year of acute financial stringency there was no case for atotal increase greater than the minimum required by the new systemof long-term guarantees.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the farmers should recognise that, apart from the proposed increase of  8 millions, thecost to the Exchequer of the existing agricultural subsidies would inany case rise by  13 millions in 1957-58. In addition, the farmers would, in that year, benefit for the first time from the new system ofcapital grants, authorised at the rate of  5 millions per annum. Ona conservative estimate, therefore, the farmers would receive about 24 millions more next year than in the current year. In view of thisheavy additional burden on the Exchequer there was no case for granting an increase of more than  8 millions.In discussion the following points were made: -la) The difference between the minimum settlement and an offer of  15 millions was only some  7 millions. This would be a relatively small price to pay in order to retain the goodwill of the farming community, which would be alienated if the first price determinationunder the system of long-term guarantees conceded no more than theminimum. The Cabinet were informed that the Home Secretaryconsidered that some modest increase above the figure of  8 millionsmight be desirable.(b) Any improvement on the figure of  8 millions which it might become necessary to consider should be.confined strictly to thosecommodities in which some increase in production was desirable.On the other hand, it could be argued that there was no agriculturalcommodity in which an increase of production above the current levelmight not, in terms of its effect on the balance of payments, do more harm than good. From this point of view a tariff on meat might wellbe preferable, and no less acceptable to the farmers, than any further increase in the subsidies to individual commodities beyond thoseimplied in a total increase of  8 millions.(c) The total of the guarantees and its distribution amongdifferent commodities were important to the small, rather than to thelarge, farmer. It was for consideration whether the greater part of theproposed increase of  8 millions should not be directed to the small farmer by relating payments to prescribed acreages of land or outputof various types of product. This could, however, be represented asa device to subsidise inefficiency and to penalise the efficient and progressive farmer. It was important that the system of agricultural
subsidies should continue to be seen to be based on sound economicprinciples.The Prime Minister, in summing up the discussion, said that thenegotiations with the farmers should start on the basis that anincrease of  8 millions not only discharged in full the Governmentsobligations under the system of long-term guarantees, but alsorepresented a heavy burden on the Exchequer in a year of particularfinancial difficulty. If it became necessary to consider some further concession to the farmers, the Cabinet would need to decide whether to adjust the structure of the subsidy system in order to favour thesmall, rather than the large, farmer; or to permit, by reference topurely economic criteria, some relatively small modification in theprices of individual commodities implied by a total increase of 8 millions; or to impose a tariff on meat. Further consideration ofthese possible courses of action could wait upon the progress of thenegotiations.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Agriculture to be guided, in his negotiations with the farmers, by the views expressed in their discussion.Remuneration 3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theof Doctors. Secretary  of State for Scotland and the Minister  of Health(Previous (C. (57) 33) about the composition and terms of reference of the reference: proposed Royal Commission on the pay of doctors and dentists inC.C. (57) 3rd the National Health Service.   They also had before them a conclusions, memorandum by the Lord President (C. (57) 34) on the need for a minute 2.) corresponding review of the remuneration of doctors employed in research establishments.The Minister of Health said that the dentists in the national health Service had now followed the doctors in submitting a claim for an increase in pay of 24 per cent. He was due to resumediscussions with the doctors&apos; representatives on 20th February, and itwas important that he should be able to inform them at that meetingof the Governments proposal to establish a Royal Commission.The Lord President said that the advance of medical practice was largely dependent on the contributions made by research workers;yet for the latter, however brilliant, there was no system of distinctionawards comparable with that which obtained in the National health service. As a result, the difference between the relative rewards ofthe two sides of the profession was now so great that it was becoming increasingly difficult to persuade the gifted man to devote himself to research. Although it might be impracticable to extend the scope ofenquiry of the proposed Royal Commission to cover doctors engaged on research, it was important that some corresponding consideration should be given to their case. He intended therefore, afterconsultation with the Minister of Health, to circulate proposals onthis subject.In discussion of the proposed terms of reference of the RoyalCommission it was suggested that, if the Commission wereempowered to make recommendations about the principles whichshould govern the levels of remuneration of doctors and dentists bythe National Health Service and by local authorities, the result mightbe to perpetuate the unfortunate consequences which had followed the Spens&apos; Reports and the Danckwerts award. Moreover, it was undesirable that the Commission should also be authorised torecommend arrangements for bringing this remuneration underperiodical review, since these arrangements might necessitate a regularre-examination of doctors&apos; remuneration on the lines of theagricultural price review. It might be preferable that the RoyalCommission should be required merely to make recommendations on
the appropriate level of remuneration for doctors and dentists inpresent circumstances, and to indicate in general terms how thisremuneration might be kept under review.Against this it was argued that there would be advantage inremoving the question of doctors&apos; pay from the field of political controversy. Moreover, the proposals were not likely to be acceptable to the doctors if the Royal Commission were not explicitlyempowered to examine the principles which should determine their remuneration.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the terms of reference should be drawn in a manner which would leave the Governmentshands as free as possible for the future. He would like to give furtherconsideration to them from this point of view.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) The proposed terms of reference might be construed asprecluding the Royal Commission from considering the relativelevels of remuneration of the different branches of the medical profession engaged in the National Health Service. consideration should be given to amending the terms of reference to enable this aspect of the matter to be brought under review.(b) The appointment of a Chairman for the Royal commission from the legal profession should not be excluded.(c) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that any improvementin the remuneration of research doctors would have repercussions on the pay of other research scientists and university teachersgenerally. He would need to give further consideration- to^ thismatter, in consultation with the Ministers concerned.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister ofHealth, to give further consideration to the terms ofreference for the proposed Royal Commission and tosubmit recommendations to the Prime Minister.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministers concerned,would consider the composition of the proposed RoyalCommission.(3) Invited the Lord President, after consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Health,to circulate proposals for reviewing the pay of doctorsengaged on research.government expenditure.(previous reference:C.C.(57)7thConclusions,Minute 1.)national health service.* 4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (57) 31) and the Minister of Pensionsand National Insurance (C. (57) 36) about the National health service.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet must now decide whether to abandon the attempt to achieve substantial economies in Government expenditure in 1957-58 or to adopt in principle theproposal that the National Health Service should be established ona contributory basis. On the latter hypothesis it would also benecessary to decide whether the necessary legislative andadministrative action should be confined to the National health service alone or whether, for the reasons given in the memorandumby the Minister of Pensions (C. (57) 36), the opportunity should betaken to deal at the same time with the increase in both thecontributions and the benefits of the National Insurance scheme.* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
In discussion there was general agreement that the national health Service should be established on a contributory basis, the contribution being initially fixed at twice the figure of that element in the National Insurance contribution which was at presentattributable to the National Health Service, i.e., at Is. %d. for anemployed man over 1.8. It might be advisable that the legislation should empower the Government to make subsequent increases inthis contribution by Order.The Minister of Pensions said that in the light of the latestmovement in the index of retail prices, the current value of theNational Insurance retirement pension for a single person in termsof real purchasing power was now Is. Sd. below its value in 1946and 3s. Id. below its value in 1955. Political.pressure for an increasein National Insurance benefits was growing rapidly. If a newcontribution was introduced for. the national health Service but wasrecorded, for administrative convenience, by means of the samestamp as the National Insurance contribution, the public wouldinterpret this as increasing their liability unden the-National Insurancescheme without any compensating increase in their national insurance benefits. The pressure for an increase in those benefits would be aggravated and the Government would lose the initiativeif any increase in benefits which they subsequently decided to make on merits appeared to have been extracted : from t them * by this pressure. It would be wiser, therefore, that.the introduction of thenew contribution to the National Health Service should be deferredto coincide with the increase in both contributions and benefits underthe National Insurance scheme which would sooner or later become inevitable. The precise timing of the combined operation might beleft to be settled in the light of movements in the cost-of-living index;and it might be possible to postpone the increase in national insurance benefits until the next Session. In that case, any announcement in the near future about the Governments intentionsfor the National Health Service would need to be in general terms.Discussion showed that the Cabinet, while appreciating thepolitical force of the argument of the Minister of Pensions, consideredthat the need for a significant reduction in Government expenditurein the forthcoming Budget was the overriding consideration. Theproposal to establish a separate contribution in respect of theNational Health Service should therefore be announced forthwith,and the contribution should, if possible, come into effect well inadvance of the probable increase in controlled rents in October.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that on this basis the newcontribution might be expected to yield some  20 millions in 1957-58.In addition, he proposed that the charge for school meals should beincreased to Is.; that this increase should, if possible, be broughtinto effect forthwith by Order; and that the charge for welfare milkshould be raised to 4d. (with a comparable charge for national driedmilk), this increase taking effect as soon as possible notwithstanding the argument which could be advanced on agricultural grounds fordeferring it until July.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the National Health Service should beestablished on a contributory basis, the contribution foran employed man over 18 being initially fixed at Is. 8d.(2) Agreed that the charge for school meals should be raised to Is.(3) Agreed that the charge for welfare milk should be raised from \\d. to Ad. (with a comparable charge for nationaldried milk).(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for theannouncement of these measures at an early date and
to consider the legislative and administrative action whichwould be required to enable them to take effect as rapidly as possible.Aden. 5.   The Minister of Defence said that, in accordance with the(Previous views expressed by the Cabinet, our forces in the Aden ProtectorateReference: were refraining from bombing from the air the Yemeni tribes whoC.C. (57) 8th were shelling our positions from Yemen territory.  They were now,Conclusions, however, being supplied with reinforcements of artillery, and it was minute 3.) important that they should be authorised to bring these guns into action, if necessary, against targets outside the Protectorate.The Cabinet Agreed that, if Yemeni tribesmen continued to shell Britishpositions in the Aden Protectorate, our forces should beauthorised to reply with artillery fire against targets in Yementerritory.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,15th February, 1957.
