1. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the memorandumby the Postmaster-General (C. (57) 158) proposing increases in PostOffice charges to yield additional revenue of  42 millions a year.The Prime Minister said that, although increased costs should be financed by increased tariffs on normal commercial principles, it was arguable that the proposed increases in charges should be spread overa rather longer period. The proposals envisaged that, within the eighteen months from October 1957 to March 1959 the deficit of 6-3 millions incurred in 1956-57 should be converted into a surplusof  5 millions in 1958-59, after allowing for further increased costs of  7^ millions which might be expected to accrue during that period.This represented a very considerable sum to be provided within acomparatively short time, and it was for consideration whether the recovery of the existing deficit of  6-3 millions might be spread overa longer period. In particular, it might be desirable to defer theproposed increases in telephone charges until the greatly improvedtelephone facilities, which would mark the first stage of subscribertrunk dialling, were introduced in January 1958.In discussion it was pointed out that if, for example, no surpluswas provided in 1958-59 and no provision was made for further increases in costs, a figure of  30 millions a year would still representthe irreducible minimum of additional revenue required; and that public opinion, which was becoming increasingly restive about rising costs in general, would be unlikely to receive a figure of this orderany more favourably than the full  42 millions now envisaged.Moreover, every effort should be made to avoid the further increases in Post Office charges after a short period which would otherwise beinescapable in view of the virtual certainty of some further increasein costs. As it was, the  7^ millions provided on this account in the1958-59 estimates represented only half the rate of previous cost increases, while the  5 millions surplus provided for that year was no more than marginal in relation to the Post Office&apos;s total turnover. Ifthe proposals were modified by deferring the increases in telephonecharges to come into operation simultaneously with the improvedtelephone services in January 1958, three months&apos; additional revenue would be sacrificed; and any attempt to recover this loss by introducing the higher postal charges before October 1957 would cause considerable dislocation to the business community.It was therefore the general view of the Cabinet that increases in post Office charges would best be made in a single operation, toproduce additional revenue of some  42 millions a year as from october 1957.Discussion then turned to the specific proposals included inC. (57) 158.  The following points were made:  (a) The proposed increase in the inland letter rate from 2%d. to3d. would be unwelcome to the general public, particularly since this service still made a profit. It was for consideration whether thisparticular increase might be avoided if the tariffs for services whichhad been running at a loss (e.g., inland telegraphs) were increasedmore sharply than was proposed. It was pointed out, however, thatthe increases proposed in these unremunerative services represented the maximum which the traffic would bear; and that the inlandtelegraph service, in which no increase was contemplated, had to bemaintained as a social service, particularly for rural areas which hadno telephonic facilities. Moreover it would be very difficult to finance the increases needed in Post Office revenue without the largeyield of  12 - 4 millions from the increased letter charge. In any event the profit on this service had been rapidly decreasing in recent years.(b) There was no scope for greater increases in the rates forparcels than the proposals envisaged. Present rates were alreadythree times the pre-war figures; and the standard of the service had deteriorated.
(c) i The existing special; rate for Canadian magazine post wasadmittedly anomalous; but to increase it at this juncture might beregarded by the new Canadian Government as an unfriendly gesture.It was agreed that this increase, which would yield only  200,000 ina full year, should5 hot ;be made&apos;.(d) In order to raise to 4d. the poundage on postal orders of 20^.statutdry authority would be required. It was agreed that.,,theproposals For increases :in postal order poundage should be modified to elimiriate ,ahy need for legislation, at the cost of a reduction by 750,000 in the additional revbriue envisaged by these proposals.(k)l!TM&apos;s re^tifction w^d^jioweVer,&apos; be made good by additionalselective increased int61epn6tie&apos;charges. The proposals in C. (57) 158would: reduce the differential in the ^rentals &apos;paid&apos;:by business andprivate1 subscribers; at; the&apos;1 expense b. the latter. It - was thereforeagreed^that&apos;:tne 13 tariff proposed ^orexclukivebusiness lines shouldbe raised rto!&apos;  14: .&apos; !The : Pdstmasfer-Geherar would also considerwhether? &apos;sohie increase :nlight &apos;b6&apos;1 made in the charges for privatebranch&apos;,&apos; exchange; arid extension&apos; rentals.In further discussion it was agreed that there would be advantage in an early&apos; statement of the Government^ policy in view of thespeculation which had already been aroused in the Press. The draft parliamentary statement should be revised in order to emphasise thatthe increases in tariffs were the direct result of wage increases over which the&apos; Post Office had no control and were justified by normal commercial principles, having regard also to the need to maintaincertain services for reasons of general social policy.The statement should not, however, incorporate any pledge of tariff stability until March 1959.The Cabinet-CD Approved the proposals for increased Post Office changes made in C. (57) 158, subject to the modifications agreedih their discussion. ;(2) Invited the Postmaster-General, in consultation with theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, to revise the draft parliamentary statement in the light of their discussion and to- submit the amended text to the Prime Minister.Jute    !    i. 2.   The Secretary: of St ate for Scotland said that, together with industry. the President; of the Board of Trade, he had met representatives of(Previous the jute industry and had informed them of the: Government&apos;reference: decision to reduce the, protection which the industry at present.C. (57) 52nd enjoyed. The representatives of the industry had made a strong pleaConclusions, for the continuance of the present arrangements, basing their caseMinute 6.)      mainly On earlier pledges by the Government; to maintain protection.They had, however,  been told that they must accept the Government^decision.It remained for consideration whether, as a possible palliative of&apos; the damage: which the industry would j suffer, representations shouldbe made to the Government of Pakistan to reduce the price of their exports of jute.The Cabinet (1) Tbok note of this statement:(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in consultationwith: the Secretary 1 of State: for11 Scotland, to considerwhether any representations could usefully be addressedto !thei Government of Pakistan about a possible reductionin the price of exports of jute from Pakistan.Cabinet Office; S.W: I,17th July, 1957.
