Tariff Policy. 2.   The President of the Board of Trade said that the Import(Previous        Duties Bill at present provided for the establishment of an ImportReference:      Duties Board to assist the Treasury and the Board of Trade in theCC. (57) 75th   discharge of their functions under the Act. This provision had been conclusions,    included because it had previously been thought that, as the ImportMinute 6.)       Duties Advisory Committee of the pre-war years was not to be revived, Parliament would expect some outside body to be createdwith comparable, though less authoritative, functions.   In fact,however, this provision had not proved popular with any section ofinformed opinion and it now appeared that Parliament would be content that this jurisdiction should be exercised by the government without the help of any outside body.   Subject, therefore, to theviews of his colleagues he proposed to bring forward an amendment to delete this provision from the Bill.The Cabinet Authorised the President of the Board of Trade to table,during the Committee Stage of the Import Duties Bill, an amendment designed to delete the clause providing for theappointment of an Import Duties Board.Ballistic 3.   The Minister of Defence said that in the House of CommonsRockets. that afternoon he had to answer a Private Notice Question about theproposed agreement for the stationing in this country of intermediate-range ballistic rockets provided by the United States Government.This agreement, which was on the point of completion, provided that most of these rocket sites would be manned by British troops; but itcontemplated that, at a later stage, there might be at least one sitewhich would be manned by United States forces. This latterpossibility had not yet been disclosed publicly. He thought it might become necessary to say, in reply to supplementary questions, that itwas under consideration. It could of course be said that it arose, notin relation to this country alone, but also to the territories of othermembers of the North Atlantic Council.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement by the Ministerof Defence.Umted staes 4.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, under the 1957and Canada Agreement on the United States and Canadian loa^/we^lSeSttifl^jLoans. to withhold annual payment of interest and capital on not more than(Previous seven occasions during the whole period of repayment, on the basisReference: that the payments withheld would be made at the end of the fullCM. (56) 104th period together with interest at the low rate of 2 per cent   In viewConclusions, of the heavy burden of other debt repayments and other claims orMinute 8.) the reserves which faced us in the current year, he had come to the parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.It was at present proposed that a debate on Foreign affairs should be held on 19th December. If, however, the meeting of theNorth Atlantic Council was not completed by the evening of18th December, it might become necessary for this debate to be postponed until 20th December. It might be possible, by17th December, to indicate to Parliament whether this change ofarrangements was likely to become necessary.Parliament would adjourn for the Christmas recess on20th December and would reassemble on 21st January.
House of Lords 5. The Cabinet were informed that, during the Committee StageReform. cf the Life Peerages Bill in the House of Lords, amendments were(Previous likely to be pressed which would have the effect of extending the scopeReference: of the reform proposed by the Government. It was possible thatCC. (57) 81st some of these might be carried against the advice of GovernmentConclusions,    spokesmen.Minute 8.) jfoe Cabinet agreed that the supporters of these amendmentsshould be warned in confidence that, if the scope of the Bill were substantially extended as a result of amendments made in the Houseof Lords, the Government would be unable to carry it through theHouse of Commons and would be obliged to abandon it altogether.British 6.   The Prime Minister said that the British Petroleum CompanyPetroleum were thinking of closing the oil refinery at Haifa which was managedCompany. by them and jointly owned by them and the Shell Company. the refinery at Government did not seek to influence decisions taken by the companyHaifa. on commercial grounds.   It would however be impracticable for ministers to contend that, on such a matter as the closing of theHaifa refinery, their views had not been sought; and it was desirablethat in this and similar matters a procedure should be followed whichwould enable the company to take account of the Governmenfs viewson political aspects, while leaving them free to exercise their owncommercial judgment. This would be secured if it could be arranged that the company would themselves take the initiative in asking whether there were any political considerations which theGovernment would wish them to take into account before they reached their decision.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Power to devise, in consultation withthe Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer,a procedure for consultation between the Government andthe British Petroleum Company on the lines suggested by thePrime Minister; and to arrange for this procedure to befollowed by the company in reaching their decision on thefuture of the oil refinery at Haifa.conclusion that we should be fully justified in withholding the annual payment on these loans which fell due this month. Subject to theviews of his colleagues, he proposed that the United States and canadian Governments should be so informed.In discussion the point was made that this decision should be presented to the public in such a way as to avoid impairing confidence in sterling. It could be stressed that some of the strain on the reservesarose from exceptional non-recurring demands e.g., India&apos;s use ofher sterling balances to finance her development, plans.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the annual payments of interest and capital onthe United States and Canadian loans should this year be withheld, in accordance with the terms of the 1957Agreement.(2) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange forthis decision to be notified to the Governments of theUnited States and Canada, and thereafter to be announced in the House of Commons on 17th December.
Libya.(previous reference:CC. (57) 1stConclusions,Minute 2.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (57) 277) on the extent of United Kingdom assistanceto Libya.The Foreign Secretary said that, in the light of a reassessmentof our interests in Libya and of the limited extent to which the UnitedStates Government were constitutionally able to incur long-termfinancial commitments abroad, it was necessary to reconsider theearlier Cabinet decision on our policy towards Libya.He now proposed that we should press the United StatesGovernment to agree that the future level of financial assistance tcLibya should be discussed with the Libyan Government by the ambassadors of the United States and the United Kingdom on thebasis (which would not be disclosed to the Libyan Government duringthe preliminary negotiations) that we might be prepared to contribute 2^-3 millions to the Libyan budget deficit instead of the  1  millions which we had originally envisaged. He also proposed that, whileadhering to the programme for the evacuation of barracks in Libyawhich had now been agreed with the Libyan Government, we should retain our remaining troops in Libya after March 1959 until further notice and that we should also maintain the British Military Missionfor a further period if suitable arrangements could be made for itsco-operation with the newly-established United States military mission.In discussion it was agreed that, in view of the importance of preventing Libya from turning to Egypt for assistance and of retaining the air-staging facilities which we enjoyed there at present, it wouldbe desirable in principle that our policy towards Libya should be adjusted on the basis proposed, particularly as the British troops in libya could be retained until March 1959 without increasing the totalof our defence expenditure. It was, however, for consideration,whether, in order to justify the maintenance of the British military mission for a further period, we should seek to reach an understanding with the United States Government whereby the Libyan forces wouldbe supplied with British equipment financed by the United StatesGovernment.The proposal that we should increase our subvention to the libyan budget deficit beyond the limits originally envisaged wouldalso need further examination as part of the current review of theForeign Office Estimates for the forthcoming financial year. while we could not expect to carry out a policy of containment in the middle east without incurring some additional expenditure, we shouldcontinue to press the United States Government to accept the major part of the financial liability in respect of assistance towards countriesin this area.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to give further considerationto the level of our future financial assistance to Libya.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theMinister of Defence, to examine the possibility of negotiating with the United States Government anarrangement whereby the Libyan forces would be supplied with British equipment at the cost of the United StatesGovernment.(3) Subject to the result of the enquiries to be made underConclusions (1) and (2) above, approved the proposals inC. (57) 277.
road programme.(previous reference:CC. (57) 45thConclusions,Minute 7.)Severn Bridge.9. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C. (57) 274) and the Minister for Welsh Affairs(C. (57) 273) and the Minister of Transport (C. (57) 283) on thequestion whether an early announcement should be made thatconstruction of a bridge over the Severn would be begun during thefinancial year 1960-61. They also had before them a joint memorandum by the three Ministers on the cost of this project(C. (57) 289).The Minister for Welsh Affairs said that the Government were under strong pressure from Wales to take and to announce thisdecision. Welsh opinion was already jealous of the government&apos;s decision to go forward with the road bridge over the Forth; and this position would become worse if it became known that work on the tyne tunnel was to start in 1960-61. The Severn Bridge would be anessential element in any soundly conceived programme of roaddevelopment in this part of the country; and its construction, the costof which would eventually be met by the receipts from tolls, was fully justified on economic grounds.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that inflation had not yetbeen brought under effective control. Large supplementary estimates were about to be presented, and painful cuts would haveto be made in the Estimates for 1958-59. In these circumstances itwould be most inappropriate for the Government to announce their intention to proceed with this costly project in 1960-61. capital projects of this magnitude should be considered as part of a balancedprogramme; and major projects should be spaced in such a way that,taking account of our export interests, they did not overtax theresources of the engineering industry and other industries concerned.He had instituted a system whereby a review was undertaken in the spring of each year of the capital programme for the ensuing twoNorth Atlantic 8.   The Prime Minister said that important issues of foreignCouncil. policy might well emerge from the discussions in Paris during theforthcoming meeting of the North Atlantic Council. Most of themembers of the Alliance would be represented there by Heads of governments, and there would be useful opportunities for informaltalks apart from the proceedings in the Council itself. He certainlyhad it in mind to broach some of these issues in private conversationwith President Eisenhower and Mr. Dulles. He hoped, in particular,to persuade them to accept the implications of the fact that, until theywere in a position to rely on inter-continental missiles, the defences ofthe North American continent must be established in Europe. he also wished to probe more deeply into the current state of Americanthinking on the major problem which would soon confront the north atlantic Alliance, viz., whether policy should be directed towardslinking Western Germany more firmly with the military organisationof Western Europe, or whether it should move towards a process ofdisengagement designed to pave the way for an understanding withthe Soviet Union on the basis of a unified but neutral Germany.These were great issues, and it was not to be supposed that they wouldbe brought to a decision in the course of the forthcoming discussions in Paris. It was however certain that they would be broached in private discussions and possible that some of them might be touched on in the Council itself. He would do his best to keep the cabinet informed of the course of the discussions, and it might be necessaryfor them to meet urgently if the United Kingdom representatives atthe meeting found themselves obliged to take a definite line on someaspect of these major questions.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Ministers statement.
years and the new projects to be started in the third. The right timefor taking and announcing a decision on the Severn Bridge would beon the occasion of the next such review in the following April.The Minister of Transport said that, while the Severn Bridge had become an acute political issue in Wales and the West of England, he accepted the arguments for deferring a decision until the project couldbe considered in the next review of capital commitments. On thequestion of overstraining physical resources, he thought it would be advisable to examine the strain which the construction of some eightmajor bridges and tunnels was likely to impose on the engineering industry with a view to securing the most satisfactory spacing of allthese projects.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were agreed that it would be premature to announce a decision to embark on the construction ofthe Severn Bridge in 1960-61 until this decision could be taken in the context of the forthcoming review of capital undertakings for thethree-year period ending in that year. Meanwhile, in apportioningfunds allocated for road development in the years immediately ahead,the provision of  1^ millions, which would be needed to coverexpenditure on the Severn Bridge during the first two years of construction, should not be diverted to other developments. It wouldalso be advisable to intimate, in the forthcoming Welsh debate, that,while the Government were giving serious consideration to thismatter, the impact of such major projects on limited engineeringresources was a factor which must be taken into account.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the conclusion in pararaph 7 of C. (57) 274.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport to arrange for a review tobe undertaken of the strain which major civil engineeringprojects were likely to impose on the resources of theindustries concerned in the years ahead, with a view tosubmitting to the Cabinet in due course proposals for asatisfactory spacing of these projects.Malta.(previous reference:CC. (57) 80thConclusions,Minute 4.)10. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (57) 291) submitting revised proposals for constitutional development in Malta which he had prepared after consultation withthe Commonwealth Secretary, the Colonial Secretary and the LawOfficers.The Home Secretary said that there were three main issues to bedecided first, the formula for the incorporation of Malta in theUnited Kingdom; second, the provision for Malta&apos;s representation inthe Parliament at Westminster; and, third, the definition of the relation between that Parliament and the Maltese Parliament in termsof legislative authority.The first two of these issues would best be dealt with by including in the Integration Bill clauses on the lines of the drafts in Annex A ofC. (57) 291. These provided that, as from the appointed day, Maltashould be included among the territories comprised in the UnitedKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and that any reference to the United Kingdom should be construed accordingly;that in no event would Malta cease to be part of the United kingdom without the consent of the Parliament of Malta; and that Maltashould be represented in the United Kingdom Parliament and shouldnot cease to be so represented without the consent of the MalteseParliament.    These  provisions  would  secure  to   the   Maltese
Government the substance of the affirmation on the status of the island which they were concerned to obtain, without involving anychange in the Royal Style and Title or in the title of the UnitedKingdom or of its Parliament; and, while they also established theprinciple of Maltese representation in the Parliament at Westminster,they would allow the extent of that representation to be dealt with byamendment of the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act,1949, thus preserving the control of Parliament over membership ofthe House of Commons.The relation between the United Kingdom Parliament and the maltese Parliament in terms of legislative authority might be defined in a Preamble to the Bill, either explicitly or by reference to an&quot; exchange of despatches &quot; to be contained in a Schedule to the Bill.These alternatives were illustrated in Annex B of C. (57) 291.In discussion it was suggested that the clauses governing the incorporation of Malta in the United Kingdom and Malteserepresentation in the United Kingdom Parliament should not provide that Malta would not cease to be part of the United Kingdom or tobe represented in the United Kingdom Parliament without theconsent of the Maltese Parliament, since these stipulations would tendto create the erroneous impression that the Parliament enacting the integration Bill sought, and was able, to stop future Parliaments fromany amendment of the relevant provisions. It might be preferable,therefore, to follow the precedent of the Union with Scotland Act,1706, and the Union with Ireland Act, 1800, by merely providing thatintegration should operate from the appointed day &quot; and for everafter&quot; and to establish the principle of -permanent Malteserepresentation in the United Kingdom Parliament by means of an appropriate reference in a Preamble rather than in the form of a specific clause in the body of the Bill. On the other hand, the maltese government would undoubtedly prefer that, as a matter of presentation, the Bill should explicitly provide that Malta would notcease to be part of the United Kingdom or to be represented in theUnited Kingdom Parliament without the consent of the MalteseParliament; and there was a precedent for at least the first of theseaffirmations in section 1 (2) of the Ireland Act, 1949, which made acorresponding provision in favour of Northern Ireland. Moreover,it was fully understood by the Maltese Government that the UnitedKingdom Parliament could not bind succeeding Parliaments and thatthese affirmations represented no more than the firm intention of theparties at the time of the agreement. The balance of advantagetherefore seemed to lie in incorporating in the Integration Billclauses on the lines of those indicated in Annex A of C. (57) 291(omitting the words &quot; and for ever after &quot;), and in including in aPreamble to the Bill an affirmation about the relation between theUnited Kingdom Parliament and the Maltese Parliament on the linesof the first version in Annex B.In further discussion it was emphasised that the Integration bill would need to be enacted before the summer recess. It was at presentproposed that, after a general election in Malta, integration shouldtake effect automatically on the passing of a resolution by the newMaltese Parliament by a simple majority. Further consideration might, however, be given to the possibility that the Bill might be sodrafted as to require that a resolution of the United kingdom parliament would also be needed before integration came into effect.Opinion among Government supporters in the House of commons had hardened against the principle of integration, and the presentation of the revised proposals would need carefulconsideration.The point was also made that integration should not take effect before there was reasonable certainty about the future ofthe dockyard in Malta. Representatives of commercial companieswho were interested in purchasing the dockyard would shortly be visiting Malta; but it would be some time before their decision was
known and, even if they agreed to acquire the dockyard, it was unlikely that they would be able to provide continuing employment for more than about half of the labour force which the Admiraltymaintained at present.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposals in paragraph 2 ofC. (57) 291, subject to the omission of the words &quot; and forever after &quot; in the first of the draft clauses outlined in annex A and to the adoption in a Preamble to the Bill ofthe first version of the affirmation in Annex B.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary, in consultation with the HomeSecretary and the Minister of Defence, to consider further whether the integration of Malta with the UnitedKingdom should be deferred until after the UnitedKingdom Parliament had passed a resolution in favourof it.(3) Invited the Colonial Secretary to consider the timing of theintroduction of the Integration Bill in relation to theprogress of the enquiries regarding the future of the dockyard in Malta.(4) Authorised the Colonial Secretary, subject to Conclusions(l)-(3) above, to inform the Maltese Government of theviews and decisions of the United Kingdom Governmenton the plan for integrating Malta with the UnitedKingdom.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,12th December, 1957.
