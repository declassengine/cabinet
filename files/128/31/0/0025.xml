3 CC. 25 (57)Parliament., 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in:-.. the House of Commons in the following week.   A debate on theBermuda Conference would take place on 1st April.Electricity 2.   The Minister of Power said that, in response to represen-Bill. tations by Government supporters in Standing Committee, he was(Previous        prepared to amend the Electricity Bill to require a longer period ofReference:      notice by Electricity Boards intending to enter on land; and, subjectCM. (56) 72nd to consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, he saw no conclusions,    objection to incorporating an amendment to empower the GeneratingMinute 4.)       and Area Boards as well as the proposed Central Electricity Councilto raise capital in the open market.  The further proposal that theElectricity Boards should be deprived of the power to manufactureelectrical plant and equipment presented greater difficulty since this power, which had never been exercised, was designed to protect theElectricity Authority against a manufacturing monopoly.    Theelectricity companies, whether under municipal or private ownership,had always possessed this power, and the Act of 1947 nationalisingthe industry had merely confirmed it.It was the general view of the Cabinet that it would be inaccordance with Conservative principles to withdraw this particularprovision from the Bill. The risk of a manufacturing monopolydeveloping in the electrical plant industry had been reduced by the restrictive Trade Practices Act, while the compromise course of imposing on the Electricity Boards a statutory obligation to satisfy the Minister, before embarking on manufacture, that they were unable to obtain plant and equipment from private manufacturersat reasonable prices would have little merit and would be unacceptable to Government supporters.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Power to table amendments tothe Electricity Bill on the lines agreed in their discussion,subject to further consultation with the Chancellor of theExchequer on the borrowing powers of the Area Boards.Obscene 3.   The Home Secretary said that a Private Member&apos;s Bill toPublications amend the law relating to obscene publications was due to be givenMil. its Second Reading on 29th March.   Although this Bill would notserve as a suitable basis for amending legislation, it was generally recognised that the existing law was defective. He therefore proposedthat the Government spokesman in the debate should move that theBill be committed to a Select Committee for examination.The Cabinet-Agreed that the House of Commons should be invited to commit the Obscene Publications Bill to a Select Committeefor examination.Cyprus.(previous reference.:CC. (57) 24thConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The Cabinet had before them a revised draft of a parliamentary statement on Cyprus.The Prime Minister said that as compared with earlier versionsthis draft had the advantage that, by omitting any detailed statementof the extent to which we contemplated relaxing the existing measures,it avoided any impression that the Government were prepared to bargain with Archbishop Makarios about the terms of his release. Itshould, therefore, be more acceptable to the Turkish Government.The statement could, however, be strengthened still further by
IBSomitting the reference to the wording of the Archbishop&apos;s appeal andthe indication that the Government were prepared to take a liberalview of it, and substituting a simple statement that in presentcircumstances it was no longer necessary to continue the Archbishop&apos;sdetention. It would be mistaken to pretend that the Archbishop hadresponded adequately to the original offer, and it would be wiser to base our action on a plain statement that we had decided, as an act of policy, to disembarrass ourselves of an individual whose continued detention no longer served any useful purpose. It was arguable that, whatever the ultimate objective of our policy as regards Cyprus,the release of the Archbishop would assist us in realising it. If wecould envisage no more than a continuance of the deadlock whichhad been reached hitherto, the resumption of the constitutionaldiscussions which we must shortly contemplate would probablycontribute to this end, since we were bound to accept the Archbishopas one party to these discussions, and he was likely to insist on thecondition, which we should be unable to accept, that Cyprus shouldbe granted the right of self-determination within a limited period.If, on the other hand, our ultimate objective was a partition of the island, we might succeed in securing agreement on this course more easily after the Archbishop was released, or, alternatively, the GreekGovernment would find the approaching prospect of partition sodistasteful that they would reluctantly accept Lord Radcliffe&apos;constitutional proposals without seeking to attach any condition thatCyprus should enjoy the right of self-determination within a definite period. In neither event, therefore, should the release of the archbishop be an obstacle to further advance; and, provided that wesucceeded in making progress towards our objective, it would be less important that this progress would inevitably appear to be, to someextent, a series of concessions to the Archbishop.The Lord President said that he remained convinced that therelease of the Archbishop would be a profound mistake. His appeal for the cessation of EOKA violence had been made conditional onour own willingness to bring the state of emergency in Cyprus to anend; and if we attempted to ignore that condition he would be free to withdraw his appeal at any time. He would therefore be free to exploit this situation to extract further concessions from us until hehad completely regained the initiative. In particular, he would seek to insist that he should be allowed to return to Cyprus on the groundthat he could, not otherwise take part in further constitutionaldiscussions and that, in his absence, no other individuals were entitledto represent the Greek community in the Island. Moreover, his release would be liable to alienate the Turkish Government andwould be universally interpreted as a sign of weakness, which would react against us in the negotiations on other difficult internationalissues which we must shortly face. He could not, therefore, endorsea statement which, in his view, would be a prelude to a process ofgradual retreat in the face of the pressure which the Archbishopwould mobilise as soon as he was again at liberty.In discussion it was suggested that, despite the embarrassmentwhich would result from the release of the Archbishop, the balanceof advantage lay in restoring his freedom. He had come some partof the way to satisfy our conditions, and EOKA terrorism had nowbeen brought under control. It was the considered view of theGovernor of Cyprus that, if in these circumstances the Archbishopwas not released, sentiment in Cyprus would consolidate behindEOKA once again and terrorism would revive. We should then have lost an opportunity, which might not recur, of securing apermanent relaxation of tension in the Island. Moreover, we shouldhave adopted an attitude which we might find it impossible to sustain.We were committed to a resumption of constitutional discussions,from which no useful result could follow unless the Archbishop wasoresent.   We were committed also to co-operate in the conciliation
procedure in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and this procedure would be liable to be similarly frustrated by a refusal onour part to contribute, by a gesture of generosity, to bringingterrorism in Cyprus to an end. If we released the Archbishop on terms which would preclude his return to Cyprus and would not commit us to define the scope of the relaxation of security measureswhich might prove to be possible, we should be regarded by publicopinion as acting from strength rather than weakness. If, on theother hand, we continued to detain the Archbishop indefinitely, itwas impossible to foresee when, and on what conditions, we shouldbe able to resolve the present deadlock. The strategic importanceof Cyprus would progressively decline over the next decade and, apartfrom the importance of maintaining our control over a sufficiently large portion of the Island to enable us to operate an effective airbase, we were unlikely to continue to need its facilities on a scale which would justify the indefinite continuance of repressive measureswhich were becoming increasingly repugnant to public opinion.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thearguments were evenly balanced. There were clear risks in releasingArchbishop Makarios. In particular, he would be bound to try toorganise international support for his return to Cyprus where, evenif he did not instigate a revival of terrorism, his presence would bea considerable embarrassment. On the other hand, it might stillbe a considerable time before the forces of terrorism in Cyprus were completely eliminated; and public opinion, which might be disposed to accept the Archbishop&apos;s appeal as broadly satisfactory, would be liable to be critical of the Government if they sacrificed anopportunity of breaking the present deadlock. It appeared to be thegeneral view of the Cabinet that, in these circumstances, the wisercourse would be to release the Archbishop without suggesting thatwe were in any way satisfied with his conditional response to our offer. At the same time, the Turkish Government should be informedthat, while we now regarded the Archbishop as a greater liability in detention than at large, our objective remained, as before, either the partition of the Island or the implementation of Lord RadcliftVsconstitutional proposals on the basis on which we had originallyput them forward and without any commitment about the ultimategrant of self-determination. Further constitutional discussions would contribute to the realisation of either of these objectives. but while, in releasing the Archbishop, we envisaged that he would need to be a party to these discussions, we should regard him as therepresentative of only one section of opinion in Cyprus and shouldnot be prepared to recognise him as in any sense the accreditedspokesman of Cyprus or entitled to negotiate with Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment about the future of the Island as a whole.The Lord President said that he was still convinced that therelease of Archbishop Makarios in these circumstances would be anerror of judgment. If this course of action were adopted, he wouldbe unable to support it, and he would therefore need to considerwhether he could remain a member of the Government.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that Archbishop Makarios should be released fromdetention in the Seychelles.(2) Authorised the Colonial Secretary to make, in the Houseof Commons that afternoon, a statement on the linesof the draft which they had before them, as amended in their discussion.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to instruct H.M. ambassador at Ankara to inform the Turkish Government of the intentions of Her Majesty&apos;s Government, on the lines approved in their discussion.

The trade unions in the engineering industry, however, were unwilling to terminate the strike until theemployers had taken direct wage negotiations with them to the point which had been reached in the corresponding negotiations in the shipbuilding industry.  The employers had so far been unwilling toenter into such negotiations but might be prepared to reconsider their attitude.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,30th March, 1957.
