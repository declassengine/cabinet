The Minister of Local Government said that, in view of the theatre. forthcoming .debate in the House of Lords about the St. James&apos;siTheatre, the Government should define their policy towards public&apos;Y agitation for its preservation. It was an old structure which was ill-adapted to use as a theatre and could not be rebuilt on its present site.Nor did it contain any special architectural features. Since theLondon1 County Council had given their original permission for:. redeveloping the site, the value of the property had risen substantiallyand its ownership had changed hands. If, therefore, the Governmentyielded to public pressure for revocation of the original planning permission, considerable compensation would become payable.Moreover, there could be no guarantee . that the building would continue to be used as a theatre unless a purchaser could be found whowould be prepared to give an undertaking to this effect. In thesecircumstances, it would be desirable for the Government spokesmanin the debate to maintain that there was no case for intervention bythe Government.. :: *i The Prime Minister said that further tests of megatonweapons were necessary both for scientific reasons and in order toestablish the best method of making more economic use of fissile&apos;;material. It would be possible to advance to November 1957 the nextseries of tests, which had originally been planned for June 1958; and&apos; arrangements for this purpose were in hand.It would be unnecessary to give such lengthy advance warning or* to declare so extensive a prohibited area as on the occasion of the lasttests.: But,&apos; since it would inevitably become known that we were making preparations for further tests in the relatively near future, itwould be necessary to consider at what point our intentions should be publicly declared. He would give further thought to this problem in preparing his reply to a forthcoming Parliamentary Question on thesubject.&apos;&apos;&apos; .        &apos;Yv/y::Y &apos; &quot;&apos;&apos;&quot;j     It would be necessary to inform the Prime Ministers of Australiaand New Zealand of our proposed action, and to obtain the agreement. of,the Canadian and United States Governments to the transit of&quot;fissile material over their territories by air.

Co,onlaI 5.   The Cabinet had before them a further report (C. (57) 162)Immigrants.     by the Committee of Ministers which had been appointed to keep(Previous        under review the rate of immigration from Africa and the WestReference:       IndiesCM. (56) 85thConclusions, The Lord Chancellor said that the flow of immigrants had minute 8.) declined significantly from the maximum rate achieved in the previous year. The number of arrivals from the West Indies in the first five months of the current year was only 5,500, as compared with 9,000and 12,700 in the corresponding periods of .1955 and 1956 respectively.The most disturbing feature of the continuing immigration was the gradual transformation of particular areas of certain cities intoexclusively coloured districts. This had already led to undesirablesocial consequences which might, at any time, give rise to acute public concern. Nevertheless, the Committee had reached the conclusionthat, while the position should be kept under review, public opinion was not yet prepared for a statutory regulation of immigration fromother parts of the Commonwealth and the introduction of legislation for this purpose would not yet be justified. If legislation eventuallyproved necessary it should follow the lines of the Bill which the&apos; Cabinet had previously considered and should not be based on any system of quotas.In discussion there was general agreement that, although publicopinion in the districts where the coloured immigrants tended to concentrate would be ready to support restrictive action, the declinein the rate of immigration, particularly frcm the West Indies,suggested that legislation would be premature. A close watch should,however, continue to be kept on the numbers of arrivals.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the conclusions in C. (57) 162.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor to arrange for the Committee ofMinisters to submit, at the end of the year, a further reporton the rate of immigration from Africa and the west indies.Development 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theAreas. President of the Board of Trade (C. (57) 171) on the proposed revision(Previous        of the schedule of Development Areas.Reference :CC. (57) 49th        The President  of  the  Board  of  Trade  said  that  further conclusions.    examination of the legislative implications of this proposal had    - %Minute 7.)      established that it would be possible under the Distribution of   -**Industry Act for the Board of Trade to continue, after de-scheduling,to maintain the factories previously erected in the de-scheduled areas.In discussion there was general agreement with this view. It wassuggested, however, that it might help to aliay public criticism of the government&apos;s attitude if it was emphasised, during the debate, thatthe legislation governing the grant of planning permission wasdefective in that, if the Minister of Local Government revoked apermission for change of use of a building, a claim for compensationcould be preferred. It would be more reasonable that no such claim should be valid until after the expiry of an adequate period and thatit should be limited to such nugatory expenditure as might have been incurred in the interval.The Cabinet Agreed that the Government spokesman in the debate on the st. James&apos;s Theatre should speak on the lines indicated bythe Minister of Local Government.
Eventually, however, legislation would be needed to secure. the; transfer of the factories to some other body which might well be theorganisation which it was proposed to establish to operate certainNew Towns. The revision of the present list of Development Areaswas now long overdue, and no more opportune moment for amendingit was likely to occur. It would not be justifiable to defer this stepmerely because of prospective redundancies at certain royal ordnance Factories. .....The Minister for Welsh Affairs said that he supported thisproposal. It was anomalous that a relatively prosperous region suchas East South Wales should continue to enjoy the status of a development Area in preference to North West Wales. The proposal that the organisation for the future ownership and management ofGovernment-owned factories in Development Areas should resemble,or be linked with, the organisation contemplated for managing the assets of the New Towns would need further examination before itcould form the subject of any public announcement.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that he must continue to urge that North Ayrshire should be retained in the schedule ofDevelopment Areas.Unemployment in that area had alreadyattained the level of 3 per cent, and would rise still further when theRoyal. Ordnance Factory in the district was closed.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while the proposedrevision of the schedule of Development Areas would be justified on merits, a comprehensive approach to the problem was liable to be misunderstood politically. If, however, it was decided to establish the projected new steel-making capacity in the East South Wales Area, theretention of that district in the district of Development Areas wouldbecome even more unjustifiable. It would then appear practicable to embark on a piecemeal revision of the list by initially substitutingNorth. West Wales for East South Wales.The Prime Minister said that memories of the plight of the former: distressed areas could easily be revived, and it would be preferable to achieve any desirable revision of the schedule of Development Areasslowly and by degrees. If the matter were approached in this way,possibly by the addition of one area and the removal of another,public opinion would appreciate more clearly the anomalies of thepresent position and conditions would be created in which theGovernment would be given a more favourable opportunity foradopting a realistic, policy for the Development Areas.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in general agreementwith the view expressed by the Prime Minister. It was also suggestedthat private companies occupying Government-owned factories in development Areas which no longer qualified for financial assistance might be prepared to pay for any necessary extensions to theseproperties. It was agreed that this possibility should be further explored. .The Cabinet (1) Agreed that no general revision of the schedule of Develop-ment Areas should be made or announced at present, butthat the way might be prepared for the piecemeal revisionof the list by substituting North West Wales for EastSouth Wales if the establishment of new steel-making&apos; capacity in the latter area made that course practicable.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to give furtherconsideration to the possibility of arranging for private companies in occupation of Government-owned factories in certain Development Areas to assume financial responsibility for any necessary extensions to theseproperties.        , .

Commissioners who would be responsible for managing and disposing&apos;*V- of them in such a manner as to secure the maximum return to the&apos; .: 7.   Exchequer while paying due regard to the interests of the inhabitants.1[ f&apos;r&apos;- Such proposals would be welcomed by the Govern men t&apos;s supporters&apos;!    &apos;   and would ensure a diversified ownership of property in the Newy; i,1&quot;&apos;&apos;1&apos;Towns which would be both socially and politically desirable.  The&quot;- &apos; practical1 application of this policy would, however, take time to%!W&apos;!-:&apos;&quot;ir! elaborate, and expert advice would be needed. It was desirable there-:;: fore that, if the proposals were approved, they should be announcedwithout delay, and that a Committee should then be established to,       ....... . advise on the arrangements to be; made to give effect to the; &apos;       Governments decision; 1 &quot;&apos;;.&apos;1&quot;The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the New Towns would&apos;    .    &quot;: represent an Exchequer investment of some  350 millions.   Thepresent proposals offered a more satisfactory prospect of eventually.   recovering this investment than any other course of action.&apos;!;. V ^       The Secretary of State for Scotland said that no New Town in&apos;   : Scotland was approaching completion, and it would be premature toAV seek to evolve an alternative system of management adapted to1 Scottish conditions. -&apos;   Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in general agreement&apos;. with these proposals. It was felt, however, that it would be preferable for the Minister of Housing to announce the Government^ intentions in the course of the debate on local government in the following&apos; :;    week.   Moreover, since the New Towns represented an importantExchequer investment, the value of which was likely to grow, it1   would be inexpedient to make an announcement which would: v,   prejudice the Governments freedom to entrust the permanentmanagement of part of the assets involved to a body analogous to the. Crown Estate Commissions, should that course subsequently appearv more advantageous.   While expert advice would be needed on the&apos; &apos;practical application of the proposed policy, it was doubtful whether an independent committee, whose report might have to be published,should be constituted for this purpose.   Alternative methods of&apos;   - securing such advice should be examined.   :The Cabinet  &apos;&apos;- &apos;(1) Authorised the Minister of Housing, subject to the points,: . : made in their discussion, to announce, in the forthcoming debate on local government, the Governments intentions.  in regard to the future of the New Towns in England andWales.    1.,    (2) Authorised the Secretary of State for Scotland to arrange fora corresponding statement on the future of the new towns:;      in Scotland to be made in the same debate.
9. The President of the Board of Trade said that, together withthe Colonial Secretary, he had discussed with the Governor of HongKong the possibility of persuading the cotton textile industry in theColony to accept a voluntary limitation on their exports to the UnitedKingdom. The Governor had not regarded such a solution asrealistic. It had, however, been agreed that, after he had returned to hong Kong, he should be sent a summary of the arguments for and against a scheme of voluntary limitation and should present these arguments to the local industry. Meanwhile, it was becoming increasingly urgent to inform the textile manufacturers in Lancashireof the Governmenfs intentions.In discussion it was suggested that we might adopt an alternativeapproach to this problem by securing the voluntary agreement ofIndia and Pakistan to establishing a &quot; peril point,&quot; defining the limitbeyond which their exports to the United Kingdom would be regardedas endangering the interests of Lancashire, and by subsequentlydeclaring a corresponding peril point for Hong Kong. It would be unnecessary to specify the action which we should take if this perilpoint was reached; but we should indicate that we should then requireimmediate consultations with the industry. The existence, of anarrangement of this kind would provide some reassurance for the textile manufacturers in Lancashire; and it might be possible toestablish the peril point in the case of Hong Kong sufficiently high tomake it unlikely that the Colony&apos;s exports of cotton textiles would infact reach it. It might, however, be necessary to concede that, if theyeventually rose to the peril point and we refrained from&quot; taking any positive action, the industries in India and Pakistan would be released from their obligation to observe the voluntary peril point applicableto themselves; and the United Kingdom Government would then need to decide whether to establish import quotas in respect of all threeindustries.The Colonial Secretary said that, while he agreed that theGovernor of Hong Kong should make known to the local industry thearguments for and against their entering into a voluntary arrangement,he would feel bound, in virtue of his special trusteeship for theinterests of the Colony, to admit that such an arrangement mightextend to other Hong Kong industries and that, if the UnitedKingdom Government endorsed it, they would thereafter be unableto come to the defence of Hong Kong, under the General agreement on Tariffs and Trade, against corresponding action by other countriesagainst Hong Kong exports. Equally, if an alternative solution wasadopted by establishing a peril point for exports of textiles from theColony, we might thereafter be unable to maintain our present policyof resisting appeals by other Colonies to be allowed to establish perilpoints against unwelcome imports, e.g., imports of United States citrusfruit into the West Indies. It would, therefore, be essential that,before any final decision was taken, the probable repercussions of our action should be fully weighed.Cotton.Imports.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 56thConclusions.Minute 8.). was contemplated by. the British and French Tunnel Companies, the;&apos;.\ Suez Canal Company and certain United States interests. It would be;   ; advantageous,; therefore,&apos; that a member of the1 British Transport&quot;Commission, who was also a director&apos;of the British Channel TunnelCompany, should be associated with this survey. &apos; This arrangement would enable the Government to keep themselves informed of developments without either incurring any commitment or prejudicing&apos;    their position about the ultimate disposition of the assets of the Suez* Canal Company.&apos; ;u &apos;,&apos;!;: y.u.nx:- b&apos;j)r.i&apos;./.--U *,. i ..&apos;e t; \;-\ -..vli:: t;; r.i ,j v;.!::,&apos;,- .,&quot;&apos;-    ^iJ^The-Cabinet-^nif r       .. &apos;..      v..-&apos;&apos; w&apos;[:]yy Approved the proposal in C.
