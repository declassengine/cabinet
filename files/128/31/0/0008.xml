CC. 8 (57)Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Monetary and 2.

It was important that this reduction should be understood as(Previous - a technical measure designed to reinforce the Governments monetaryReferences: policy, and that it should not be interpreted as an indication thatCM.

It would minute 6.) set out the basis on which he and the President of the Board of Tradeproposed to approach the discussions which were due to take placein Paris shortly, and it would place publicly on record ourreservations against bringing agricultural products within the scopeof a free trade area.The Cabinet Took note of these statements by the Chancellor of theExchequer.Foreign Affairs.       3.   The Foreign Secretary said that the United States Govern-Suez Canal.     nient now appeared to be convinced that Canal dues should be(Previous        paid to a neutral authority such as the International Bank under reference:      an arrangement which would provide for half the sums received to. (57) 7th    be paid over immediately to the Egyptian Government and theConclusions,    other half to be held in trust by the receiving authority until a basisMinute 6.)       for the future operation of the Canal had been settled.   Thepossibility could not, however, be excluded that we might still be pressed to agree that all dues should be paid direct to the egyptian government.The Cabinet agreed that, as the clearance of the Canal might now be ahead of schedule, every effort should be made to induce theUnited States Government to press for a satisfactory agreement to govern the payment of dues. The speed with which the Canal couldbe restored to use would depend both on the extent of the damage which had been suffered by the shore installations and onre-establishing agency services for shipping in the Canal area. TheMinister of Transport was considering these matters.The Foreign Secretary said that, while we had supported theresolutions urging Israel to withdraw her forces which had been tabled in the General Assembly of the United N ations in the previousweek, it would be more difficult to decide our attitude on any subsequent resolution invoking sanctions against Israel fornon-compliance. Our best course would probably be to argue thatit was premature to consider using sanctions. But it would also benecessary to press the United States Government, who were unlikely to favour recourse to sanctions, to use their influence in the assembly to prevent any premature decision.The Foreign Secretary said that the meeting of the foreign ministers of the countries in the Western European Union whichwould shortly take place in London would provide the opportunityfor explaining to the other member countries our intentions aboutthe level of the forces which we proposed henceforward to maintain in Europe. The justification which we should advance for reducing our forces should be discussed primarily in political rather than in military terms; but a meeting of Defence Ministers might be ofadvantage at a later date.Israel.(previous reference:CC. (57) 4thConclusions,Minute 2.)WesternEuropeanUnion.(previous reference:CC. (55) 5thConclusions,Minute 5.)
Aden. The Foreign Secretary said that further reflection about the(Previous        suggestion that we should invite the United Nations to stationReference:      observers in the frontier areas between the Aden Protectorate andC.C.

It would not be possible to excludeMinute 1.)       representatives of countries in the Soviet bloc from any body ofobservers appointed by the United Nations, and it was undesirable to create a precedent which might have damaging results elsewhere.The situation on the frontier was not out of control, and at presentthe degree of unrest was less than on some previous occasions.   Itwas in our interest that the matter should be presented in this light.The Colonial Secretary said that he agreed with this view. steps had been taken to reinforce the ground armament of our frontierposts.The Cabinet -Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statements and of thepoints made in discussion.Germany. 4.   The Foreign Secretary said that it was desirable that theSupport Costs,   negotiations which had been proceeding with the Federal German(Previous        Government over their contribution towards the support costs of ourReferences      troops in Germany should be concluded as soon as possible.  TheC-C. (57) 4th     outstanding points were minor and, if they were allowed to prolongConclusions,    the negotiations, the degree of agreement already reached would minute 5.)       be jeopardised.   He therefore sought authority to dispose of these points on the best terms that could be obtained and thereafter to conclude the negotiations on the basis of a contribution as closeas possible to  50 millions.  Although the exact reductions which we proposed to make in the number of our troops in Germany had notbeen disclosed to the Federal German Government, we had informedthem in general terms of our intentions, and it would be possiblefor either Government to demand a review of the agreement if ouractual expenditure varied substantially from the present estimatedfigure of  57 millions.   There was little danger, therefore, of ourexposing ourselves to a charge that we had misled the GermanGovernment in not disclosing in detail the reductions which we proposed to make.The Cabinet agreed that a settlement of this matter should nowbe sought without delay on the basis proposed by the foreign secretary.The Cabinet Authorised the Foreign Secretary to expedite, on the basis which he had outlined, the conclusion of the negotiationswith the German Government on support costs.Ghana. 5.   The Colonial Secretary said that the purpose of his recent(Previous        visit to Accra had been to allay the anxiety among the Ashanti and reference:      the tribes in the Northern territories that their local traditions andC.C. (57) 7th    institutions would not be preserved under the new Constitution for conclusions,     Ghana. A satisfactory agreement had been reached as a result of his minute 4.)       intervention.  But the Prime Minister of the Gold Coast had subse-quently proposed to adopt certain provisions which would nullifythe safeguards introduced to cover the interests of the Ashanti andthe Northern territories and had sent two of his Ministers to london to discuss these proposals.   After further discussion, agreement onall points had been restored.  Every possible step had been takento entrench in the Constitution safeguards for the rights of the tribaland regional peoples. The White Paper setting out the constitutional proposals for the Gold Coast would be published forthwith.
The Cabinet would welcome the suggestion by H.R.H. theDuchess of Kent that she should extend her forthcoming visit to theGold Coast on the occasion of the independence celebrations in orderto visit the Ashantiand Northern territories. Such a visit would do much to allay inter-regipnal suspicions, and would make an important contribution towards a successful start for Ghana as an independent state.The Cabinet Took note of the Colonial Secretary&apos;s statement.East-west trade.Copper Wire.(previous references:CM. (56) 68thConclusions,Minute 4, and cm. (55) 5thConclusions,Minute 9.)Education.(previous references:C.C. (57) 7thConclusions,Minute 1, and cm. (56) 40thConclusions,Minute 11.)6. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (C. (57) 22) and the Foreign Secretary(C. (57) 26) about the export of copper wire to Russia.The President of the Board of Trade said that, since copper wirewas freed from embargo in August 1954, United Kingdom exportsto the Soviet Union had risen from 5,000 tons in 1954 to 40,000 tonsin 1956. Of the 40,000 tons, 33,000 tons had been sold by CromptonParkinson and the balance by Aberdare Cables against a licence for10,000 tons. For 1957 Crompton Parkinson had been promised a licence for 40,000 tons, and Aberdare Cables were applying for a licence for 10,000 tons. Although the United States Governmentwere pressing for a sharp curtailment in the export of copper wireto Eastern Europe, it would be difficult to refuse the application ofAberdare Cables without being accused of favouring CromptonParkinson. Moreover, the Soviet Union could probably place theorder elsewhere without difficulty.The Foreign Secretary said that, in view of the sharp rise in our export of copper wire to the Soviet Union since 1954, the UnitedStates Government would be liable to take offence at any further increase. If, however, deliveries by Crompton Parkinson could beso spaced that they would not exceed in the current year the amountdelivered last year, the balance being delivered in 1958, the proposal might be more acceptable.In discussion there was general agreement that we should seek to avoid any occasion of dispute with the United States government at a time when friendly relations between the United States and thiscountry were being restored. On the other hand, the refusal of a licence to Aberdare Cables would deprive this country of a valuableexport and might endanger employment in a Development area without necessarily reducing the supply of copper wire to the soviet union. It was therefore desirable to seek to arrange the deliverydates of the consignments supplied both by Crompton Parkinson andby Aberdare Cables in such a way that we could claim that we werenot permitting any significant increase in the export of copper wireto the Soviet Union during 1957 over the quantities actuallyexported in 1956.The Cabinet Invited the President of the Board of Trade to give furtherconsideration to the proposed export of copper wire to theSoviet Union on the basis suggested in their discussion.7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Education (C. (57) 23) on future educational policy.The Minister of Education said that he endorsed the approach to this question outlined in the memorandum by his predecessor(CP. (56) 278). In terms of educational structure and of expenditureon education per head of the population we compared unfavourably with many other countries. An increase in expenditure on buildings,teachers and, ultimately, university awards was essential if we wereto match the educational achievement of our competitors and, in
particular, to accommodate in the secondary schools the ;i bulge &quot;which was now passing out of the primary schools. In addition, wemust contemplate making it possible for any child who wished to stay at school until the age of 18 to do so, even at the cost of givingthis measure priority over the raising of the normal school-leaving age to 16.If economies in Government expenditure of the scale at present under discussion were to be adopted and a general grant was to beintroduced in substitution for specific grants in aid of local authority expenditure, some progressive measure in education must beintroduced to offset the impression, which would otherwise be inevitable, that the Government had failed to justify their claim to beintroducing the Opportunity State and had forfeited the confidence of educationalists. The essential feature of such a measure wouldbe a more generous attitude towards the school building programme,which would facilitate a reduction in the size of classes and the recruitment of additional teachers. Moreover, the pressure on thebuilding industry had now been relieved and, unless some modestincrease in building authorisations was made, there might be anunwelcome interruption in the school building programme. he therefore proposed that authorisations of  55 millions for 1957-58and  60 millions for 1958-59 should be granted. The immediate increase in expenditure would be negligible.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, at a time whentaxation was already too high and the scope of possible economieselsewhere in Government expenditure was not yet clear, it wasunrealistic to consider any further increase in expenditure on education. The proposal of the Minister of Education should therefore be deferred until the total of civil expenditure had beenfinalised in the Estimates and it was possible to see more exactlywhether the Exchequer could sustain any additional claims.In discussion there was general agreement that, although any additional expenditure was most unwelcome in present circumstances,it was desirable to satisfy public opinion that the essential elements in the Governments educational policy were being preserved not-withstanding the economies in Government expenditure generally and the possible adverse effects on education of the introduction ofa general grant in aid of local authority expenditure. An increase inExchequer outlay on education would not necessarily involve acommensurate increase of inflationary pressure; and in view of thedecline in activity in the building trade it should be possible toestablish, by further interdepartmental discussion, whether somemodest increase in building authorisations for education could be permitted without damage to the economy.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Minister of Education, to give further considerationto the possibility of increasing the building authorisationsfor education; and, if necessary, to submit revised proposals to the Cabinet.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,7th February, 1957.
