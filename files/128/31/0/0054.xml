1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.A Motion had been tabled by Opposition Members deploringthe refusal of the Attorney-General to grant his fiat to enable aconvicted murderer, whose appeal had already been rejected by theCourt of Criminal Appeal, to appeal to the House of Lords. Mr.Speaker was apparently prepared to rule that this Motion would constitute a proper subject of debate, despite the convention whichnormally debarred discussion of a capital case. The Governmentwould, however, be entitled to stipulate that, if the Opposition wishedto debate the Motion, they must do so in their own time.international court ofJustice.(previous reference :CC. (57) 34thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Foreign Secretary recalled that the Cabinet had decided in April, 1956, that the terms of our acceptance of the jurisdiction ofthe International Court should be modified in order to preclude thepossibility that an injunction might be obtained from the Court toprevent us from undertaking tests of nuclear weapons. parliament had not been informed of this decision at the time; but a recentruling of the Court would probably result in its becoming known very shortly. It would be desirable to maintain, in reply to any questions in Parliament, that our earlier view was provisional and that we hadnot yet reached a final decision on this subject.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.defence policy.(previous reference :CC. (57) 51stConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Prime Minister said that it had been suggested that theParliamentary statement which he was due to make in the following week on the future of the Armed Forces should be followed onsucceeding days by three further Ministerial statements about thefuture organisation of the Army, compensation for redundant officersand men and the arrangements for their resettlement. The practiceof making Parliamentary statements, which merely summarisedinformation which would be made available in a White Paper, wasa relatively recent innovation and was often tactically disadvan-tageous. It might be preferable, on this occasion, to embody in asingle announcement the main principles of the various proposals,leaving the details to be explained by a series of separate white papers.In discussion, there was general agreement with this suggestion.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for thevarious statements on defence policy which had been planned for the following week to be embodied in a reply toa single Parliamentary Question.Pensions.(previous reference :CC. (57) 40thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (57) 165) on old-age pensions.The Home Secretary said that it would shortly be necessary to announce an increase in the National Insurance pension, to operate in the spring of 1958. This increase, in terms of the pension for asingle person, might be either 5s. or 10s. The former would suffice to preserve the real value of the pension as established in 1955; thelatter would represent an improvement in that value beyond anystandard hitherto adopted and would make it possible, in addition, to abolish the tobacco concession.
Further examination had shown that, if this improvement wasto take effect in the near future, as was clearly desirable, it could notbe accompanied by the introduction of a new system of pensionsrelated to earnings. Nevertheless, there was a strong case for establishing such a system. The National Insurance scheme wasplacing an increasing burden on the Exchequer, and it was essentialthat some relief from this burden should be devised. Moreover,the application of the principle of insurance on a scale more generousthan that provided by the National Insurance scheme was becoming increasingly attractive to public opinion. The Committee on national insurance, under his chairmanship, had therefore examined thevarious forms which a scheme of this kind might take and had cometo the conclusion that, on balance, the proposals outlined in C. (57)165, based on graduation of both contributions and benefits inrelation to earnings, would be the most advantageous. Theseproposals had the advantages that they would leave scope for theactivities of the insurance companies; that they should produce, indue course, a substantial surplus of income over expenditure whichwould benefit the Exchequer; and that, administratively, they wouldbe simpler to operate than any other scheme which had so far been devised. Certain members of the Committee, however, believed thatthe proposals should incorporate a provision enabling individualsparticipating in approved occupational pension schemes to contract out of the graduated element in the benefits of the new scheme. Thefinancial implications of such a provision might be serious and would need careful examination.If the Cabinet approved in principle the outline scheme whichthe Committee had prepared, it would be necessary to work out in greater detail the precise form which it should take and to ascertain the probable reactions of the insurance companies and possibly theAssociation of Superannuation Funds to its introduction. Theinsurance companies had indicated informally that they were notunduly alarmed about the possible effect on their own interests of theproposals in their present form. But it would be necessary to discussmore fully with them the implications both of the scheme as a whole and of any provision which it might incorporate to enable individualscovered by occupational schemes to contract out of it.The Minister of Pensions said that an increase of \0s. in theNational Insurance pension would, for the reasons given by the HomeSecretary, be preferable to an increase of 5$. It would be possibleto bring this increase into effect in December, provided that theannouncement was made before the summer recess and the necessary legislation was dealt with expeditiously in the autumn. There wouldbe some advantage in accelerating the introduction of the increasedpension in that it appeared almost certain that National Assistancerates would also be increased in the late autumn.As regards the scheme for graduated pensions outlined in C. (57)165, his own preference would have been for an alternative schemewhich would have provided greater scope for the independentoperation of the insurance companies. If, however, the cabinet favoured a scheme on the lines indicated by the Home Secretary, itwould be essential, in his view, that its intrusion upon the private sector should be mitigated by a provision enabling individualsparticipating in private occupational pension schemes to contract outof the graduated element in the new scheme.The Minister of Labour said that he agreed with the Minister ofPensions. The Governmenfs supporters were likely to regard it asa question of principle that individuals earning more than  8 a weekshould have the opportunity to choose between contributing to aGovernment scheme or making their own arrangements with theinsurance companies or under their own occupational pension schemes.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that an increase of \0s. inthe National Insurance pension would be more inflationary in its
impact on the economy than an increase of 5s. And it would, for thefirst time, increase the real value of the pension above the subsistencelevel to which it had hitherto been related. In view of the fact that,if and when a new scheme of graduated pensions was introduced,public opinion would expect the National Insurance pension to beincreased again, there would be considerable advantage in restricting the present increase to 5.v.The proposals for a graduated pension scheme would need further examination, since it was desirable that the Governmentshould not appear to be attempting merely to outbid the supplementary pension scheme recently published by the Oppositionbut should be seen to be sponsoring proposals which were financiallysound. The question whether individuals should have a right to contract out of the scheme should be decided in the light of the viewsof the insurance companies and of considerations of administrativepracticability.The Prime Minister said that there would be advantage in increasing the National Insurance pension by an amount designed toavoid the need for any further increase during the life-time of thepresent Parliament. This decision would, however, need further thought, together with the separate but related decision on theintroduction of a graduated pension scheme. If such a scheme was introduced, it would also be necessary to decide whether it shouldincorporate a provision enabling individuals to contract out of it,on the lines indicated by the Minister of Pensions. The moreconsidered views of the insurance companies would need to beobtained before the Cabinet could reach final decisions on thesequestions. It was clear that any graduated pension scheme could not operate during the life-time of the present Parliament. There mightbe some advantage in the Governmenfs having enacted the necessary legislation before the end of the Parliament; but it would be forconsideration whether the Bill need be introduced in the very nearfuture. It would, however, be desirable that the Cabinet should reach an early decision in principle on this scheme since, if it was to beeventually put into effect, the increase in contributions which would need to accompany an increase in the National Insurance pension would be rather smaller than would otherwise be necessary. further thought should also be given to the possibility of bringing intooperation by Christmas whatever increase in the National insurance pension was finally approved by the Cabinet.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the Ministerof Labour and the Minister of Pensions, to arrange forfurther consultation with representatives of the insurance companies on the lines indicated in their discussion.(2) Invited the Minister of Pensions to examine the possibilityof bringing into effect an increase in the national insurance pension by Christmas.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.Muscatand theOman.(previous references :CM. (55) 43rdConclusions,Minute 4, and cm. (56) 53rdConclusions,Minute 6.)5. The Prime Minister said that a potentially serious situation had arisen in central Oman, where certain tribesmen, with Egyptianand Saudi Arabian support, had revolted against the Sultan of muscat, who had appealed for our assistance. We had no formalresponsibility to protect the Sultan except against external aggression.Nevertheless, we had supported him in connection with the dispute over Buraimi, and we should continue to give him such help as wecould. Our assistance could take a number of unprovocative forms,e.g., the movement of a company of British troops to secure Buraimi;the supply of stores and arms by air to those of the Sultan&apos;s forces who had been cut off; the employment of the Trucial Oman Scouts,
Cabinet Office, SWA,18th July, 1957.at the discretion of their British Commanding Officer, to support the sultan&apos;s troops; the despatch of a second frigate to patrol the coast;and the provision of financial assistance. The Defence Committeehad agreed, at a meeting earlier that day, that action on these lines should be taken. It was more arguable, however, whether, in response to a request from the Sultan, we should also authorise the bombardment from the air of certain forts held by the rebels.Action of this kind would be liable to provoke an adverse reaction from the United States and the United Nations; and it would be particularly Unfortunate if it alienated the Arab League at a timewhen Arab sympathy with Egypt was in general diminishing. On theother hand, a clear demonstration of our ability to support our allies in an emergency would reinforce our prestige in the area; and promp action on a limited scale might put an end to a rebellion which we might have much greater difficulty in repressing later.The Foreign Secretary said that, if we resorted to aerial bombardment, we should be liable to be more sharply criticised by international opinion than if we confined ourselves to the use of ground troops. Moreover, it was open to question whether an initialbombardment of the kind proposed would suffice to quell the rebellionor whether it would have to be followed by further operations of thesame kind. Nevertheless, if the military authorities regarded air action as essential in the circumstances, the risk of unwelcomepolitical repercussions could, on balance, be accepted.In discussion some doubt was expressed whether we shouldemploy aerial bombardment if ground forces would eventually,though over a long period, be capable of crushing the revolt. the mere containment of the rebel forces on the ground might not, ofcourse, suffice to end the dispute; and there was some risk that, inthe interval, the rebels would secure some degree of recognition asan independent State, a situation which would be liable to cause usconsiderable political embarrassment. It was agreed, therefore, thatthe Air Officer Commanding should be given discretion, inconsultation with the acting Political Resident, to carry out aerial bombardment of a selected fort or forts in the area held by the rebels,provided that such action was taken only in support of a plan agreed with the Sultan of Muscat for a fresh attack by his ground forces;that it was necessary, in the opinion of the Air Officer Commanding,to take offensive air action as part of such a plan; that the bombardment would be confined to the use of rockets, not bombs;and that the inhabitants of the area concerned would be givenadequate advance warning.It would be desirable that the United States Government shouldbe informed of our intervention in this dispute. But steps should betaken to prevent, so far as possible, any impression arising, either inthe United States or in this country, that this incident providedgrounds for international concern. It should be represented as a minor outbreak of local trouble with which we were dealing onroutine precautionary lines.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Defence to inform the Air OfficerCommanding that he was authorised to conduct, at his discretion, an aerial bombardment of the area in centralOman occupied by the rebels, subject to the conditionsagreed in their discussion.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for the UnitedStates Government to be informed in general terms of theaction which we were proposing to take to assist the sultan Of Muscat to suppress this revolt.
