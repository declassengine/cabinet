Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.It was hoped to secure the Third Reading of the Homicide Billon 6th February. Thereafter, if Miss Bacon&apos;s Bill had been successfully blocked in the meantime, the rules of procedure would prevent the introduction during that session of any further Billproviding for the abolition of capital punishment.government expenditure.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 2ndConclusions,Minute 3.)*2. The Cabinet had before them memoranda on government expenditure by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (57) 16), theMinister of Education (C. (57) 19), the Minister of National Insurance(C. (57) 20) and the Minister of Health (C. (57) 17).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, even if substantial economies were achieved in the Defence Estimates, they would notsuffice, from either the economic or the political point of view, torecreate that confidence in the Governmenfs policies which wasnecessary to enable the economy to surmount the dangers ahead. a significant reduction in civil expenditure was also essential.The Government were faced with both a long-term problem andan immediate problem. In the longer term the financing of the welfare State on its present basis would prove a heavier liability thanthe economy could sustain. It would not be possible to dealcomprehensively with this serious issue in the next Budget. But itwas desirable that the Government should be prepared in the 1957-58Session to introduce legislation dealing with the whole problem of financing the National Health and Insurance Schemes, includingpossibly the introduction of the contributory principle into theNational Health Service in the form of a seiparate contribution. this latter question deserved careful examination, and it might be premature to attempt to incorporate any action of this kind in theforthcoming Budget.The immediate need was to secure sufficient savings inGovernment expenditure to enable the prospective deficit on theBudget to be substantially reduced. The most effective remedy wouldbe to adopt the whole range of economies indicated in his memorandum, which would yield a saving of  55 millions in 1957-58and  100 millions in a full year. If, however, the political implications of economies on this scale were unacceptable, theproposals relating to the dental service and family allowances mightbe deferred for the time being (apart, perhaps, from some moderateincrease in the scale of dental charges), but he hoped that the rest ofthe proposals might be put into effect, to yield some  30- 40 millions in 1957-58. In that event the announcement of the governments intentions should be accompanied by a warning of the dangers to the economy which the growing cost of the social services entailed andby a clear indication that they intended to bring within bounds other areas of expenditure (particularly the grant-aided expenditure bylocal authorities) where the existing control was not sufficient toprotect the taxpayer^ interest.The Minister of Health said that the proportion of the gross national product absorbed by the Exchequer cost of the national health Service had fallen from 3-26 per cent, in 1949-50 to 2-80 percent, in .1955-56. The latest review of the Service had found thatit was giving value for money and had recommended certain increases in expenditure. The arguments against drastic economies were therefore strong; in particular if, at a later stage, it was to be put on a contributory basis (a course which he personally favoured), it wouldbe unwise to prejudice this change by premature modifications inthe scope and nature of the services provided.The case against abolishing the dental service was strong,especially in view of the probable reaction of the dental profession.Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex
Even an increase in dental charges was objectionable, particularly as regards conservation treatment. It might, however, be possibleto make a moderate increase in the charge for dentures.The proposal to impose a hospital boarding charge was alsoopen to serious objection. But even if this proposal was not pursued,it should be possible to achieve an economy of some  15-20 millions in the expenditure under his control by some increase in dentalcharges combined with economies in respect of welfare foods on thelines suggested by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Minister of Education said that economies in expenditureon education would be regarded by public opinion as a drastic and permanent modification of the Governments social policy. Thefundamental principles of that policy should not be sacrificed to the exigencies of one year&apos;s Budget. It would be politically unwise ifthe first act of a Government favouring the Opportunity State was seen to be an attack on parenthood and education, which were the foundations of the future expansion of the economy. A rise in expenditure on education was the natural corollary of a rise in the size of the population. It was less significant than the proportionof the gross national product absorbed by the educational services,which now stood at less than 3 per cent., representing an expenditureof less than  100 a year on each child at school. Moreover, of this sum, more than half represented the salaries of teachers and other staff, which were not amenable to direct control by the government or by local authorities.The proposals before the Cabinet, in so far as they affectedschool milk, school meals and family allowances, would inflict a new and heavy burden on the two-child family, whose expenditure wouldbe increased by nearly \9s. a week. The whole purpose of thelegislation which had provided school meals, school milk and family allowances had been to encourage parenthood by deliberatelyselective methods. The value of school meals, particularly in rural areas, had been amply demonstrated. If the charge for these mealswas now substantially increased, the only means by which parentscould escape the additional financial strain would be by sendingtheir children to school with their own food. The nutritionalconsequences would be unfortunate; and the distinction, within a school, between those children who continued to take advantage of school meals and those who brought their own food would besocially invidious. Moreover, the proposals would involve serious administrative difficulties, particularly in imposing on teaching staffan additional duty in the way of collecting payments for school milk, &amp;c, which the teachers were now legally entitled to refuse todischarge.The Minister of Pensions said that the proposal to withdraw the family allowance for the second child while increasing the allowance for the third and subsequent children to 14s. would be a reversal of the Governments previous policy of abolishing generalsubsidies and providing discriminatory compensation to those members of the community who were economically the most vulnerable. If coupled with the imposition of increased charges forthe welfare foods, school milk and school meals, it would be regardedas an attack on the nutritional standards of children and would bedifficult to justify. Its disadvantages would be aggravated by thefact that the full force of the saving would fall on families belowthe income tax level, He., on those whom it was impossible to helpby any adjustments of direct taxation.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Economies in Government expenditure were necessary, both to convince the public that the Government were in control of theeconomic situation and also to restore external confidence in sterling.These economies should not, however, be inconsistent with the main
principles of the Government^ social policy; nor should the costof the social services be regarded as the only cause of the pressure on the economy, for which the great increase in investment was alsopartly responsible.(b) A comprehensive review of methods of financing the social services should be undertaken forthwith. There would be considerable advantage if the first major step towards theOpportunity State, insofar as it depended on the more comprehensivelist of economies proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,could be taken in time for its results to be apparent in theforthcoming Budget. But, even if this was not possible, theBudget must be seen to reflect a more realistic approach to theproblem of financing the social services and to be a first instalment of a new and determined effort to solve this problem.(c) A few large economies might be both more effective andmore easily accepted by public opinion than a series of small andirritating reductions. From this point of view there was much to besaid in favour of the proposal to withdraw the family allowance forthe second child, with some increase for the third and subsequent children. On the other hand, there were serious political risks inthe reversal of policy which this would imply.(d) The proposed economies in respect of welfare milk, orangejuice, cod liver oil and vitamins might well be adopted. On the dental service, school milk and school meals the arguments were more evenly balanced, although it should be possible to make a moderate increase in the charges for the dental service and to increaseslightly the charge for school meals. Consideration should also begiven to the possibility of securing economies in the expenditure ondrugs under the National Health Service, which now amounted tosome  60 million a year.(e) The possibility of introducing into the National health service the principle of a separate contribution should be further examined. The advantages of this suggestion would, however, need to be weighed against the probability that the existing contributionunder the National Insurance Scheme would have to be raised inthe near future and the risk that public opinion would resent twoincreases in contributions following hard on one another.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet&apos;s discussion hadclarified a problem which was partly economic and partlypsychological. The economic factors involved e.g., the ultimateimpact of the oil shortage on our balance of payments, the future ofthe Suez Canal and of the oil pipelines, &amp;c. were unpredictable. Itwas, therefore, particularly important that the forthcoming Budgetshould inspire public opinion, both at home and abroad, with confidence in the Government^ ability to keep public expenditure under firm control. The Cabinet would need to reach decisions onthese questions during the following week.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their discussion at a later meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,1st February, 1957.
