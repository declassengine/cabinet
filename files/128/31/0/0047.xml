Public 1.   The Prime Minister said that he had reflected further on theService. proposals for increases in certain public service salaries which the salaries. Cabinet had provisionally approved before the Whitsun recess.  He(Previous        believed that public opinion, while prepared to accept significantReference:      increases in the remuneration of Members of Parliament and cc. (57) 44th Parliamentary Secretaries, might react unfavourably to an arrange-Conclusions,    ment whereby senior Ministers in the House of Commons would minute 2.)       receive an increase of  1,000 a year in their basic salary and be entitledto draw, in addition, a Parliamentary allowance of  750.  A married man with two children and an earned income of  5,000 a year hadalready benefited from the tax changes in the recent Budget by rather more than  300 a year; and such a man, assuming that he had noother income, would derive a further net benefit of about  360 a year if his earned income was increased from  5,000 to  6,000 a year.Public opinion might well be critical of an addition of this order tothe salaries of senior Ministers, especially as the Government had notyet introduced legislation to improve the pensions of the poorersections of the community.He therefore suggested to the Cabinet that, while they mightreaffirm their earlier decision to improve the remuneration ofMembers of Parliament by introducing a Parliamentary allowance of 750 a year, they might reconsider the increases in salary which theyhad envisaged for Ministers. More appropriate increases might be 2,500 a year for Parliamentary Secretaries and  3,750 a year for ministers of State, the Parliamentary allowance being payable inaddition when the Minister was in the House of Commons. the salary of senior Ministers, however, might remain unchanged at 5,000, with the addition of the Parliamentary allowance for a minister in the Commons. The Financial and Economic secretaries to the Treasury should be treated as Ministers of State. It would benecessary to make appropriate adjustments in the increases previously envisaged for Mr. Speaker, the Officers of the two Houses ofParliament and the Leader of the Opposition. It would be inadvisable to make any change in the pensions of former PrimeMinisters.In discussion it was suggested that there was some case foradhering to the Cabinefs original decision. An increase in the salary of senior Ministers was long overdue, and it could be argued that theGovernment need not adopt a more cautious attitude towards thosesalaries than towards the salaries of the Chairmen of the Boards of the nationalised industries. Moreover, the existing structure of ministerial salaries incorporated a scale of relativities which reflected the degrees of responsibility involved, and it would be anomalous ifa Minister of State in the House of Commons received, after tax,higher remuneration than a senior Minister in the House of Lords.It was suggested, alternatively, that, in the case of senior ministers, the legislation which would have to be introduced shouldbe confined, as regards the remainder of the life of the present parliament, to enabling them to receive the proposed Parliamentaryallowance, but should also provide that the increase in basic salarywhich the Cabinet had previously approved should comeinto operation after the next election. If, however, it was feltinappropriate in present circumstances to attach any precise figure toa prospective increase in the salaries of senior Ministers, theannouncement of the Governments proposals, as now modified,should at least indicate that the Government recognised that a more comprehensive adjustment of those salaries would need to be madesooner or later.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that further enquiry had shown that it would be possible to introduce a scheme of insurancewhich would provide Members of Parliament with protectioncomparable with that which would henceforward be extended to
Ministers of the Crown by the Injury Warrant. Such a scheme would,however, have to be confined to those occasions when Members ofParliament were commissioned by the House of Commons to act ina representative capacity on behalf of the House as a whole, and couldnot extend to injuries suffered in the discharge of their ordinaryParliamentary duties.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the proposals for increases in certain publicservice salaries should be revised on the basis suggestedby the Prime Minister.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would consider whetherit would be appropriate to indicate, in announcing these increases, that the Government recognised that an adjustment of the salaries of senior Ministers was overdue.(3) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the chief whip, to arrange for the necessary preliminaryconsultations to be undertaken, with a view to an early announcement of the Governments proposals.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for theintroduction of a scheme of insurance for Members ofParliament on the lines indicated in the discussion.Housing 2.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordPolicy. Chancellor (C. (57) 140) reporting the conclusions of a Committee of manchester.     Ministers which had examined the case for submitting to a public(Previous        enquiry the application of the Manchester Corporation for leave to reference:      acquire agricultural land at Lymm for housing development.CC. (57) 33rdConclusions, The Lord Chancellor said that the Committee had been unableMinute 3.) to reach agreement. It could be argued that the manchester corporation would be able to increase their rate of building to 2,300houses a year or more in the period 1961-65 by making use of siteswhich were already in prospect; and he himself considered that theCorporation should be required to develop those sites beforeencroaching on agricultural land. The Minister of Housing, however,took the view that, on a realistic appraisal, the rate of building couldnot be raised above 2,000 houses a year in that period if theCorporation were confined to the sites already in prospect, and thatit would be tantamount to a decision to frustrate the Corporation intheir slum clearance policy if they were prevented from pursuing their claim to acquire an additional site under their own control. Therewas therefore no alternative but to submit the question again to theCabinet.The Minister of Housing said that Manchester was confronted with the worst slum problem in England and Wales. A forecast of separately of new building of 2,300 houses or more during the years 1961-65was unrealistic in assuming that there would be no delay in thenecessary preparations and that neighbouring local authorities, whohad no incentive to absorb Manchester&apos;s surplus population, would infact collaborate fully to that end. The Cabinets earlier decision thatManchester^ application should not be submitted to public enquiryhad been taken on the assumption that alternative sites for a total of18,000 houses would be available to the Corporation. It was now established, however, that the alternative sites in prospect wouldaccommodate only 12,000 new houses, a number quite disproportion-ate to Manchester&apos;s needs. The charge that Manchester had notinvestigated all possible alternative sites could not be sustained, andit was essential that the Corporation should be afforded an adequateopportunity of demonstrating the strength of their claim for anadditional site. He recommended however that, in prefence to apublic enquiry confined to the Corporation^ application for leave to
Retirement Pay 3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the first of Vice-Admiral Lord of the Admiralty (C. (57) 139) recommending that steps should. Hughes be taken to negotiate a settlement, at a compounded figure notHailett. exceeding  2,500, of the claim of Vice-Admiral J. Hughes Hallett to(Previous        retired pay of  1,200 a year instead of  873 a year as awarded.Reference:CM. (55) 21st The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that Vice-Admiral HughesConclusions, Halletf s case was not a strong one, and a negotiated settlement couldMinute 6.)       only be justified if the claim could properly be regarded as analogous to the type of claim in private litigation in which a negotiated settle-ment would be accepted as appropriate.acquire a particular site at Lymm, the proposed investigation, a comprehensive enquiry into Man Chester &apos;s housing needs, should be conducted by an independent person of the standing of a High court judge. Such an enquiry, which would enable the facts of the matter to be impartially established, offered the only prospect of resolvingthe present deadlock.Discussion showed that several Ministers felt considerablemisgivings about the proposal to submit this issue to public enquiry.The alienation of first-class agricultural land would be ill received bya large section of the Governmenfs supporters, and the proposal todevelop for building some of the best farming land in the country would be generally regarded as a test of the Governmenfs attitudetowards the interests of the agricultural community and thepreservation of the amenities of the countryside. Moreover, a public enquiry would diminish the incentive to the Manchester corporation to intensify their search for alternative sites. Perseverance might bring such sites to light; but if, as was probable, a public enquiryestablished Manchester^ claim to develop the site at Lymm, a large area of agricultural land would be irrecoverably lost.On the other hand, the Governmenfs housing policy was nowdirected mainly towards securing more rapid progress in slum clearance, and their decision in this case would also be regarded as a test of their sincerity in pursuing this policy. Moreover, the suitability of alternative sites from the point of view of Manchester&apos;s industrieswas of great importance. Neither Glossop nor Macclesfield offeredadequate industrial potentialities; and, in striking a balance betweenthe legitimate claims of town and country, full weight should be givento the fact that it was on industry rather than on agriculture that thenational economy was ultimately dependent.In further discussion it was agreed that the oalance of advantage lay in conceding a fresh public enquiry. This enquiry should,however, be directed primarily to establishing the order in which thevarious possible sites should be developed if Manchester&apos;s housing policy was to be based on a realistic rate of building and the develop-ment of high-quality agricultural land was to be deferred as long aspossible. The terms of reference of the enquiry should be so draftedas to emphasise this latter stipulation.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that an independent enquiry intoManchestefs housing needs should be appointed, on thelines indicated in their discussion.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with the Ministerof Housing and the Minister of Agriculture, to frame, inthe light of the discussion, appropriate terms of reference for such an enquiry and to make recommendations regarding its composition and character.
The Attorney-General said that, while a negotiated settlement would not be inappropriate, the prospects of Vice-Admiral HughesHalletfs succeeding in establishing his claim if he took it to the courtswere, at best, evenly balanced. Whatever misleading information onthe subject of retired pay entitlement might have been given to him,the correct entitlement was clearly set out in a code to which he hadaccess. It might be held to imply some admission of liability if theclaim were settled at a figure higher than half its compounded value,and the repercussions of such a precedent might be embarrassing. Nosettlement should, therefore, be sought at a figure exceeding  2,000and no allowance for costs should be made.The Cabinet Authorised the Parliamentary Secretary, Admiralty to seek to negotiate a settlement of the claim of Vice-AdmiralJ. Hughes Hallett in respect of his retired pay, at acompounded figure not exceeding  2,000 with no allowance for costs.4. The Prime Minister said that in 1955 it had been suggestedthat the U.S.S. Nautilus should visit this country as soon as agreement had been reached between the United States authorities and ourselves on the exchange of nuclear information; and the United states authorities had been informed that we should welcome such a visit indue course. It was now proposed that this ship should enterPortsmouth in September. It was unfortunate that these arrange-ments had been made without prior consultation with the atomic energy Authority, since there were some grounds for believing that,if the ship was allowed to come to Portsmouth, American interests would exploit the visit to argue that, although we were not preparedto establish our own nuclear reactors in centres of population, wewere ready to accept an American reactor in a busy port, thus tacitlydemonstrating that the American reactor was safer than the Britishreactor. From this point of view it would be desirable that, if the visit of the U.S.S. Nautilus could not be postponed, the ship should goeither to Milford Haven or to Invergordon.The Parliamentary Secretary, Admiralty said that it would be unfortunate if, at a time when we were seeking to obtain information from the United States on a variety of nuclear problems, particularlysubmarine propulsion, we were to refuse to receive the U.S.S. Nautilusat Portsmouth which was our main naval port and the centre of oursubmarine service. Of the alternatives to Portsmouth, milford haven was not a naval port, while Invergordon would have been closed, under the defence economy measures, before the visit of theU.S.S. Nautilus took place. If, however, the objections to receivingthis ship in Portsmouth were overriding, it might be possible toarrange for it to visit Portland instead.The Cabinet-Invited the Parliamentary Secretary, Admiralty, to consult the Atomic Energy Authority about the suitability ofPortland for the reception of the U.S.S. Nautilus.Visit of theU.S.S.&quot; Nautilus &quot;to the UnitedKingdom.
