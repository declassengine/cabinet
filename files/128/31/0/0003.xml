[ Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Business. The Death Penalty (Abolition) Bill, introduced by Miss AliceBacon, M.P., was due to have its Second Reading on 1st February.The debate on the Advertisements (Hire-Purchase) Bill which preceded it might prevent its being discussed. If so, Mr. Silverman,M.P., would probably seek to reintroduce Miss Bacon&apos;s Bill underthe Ten-Minute Rule.Breach of The Home Secretary said that Mr. Junor, the editor of the privilege. Sunday Express, would appear at the Bar of the House that afternoon to atone for his breach of privilege in publishing unfounded reportsabout the allocation of petrol to Members of Parliament. If he offered a suitable apology, it could be accepted. If he refused toapologise, he would be reprimanded by the Speaker. If, however,his behaviour was contumacious, he would be committed to the custody of the Sergeant-at-Arms.remuneration of Doctors.(previous reference:CM. (56) 49thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum (CP. (57) 11)by the former Secretary of State for Scotland and the former Ministerof Health about the remuneration of doctors.The Minister of Health said that the doctors were maintaining their pressure for an increase in their remuneration. He agreed withhis predecessor in recommending that the Government should now propose the establishment of a Royal Commission on medical and dental remuneration, while offering at the same time some interim increase for certain classes of doctor who were admittedly underpaidat present. The main advantage of a Royal Commission would bethat it would substitute for the principles adopted by the SpensCommittees a fresh basis for future consideration of medicalremuneration. While the doctors could not be expected to welcome the proposal, they would probably accept it if it were coupled withsome interim increase in remuneration. If, however, the government took no action of any kind, the doctors would certainly intensify theirpublic pressure, and might even withhold their co-operation in theworking of the National Health Service.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that the temper of the doctors in Scotland was more aggressive than in England and that,unless the Government were prepared to take some immediate actionto relieve hardship, the continued collaboration of the doctors in the efficient operation of the National Health Service in Scotland couldnot be taken for granted.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) If the proposal to establish a Royal Commission was accepted in principle, further thought would need to be given to its membership. A judicial Chairman might be unduly influenced by thelegalistic considerations which had contributed to determining theprinciples of the Spens Committees&apos; recommendations. An eminentindustrialist might be preferable. The members of the commission should be selected as individuals rather than as representatives ofparticular interests.(b) The terms of reference proposed in CP. (57) .11 would coverdoctors and dentists outside the National Health Service, including those working under the Medical Research Council or in the universities. It might be wiser to confine the scope of the RoyalCommission to the National Health Service, merely empowering itto have regard to the remuneration of other doctors and dentists.On the other hand, such doctors were already at some disadvantageby comparison with members of the National Health Service,particularly as they were not eligible for merit awards. This must,however, be weighed against the risk that any concession to doctors51124 b 2
Oil Supplies(previous reference :CM- (57) 1stConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Power (C. (57) 2) and a report by the Economic PolicyCommittee (C (57) 7) on the prospects for oil supplies in the period immediately ahead.The Minister of Power said that the outlook, although it variedas between the different oil products, showed some slightimprovement on previous forecasts. It should be possible to sustain the petrol ration at its present level at least until the end of the firstrationing period. The distribution of diesel and gas oil could alsobe maintained, on the basis of current restrictions, at the expense ofsome reduction in stocks. Fuel oil gave cause for the greatestanxiety, and a loan of 400,000 tons from Admiralty stocks wouldbe necessary in order to maintain reserves at a minimum workingnot members of the National Health Service might react on other professions, including the non-medical faculties at the Universities.(c) The proposed terms of reference also seemed to invite theRoyal Commission to recommend machinery for subsequentperiodical reviews of remuneration. It would be undesirable that the remuneration of doctors should be linked directly with the cost ofliving.(d) The competition for the output of schools and Universitieswas now so keen that the learned professions no longer providedsufficiently remunerative prospects to attract the best candidates. Itwas to be hoped, therefore, that the main emphasis of theCommission^ recommendations would be on improvingremuneration at the upper end of the income scale.(e) The interim increase to be offered to the doctors should be without prejudice to the eventual findings of the Royal Commission;and the hardship cases to which it should be made available shouldbe defined by the Government after discussion with the doctors, but should not be allowed to become the subject of a negotiation whichwould anticipate the work of the Commission. The increase shouldbe confined to such categories as junior hospital staff, and should not extend to general practitioners as a whole.(/) The interim increase to the doctors should be kept in scalewith, and announced at much the same time as, any corresponding increases which it might be decided to award to other professionalclasses, e.g., the judiciary, University teachers, Junior Ministers and members of Parliament. The announcement of such increases should be deferred until the current wages pressure had passed itspeak; but it should be made, if possible, before the end of March.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the establishment of a RoyalCommission on the remuneration of doctors and dentists.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Ministerof Health to reconsider with the Chancellor of theExchequer, in the light of their discussion, the composition and terms of reference of the RoyalCommission.(3) Agreed that an interim increase of remuneration should begiven to certain classes of doctors or dentists; and invited the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister ofHealth to consider, in consultation with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, the amount of such interim increases.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider inconsultation with the Minister of Labour the timing of salary increases for other professional classes.
level in April. The Economic Policy Committee had agreed that industry might be given an assurance that there would be no furthercut in the distribution of fuel oil before the end of March, althoughit was recommended that the announcement of this should be deferred until the end of the first week in February. He now sought authority to make such an announcement, the actual date being leftto his discretion.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) In order that industry should be able to plan sufficiently far ahead, the proposed announcement should be made as soon aspossible. On the other hand, a premature announcement might be interpreted by American and European opinion as an indication thatwe were making extravagant use of our resources. A balance would need to be struck between these considerations.(b) The possibility of effecting further economies in the use of oil should be re-examined, particularly in the case of the Services andthe farmers. Farmers were probably receiving petrol in excess oftheir reasonable needs, but it was not easily practicable to introduce a cut during the currency of a rationing period. A plan had,however, been prepared for allocating petrol to farmers after the endof the first rationing period, if rationing had to be maintained. ThePresident of the National Farmers&apos; Union had been urged torepresent to his members in the strongest terms the need for stringenteconomy in the use of petrol.(c) It was reported to the Cabinet that the United states authorities were now considering possible methods of alleviating theshortage of oil in Western Europe by obtaining additional deliveries from Venezuela and by persuading American oil companies operating on the East coast of the United States to reduce somewhatthe rate of output of their refineries so as to release a correspondingtonnage of crude oil for export. There was also a possibility thatthe United States Navy might be prepared to lend part of their stocksof oil to underwrite commercial stocks.(d) The long-term risk to the safe transit of our oil might persisteven when the Suez Canal had been cleared. The tentative projectto construct a pipeline from the Gulf of Aqaba to the Mediterraneanacross Israeli territory might therefore represent an importantmeasure of insurance, especially if steps could be taken tointernationalise this strip of territory under the control the united nations. It could not be assumed that the Arab countries would necessarily allow this pipeline to be used for the passage of oilproduced in their territory and this would seriously impair its value.Nevertheless, the extent to which we could reduce our dependence on the Suez Canal, both by building large tankers and by constructingnew pipelines, should be examined as a matter of urgency.(e) It would be necessary to decide, before the Suez Canal wasreopened to navigation, whether in any circumstances we should beprepared to pay dues to an agency of the Egyptian Government. Itwould be damaging to our prestige to do so, and we must clearlyaim at reaching agreement on a system which would permit dues tobe paid in the first instance to some appropriate international organisation. Nevertheless, if we were confronted with the alternatives of either paying dues to the Egyptian Government orvoluntarily foregoing the use of the Canal, it would be necessary toconsider very seriously where our paramount interests lay. In such circumstances, the worst possible outcome from the point of view of prestige would be to find ourselves, after initial resistance, ultimatelyforced into paying dues to Egypt.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Power to make an announcement,at a date to be fixed at his discretion, assuring industry that it should be possible to maintain supplies of fuel oilat the present level until the end of March.
(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theMinister of Power, to take such continuing action as might be necessary to encourage the United StatesGovernment in their efforts to alleviate the oil shortage in western Europe.(3) Invited the Minister of Power to provide the Minister ofDefence with a brief on this subject, for use during his forthcoming visit to Washington.(4) Invited the Minister of Power, in consultation with theForeign Secretary and the Minister of Transport, toconsider what further steps might be taken to reduce oue independence on the Suez Canal for oil supplies in the longer term.(5) Invited the Minister of Defence to consider what further economies might be achieved in the use of oil by theServices.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,24th January, 1957.
