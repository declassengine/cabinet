JordanUnited states military Aid(previous reference:CC. (57) 63rdConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of State for Foreign Affairs (C. (57) 191) stating that theUnited States Government had now decided to supply AmericanM. 47 tanks to Jordan in place of the fifteen Centurion tanks, whosesupply had been approved by the Cabinet at their meeting on27th August. The suggestion that American instead of British tanksshould be supplied had apparently come from King Hussein. In thecircumstances it would be difficult for the United KingdomGovernment to question the decision.The Cabinet Took note of C. (57) 191.WesternEuropeanUnion(previous reference:CC. (57) 15thConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theForeign Secretary (C. (57) 192) about the draft Convention settingup an international Tribunal for the protection of private interests which might suffer damage from the operations of the Arms ControlAgency in Western European Union.The Cabinet were informed that under Article XVIII of the draftConvention it was proposed to accord to the judges of the Tribunalimmunity from legal process. This provision raised no difficulty forthe other Western European Union countries since it merely repeated the privileges and immunities already granted to the European coal and Steel Community judges who would also be the six Europeanjudges on this new international Tribunal. In view of the importanceof ensuring an early start of the full operation of the Arms ControlAgency it was recommended that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should agree to accept Article XVIII, provided that an amendment was introduced limiting the immunity granted to the United Kingdomjudge to immunity in respect of actions carried out in the course ofhis official duties. Legislation would not be required for this purpose,but an Order in Council would in due course have to be submitted toParliament.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals in C. (57) 192.IndiaExport Credit(previous reference:CC. (57) 63rdConclusions,Minute 6.)4. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the indian government had objected to the proposal that the Export credits guarantee Department should issue an announcement about thelimitation on the amount of medium-term commercial credit to begranted to India under the Export Guarantees Act. The indian government were now proposing to impose further restrictions on imports into India, and though the formal announcement of their new import licensing policy would not be issued until towards theend of the month, they intended to issue an interim statement onSyia 1.   The Cabinet discussed the situation in Syria.(previous reference:CC. (57) 63rdConclusions,Minute 7.)
9th September which would enable the Export Credits guarantee department to refer applicants back to their Indian customers forletters of authority to be issued by the Government of India. Thisarrangement would make it unnecessary for the Department to issue the proposed announcement. The Chancellor said that, in view ofthe concern which the Indian Government had expressed about theoriginal proposal, he intended to send a personal message to theIndian Finance Minister.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement.Cabinet7thOffice, S.W. 1,September, 1957.
