Wages Policy.(previous reference:CC. (57) 83rdConclusions,Minute 3.)industrial disputes.(Previous .Reference:CC. (57) 60thConclusions,Minute 4.)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Labour (C. (57) 288)about wages policy.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Governmentshould now adhere firmly to the policy which they had adopted emphasising, where appropriate, the need and opportunities for price reductions and avoiding any binding statements about modifications of the system of arbitration and collective bargaining. The attitude to be adopted towards individual wage claims would need to bedecided in each case in the light of the circumstances at the time.In discussion there was general agreement with these views. Itwas pointed out, however, that in so far as price reductions affectedstocks, they would inflict losses on the traders concerned. It might therefore be preferable that the Government should be seen to welcome them where they occurred rather than to seek to secure themregardless of the circumstances.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of C. (57) 288.*2. The Home Secretary said that the Ministerial Committee on emergencies had recently completed a review of the arrangements for maintaining essential supplies and services in the event of industrial unrest. Planning had been carried as far as was practicable. Inparticular, plans had been made for the employment of Servicemenand civilian volunteers in an emergency and for the strengthening ofthe Emergencies Organisation in the regions. If a major emergencydeveloped, it might be desirable that the Government should berepresented in the regions by Ministers, who would act as chairmen of the Regional Committees. On this he would submit proposals tothe Prime Minister.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that, in the event of a railway strike, it should be possible to maintain essential supplies forseveral weeks, provided that the road transport system continued to operate. It would be unwise, however, to assume that the unions would be unable, having regard to their own resources and to thesystem of P.A.Y.E. refunds, to sustain a Strike beyond that period.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.Electrical 3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theTrades Union Minister of Labour (C. (57) 294) on allegations that the ExecutiveCouncil of the Electrical Trades Union (E.T.U.) had recentlymanipulated the election of new members in favour of Communistcandidates and had altered the CounciFs rules in order to strengthenits position as against its members.The Minister of Labour said that investigation would probablyconfirm that the Council were not formally guilty of any irregularity.The allegations had, however, aroused considerable public disquiet,and Government supporters whom he had consulted, while endorsingthe view that it was primarily for the union concerned or, alternatively,the Trades Union Congress (T.U.C.) to take steps to ensure that the affairs of this union would be administered more satisfactorily infuture, were also of the opinion that, failing such action, theGovernment would be obliged to consider whether they should themselves intervene. It might strengthen the position of those elements in the T.U.C. who were prepared to contemplate taking action under their own rules if he conveyed a private warning in this sense to the Chairman of the General Council. Nevertheless, it would* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET52960-1 B 2
not be easy to devise means by which the Government could properlyintervene in the affairs of a union, especially since new legislation would probably be required. He would give further considerationto this aspect of the matter.The Cabinet (1) Took note of C. (57) 294.(2) Authorised the Minister of Labour to advise the Chairmanof the Trades Union Congress, on the lines which he had indicated, of the Governmenfs attitude towards the allegations of irregularity in the proceedings of theExecutive Council of the Electrical Trades Union.Rent 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theRestriction. Secretary of State for Scotland (C. (57) 292) submitting proposals(Previous for raising the rents of houses in Scotland belonging to certain reference: Government-sponsored bodies, namely, the Scottish Special HousingC.C. (57) 15th Association, the Scottish National Housing Companies and the NewMinute?)S&apos; Town CorPorations of East Kilbride and Glenrothes.Scotland. jne Secretary of State for Scotland said that no increase would amount to more than Is. 6d. a week and provision would be made forrebates in cases of hardship. The proposals were acceptable to the managing bodies of the organisations concerned and should be. endorsed by responsible Scottish opinion. Nevertheless, they wouldgive rise to a disparity, amounting to about 14s. a week in an extreme case, between the rents of these houses and the rents of local authorityhouses. They would therefore be liable to provoke social protest, inthe form of tenants&apos; strikes, which might develop into industrial unrest. It was essential, however, following the enactment of theHousing and Town Development (Scotland) Act, that the rents ofGovernment-controlled houses in Scotland should be placed on amore economic footing. It was proposed that the increases should be announced on 15th January to come into effect, after the necessaryperiods of consultations and notice, about mid-summer 1958.In discussion there was general agreement that the proposed increases were justified, particularly since the revised rents would notbe out of line with the rents of comparable houses in England. Inorder to reduce the risk of adverse reactions on current wage negotiations, however, there would be advantage, if the necessary preparations could be completed in time, in making the proposed announcement as early in the New Year as possible instead of deferring it until 15th January.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the proposals in C. (57) 292.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland to give furtherconsideration to advancing the date of the public announcement of these proposals.North atlantic council.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 84thConclusions,Minute 8.)5. The Prime Minister made a report to the Cabinet on themeeting of the North Atlantic Council held in Paris from 16th to19th December.The Prime Minister said that the results of this meeting were, onthe whole, satisfactory. The suspicions, aroused by the Washingtonmeeting, of a new phase of Anglo-American hegemony in the Alliancehad been dispelled. The principle of independence military,political and economic had been accepted. There had been a welcome recognition, aided by recent developments in Indonesia, thatthe main Communist threat to the free world lay, not in militaryaggression in Europe, but in economic penetration and politicalsubversion elsewhere.   The Secretary-General had been instructed to
explore the possibilities of closer association with other defensivealliances ranged against Communist encroachment. The Americanoffer to locate stocks of atomic weapons and ballistic missiles inEurope had not led to any division of principle within the Alliance.This offer had been accepted by the Alliance as a whole on the basis that the location of the stocks and the missiles would be determinedby strategic considerations and regulated by bilateral agreements withthe countries concerned.The great issue which had emerged at the meeting was that of reconciling the need to strengthen the military power of the alliance with the growing feeling in Europe that no opportunity should be lost of settling outstanding differences with the Soviet Union. On this there had at the outset been some danger of a rift between the UnitedStates Government and some of the European members of the alliance. The Prime Minister had been able to reconcile what might otherwise have developed into a conflict of view by proposing thatthe policy of the Alliance should be based on the concept which sir Winston Churchill had embodied in the phrase &quot;we arm toparley.&quot; This concept had enabled the meeting to approve measures for increasing the military strength of the Alliance, by accepting theprinciple of balanced collective forces and the American offer of modern weapons, and at the same time to put forward the suggestionthat a meeting of Foreign Ministers should be held to attempt tobreak the deadlock in the international discussions on disarmament.The meeting had thus produced a balanced set of decisions whichwould probably be found to be in accord with the mood of publicopinion in Europe.The Reith Lectures recently delivered by Mr. George Kennanhad revived public interest in the future of Germany, which continuedto be the crux of the European problem. The possibility of a unifiedand neutral Germany would again be canvassed; and those whoadvocated this solution would play on the feelings of those who weregrowing tired of maintaining resistance to Communist encroachment.This was a dangerous development which must be carefully handled.Germany had always formed part of the North Atlantic area, first asan occupied country and later as an independent member of the alliance; and it must be recognised that, without Germany, theNorth Atlantic Alliance could not in practice form an effective shieldagainst Soviet encroachment.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Government must give their supporters a firmer lead on policy towards Europe. They must also counter the view that international Communism was losing its dynamic force andabandoning its ambition for world domination.(b) An answer must be found to Russian claims of pre-eminencein scientific and technological achievement. There were indicationssuggesting that, by encouraging the exchange of visits by business menand by increasing the teaching of foreign languages, the Russians were now preparing for increased competition for foreign trade.(c) It was increasingly important that the productive surplusesof the United States and Germany should be harnessed to the task of checking Soviet economic penetration overseas, especially in theless developed countries. The Prime Minister said that in this contexthe had been glad to hear that President Eisenhower was proposing to ask Congress to increase the appropriations for foreign aid.During the discussions in Paris he had also impressed on the Germanrepresentatives the need of their co-operation in financing economic development overseas, and further steps must be taken to keep thispoint in the minds of German Ministers.(d) Further thought should be given to the possibility of concentrating on selected countries the capital resources available for economic development in the free world.
(e) It would be helpful if the Cabinet could have an appreciation of the military value of siting ballistic missiles at advanced points inEurope, so that this could be weighed against the political advantage which might be gained from a decision that these weapons shouldnot be located east of the Rhine. The Minister of Defence said thathe would welcome an early opportunity for discussion of this subject in the first instance, perhaps, in the Defence Committee.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement and of the points raised in discussion.(2) Expressed their appreciation of the results achieved at therecent meeting of the North Atlantic Council and of thenotable contribution which the Prime Minister had madein securing those results.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,20th December, 1957.
