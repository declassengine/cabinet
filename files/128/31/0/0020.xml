Oil supplies and Prices.(previous references:CM. (56) 95thConclusions,Minute 2, andC.C. (57) 13thConclusions,Minute 10.)1.; The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Minister of power (C. (57.) 66 and 67) recommending that further relaxationsshould be authorised in the rationing of oil products, and that consentshould be given to marginal increases in the prices of these products.The Minister of Power said that the prospects for oil supplieshad been materially improved by the re-opening of the Syrian pipe-line. Restrictions on the consumption of gas/diesel oil could nowbe withdrawn, on the understanding that, unless consumers exercisedall possible economies, it might prove necessary to prescribe a measureof under-delivery by the Companies. The rationing of fuel oil andpetrol could not be completely terminated until supplies more nearlyapproached normal; but a more generous allocation of fuel oil forspace-heating could be permitted and the basic ration of petrol couldbe increased by 50 per cent, for the second rationing period, with a correspondingly generous treatment of applications for supplementaryallocations^Some increase in the prices of oil products was now unavoidable,as a result of a further rise in costs. The oil companies hadvoluntarily undertaken to submit their proposals to the Governmentfor approval, although they were under no obligation to do so. an examination of the evidence submitted by the companies suggestedthat the retail price of petrol should be raised by Id. a gallon, withproportionate increases in the prices of other oil products.In discussion it was agreed that the prospects for oil supplies were not yet sufficiently secure to justify bringing all rationing to anend. On the other hand, there might be some advantage in announcing forthwith that restrictions on the use of gas/diesel oilwould be removed, since, the prospect of more generous supplies of fuel for the road transport industry might help to reduce the riskof a strike on the railways.As soon as the de-rationing of gas/diesel oil had been announced,the Government would be pressed to honour their undertaking toremove the temporary additional duty which had been imposed inthe previous autumn. It would, however, be impracticable to remove the extra, duty on one of the oil products in isolation, and theGovernment were under no legal obligation to reduce the duty to itsprevious level until a month after the rationing of all oil productshad ended. In the meantime, there was no alternative to consentingto a further marginal increase in the commercial prices of these products. The proposed increase of \d. in the retailers&apos; margin,however, was doubtfully justified, and consideration should be givento the possibility of pressing the oil companies to effect a significant reduction in this margin when petrol was eventually de-rationed.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in C. (57) 66 and 67.- (2) Authorised the Minister of Power to arrange for a statement on oil supplies and prices, in the terms of the draft whichhe had circulated at the meeting, to be made in Parlia-ment on 18th March.Credit Trading. 2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordChancellor (C. (57) 52) about the introduction of the Credit TradingBill in the current Session.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the banks supported the proposals in Part II of the Bill, partly in order to secure someregulation of the competition which they faced from the hire-purchase finance companies and partly in order to provide protection
for persons placing money on deposit with those companies. TheBill was, however, a complex and difficult measure which would arouse considerable opposition; and it should not be impossible to devise, in consultation with the interests concerned, some simplersolution to the problem. If Part II of the Bill was abandoned, therewould be no justification for proceeding in the current session witha more limited Bill, based only on Part I of the present draft, anddesigned merely to provide permanent powers to control hire-purchase trading.The President of the Board of Trade said that he concurred inthis view. The introduction of legislation to prescribe liquidityratios for the hire-purchase finance companies could be misrepresented-sented as an attempt to impose restrictions on companies whose activities were of benefit mainly to the poorer members of thecommunity. Moreover, the Bill was neither suitable nor necessary as a reinforcement of the Governments disinflationary policy.In discussion it was agreed that the Bill should not be intro-duced in the current Session. The problem of the liquidity ratios ofthe hire-purchase finance companies might be further considered inthe context of any wider examination of the mechanism of the creditsystem in general which it might prove desirable to undertake; andthe enactment of permanent legislation to control hire-purchasetrading should be deferred until the following Session when it shouldbe considered in conjunction with other legislation designed toreplace the Defence Regulations.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Credit Trading Bill should not be intro-duced in the current Session.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to give furtherconsideration to the extent to which its provisions should form the subject of legislation in the following Session.Legislative 3.   The Home Secretary said that, in view of the decision that programme,     the Credit Trading Bill should not be introduced in the current1956-57.        session, it should be possible to allow a recess of two weeks at(Previous        Whitsun and to complete the legislative programme with only a reference:      short meeting of Parliament in the autumn.   This was on the cm. (56) 72nd assumption that it would not now be practicable to proceed in this conclusions,    session with a Bill to reform the House of Lords, and that constitu-Minute 4.)       tional legislation on Malta and Malaya could be deferred until thenext session.   On the other hand, it should be possible to enactthe Geneva Conventions Bill in the current session, if drafting couldbe expedited.   The drafting of the National Health Service Bill shouldalso be completed as a matter of urgency.   He would shortly submitseparate proposals about the future course of the Shops Bill.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Colonial Secretary said that, since it seemed likely thatthe report of the Reid Commission would prove acceptable in theFederation of Malaya, it would be out of the question to defer untilthe following session the constitutional legislation about theFederation. It was less certain whether it would prove possible to enact the proposed Malta Bill in the current session; but, if agree-ment was reached with Maltese Ministers in the near future, the enactment of this Bill also would be a matter of urgency.(b) The Lord President said that, although the discussions which,in consultation with the Lord Chancellor, he had been holding with
the independent Unionist Peers had resulted in a satisfactorymeasure of agreement, it now seemed less likely that legislation forthe reform of the House of Lords would be possible in the current session. If, however, the Governmenfs proposals were made public and debated in July, the Bill could be introduced early in thenext session. In the light of the growing pressure of public opinion,the Geneva Conventions Bill, which would be suitable for intro-duction in the House of Lords, should be enacted in the current session if possible.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of these statements.(2) Invited the Minister of Health to arrange for the drafting ofthe National Health Service Bill to be expedited.4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary ofthe Cabinet (C. (57) 61) covering a memorandum about imports ofcotton textiles from India, Pakistan and Hong Kong.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the growth ofimports of manufactured goods from Asian commonwealth countries presented an increasingly serious problem. The Lanca-shire cotton industry had been advised to attempt to negotiate withthe industries in the countries concerned agreements for the voluntary restriction of exports of cotton textiles from thosecountries. The negotiations with the Indian industry had had anunexpected measure of success; but the Indian agreement was con-ditional not only on similar agreement by Pakistan and Hong Kong,which had not yet been obtained, but also on a control in thiscountry of the limitation on the exports from the countries involved.It was suggested that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should undertake this control, but it was a matter for serious consideration whetherthe Government would be justified in introducing quota restrictions,if requested to do so, as a means of giving effect to voluntary agree-ments of this kind.The President of the Board of Trade said that the represen-tatives of Lancashire industry were prepared, for the moment, to pursue negotiations with Pakistan and Hong Kong without anyexplicit assurance on this point. If, however, agreement wasreached between the industries themselves, the Government wouldthen need to decide whether they would operate the administrative machinery available to them in support of such an agreement. Thedecision would be a difficult one; but the Government might forfeitthe confidence of the cotton industry if they were not prepared toact in support of a successful initiative by the industry which theGovernment had originally prompted.The Colonial Secretary said that the imposition of quota restrictions in support of such agreements would have far-reachingand unacceptable repercussions. It would not be possible to confine such restrictions to cotton piece-goods, and it would prove necessary to extend them, under pressure, to other finished manu-factures, which represented a much more serious problem. More-over, other Commonwealth countries were already anxious toimpose restrictions on imports of Asian manufactured goods and, ifwe set an example in this respect, the effects on the economy and theinternal security of Hong Kong could be serious. Finally, theimposition of import restrictions on Commonwealth manufacturers would appear singularly inapposite at a moment when we were engaged in the negotiation of a free trade area in Europe. in discussion it was suggested that a decision should be deferred until
the result of the negotiations between the Lancashire industry andthe industries in Pakistan and Hong Kong were known. In themeantime the possible courses Of action open to the Governmentshould be further examined.The Cabinet &apos;(1) Took note of C. (57) 61 and of the points made in their discussion.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange forfurther examination of the possible courses of actionwhich would be open to the Government in the event ofagreement being reached between the cotton industry inLancashire and the industries in Pakistan and HongKong for the voluntary restriction of exports of cotton piece-goods from those countries.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (57) 68) about salary increases for university professors, the lower judiciary and the Comptroller and auditor-General.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, with the agreementof the Prime Minister and in order to enable the universities to make arrangements in good time for the next academic year, he hadalready announced an increase in the salary of university professors,to take effect from 1st August. The increases for the lower judiciaryand the Comptroller and Auditor-General should not now be furtherdelayed and it was desirable that the Government should announceforthwith their intention to introduce Bills dealing with thesesalaries.In discussion some doubt was expressed about the timing of this legislation, and it was suggested that any announcement of theGovernments intentions should be deferred until the next interimaward to the doctors and dentists had been granted and it waspossible to assess more clearly the possibility of industrial unrestresulting from outstanding wage claims. It would not be possibleto give priority to the lower judiciary, whose claims were admittedlystrong, or to grant an immediate increase to sheriffs-substitutes inScotland, in spite of the fact that legislation would not be needed in their case. Further consideration of public service salaries,including those of Ministers and Members of Parliament, should therefore be deferred for the time being.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their discussion of improvements in public service salaries at a later date.6. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (C. (57) 65) covering a draft of the Economic Survey,1957.The Prime Minister said that he felt some doubt about the wisdom of including paragraphs 72 to 82 which discussed theposition of the United Kingdom as an international banker. these paragraphs would not necessarily make much impression on publicopinion at home; and it was arguable whether foreign confidence in sterling would be increased by this detailed analysis of ourmonetary assets and liabilities. The paragraphs should be recon-sidered from this point of view.
In further discussion it was suggested that paragraphs 93 and94 should be revised in the light of the latest information about there opening of the Suez Canal and the Iraq Petroleum Company&apos;spipeline.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to reconsider the text of the Economic Survey in the light of the points made in their discussion.(2) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange forthe publication of the Economic Survey as amended.Security of 7.   The Prime Minister said that on several recent occasionsCabinet there had been unauthorised disclosure of Cabinet decisions in theProceedings. Press. He was concerned at this apparent leakage of confidential information. He asked all Ministers to take steps to preventfurther unauthorised disclosure of Cabinet proceedings.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.Industrial 8.   The Prime Minister suggested that there might be someRelations.       advantage if the shipbuilding employers caused it to be known that,(Previous        while they were not prepared to enter into negotiations about any reference:      further wage increase at so short an interval after the last substantialC.C. (57) 19th   increase, they were ready to refer the present dispute to arbitrationConclusions,    and to accept the arbitrator^ award and that, in taking this course,Minute 2.)       they were aware that arbitration tribunals had recently tended togrant wage increases of the order of 3 to 4 per cent.   A statement ofthis kind, while not compromising the stand which the employershad hitherto taken, would indicate to the public that their attitude was not merely negative.The Minister of Labour said that the employers would not agree to make a statement of this kind. They had originally agreedto accept arbitration provided that the strike notices were withdrawn and that the terms of reference for the arbitrator were agreed between the parties to the dispute. They had now withdrawn thelatter stipulation and had agreed not merely to accept arbitrationbut also to give effect to the arbitrators award. It would be unreasonable to expect them to advance beyond this position solong as the unions maintained their present uncompromisingattitude. Representatives of the unions were to meet the chief industrial Commissioner on the following day; but there was as yet no sign that they were prepared to adopt a more conciliatory policy.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,15th March, 1957.
