Wages and prices.(previous references:CC. (57) 36thConclusions,Minute 3,CC (57) 38thConclusions,Minute 8.)1. The Cabinet had before them (i) a note by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C. (57) 117) covering a report by officials on theproblems involved in establishing an Advisory Council on price stability and (ii) a memorandum by the Minister of Labour(C. (57) 119) about the means of further consultation on this proposal with the Trades Union Congress (T.U.C.), the British Employers&apos;Confederation (B.E.C.) and the nationalised industries.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The T.U.C. had indicated unofficially that they wouldprobably be unwilling to be formally associated with the establish-ment of the proposed Advisory Council; but if its terms of reference were sufficiently widely drawn they might be persuaded grudginglyto co-operate in its work.(b) There were risks in establishing the Council on a more orless permanent basis or for a definite period of years. The fact thatit would be empowered to make pronouncements on questions of profits and dividends might be unacceptable to a section of the government&apos;s own supporters; and its activities might be embarrassing to the Government in other respects, e.g., if it choseto examine wider economic problems involving questions of budgetary and credit policy. It might therefore be wiser to constitute the Council on a basis which would permit the Government to amendits method of working if necessary, or even to bring it to an endentirely if it proved to be unsuccessful.(c) It might also be expedient to avoid giving the Council formalterms of reference but to allow it, at least initially, to operate on thebasis of more general directions which could be outlined in the government&apos;s statement announcing its creation and could, ifnecessary, be modified with less formality in the light of developments.(d) The emphasis of the CounciPs deliberations should be lesson stability and more on the positive aspect of the problem of wagesand prices, i.e., the importance of increasing productivity and creatinggreater real wealth in the economy. This might also be reflected inthe CounciFs title.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, whilethe Council might prove to be of psychological value as constituting a new and constructive approach to the problem of reconciling price stability and full employment, a problem for which none of theexisting advisory or consultative bodies had been able to devise asolution, the Cabinet would need to give further consideration tothe embarrassments which such a Council might create for theGovernment and the difficulty of providing it with a suitable mandate.The Cabinet should also consider further whether it would be wise to go forward with the appointment of such a Council if theco-operation of the T.U.C. was not in fact forthcoming. In thisconnection further thought should be given to the appropriate method of ascertaining the reactions of both sides of industry itmight, for example, be appropriate to make use of the economic planning Board for this purpose.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of-the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Minister of Labour, to arrange for officials, in thelight of their discussion, to re-examine the draft terms ofreference of the proposed Advisory Council on price stability and to consider how further unofficialapproaches on this subject would best be made to management and labour.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting in the light of the results of the further examination to beundertaken in pursuance of Conclusion (1) above.
Suez Canal. 2.  At the end of its meeting on the previous day the Council of(Previous        the Suez Canal Users&apos; Association (S.C.U.A.) had stated publicly that reference:       it was the general consensus of opinion of its members that theCC. (57) 38th Egyptian proposals for the use of the Suez Canal were insufficientConclusions,     and fell short of the six principles approved by the Security CouncilMinute 2.)      on 13th October, 1956.  The Council had also stated that, in so faras the use of the Canal was resumed by the shipping of member states, this would not imply their acceptance of the Egyptianproposals as a settlement of the Suez Canal question. Member Statesreserved their existing legal rights under the Convention of 1888 and otherwise with respect to the operation of the Canal.    Tworeservations to this statement had been publicly made.  The first, bythe French delegate, was that in the opinion of his Government itwas not possible in present circumstances to recommend the use ofthe Canal to member States.  The second, by the Spanish delegate,expressed the view that it was solely within the competence of theUnited Nations to decide whether or not the Egyptian proposals wereconsistent with the resolution passed by the Security Council on13th October, 1956.The Prime Minister said that, in the light of this communique, theCabinet must now decide what policy they would adopt about theuse of the Suez Canal by United Kingdom shipping. The public&apos;spreliminary reaction to the communique had been reasonably satisfactory, and the French reservation had attracted relatively littleattention-. An attempt to maintain indefinitely our present restrictions on the use of the Canal by United Kingdom snipping.; might be interpreted as a sign of weakness rather than of strength.It would also entail the risk that the Egyptian Government mightwithdraw their agreement to the arrangements which had been concluded between the Bank of England and the National Bank ofEgypt for the payment of Canal dues and ships&apos; disbursements by united Kingdom shipping in transferable sterling. Finally, it mightalienate the goodwill of the United States Government, since it hadbeen at our request that they had taken the initiative in making thesuggestion that ship-owners might resume de facto use of the Canalwhile reserving their legal rights. In these circumstances it seemed that the balance of advantage might lie in allowing United Kingdomshipping to resume transit of the Canal.In discussion there was general agreement that we had nowextracted the maximum advantage from the present situation and thatthe Egyptian proposals represented the best arrangements for theadministration of the Canal which we could hope to achieve in the short term. There was no possibility that an effective internationalboycott of the Canal could be enforced; and, in view of the increasing number of ships of other countries which were now using the Canal,our own shipowners and traders would be placed at a commercialdisadvantage if we continued to prohibit them from, enjoying thesame competitive facilities. The trade returns for April would revealan unwelcome increase in the adverse balance of visible trade, and wecould no longer afford to maintain an artificial obstruction to themaximum expansion of our exports.The Cabinet therefore agreed that it would be desirable that theGovernment should announce in the House of Commons on13th May that financial arrangements had been made with theEgyptian authorities which would enable United Kingdom ships to resume use of the Canal on the basis that the necessary payments would be made in transferable sterling. The statement should emphasise the substantial advantages which had been gained as aresult of the pressures to which the Egyptian Government had been subjected during the period in which we, in common with othermembers of S.C.U.A., had dissuaded shipping from using the Canal;and it should stress the importance which we should continue to attach to the achievement of a final settlement in full conformity with

It wastherefore desirable that we should at once inform those Governments,both in the Commonwealth and in other countries, that we weregrateful for their support and co-operation in the last few months,but that, in view of the terms of the communique issued by S.C.U.A.and the increasing extent to which shipping was in fact resuming useof the Canal, we no longer felt entitled to maintain our request that other countries should discourage their shipping from using the Canalroute; that we had good reason to believe that by 13th May financial arrangements would have been concluded with the egyptian government to enable transit dues to be paid in transferable sterling and that in that event we should on 13th May announce that we had withdrawn our advice to United Kingdom shipowners to avoid use ofthe Canal; and that we hoped that the other Governments concerned would at the same time announce that their shipping would no longerabstain from using the Canal.It would also be necessary, in advance of the parliamentary statement, for the National Bank of Egypt to be informed by the Bankof England that it would be convenient if their request for theopening of the new Egyptian account could be received in time forthe account to be opened by 13th May. If the Egyptian reply was satisfactory, the relevant Order could be made on the morning of13th May and published later in the day at approximately the sametime as the Governmenfs statement.At a later stage the Cabinet would need to consider thedesirability of allowing United Kingdom warships to resume use ofthe Canal, in the light of the existing relations between the UnitedKingdom and Egypt in terms of international law. An occasion ofthis kind would arise towards the end of the month, when a frigatewhich was due to leave the United Kingdom on 17th May would reach the Canal.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the commonwealth secretary and the Minister of Transport, to prepare and submit for the Prime Minister^ approval drafts of a parliamentary statement and of telegrams to otherGovernments on the lines agreed in the discussion.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for theBank of England to inform the National Bank of Egyptthat it would be convenient if the latter&apos;s request for theopening of the new Egyptian account could be received intime for the account to be opened by 13 th May.

(2) Authorised the Minister of Power to announce their decision in reply to a Parliamentary Question in the House ofLords on 14th May and to arrange for a similar announce-to be made by the Paymaster-General in the House ofCommons on the same day.4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (C. (57) 115) covering a report by officials on the claims of British subjects and enterprises whose assets and property in Egypthad been sequestrated, and submitting proposals both for pursuingthese claims with the Egyptian Government and for taking interimaction to meet the needs of individual claimants.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the claims in question would probably exceed  140 millions. The Egyptian authorities had intimated, during the recent financial negotiations in Basle, that they wished to discuss the re-instatement of facilities for ordinary commercial payments and it had been arranged that a further conference for this purpose should take place in Rome on 23rd May.This conference would provide an opportunity for ascertaining wether the Egyptian authorities would be prepared to release thegreater part of the sequestrated assets. If they adopted a whollyintransigent attitude on this subject it might prove necessary to appropriate the Egyptian sterling balances in this country which amounted, after excluding the sum due to be transferred to the sudan government, to some  85 millions, and to distribute these balancesto the claimants. This, however, must be regarded as a course of ultimate resort: it would be a formidable administrative operation,involving legislation of a kind for which there was no precedentexcept in the case of enemy property in time of war, and it would be liable to have serious repercussions on the international reputation of sterling. Moreover, there were no grounds as yet for assuming that the Egyptian Government would prove wholly unaccom-accommodating, and it would prejudice our prospects of establishing theclaims by negotiation with the Egyptian Government if weprematurely assumed responsibility for them by undertaking to makeadvance payments against the security of the sequestrated assets.There might be rather less objection to making advances against assetsphysically in this country and to making special arrangements in thecase of the employees of the Suez contractors. It would be advisable,however, to defer making payments under either of these heads untilthe need for doing so could be assessed in the light of the progressachieved in the forthcoming negotiations in Rome. Meanwhile, thescope and scale of payments by the Anglo-Egyptian ResettlementBoard should be sympathetically re-examined.Discussion showed that the Cabinet, while in general agreementwith this view, felt that the Governmenfs responsibilities towards the contractors&apos; employees might be regarded as being on a different footing from their responsibilities towards the other claimants. Thesemen, many of whom had realised their assets in this country on beingposted to Egypt, were virtually in the position of public servants, andthe Government were under a strong moral obligation towards them,especially in the context of the Anglo-French operation against egypt. Their claims amounted in total to about  600,000, of which about  500,000 was attributable to personal effects, the balancerepresenting funds on deposit in Egypt. It was agreed that no action should be taken as regards claims in the second category untilthe results of the forthcoming negotiations in Rome could be assessed.It would, however, be justifiable to accord a special priority to theclaims of the contractors&apos; employees in respect of personal possessions,and arrangements for this purpose should be examined, although no public announcement of the Governmenfs intentions should be madein advance of the opening of the negotiations in Rome. It would be important that any payments made under such arrangements shouldbe regarded as ex gratia compensation, and should not be interpreted as establishing a precedent for interim payment against assets.
7 CC. 39 (57)In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) If it ultimately became necessary to concede advances againstsequestrated assets, it would not be possible to adapt the Anglo-Egyptian Resettlement Board to fulfil this function. It would be prudent therefore to create without delay the nucleus of an organisation which, if need arose, would be capable of such a task,employing staff which could be made available by the Board of trade for this purpose.(b) The Government statement about the Suez Canal on13th May, together with the disclosure of the payments arrangements which had been negotiated with Egypt, would provoke a revival ofinterest in the claims of those who had suffered financially from the suez dispute. Steps should be taken to represent to Lord Killearn, asthe spokesman of the claimants, the desirability of refraining from pursuing this matter in Parliamentary discussion until the negotiations in Rome had made some progress.The Cabinet (1) Approved, subject to the points made in their discussion, theproposals in C. (57) 115.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Secretary of State for War, to arrange for an examination of the possibility of making ex gratiapayments of compensation to the employees of the Suezcontractors in respect of personal possessions and effectsbut not of funds on deposit in Egypt, on the assumptionthat no public announcement of the Government^intentions in this respect would be made and no compensation would be paid in advance of theforthcoming negotiations with the Egyptian Governmentin Rome.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe President of the Board of Trade, to examine thepossibility of creating a nucleus organisation which wouldbe capable, if need eventually arose, of making advances to British subjects and enterprises against assetssequestrated in Egypt.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Commonwealth Secretary, to consider advisingLord Killearn to refrain from pursuing the claims ofBritish subjects in Parliamentary discussion until thenegotiations in Rome had made some progress.New Zealand. 5.   The President of the Board of Trade said that during theTrade Talks, current trade discussions the New Zealand delegation had reactedadversely to our refusal to impose a quota on Argentine meat, andhad discounted the value of our alternative offer of an undertakingnot to impose quotas against dairy products from New Zealand fora period of at least ten years. The delegation had subsequentlystated, that New Zealand might now find it necessary to re-negotiatethe Ottawa Agreements and to reduce the preferences accorded to united Kingdom manufactures entering New Zealand to levelscomparable with those which we had negotiated with Australia inthe previous year. This proposal could be attributed partly to domestic political considerations, and partly to a desire not to appearat a disadvantage in the matter of preferences in comparison with australia. On the other hand the New Zealand Government wereconfronted with a real problem of surplus agricultural products.They took the view that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Tradeoffered little advantage to New Zealand, and they appeared to beexploring the possibility of negotiating bilateral agreements,including an agreement with Japan, in which they would be assisted
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,10th May, 1957.by a substantial reduction in existing preferences. Nevertheless, the preferences which we enjoyed in New Zealand, at an average levelof 20 per cent., were more valuable than those which we had previously enjoyed in Australia, and their reduction to a level of -J-10 per cent, would inflict serious damage on our export trade. Itmight therefore be necessary to ask the Prime Minister to intervene in the discussions if the New Zealand Government could not be diverted from their present proposal.The Commonwealth Secretary confirmed that the proposal ofthe New Zealand Government to re-negotiate the ottawa agreements was motivated primarily by domestic political considerations. Nevertheless, we should not be able indefinitely to withstand pressure to reconsider these Agreements. In presentcircumstances it might be advisable to intimate that we were preparedto conduct exploratory discussions on this subject, with a view toentering on substantive negotiations early in the following year.The Cabinet-Invited the President of the Board of Trade to keep theminformed of further progress in the trade discussions withthe New Zealand delegation.
