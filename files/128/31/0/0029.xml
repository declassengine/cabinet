Since the Amalgamated Engineering UnionMinute 3.) &apos;    had 500,000 votes and the National Union of General and MunicipalWorkers had 95,000 votes, it was clear that these two unions had,in effect, determined the majority view and that the bulk of thesmaller unions had favoured the continuance of the strikes. It would,however, be at least a week before the first report from the Courts ofEnquiry would be available, and it was doubtful whether, after thatinterval, it would be practicable for the unions to reinstate strikeswhich did not seem to have aroused much enthusiasm among themen.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement.Egypt.Suez Canal.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 28thConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The Foreign Secretary said that the United StatesGovernment had just received a reply to their latest communication to the Egyptian Government. This appeared to be whollyunsatisfactory. They intended to send a message expressing theirdisappointment and giving the Egyptian Government an opportunityto modify their attitude. It was unlikely, however, that the egyptian government would be prepared to do so and we should shortly need to decide how we should deal with the situation which had nowemerged.The French Government had already intimated that, if theEgyptian reply did not adequately safeguard the six principlesadopted by the Security Council on 13th October, 1956, they would refer the issue to the Security Council. At the same time, however,they hoped that we and the United States Government would jointhem in a tripartite declaration to the effect that Canal dues shouldbe paid to the Bank of International Settlements, not under protestbut on condition that the Bank should remit 50 per cent, to theEgyptian Canal Authority, 5 per cent, to the Egyptian government as royalty, and 25 per cent, to an improvement fund, and shouldblock the remaining 20 per cent, until agreement had been reached, inaccordance with the six principles, about tariffs, improvements,arbitration and compensation. The response of the egyptian government to a declaration of this kind would be a test of their intentions. If they rejected the six principles outright, the FrenchGovernment proposed that the declaration should be abandoned and that the issue should be referred to the Security Council on thebasis of the Egyptian failure to comply with the six principles. Ifwe and the United States Government felt unable to adopt thiscourse, the French Government might be obliged ultimately to followus, but they were not prepared to participate in what they would regard as a tripartite retreat.In discussion there was general agreement that we had no meansof compelling the Egyptian Government to accept our requirementsapart from economic pressure which would, in any case, take a
The Cabinet-(1) Agreed to resume their discussion at a later meeting.(2) Approved, in principle, the proposals in C. (57) 85 about themethod of reinstating facilities for current paymentsbetween residents of the sterling area and Egypt.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to defer action onthese proposals for the time being and to seek the PrimeMinisters approval to the appropriate moment for theirimplementation.considerable time to become effective. The issue should therefore bereferred to the Security Council, preferably on the initiative of theUnited States Government. If discussion was blocked by the Sovietveto, the matter could then be raised in the General Assembly. Ifwe failed to obtain an adequate majority in the General Assembly,it would be necessary to invite the United States Government to implement their undertaking at the Bermuda Conference to condemnpublicly the action of the Egyptian Government and to organise themaximum of economic pressure on Egypt. It might also be desirable,in these circumstances, to reconsider our own policy towards theUnited Nations.But it would be necessary to decide also the extent to which weenvisaged that, while discussions were proceeding in the united nations, British ships should use the Suez Canal and the method bywhich Canal dues should in that event be paid. It would be unwise toadopt, in either respect, an attitude which we could not sustain. Atpresent British ships were being advised to refrain from using the canal and the ships of other nations were being influenced in thesame direction. It was unlikely that this voluntary boycott of the canal could be continued much longer; but it should be maintained for as long as possible; and, if it broke down after discussions hadbeen begun in the United Nations, our position would be lessindefensible in the eyes of public opinion than if we had consented to our shipping resuming the use of the Canal while making no further attempt to organise international pressure on the egyptian government.Payments to On this hypothesis it might become necessary in the near futureEgypt. to resume the payment of port charges and other ships&apos; disbursements.If a new No. 3 Account was opened for this purpose, on the lines suggested in the note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (57) 85)it should receive also the Canal dues. Moreover, it would be in theinterests of our international trade that this Account should also beused for current payments from Transferable Account countries andfrom the rest of the sterling area, and for current payments by our owntraders provided that the Egyptian restrictions on payments to theUnited Kingdom were withdrawn. No indication should, for themoment, be given to the Egyptian Government or the National Bankof Egypt that v/e contemplated arrangements of this kind; but weshould be ready to put them into effect when it became necessary toindicate our policy about the payment of Canal dues. It was forconsideration, however, whether, shortly after the issue had been referred to the Security Council, we should make it clear, preferably in conjunction with the United States and French Governments, thatwe would pay Canal dues only under protest or with &quot; doubleblocking&quot; of a corresponding portion of the Egyptian sterling balances, and should seek to persuade other users of the Canal toadopt a similar course. The &quot; double blocking &quot; of Egyptian assetsmight prove an embarrassment in the long term; but the payment ofthe Canal dues under protest might not be without value if it waspossible to organise the Suez Canal Users&apos; Association as the channelthrough which all users of the Canal would deal with the EgyptianCanal Authority on this basis.

(57) 8thConclusions,Minute 2.)EuropeanCustoms andEconomicUnion.nationalised industries.(previous reference:CM. (56) 22ndConclusions,Minute 8.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Power (C. (57) 82) submitting proposals about the price policy of the fuel and power industries. They also had before themmemoranda by the Minister of Transport and the President of theBoard of Trade (C. (57) 83 and 86) on the implications of theseproposals for the British Transport Commission and for the exporttrade.The Minister of Power said that the fuel and power industries should be allowed to increase their prices to an extent which would permit them both to cover the current deficits arising from increases in wages and other operating costs and to make adequate provisionfor the maintenance, replacement and normal improvement of their capital assets. This would entail price increases varying from 4 percent, to 10 per cent., designed to yield  92 millions to meet increased costs and an additional  48 millions to meet capital requirements.These increases would be equivalent to a rise of 0-7 per cent, in thecost of living; but, if they were not brought into effect, the exchequer would be compelled to advance equivalent amounts and the consequential Government borrowing would be no less inflationary.Although his proposals would result in the railways incurringincreased costs for coal, it was not essential, in his opinion, that theTransport Commission should be obliged to follow precisely thesame price policy.3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C. (57) 81) covering a report by officials about theassociation of overseas territories with the European Customs andEconomic Union and the European Industrial Free Trade Area.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Customs andEconomic Union Treaty provided for the association of French and belgian overseas territories with the Customs Union on terms whereby the six countries concerned would gradually establish a common tariff against imports.from the rest of the world, while their tariffsagainst imports from French and Belgian overseas territories, andthe tariff of the French overseas territories against goods from therest of the six countries, would be reduced on a discriminatory basis.It was necessary therefore to consider, in the light of the damage which our exports and those of our Colonies would probably sufferas a result, whether it would be to our advantage to continue ourattempt to negotiate, in the Organisation for European economic co-operation, an industrial free trade area, excluding all overseas territories, while seeking adjustments in the. arrangements of theCustoms Union to mitigate the harm to the interests of ourselves andour Colonies; or whether we should attempt to expand our association with the new European grouping to include either ourAfrican territories or, possibly, the whole of the Commonwealth.In discussion it was agreed that the first of these two courses wasto be preferred. The damage which it might inflict on UnitedKingdom and Commonwealth interests was likely to be relativelylimited; whereas the second course, whichever form it took, would necessitate the investigation of very complex issues which would notonly retard the negotiation of the industrial Free Trade Area but might also prejudice our ability to maintain the position which wehad taken up on the exclusion of agricultural products. Moreover,it was emerging that the majority of our own Colonial territories were at present averse from participating in a free trade area; and itwould be wise, in any event, to be cautious in associating ourselves with French proposals which might appear to be directed to the exploitation of Colonial resources in Africa.The Cabinet Endorsed the proposals in C. (57) 81.
ffaCyprus.(previous reference:CC. (57) 25thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet had agreed that are-examination of the future value of Cyprus as a British militarybase should be carried out. The implications of a partition of the island, however, transcended purely defence considerations, and he now proposed that a review of these implications should be conducted by a small Steering Committee, representative of theDepartments concerned, under the chairmanship of the Secretary ofthe Cabinet. It would be appropriate that it should include an examination of the scope for reducing forthwith further expenditureon military works in the Island.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement.The Minister of Transport said that he did not dissent from theview that the nationalised industries should be obliged to cover theiroperating costs. But the proposal that they should also be requiredto meet from revenue a much greater proportion of their capitalneeds would have serious consequences for the railways. They wouldbe compelled to make substantial increases on traffic generally,coupled with very heavy increases on selected traffics. It might benecessary, for example, to raise the charges for certain coal trafficby as much as 50 per cent. Increases of this magnitude would imply a clear departure from the existing policy of price restraint and mighthave serious consequences.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the price policy of the nationalised industries should be examined in the wider context ofthe inter-relation of prices and wages. He would prefer to postponeconsideration of this complex subject until after the Budget, whenboth he and the Minister of Labour proposed to circulate memoranda on the question.In further discussion it was noted that, in order to coverincreases in operating costs, the Transport Commission would in any event wish to lodge with the Transport Tribunal forthwith anapplication to enable them to continue to maintain the current 3d.minimum fare in London after the temporary additional duty on fuelhad been withdrawn. Any such action would be represented,however, as a serious breach of faith with the public, for which theGovernment would be held partly responsible. It would be preferable that the Transport Commission should reduce theminimum fare to 2\d. as soon as the additional duty on fuel wasremoved, and should then apply forthwith to the Transport tribunal for authority to restore the 3d. minimum fare in order to coverincreased operating costs resulting from the wage award which hadbeen made while the additional duty was in force.The Cabinet (1) Agreed to resume their consideration of C. (57) 82, 83 and 86at a later meeting.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister ofLabour to circulate memoranda on the relationship between prices and wages.(3) Invited the Minister of Transport to be guided by the views expressed   during   their   discussion   about   the   3d.minimum fare.
