Soviet Union. 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that the Soviet Union wereEarth Satellite, seeking to focus world opinion on the military implications of the earth satellite which they had recently launched. It was undesirable that we should appear to be unduly concerned about theseimplications; and our attitude should, therefore, be primarily oneof welcome to a notable scientific contribution to the InternationalGeophysical Year. It would be advantageous, from this point ofview, if a representative body of scientific learning in this country,such as the Royal Society, would send a message of congratulationto the appropriate body in the Soviet Union in these terms.The Cabinet Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to arrange for asuggestion to be conveyed to the Royal Society that theyshould send a message of congratulation to the appropriate body in the Soviet Union on the scientific achievementrepresented by the successful launching of an earth satellite.3- The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the paymaster-General (C. (57) 222) on the forthcoming negotiations forthe creation of a European Free Trade Area, together with fourCC (57) 37th hither memoranda by the Paymaster-General (C. (57) 218, 219, 220Conclusions, and 221) covering reports by officials on various aspects of the minute 4, and negotiations.Conclusions^ The Paymaster-General said that the United Kingdom objectiveMinute 1.) &apos; at the forthcoming meeting of Ministers of member countries of theOrganisation for European Economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.)would be to secure the effective resumption of negotiations for thecreation of a European Free Trade Area. There were still widedivergencies between the views of the United Kingdom and those ofthe Six Powers, and protracted discussion would be necessary before these divergencies could be reconciled. We could count, however,on a degree of political support from certain of the Six Powers,particularly Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. Italy, thoughreluctant to expose her economy to competition, was also attracted by the Free Trade Area project for political reasons. The FrenchGovernment, on the other hand, could be expected to seek to repeat,in the Free Trade Area negotiations, the tactics by which they hadCommercialPolicy.(previous references:Foreign Affairs. 1. The Foreign Secretary said that the situation in the middle east appeared to be developing, for the time being, to the advantageof Syria. Moreover, the Soviet Union were clearly embarking ona new campaign of political and economic warfare in the middle east; and, if we were to resist this pressure, we must be prepared tocontribute a share of the resources which the free world would haveto deploy for this purpose. It was for consideration whether someof the expenditure which we at present incurred in respect of suchdefence arrangements as the North Atlantic Treaty organisation would be more profitably diverted to countering the Soviet economicthreat in the Middle East. It would also be necessary to review our policy towards Egypt in the light of the new situation which was nowdeveloping.In discussion there was general agreement with these views. Itwould be particularly important to maintain the close contact withthe United States Government which had now been re-established and to ensure that the joint measures to be adopted to arrest theSoviet penetration of the Middle East were fully discussed and agreed between the United States and ourselves.
secured, in the discussions leading up to the signature of the Treatyof Rome, substantial concessions in favour of French domesticindustry. Of the other members of O.E.E.C., the scandinavian countries, Switzerland, Austria and Portugal held views broadly similar to our own, although Denmark was faced with special problems in respect of agriculture which might lead her to join theEuropean Economic Community if no satisfactory arrangements inconnection with trade in foodstuffs were made in the context of theFree Trade Area. The Irish Republic, Iceland, Greece and Turkeywere favourably disposed towards the Free Trade Area in principle,provided that they were not expected to accept immediately the fullobligations of membership.Three major issues were likely to arise in the course of thenegotiations:  (i) Agriculture. We were committed to the exclusion ofagriculture from the scope of the Free Trade Area. It was nowproposed, however, that, simultaneously with the negotiations forthe creation of the Free Trade Area, discussions should proceed onthe possible extension of European co-operation on agriculturalquestions. This proposal, which was compatible with our insistencethat agriculture should be excluded from the Free Trade Area, should suffice to enable the Free Trade Area negotiations to begin.(ii) Rules of Origin. Members of the Free Trade Area wouldnot maintain a common tariff against countries outside the area.As a result United Kingdom traders, selling their goods in france in competition with French manufacturers, would have been able toobtain their raw materials duty free, whereas the Frenchmanufacturers would have had to pay the common tariff charged by members of the Common Market. The degree of difficulty whichthis problem would present in negotiation would depend on theextent to which the Six Powers, particularly France and Italy,proposed to impose high tariffs on raw materials. If the FrenchGovernment were intransigent on this point, the negotiations wouldbe seriously endangered.(iii) Dependent Oversea Territories. We had decided that, inprinciple, these territories should not be associated with the free trade Area. But developments in the context of agriculture and during the forthcoming session of the Contracting Parties to theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) might make itnecessary to review this decision in due course.Our representatives at the GATT discussions should seek, inparticular, to ensure that the Contracting Parties would not approve the Treaty of Rome without imposing conditions for the review, as necessary, of its provisions relating to agriculture and requiring the six Powers to make concessions designed to mitigate the damagethreatened to third countries, including our own Colonies. But weshould avoid, if possible, confronting the Six Powers with the need to choose between membership of the Common Market andmembership of GATT since, in that event, they would probably resignfrom GATT.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Germany and the Netherlands probably desired a liberalform of Common Market, for both economic and political reasons,while France and Italy would prefer arrangements of a highlyprotectionist character. This division between the members of theEuropean Economic Community reduced the danger that the institutions of the Common Market might dominate those of theFree Trade Area. Nevertheless, it was desirable that the institutions of the latter should compare favourably with those of the common market and should be sufficiently comprehensive and authoritative toensure that the economic leadership of Europe would not pass intothe control of the Common Market.
The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement that the United Kingdom representatives inthe forthcoming negotiations in the O.E.E.C. and the GATT shouldbe guided by the considerations outlined in the memoranda underdiscussion.As regards agriculture, it might be possible in due course to achieve some alleviation of the difficulties of Commonwealth and colonial countries by using, to their advantage, the techniques ofbulk purchasing and long-term contracts which were a feature of the policies of the Six Powers. Our proposals on agriculture should not,however, be given the title of a &quot; Statute &quot; but should be described in more general terms as a charter or agreement.We should pay particular attention to the formal aspects of theFree Trade Area, and should seek to secure that its institutions were(b) We could not afford to rely on a failure by the Six Powers tomake the European Economic Community effective. Despite thedifficulties which they faced, they had a common political purpose and would make very considerable efforts to ensure its realisation.(c) The other members of the Commonwealth were concerned about the damage which the Common Market might inflict on their trade, particularly in the case of foodstuffs, where the Six Powersenvisaged bulk-purchasing and other arrangements designed to benefitthemselves and their oversea territories. We should thereforeencourage Commonwealth Governments to play a leading part in theforthcoming GATT discussions. The support of the United states should also be sought in the GATT examination of the Treaty of rome. Without provoking the Six Powers to retaliate by adopting a hostile attitude to the Free Trade Area negotiations, we should seek to prolong the GATT discussions, to ensure that the arrangements ofthe Six Powers would be effectively and continuously supervised byGATT and to secure adequate mitigation of the damage which would otherwise be caused to the trade of our Colonial territories.(d) There was general agreement that in the forthcoming negotiations in O.E.E.C. the agricultural issue should be handled onthe lines proposed in C. (57) 219, and that any further concessions onthe lines of those outlined in the Annex to that memorandum would undoubtedly provoke considerable criticism from, other members ofthe Commonwealth. But, while the European countries wereprepared reluctantly to accept our special relationship with theCommonwealth, they would probably attack our domesticagricultural policies and we might be pressed to accept a more fundamental adjustment of those policies than was now envisaged.We should have to resist proposals designed either to effect a reductionin our own agricultural output or to diminish the Governmenfscontrol of agricultural policy. We should therefore seek to persuade the other European countries to accept assurances that it was not our purpose to increase the share of our domestic agriculture in theUnited Kingdom market for foodstuffs and that member countries of the Free Trade Area could rely on the maintenance of their existingshare in our market.(e) It would be unwise to exaggerate the technical difficultieswhich would arise during the negotiations in comparison with theeconomic and political advantages which we should derive fromtheir successful conclusion. Commonwealth Finance Ministers had recognised, at their recent meeting, the importance, both to theCommonwealth and to the free world, of a positive outcome of this movement towards closer economic association in Europe. Weshould emphasise, in the public presentation of our proposals, thatthe Free Trade Area would be complementary to, not inconsistent with, the greater degree of Commonwealth economic co-operation which we hoped to achieve.
East-west trade.Copper Wire.(previous reference :CC. (57) 13thConclusions.Minute 7.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (57) 223) covering a report by officials on a request bythe United States Government that we should collaborate in proposing that the embargo on the export of copper wire to the soviet union should be reimposed.The Foreign Secretary said that the Soviet Union were buyingcopper wire primarily as a means of evading the embargo on theexport of copper metal to countries in the Soviet bloc. The UnitedStates Government were anxious to secure our collaboration inclosing this loophole. Even if the commercial considerations involvedmade it impracticable for us to agree to a total embargo on exportsof wire, we ought not to pursue a policy in direct opposition to thatof the United States Government until we had discussed with them the scope of the controls over strategic exports which it was desirable,in the light of current strategic thinking, to seek to enforce. In themeantime our exports of copper wire should be reduced below theirpresent level.In discussion it was suggested that it was very doubtful whether any military advantage was to be gained by attempting to limitsupplies of copper wire to the Soviet Union, particularly in view ofthe current depression in the copper market, which was causing considerable anxiety to Commonwealth producers. But, although itwas desirable that we should review, with the United StatesGovernment, the strategic criteria by which exports of materials tothe Soviet bloc were at present assessed, it was not in our interest toadopt, in the interval, an entirely independent course, and it wouldbe justifiable to meet the wishes of the United States Governmentto the extent of undertaking to limit the amount of copper wirelicensed for export to the Soviet Union in the next period of sixmonths to the amount licensed in the first half of the current year,namely 30,000 tons.The Cabinet (1) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to arrange for thequantity of copper wire licensed for export to the soviet bloc in the next period of six months to be restricted to30,000 tons.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for the issues involved in seeking to maintain strategic controls overexports of copper and copper wire to the Soviet bloc to bediscussed with the United States Government as soon aspossible.invested with at least as much dignity and authority as those of theEuropean Economic Community. In general, discussion of our proposals should be elevated to the plane of major political decision,and the Free Trade Area should be presented as a project which, sofar from conflicting with our special relationship with the othermembers of the Commonwealth, was designed to strengthen and consolidate the political and economic resources which the free world as a whole could deploy against the Sino-Soviet bloc.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the President ofthe Board of Trade and the Paymaster-General to be guided,in the forthcoming negotiations in the Organisation for european Economic Co-operation and the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, by the considerationsoutlined in C. (57) 218, 219, 220, 221 and 222 and the points made in the Cabinefs discussion.
Civil Aviation.IndependentAirlines.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 43rdConclusions,Minute 10.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Civil Aviation (C. (57) 224) proposing that two air transport companies, air work and Hunting-Clan, should be allowed to makea night stop at Luxor on their services to Nairobi and Salisbury andthat the necessary payments to the Egyptian authorities should bemade in transferable sterling from the No. 1 Special Account.The Minister of Civil Aviation said that it was important thatno unnecessary obstacles should impede the development of the government&apos;s policy of encouraging the expansion of the independentair transport companies and their use of more modern aircraft. Theservices to Nairobi and Salisbury which air work and Hunting-Clanhoped to introduce in the near future were, however, dependent, for technical reasons, on arrangements being made to enable the aircraft to stop overnight at Luxor; and it was therefore desirable thatthe companies should be allowed to finance the cost, amounting toabout  1,600 a week, through the No. 1 Special Account. The same considerations were likely to arise in the case of Central AfricanAirways, operating services from the Central African Federation.The Government of the Federation would probably adopt whateverpractice we ourselves authorised as regards payment to the egyptian authorities.In discussion it was suggested that, in view of the forthcomingresumption of financial discussions with representatives of theEgyptian Government in Rome, a decision on this issue should be deferred until it was possible to judge from the tenor of those discussions whether it would be possible and desirable to revert to more normal financial and commercial policies towards Egypt.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at a subsequent meeting, in the light of the result of theforthcoming financial discussions with representatives of theEgyptian Government in Rome.EconomicSituation.(previous reference :C.C. (57) 69thConclusions,Minute 1.)AllegedLeakage ofInformation.6. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of exchanges whichhe and the Financial Secretary, Treasury, had had with opposition leaders regarding their suggestion that a formal enquiry should beheld to establish whether there had been any premature leakage ofinformation about the increase in the Bank Rate on 19th September.When this suggestion was first put forward on 24th September,enquiries were at once made of the responsible City authorities andthese disclosed no evidence, either in the operations on the gilt-edgedmarket or otherwise, to suggest that there had been any leakage ofthe intention to increase the Bank Rate. Mr. Harold Wilson, M.P.,had then been informed, with the Prime Ministers authority, thatthe Government saw no sufficient grounds for holding a formalenquiry. On 4th October, however, Mr. Wilson sent a further letter,in the course of which he stated that prima facie evidence had beenbrought to his attention suggesting that a leakage had occurred froma political source. To this the Prime Minister had at once repliedthat, if this evidence was made available to him, he would ask theLord Chancellor to consider whether it afforded sufficient grounds for further investigation. On 7th October Mr. Wilson and Mr. JamesGriffiths had called on him and had revealed the nature of thisevidence without, however, disclosing the identity of the persons concerned; and they had asked that, as it pointed in their view to apolitical source, it should be referred for examination, not to theLord Chancellor, but to a Judge of the High Court.   The Prime
Minister had felt that it would be wrong to appear to accept the implication that the Lord Chancellor might not take a whollyimpartial view of this evidence, and he had felt obliged to reject thesuggestion that it should be examined instead by a Judge of theHigh Court. He had therefore sent a further letter to Mr. Wilsonasking him to arrange for the evidence to be made available to theLord Chancellor. To this letter Mr. Wilson had not so far replied.The Cabinet Noted, with approval, the action which the Prime minister had taken in this matter.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,8th October, 1957.
