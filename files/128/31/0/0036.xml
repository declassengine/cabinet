Suez Canal. 1.   The Foreign Secretary said that the recent discussion in the(Previous        Security  Council   of  the  Egyptian  proposals   for   the  futureReference:      administration of the Suez Canal had satisfactorily identified theCC. (57) 35th inadequacies of these proposals, while at the same time it had allowedConclusions,    the suggestion to be advanced that international shipping should minute l.)      resume use of the Canal on an interim basis, without prejudice to theultimate settlement.  The position which had now been reached was due to be considered by the Council of the Suez Canal UsersAssociation (S.C.U.A.) in London that afternoon.  It was probablethat most of the members of the Association, with the exception ofthe French, would be in favour of allowing their shipping to resumetransit of the Canal on this interim basis, and that few of them would see  advantage  in  prolonging  negotiations  with  the  egyptian government or in attempting to organise an effective boycott of the canal.In discussion it was suggested that it would not be to our advantage that shipping should begin to use the Canal again on an appreciable scale until we had made satisfactory arrangements withthe Egyptian authorities for the payment of Canal dues by british shipping in transferable sterling. Our proposals had beentransmitted to the National Bank of Egypt, who had replied that theywere prepared to regard them as an appropriate basis for further discussion, but had intimated that they would wish this discussion toextend to certain aspects of the Egyptian No. 1 account. If thequestion of payment was raised in the S.C.U.A. discussions, theAssociation could be informed in general terms of the arrangements which we favoured. But they should be warned that these arrangements had not yet been agreed with the Egyptian authorities;and we should emphasise that we were not prepared, in any event,to allow British shipping to resume even interim use of the Canal onthe strength of Egyptian proposals for its administration which hadbeen unilaterally put forward and could be unilaterally withdrawn.It would be necessary therefore to require the Egyptian Governmentto provide, at the resumed discussion in the Security Council, some more definite assurance about the status of their proposals whichwould safeguard shipping against the risk of their being abruptlywithdrawn. If the main body of opinion in S.C.U.A. could bedissuaded from accepting the Egyptian proposals as an adequateinterim arrangement until these further discussions in the security council had taken place and if, in this interval, our own negotiationswith the Egyptian authorities for the payment of Canal dues byBritish shipping in transferable sterling could be completed withoutany appearance of undue haste on our part, it should be possible toreach a position in which international shipping would graduallyresume use of the Canal, on an interim basis, without any formal act of acceptance of the Egyptian proposals.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of theExchequer to be guided, in the subsequent discussions inthe Security Council and in S.C.U.A., and in the financial negotiations with the Egyptian authorities, by the general sense of their discussion.Oil supplies and Prices.(previous reference:CC. (57) 34thConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The Minister of Power said that the oil companies had intimated to him that, as an earnest of their intention to remove theemergency surcharge of 3\d. a gallon as soon as petrol rationing wasdiscontinued, they were ready to make a reduction of Id. a gallon inthe price of petrol forthwith. Subject to his colleagues&apos; agreement, he proposed to concur in this reduction.51870-1The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement.b 2
*4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (57) 103) about wages, prices and the pound sterling.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the internalpurchasing power of the pound sterling had fallen from a value of20s. in 1948 to a value of about 14s. to-day and must be expected to fall still further unless our economic policy was drastically changed.Jordan.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 35thConclusions,Minute 2.)GeneralSituation.EconomicSituation.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 2ndConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Foreign Secretary said that King Hussein appeared tobe retaining political control of Jordan and that, although his militaryhold on the country was more precarious, he hoped to be able toarrange for the withdrawal of the Syrian contingent in the nearfuture. The situation in Jordan therefore represented a seriouschallenge to the prestige of the Egyptian Government and the maindanger was that they might feel bound to intervene in order tomaintain their position among the Arab countries. On the otherhand the United States Government were now firmly committed tothe support of King Hussein; and it was also clear that theGovernment of Iraq were prepared to intervene if necessary tomaintain the King in power. The United Kingdom should allow theUnited States to take the lead in this area and should continue the orderly withdrawal of British troops in accordance with the agreed programme.In discussion it was suggested that it would be politicallydesirable to indicate that the United Kingdom had been informed inadvance of the recent action by the United States Government insupport of King Hussein, in order to show that there was effectiveAnglo-American co-operation in the Middle East.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Foreign Secretary.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider whether it would be advisable to indicate publicly that we had received priornotification from the United States Government of their recent action in support of King Hussein.Over-flying The Minister of Defence expressed concern about the delay inRights. concluding the proposed agreement on over-flying rights for british aircraft in Jordan. At the time of the negotiations for the terminationof the Anglo-Jordan Treaty the then Prime Minister of Jordan had undertaken that these rights would be granted in a subsequentexchange of letters. This exchange had not yet taken place and. the lack of over-flying rights meant that British aircraft had to use longerroutes on journeys to the Middle East and Far East owing to thepresent air barrier between Syria and Egypt.In discussion it was suggested that there was probably little doubt that in the long term the Jordan Government would beprepared to grant over-flying rights to British aircraft in order toobtain reciprocal rights for Jordanian aircraft in British territory suchas Cyprus. A premature request on our part might thereforeprejudice or delay this agreement. On the other hand,, the presentJordan Government appeared favourably disposed towards theWest; and King Hussein would be unlikely, at the present juncture,to refuse a request of this kind. It was important that this matter should be settled before British troops finally withdrew fromJordan.The Cabinet (3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider whether a further approach should now be made to the Jordan government about the grant of over-flying rights for British aircraft in jordan.
Of the factors which had contributed to increasing prices on this scale by far the most significant was the increase in wage costs.Between 1948 and 1956 incomes had risen by 75 per cent, ascompared with an increase of only 28 per cent, in output. The effectof price increases on this scale was damaging both at home, wherethey fell with particular severity on fixed incomes and on savings, andabroad where they encouraged apprehension that it was merely amatter of time before the pound was devalued again. If the progressive decline in the value of the currency continued unchecked,a further devaluation of the pound would indeed be inevitable. Onthe other hand a policy of deflation, if it was to be effective inarresting wage inflation, would need to be so severe as to create a level of unemployment which would be politically unacceptable. Apolicy of compulsory wage fixing could not be recommended, except as a feature of a fully-planned society. Subsidies were both costlyand unless matched by high taxes, dangerously inflationary. It wastherefore necessary to seek some alternative approach to the problemof wages and prices. Having accepted responsibility for full employment, the Government could no longer adopt a purely passiveattitude towards wage problems and towards the processes of collective bargaining which were traditional in industry but mustsecure that increases in wages fell within the range of what the economy had earned from its own productive efforts. For thispurpose the Government might announce from time to time theamount of wage increases which they regarded as consistent withprice stability and they should adhere to that figure until the nextoccasion for a further wage increase arose after a defined period. Itwould be advisable to create a new independent body which wouldbe responsible for ascertaining&apos; how much, in terms of the expectedaverage increase in productivity for the country as a whole, the economy could afford for increases in remuneration; and theGovernment would then need to regard themselves as committed to endorse the findings of this body in terms both of those wage settlements which they directly controlled (e.g., in the Civil Service),and of those settlements (e.g., in the nationalised industries) whichthey influenced by advice and guidance.This approach to the problem would raise a series of questions,indicated in paragraph 22 of C. (57) 103, which would need furtherconsideration. Officials should be instructed to investigate theseurgently. In the meantime the first step towards the new policy could be taken by a Government statement welcoming therecommendation made in the Reports of the Courts of Enquiry intothe disputes in the shipbuilding and engineering industries that an authoritative and impartial body should&apos; be established to considerthe wider economic problems involved in the inter-related factorsof wages, costs and prices. Thereafter the establishment of this body,its composition, its terms of reference, and other aspects of its work should be discussed with the leaders of both sides of industry at! ameeting at which the Government should seek to emphasise afreshthe gravity of the present situation and the need for a newco-operative effort to achieve price stability and restraint in respectof personal incomes.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The economic outlook need not necessarily be interpreted asunfavourably as was implied in C. (57) 103. Our exports were rising,and until recently we had succeeded in keeping the cost of livingrelatively steady for a considerable period and in restricting wage increases to a level of 3 or 3\&apos; per cent. The ratio betweenunemployed and vacancies was now more satisfactory than for sometime past and the Government^ monetary policy was clearlyoperating effectively to reduce the inflationary pressure. From thispoint of view it would be relevant to ascertain how the presentrelation between prices, costs and incomes compared with the similarrelation in the years before the war.
(b) No new wages policy would be successful unless the present condition of over-full employment was brought to an end. So longas this condition persisted employers would continue tp competefor labour, and wages would, as a result, continue to rise. Therelative success of certain other countries in maintaining price andwage stability was due mainly to the higher levels of unemployment which they were prepared to tolerate.(c) If the Government were to regard themselves as committed to endorse the findings of the proposed impartial body, they would need to be able to employ effective sanctions against attempts tosecure wage increases which were not justified by the new criterion.But so long as they felt unable effectively to resist the threat of strike action by a major industry, the sanctions necessary to the new policy would be lacking. If this&quot; policy was to have any chance of success,it would be necessary first to ensure that the Government could maintain essential supplies and services throughout a strike. an enquiry into this problem was already in hand in. relation to a railway strike. It should be expedited and extended to cover the possibilityof a coal strike.(d) It was far from certain that the impartial body would be ableto agree upon a figure corresponding to the expected average increasein productivity for the country as a whole. Nor would a single figurerepresenting an average increase in productivity be equally applicableboth to industries in which the increase in productivity might beexpected to be greater than the average, and to those occupations(for example, the medical and teaching professions) in which, bytheir nature, it could not be expected to be statistically ascertainableat all. But the latter would claim to benefit from the average increasein productivity as of right, while the former would justifiably claima wage increase exceeding the average increase in productivity; andthe final result would be a higher increase in total remuneration thanthe real increase in productivity would justify. The figure establishedby the impartial body would become, in effect, not an averagecriterion of wage increases but a minimum for fresh wage bargaining.The effect would be to increase the inflationary pressure, andincidentally to impede the redeployment of labour which it should bethe Governments policy to foster.(e) In a year in which output had hardly increased at all, as in1956, little, if any, increase in wages should be permitted by the newtheory. But it was very doubtful whether the Government would beable to sustain this argument, particularly since it could be urged,with some reason, that it was largely the Governments own creditpolicy which had prevented an increase in productivity.(/) If the attitude of the Government to any particular wagesdispute was in effect predetermined by the findings of the impartialbody, no room for manoeuvre would remain in which the conciliation machinery of the Ministry of Labour could operate with flexibility;and this valuable feature of our system of industrial relations wouldbecome ineffective.It was the general view of the Cabinet that, for the reasonsindicated above, it might be unwise for the Government to adopt apolicy whereby they would become automatically committed to endorse a specific figure of expected increase of productivity as the single criterion for increases in remuneration throughout the economy.On the other hand a standing advisory body, charged with theresponsibility of investigating the problems involved in the inter-relation of wages, costs and prices, might provide a valuable meansof educating public opinion about the implications of wage increases and of securing that the national interests involved in the settlementof wage claims were impartially and authoritatively presented.Officials should therefore be instructed to consider, as a matter of urgency, how such a body might be constituted and what the scope
7 CC. 36 (57)of its functions might be, taking into account the experience of certain other European countries which operated, or had attempted to operate, similar systems of wages settlement.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for officials to examine, as a matter of urgency, the problems involved in establishing an advisory body on the lines indicated in their discussion.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to circulate, in a form comparable with the appendix to C. (57) 103,particulars of movements in the purchasing power of the pound and of changes in incomes, real output and costs in the years before the war.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange that theenquiry into the Governments ability to maintain essential supplies and services during a transport strikeshould be expedited and that its scope should be extendedto comprise also a strike in the coal mining industry.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Labour (C. (57) 102) on the disputes in the shipbuilding and engineering industries.The Minister of Labour said that the Reports of the Courts ofEnquiry into these disputes would be published on 2nd May. their main recommendations were (i) A wage increase of 5 per cent, without conditions or,alternatively, a wage increase of 6^ per cent, coupled with theconditions about stabilisation and productivity which were underconsideration when the earlier negotiations had broken down. the stabilisation condition would provide that no fresh wage claim shouldbe put forward within twelve months of the date of agreement; andthis would probably mean that, owing to the procedural delays in negotiation, no fresh wage increase would be granted for abouteighteen months.(ii) The formation of National Joint Councils with regular meetings, and the improvement of the existing procedure for dealingwith disputes.(iii) The establishment of an authoritative and impartial body to consider the wider economic problems involved in the inter-relatedfactors of wages, costs and prices.In the light of their general discussion on wages policy, recorded in the preceding minute, the Cabinet agreed that the Governmentshould refrain from seeking to influence the attitude of industry tothe first of these recommendations. The second recommendationmight prove to be valuable, and should be generally supported. Thethird recommendation, which was in effect an endorsement of an earlier recommendation by the 1954 Engineering Court of Enquiry,would need to be carefully considered before the Government couldannounce the precise terms in which they would propose to give effectto it. It would, however, be desirable to indicate the governments acceptance of the proposal in principle without delay; and astatement should therefore be made, on the publication of theReports, indicating that the Government welcomed thisrecommendation, that they were already giving it urgent consideration, and that this would involve discussions with the leadersof the two sides of industry both in the public and in the private sector.industrial disputes.shipbuilding and Engineer-ing Industries.(previous reference:CC. (57) 29thConclusions,Minute 1.)
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,30th April, 1957.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Labour to arrange for a statement on the lines approved in their discussion to be issuedsimultaneously with the publication of the Reports of theCourts of Enquiry into the disputes in the shipbuilding and engineering industries.
