commonwealth economic(previous reference:CM. (56) 38thConclusions,Minute 7.)1.   The Cabinet had before them :  (i) A memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(C. (57) 131) on the extent to which the United Kingdom could afford to assist economic development in the Commonwealth in thelight of the limitations on our resources for both internal and externalinvestment.(ii) A note by the Secretary of the Cabinet (C. (57) 129) covering reports prepared by the Committee on Commonwealth economic development on the provision of capital and technical assistance for commonwealth development.(iii) A memorandum by the Colonial Secretary (C. (57) 130) onthe provision of loan finance for Colonial development.The Prime Minister said that these memoranda indicated thatit might be necessary for the United Kingdom Government to takestatutory power to make Exchequer advances to colonial governments who could not raise sufficient finance in the london market for their capital programmes. The United KingdomGovernment could not, however, sustain a regular system of govermental capital assistance to the independent members of theCommonwealth. The Colonial Development Corporation (C.D.C.)should therefore concentrate its attention on the Colonial territories and should refrain from investing in new projects in commonwealth countries after they had attained independence. It should, however,be&apos; allowed to second members of its expert staffs to assist in themanagement of new projects in newly-independent countries and,on occasion, to undertake itself the management of particularly important projects of this kind.As a result of this review of Commonwealth development it was clear that there was no scope for the establishment of any new commonwealth organisation for the co-ordination of economic development in the member countries. There might, however, be advantage in strengthening the Commonwealth EconomicCommittee; and, in order to ensure that such resources as we couldspare for Commonwealth development were used as productively aspossible, the Commonwealth Development Finance Company(C.D.F.C.) should be encouraged to expand its activities and toestablish closer links with the work of those banking houses whichoperated throughout the Commonwealth.It would be desirable that United Kingdom policy on commonwealth economic development should be explained at theforthcoming Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers. Thisshould emphasise the magnitude of the development programmes to which Commonwealth countries were committed, the effort whichthe United Kingdom were already making to provide capital for thispurpose, the importance of the part which could be played by privateinitiative in the form of development and finance corporations, andthe value of the technical assistance which we were able to offer tothe Commonwealth, particularly in the development of nuclear energy. It would be useful if, at much the same time, a White paper on Commonwealth development could be published, defining the government&apos;s policy and emphasising the extent of our existing capital investment in the Commonwealth.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The gradual loosening of the other ties which bound together the members of the Commonwealth made it increasingly important that its economic links should be strengthened as far as possible.While the Prime Ministers of the Commonwealth should not be encouraged to entertain exaggerated hopes of the additional financial support which the United Kingdom could provide for their development programmes, the proposed White Paper should emphasise that we were already applying to commonwealth development resources equivalent to 1 per cent, of our gross national product. The assistance which we should in future be able to offer to other Commonwealth countries would tend increasingly to take51760-3b 2
the form of technical advice and services; and the White Paper shouldstress the value of the facilities which we could make available in thisrespect.(b) If these facts were to capture the public imagination, theyshould be presented in as vivid and constructive a manner as possible.There might be advantage in linking the publication of the proposed white Paper with a new appeal to the public to increase the volumeof saving available for financing Commonwealth development by,e.g., subscribing to a new issue of National Savings Certificates. this possibility should be further examined.(c) The proposal that statutory power should be taken toprovide loans from the Exchequer for the financing of colonial development could be criticised on the ground that it would diminishmarket support for loans issued by Colonial Governments themselves and would tend to weaken the credit of Colonial borrowers inLondon. On the other hand, in so far as the proposal would tendto relieve apprehension about the capacity of the market to absorbloans issued by Colonial Governments, it would tend to simplify the financing of Colonial development programmes. It would bepossible, however, to defer the introduction of the proposed legislation, provided that Colonial Governments could be assured that they could continue to give effect to the development programmes to which they were already committed, on theunderstanding that, if Exchequer advances were needed to supplement market issues, the United Kingdom Government wouldbe prepared to obtain the necessary statutory authority to make suchadvances.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the recommendations made inC. (57) 131.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Commonwealth Secretary and the Colonial Secretary,to prepare a draft statement about United kingdom policy on Commonwealth development, to be made by united Kingdom Ministers at the forthcoming Meeting of commonwealth Prime Ministers.(3) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and the colonial secretary, to prepare a draft White Paper on the contribution made by the United Kingdom to commonwealth development.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to re-examine thepossibility of publicising Commonwealth development asan incentive to national saving.Public Service. 2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the PrimeSalaries. Minister (C. (57) 133) setting out revised proposals for increases in(Previous certain public service salaries, together with a draft ParliamentaryReferences:     statement on this subject.CC. (57) 16th The Prime Minister said that the proposals which the cabinet conclusions, had previously considered had been revised after further carefulMinute 5, and consideration. If the Cabinet approved them in their present form,CC (57) 4lst he proposed, after arranging for the necessary consultations with conclusions, Mr. Speaker and the Opposition Leaders, to make an earlyMinute 2.)       announcement of the Governmenfs intentions.It was the general view of the Cabinet that the revised proposals would probably be welcomed by the Opposition and should be acceptable to the Governmenfs own supporters, provided that it wasmade clear that, the increase in the remuneration of Members ofParliament was directly attributable to the inescapable expenses of membership.
In discussion ot the detailed proposals the following points weremade:  (a) Allowance for PeersIt was desirable that Peers should be entitled to claim the allowance in respect of expenses incurred in connection withattendance at the House of Lords, without liability to taxation or having to account for their expenditure in detail. For this purpose,the allowance must be, in principle, a subsistence allowance,corresponding broadly to the similar provision which was made for public servants. It would defeat this objective if the allowance was increased to  4 or  5 a day, since such a figure would be held tocomprise an element of taxable remuneration. It should thereforebe fixed at three guineas a day.(b) Members of ParliamentWhile the total remuneration of Members of Parliament, less any claim which could be made for expenses, would remain liable to taxation, it was important that the proposed additional provision of 750 a year in place of the sessional allowance should be presented in a manner which would minimise the risk of its beingmisrepresented as merely a net addition to salary. For this reason,it would be wise to avoid the use of the expression &quot; expensesallowance,&quot; which tended to be interpreted by public opinion as constituting, in effect, a tax-free addition to salary. It would be preferable to make it clear, that, in the Governments view, the salary of a Member of Parliament should remain unchanged at  1,000; butthat, having regard to the finding of a Select Committee in 1953 thatthe average expenses of a Member of Parliament amounted to 750 a year, it would be appropriate to institute a Parliamentaryallowance of this amount in place of the present sessional allowance;and that this allowance would be liable to tax (as was the basicsalary of  1,000), subject to deduction of Parliamentary expenses.It was agreed that the proposed announcement should be redraftedin this sense, and should also indicate that the Government had rejected, as being inconsistent with the traditions of the House ofCommons, the alternative possibility of following the practice ofcertain other countries in providing centralised secretarial services for members of Parliament.(c) Senior MinistersA moderate increase in the total remuneration of senior ministers could be justified to public opinion as a measure whichwas long overdue and was not out of keeping with the greaterincreases proposed for members of the Boards of nationalised industries. A satisfactory arrangement for improving the remuneration of all Ministers must comprise some increase in the basic salary. Ministerial salaries should therefore be increased from 5,000 to  6,000 a year, a Minister in the House of Commons beingentitled to draw, in addition, his Parliamentary allowance of  750 ayear.(d) Junior Ministers and Parliamentary SecretariesIn view of the fact that junior Ministers were unable to claimtax relief for the additional expense of living in London, an increaseof  1,000 in their basic salary would leave an inadequate marginbetween their remuneration and that of Members of Parliament. Itwould be justifiable, therefore, to increase the salaries of junior ministers by  1,250 rather than  1,000, resulting in total emolumentsof  5,000 for Ministers of State and  3,500 for parliamentary secretaries.
(e) Mr. Speaker and Officers of the two Houses of parliament the existing parity between the salary of a senior Minister andthat of Mr. Speaker should be maintained; and it should be suggested to him that his official salary of  5,000 should be increased by  1,000,the present tax-free allowance of  4,000 remaining unchanged. the salaries of the Chairman of Committees in the House of Lords andthe Chairman and Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means in theHouse of Commons should be increased by  1,250 rather than  1,000(as in the case of junior Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries) thetwo officers in the House of Commons being entitled to receive,in addition, the new Parliamentary allowance of  750.(/) Leader of the OppositionIt would be appropriate to provide a total remuneration of 3,750 for the Leader of the Opposition, comprising a salary of 3,000 and a Parliamentary allowance of  750. The present leader of the Opposition should be invited to consider this proposal.(g) Injury warrant the exclusion of Ministers of the Crown and their dependantsfrom the benefits of the Injury Warrant System in the event of theirdeath or injury while on duty was an anomaly which should nowbe corrected. It might also be justifiable to provide similar protection for Members of Parliament, although it would be necessary, in their case, to define whether this protection should be confined tooccasions when they were commissioned by the House of commons to act in a representative capacity on behalf of the House as a wholeor should be extended to include the discharge of their ordinaryParliamentary duties. It might be impracticable, in any event, tobring Members of Parliament within the scope of the Injury Warrant;and further consideration should be given to the possibility of devising a scheme of insurance for this purpose. It would bedesirable that any arrangement which might be agreed should beincluded in the forthcoming legislation.(h) TimingThe necessary action to give effect to the Governmenfs proposals should be initiated as soon as possible after the Whitsun recess, inaccordance with a time-table which would provide for the necessary consultations with Mr. Speaker, the Leaders of the opposition parties, the Chairman of the Select Committee which had enquiredinto the question of Members&apos; expenses, and the governments supporters.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the proposals in C. (57) 133, subject to the points made in their discussion and to the qualification that the salaries of junior members of the Government should beincreased by  1,250 rather than  1,000 a year.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, would arrange for the draft parliamentary statement annexed to C. (57) 133 to be revised on the lines agreed in their discussion.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation with theHome Secretary and the Chief Whip, would arrange forthe necessary preliminary consultations to be undertaken,with a view to announcing the Governmenfs proposals as soon as possible after the Whitsun recess.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to give furtherconsideration to the possibility of providing some protection for Members of Parliament analogous to theterms of the Injury Warrant, in the event of their deathor injury on duty, and to incorporate in the forthcominglegislation any scheme which it might be practicable to devise for this purpose.
3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (57) 134), proposing that he should announce that day in the House of Commons, by means of thestatement annexed to his memorandum, that the present travel allowance of  100 would be extended to include travel in the dollar area, particularly in the United States and Canada, and that theimport restrictions on many industrial raw materials and metalsemi-manufactures (with the exception of leather) and on certainagricultural products would be withdrawn on 1st July. *The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that no travel allowance had been available in respect of dollar countries since the end of thethe war and that it would be in the interest of good relations betweenthe English-speaking peoples that the allowance should now beextended to include the dollar area, particularly since the cost was likely to be small. This proposal would be particularly welcome tothe Canadian Government. The removal of import controls on alarge number of industrial commodities would also be to theadvantage of this country, since it would enable our manufacturers to compete on more equal terms with other European countries where these controls had already been withdrawn. The resultantdiversion to dollar sources of supply might add some   12-  13 millions to the cost of our dollar imports, but the addition to the cost of our imports as a whole should not exceed  3 millions. The net increasein the total cost of imports by the Colonies should not be more than about  1 million. The independent members of the sterling area would probably follow our example to some extent, although thecost on this account could not be predicted.In discussion it v/as agreed that the time was now opportuneto introduce a dollar travel allowance. Some doubt was expressed,however, about the proposed relaxations in the import of industrialraw materials. Further consideration should be given to the probable effects of this proposal both on our balance of payments and on theinterests of producers of the commodities in question in this countryand in the Colonies. It was also for consideration whether we shouldrelax our restrictions for the benefit of dollar exporters at a timewhen the United States, so far from giving effect to the progressivecommercial policies which they purported to endorse, had recentlyimposed a tariff on woollen imports. In these circumstances it wouldbe advisable to establish more clearly that, if our import controlswere relaxed to the extent which was proposed, the result would, on balance, be to the national advantage.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to announce inthe House of Commons that day that the travel allowance of  100 would be available in future for travel to the dollar area, including Canada.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would inform the PrimeMinister of Canada of this decision.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the President of the Board of Trade, to arrange forfurther consideration to be given by the Economic PolicyCommittee to the proposal to discontinue import controls on certain industrial and agricultural commodities.dollar expenditure.Imports andTourism.Cabinet Office, S.W.L4th June, 1957.
