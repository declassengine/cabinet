1. The Cabinet had before them a note by the colonial secretary (C. (57) 71) to which was annexed the draft of a statement,prepared at a meeting of Ministers held by the Prime Minister on15th March, in which the Government would announce their intention:  (i) To accept in principle the offer by the Secretary-General ofthe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) to use his good offices in the search for an acceptable solution of the differences which existed between the Governments of Greece, Turkey and the UnitedKingdom about Cyprus.(ii) To summon, at an early date, a conference in London of theleaders of the various Cypriot communities in order to make further progress towards the introduction of internal self-government in cyprus on the lines of Lord Radcliffe&apos;s recommendations.(iii) To inform Archbishop Makarios that the leader of EOKAhad stated in a recent leaflet that his organisation would suspend its operations as soon as the Archbishop was released; that theGovernment assumed that in this new situation he would be willingpublicly to recommend the cessation of terrorist activity; that, in that event, they would be ready to bring to an end his detention in theSeychelles and would raise no objection to his taking his place as amember of the conference to be held in London; but that they must reserve to themselves the decision on the appropriate time when itwould be possible to allow him to return to Cyprus.The Foreign Secretary said that the Turkish Government, whohad been informed of our intention to make an announcement onthese lines, had expressed strong objections on grounds both ofprocedure and of substance. On procedure they felt that, in viewof the short notice which we had given them, we were merelynotifying rather than consulting them. On substance, they could see no advantage in our attempt to separate the internal from theinternational aspects of the Cyprus problem. The latter should, they felt, be pursued in the light of the United Nations resolution calling for negotiations between the three Governments concerned. the handling of the internal aspect of the problem should, in their view,be determined by the fact that the Government of Cyprus were now making steady progress in the suppression of terrorism and that itwould be a sign of weakness to embark on any further discussions with the leaders of the Greek community in Cyprus or withArchbishop Makarios until terrorism had been finally eradicated.In discussion there was general agreement that the offer of theSecretary-General of NATO should be accepted, and that the TurkishGovernment should be informed that we saw, and hoped they would see, advantages in pursuing the international aspects of the cyprus problem through NATO rather than the United Nations.It was recognised that it was unlikely that the Secretary-general would succeed in his attempt to devise, by means of the conciliationprocedure, a solution acceptable to the three Governments involved.But this attempt might throw further light on the possibility ofa partition of the Island, and a more detailed examination of theadvantages and disadvantages of partition from our point of viewshould therefore be put in hand as a matter of urgency. In the mean-time, however, we should not allow ourselves to be put into a positionin which, while opinion in NATO might be moving towards partition,we ourselves should simultaneously be envisaging, in our response to the EOKA leaflet, discussions with the leaders of the Cypriotcommunities directed towards further constitutional advance withinthe Island as a single political entity. It might, therefore, be wise to temporize in our treatment of the EOKA leaflet and to wait until we could judge what results the NATO conciliation procedure was likely to achieve before reaching a decision about the future internal administration of Cyprus.51460-1 , b 2Cyprus.(previous reference :C.C.

Statement on defence, 1957.(previous reference:CC. (57) 17thConclusions,Minute 3.)*2. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Minister ofDefence (C. (57) 69) covering a draft of a White Paper giving an outline of future defence policy.The Prime Minister said that the White Paper was designed toset out in greater detail the new defence policy which he had alreadyoutlined to the Cabinet. It was important that this policy should notbe presented in such a way as to reflect unfavourably on the record of Conservative Governments since 1952 or to alarm our allies in western European Union (W.E.U.), to whom the progressiveelimination of National Service would come as a surprise. Theopening section of the White Paper should therefore be replaced bya longer introduction which would make it clear that the objective of our defence policy remained, as it had always been, themaintenance of compact and efficient fighting Services, but that themethods by which we should best attain this objective required radicalreappraisal in the light of current strategic considerations.The Minister of Defence briefly reviewed the main provisions ofthe White Paper, emphasising that, if the Services were to be mannedin future by regular recruits, conditions of service would need to beOn the other hand, it would be unwise to allow our policy forCyprus to be determined by NATO. We could not afford to ignore the probable effect on public opinion, both at home and abroad, ifwe made no response to the EOKA leaflet. There would, however,be advantage in omitting from the proposed announcement any reference to our intention to hold discussions on further constitutional advance with the leaders of the Cypriot community and inemphasising that we were concerned less with the future ofArchbishop Makarios than with the effective surrender of the presentleaders of EOKA in Cyprus itself. For this purpose the statement should be amended to make it clear that, if terrorism ceased forthwith,we should be prepared to allow the leader of EOKA and his principalsupporters to leave the Island under a safe conduct, and that, if the archbishop would publicly associate himself with the cessation of terrorism, he would be released from the Seychelles, although the timing of his return to Cyprus would be a matter for subsequent consideration. At the same time, while remaining on guard againstrenewed outbreaks of violence in Cyprus, we should refrain fromlaunching any major offensive against the terrorists.The exact wording of such a statement would, however, need careful consideration, having regard to its probable effect on opinion among the Governments own supporters, the troops in Cyprus, andthe Turkish Government.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Defence to arrange for are-examination of the future value of Cyprus as a british military base and of the implications, from this point ofview, of a partition of the Island.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to revise the draft announcement on the lines agreed in their discussion,and to circulate it for further consideration by theColonial Policy Committee at a meeting on the followingr --. ,day-\ (3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to instruct Her Majesty      H- ^ -\        Ambassador at Ankara to inform the Turkish Governmentthat we had reconsidered our policy in the light of their\       representations and were now contemplating a statement on the lines of the revised draft indicated at Conclusion (2)V........ above.____________.....
substantially improved in certain respects, and some additional expenditure on this account would be inevitable. It would also bedesirable to indicate in the White Paper the date by which we hoped to complete the elimination of National Service.In the course of a general discussion the; Cabinet reaffirmedtheir approval of the broad lines of the new defence policy. its presentation would need careful consideration, however, and in thisconnection the following points were made:  (a) The White Paper reflected a fundamental revolution in our defence policy, which might have far-reaching effects on our influence in world affairs and on our ability to maintain our position in themore remote Colonial territories such as Hong Kong.(b) The impact of our proposals on the North Atlantic treaty organisation (NATO) might be unfortunate. NATO was the centralpivot of our system of defence as a whole, and we should therefore seek by consultation to convince the other member countries ofthe advantages of our new policy. We should oppose any suggestionthat the proposed reduction in our naval forces would warrant thetransfer of certain NATO naval Commands to other countries.(c) A reduction in military establishments on the scale indicatedin the White Paper would give rise to considerable problems in theServices themselves, particularly in those branches which weremanned predominantly by technical personnel recruited by NationalService. The effect of the new policy on industry, particularly fromthe point of view of the unemployment which might result from the cancellation of contracts, would also need to be carefully reviewedfrom time to time.(d) It was for consideration how far our allies in W.E.U. shouldbe informed in advance about our intention to bring National service to an end. Provided that we made an adequate contribution to thedefence of Europe, the decision on the means by which we recruitedthe necessary forces lay with us and not with the other member countries of W.E.U. Nevertheless it would be advisable to give them some indication of our intentions shortly before the white paper was published.(e) The announcement of the withdrawal of two Territorial Armydivisions as reinforcements for NATO would not be very opportuneat the present moment. The extent to which Territorial Armyformations should be available for emergency service overseas should perhaps be reconsidered in the light of experience during the Anglo-French operation against Egypt.(/) The reference to Cyprus should be carefully considered inthe light of the current discussions about future policy for the Island.(g) The White Paper should include a reference to the need forclose collaboration with the other Members of the commonwealth in the development of our defence policy.(h) The proposed reduction of our forces in the Far East wouldmake it more difficult for us to discharge, in respect of bur colonies in that area, the responsibilities for their defence which we should retain even when they had attained a large measure of self-government.(/) The treatment of civil defence in the White Paper would need further consideration, particularly in the light of the statement thatthe great cities could not at present be protected against nuclearattack.(/&apos;) It was unlikely that all the transport aircraft needed for theCentral Reserve could be provided by Transport Command; and the relevant passage in the White Paper might be amended to leave morescope for the contribution which could be made by air chartercompanies.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the general principles of the new defence policy outlined in the draft White Paper annexed to C. (57) 69.
3. The Minister of Labour informed the Cabinet of the most recent developments in connection with the disputes in the ship-building and engineering industries and in the railways. In his view,the Governmenfs aim must be to prevent these three separatedisputes from merging into a common struggle waged in the threeindustries simultaneously, with the risk that the dispute would thenspread to other industries. The immediate objective should thereforebe to isolate the dispute in the railways and to seek to secure asettlement there. The Railway Wages Tribunal, as arbitrators, were due to announce their award on 20th March and arrangements shouldbe made for the Chairman of the British Transport Commission andthe union leaders to meet immediately thereafter.The shipbuilding employees were showing little enthusiasm forthe strike, and there was some reason to hope that after a time itwould be possible to bring the two sides together.The engineering employers had rejected the union&apos;s wage claim-before it had been tabled and the unions were known to be opposedto arbitration. While efforts would be made to bring the parties together, it must remain to be seen, in these circumstances, whetherand when these efforts would be successful.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement.The Cabinet. 4.
