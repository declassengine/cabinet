Steel.(previous reference:CM. (56) 25thConclusions,Minute 8.)Location ofNew Works.1. The Secretary of State for Scotland said that ScottishMembers of Parliament of both Parties were anxious that the PrimeMinister should receive a deputation to urge the importance ofselecting a site in Scotland for a proposed new steel strip mill. Inview of the increasingly uncertain prospects of the jute and shale-oilindustries, Scottish opinion was concerned that the Government asa whole should be seized of the arguments for placing this newproductive capacity in Scotland.The Minister of Power said that the company concerned,Richard Thomas and Baldwin Limited, had reached the provisionalconclusion that, on technical grounds, the new works should be at newport and that no Scottish site would offer comparable advantages.Representations on behalf of West Wales as well as Scotland hadalready been made to him and to the President of the Board of Trade,and, if the Prime Minister were to see a Scottish deputation, it wouldbe desirable that a corresponding opportunity should be provided fordeputations from all the competing districts, including Lincolnshire,to state their case.The Prime Minister said that, in view of the scale of this project and of the Governmenfs financial interest in Richard Thomas andBaldwin Limited, it would be desirable to satisfy public opinion thatthe competing claims of different regions had been given full consideration. He was prepared, therefore, to receive deputationsconsisting of Members of Parliament representing East Wales,Scotland, West Wales and, if need be, Lincolnshire. It would benecessary to make it clear to the deputations that while, pendingde-nationalisation, the ownership of the company involved remainedvested in the Government, it would not be justifiable for theGovernment to override the company&apos;s commercial judgment in the selection of the most suitable site for the installation of new capacity.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange to receivedeputations of Members of Parliament representing west wales, Scotland, East Wales and possibly Lincolnshire,about the location of new steel works by Richard thomas and Baldwin Limited.Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week. In the course of theBusiness Statement on the following day it would be announced thata recess of two weeks was proposed for Whitsun.House ofLords Reform(previous reference:CC. (57) 41stConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Home Secretary said that he had examined thepossibility of enacting, before the summer recess, a Bill to reform theHouse of Lords on the lines suggested in the Cabinet&apos;s last discussionof this subject. To fulfil this time-table the Bill would need to beintroduced in the House of Lords on the following day. Even so,it would have reached only the Committee stage in the House ofCommons by the last week of July, and it would not be possible tocomplete Report and Third Reading unless these stages were taken after .10 o&apos;clock or the adjournment of Parliament for the summer recess was postponed until 3rd August. If this was unacceptable, itmight be necessary to defer the final stages in the House of Commonsuntil Parliament reassembled for the end of the current session inthe autumn, and there was a risk that in the interval the question would become the subject of undesirable debate at the annual LabourParty Conference during the recess.In discussion it was urged that it would probably be necessary,in any event, for the Government to introduce, before the recess,proposals for increasing the remuneration of Members of Parliament51570-6 B 2
and junior Ministers and for introducing payment for attendance atsittings of the House of Lords, and that it would be unfortunate to lose the opportunity of dealing more or less simultaneously with the reform of the Upper House. On the other hand, it had been ascertained that the leaders of the Opposition would be prepared todeal with the question of payment for the discharge of parliamentary duties on its merits and would not expect that the issue of payment for attendance in the House of Lords should be linked with proposalsfor the reform of that House. Moreover, even the one-clause bill which was now envisaged would provide considerable scope for amendment in the House of Commons; and it would be inexpedient to introduce a Bill of this nature at short notice without anyintroductory debate in the House of Lords and without any assurance that it could be enacted without congestion of theParliamentary time-table and inconvenience to Members of theHouse of Commons. It would be wiser, therefore, to defer theintroduction of the Bill until the following session.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the introduction of the Bill to reform the Houseof Lords should be deferred till the following session.(2) Invited the Lord President to seek to persuade the sponsorsof the forthcoming debate in the House of Lords to agreethat this debate should be postponed until the last fewweeks of the current session in the autumn.Nigeria. 4.   The Cabinet had before them:  (i) A note by the Colonial Secretary (C. (57) 120) covering amemorandum on the constitutional development of Nigeria.(ii) A note by the Lord Chancellor (C. (57) 122) to which was annexed a revised version of the draft declaration of policy includedin the Colonial Secretary&apos;s memorandum.(iii) A further revision of the draft declaration, circulated bythe Colonial Secretary during the discussion.The Colonial Secretary said that at the Nigerian constitutional conference in 1953 his predecessor had found it necessary to declare that in 1956 Her Majesty&apos;s Government would grant to those regions of Nigeria which desired it full self-government in respect of all matters within the competence of the Regional Governments. Atthe forthcoming Conference the spokesmen of the East and WestRegions would undoubtedly demand the fulfilment of this undertaking. The Northern Region, on the other hand, had intimated that they did not desire regional self-government until1959. But it was not certain that they would maintain this attitude in view of the fact that the Federal House of Representatives had recently adopted, with the support of the Northern members, aresolution demanding independence for the Federation as a whole,within the Commonwealth, in 1959. In these circumstances, andin the light of the political immaturity of Nigeria, the Governmentwere now faced with a difficult choice. Either they must concedeindependence too soon and risk the disintegration of Nigeria and acritical breakdown of administration; or they must seek to delay the grant of independence, in which event they would provokeincreasing animosity and disturbance and would be unable, whenindependence was eventually conceded, to influence Nigerian policiesthereafter. If, as was probable, it became necessary for theGovernment to make a fresh declaration of policy at some stage inthe Conference, it would in his view be appropriate that this statement should be on the lines of the alternative draft which hehad circulated during the discussion. This would make it clear thatif, when the life of the present House of Representatives came to anend in 1959, there was a clear wish on the part of the Nigerian people(previous reference:CM. (56) 48thConclusions,Minute 12.)
for early independence within the Commonwealth, the UnitedKingdom Government would confer with all the NigerianGovernments to determine the processes whereby this wish mightbe attained; and that these processes might well include theappointment of a Constitutional Commission, which would berequired to make recommendations for the framing of a constitution for a fully independent Nigeria, to review the working of governmentand of the constitution in both its federal and regional aspects inthe light of the experience gained since the forthcoming conference,and to consider the constitutional and other changes which would benecessary to enable the Federation to become eligible for full membership of the Commonwealth.In discussion there was general agreement that our objectiveat the forthcoming conference should be to seek to avoid any precisecommitment to grant independence to Nigeria by a specific date.The Government of South Africa were already inclined to question the right of the United Kingdom to promote Colonial territories to independent status within the Commonwealth without the consentof the other self-governing members. The Governments of Australiaand New Zealand had also shown concern about the increase in thecoloured members of the Commonwealth and the risk that theymight ultimately outnumber the older members. In Nigeria theissue was further complicated by the recent agreement with thePrime Minister of the Central African Federation that the decisionon the Federation^ attainment of full membership of theCommonwealth should be deferred until 1960. It was essential,therefore, that Nigeria should not achieve self-government until after1959. Moreover, it was not unreasonable that we should stipulate that an independent enquiry should be carried out by a constitutional commission before Nigeria could attain independence. experience had shown that the technical questions involved in a majorconstitutional operation of this kind were liable to be numerous and complex; and it would be optimistic to assume that after only a briefperiod of regional self-government the Nigerian peoples would becompetent to assume the responsibilities inseparable from full self-government on a federal scale. For this reason, it would be wise to limit any formal declaration of policy to the minimum of commitmentand to undertake no more than that we would confer in 1959 withall the Nigerian Governments to determine the processes wherebyNigeria might attain independence within the Commonwealth. Thenature of these processes and the period over which they wouldrequire to operate might be left for a subsequent and less formal statement.It would also be important that, in the process of grantingindependence to Nigeria, we should retain such strategic concessions,in terms of over-flying rights, the maintenance of staging posts, &amp;c,as were essential to the fulfilment of our defence policy.The Cabinet Invited the Colonial Secretary to be guided, in theforthcoming conference on Nigeria, by the general sense of their discussion.EducationalPolicy.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 8thConclusions,Minute 7.)Trainingof Teachers.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Education (C. (57) 123) recommending that a three-yeartraining course for teachers should be introduced in September 1960.The Minister of Education said that his proposals were designedto achieve the maximum of progress towards the Governmenfs twoaims of reducing the size of school classes and securing an improve-ment in the quality of teachers. 1960 would be the best year inwhich to introduce a three-year training course, since 1962, the year in which there would then be no output of teachers from the training
colleges, would also be the year in which the fall in the school population would be greatest. The proposed change, wheneverintroduced, would yield a substantial saving in teachers&apos; salaries, andhe had been pressed by the Home Affairs Committee to advance it to september 1959 on the ground that this would increase by anadditional  15 millions the saving which would accrue over the fiveyears 1961-65. But the educational result of this alternative proposal would be.to reverse, for the year 1961, the trend towards a reductionin the size of primary classes, which would be allowed to continueuninterrupted if the introduction of the three-year training course was deferred until 1960. Government spokesmen had repeatedlyaffirmed that progress in reducing the size of classes was impededonly by the shortage of teachers and accommodation and not by considerations of economy; and it would be inconsistent with these statements to advance the introduction of the three-year course to1959.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he did not contest theimportance of reducing the size of school classes and improving thequality of teachers, isut neither of these objectives would be substantially retarded by introducing the three-year course in 1959,while a saving of  15 millions, of which  9 millions would accrue tothe Exchequer, would constitute a significant contribution to thereduction of Government expenditure.In discussion it was emphasised that the introduction of a three-year training course for teachers might preclude for a long period thepossibility of attaining any other important objective in educationalpolicy, such as the raising of the school age or the creation of countycolleges. On the other hand, if an improvement in the quality of teachers was judged to be of over-riding importance, the decision whether to introduce the three-year training course in 1959 or in 1960should be taken primarily on educational, rather than on financial,grounds. This view was reinforced by the fact that the Governmenfsproposal to embody their contribution to the cost of education in theproposed general grant had already given rise to apprehension thatthe financing of the education service was to be subjected to further measures of economy.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, in acase where the issues v/ere so evenly balanced, it would be necessaryfor the implications of the proposal to be studied in greater detail.He would consider how this might best be done.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for an examination to be made of the detailed implications of theproposals in C. (57) 123.CivilAviation.(previous reference:CM. (55) 15thConclusions,Minute 5.)Viscountsfor Turkey.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Civil Aviation (C. (57) 124) about a proposal by theBritish Overseas Airways Corporation (B.O.A.C.) to invest a total of 2 millions in the Turkish National Airline (T.H.Y.) in order toenable that airline to procure Viscount aircraft.The Minister of Civil Aviation said that B.O.A.C. had negotiateda provisional agreement with the Turkish interests whereby theywould invest  500,000 in the equity of T.H.Y. and would also makethe company a loan of  1-1 millions secured on a debenture repayablein sterling over ten years. The advantages of this arrangement interms of civil aviation development and foreign policy were substantial, and the case for a favourable response to the proposal wasreinforced by the attitude adopted by the Turkish Government in granting over-flying rights to B.O.A.C. during the recent disturbances in the Middle East.   On the other hand, in view of Turkey&apos;s
7 CC. 42 (57)substantial and persistent sterling deficit, any sterling payments madeto the Corporation under the debenture could only be at the expenseof other United Kingdom creditors, and from this point of view theproposal was open to considerable objection. But unless the project was to be abandoned, or B.O.A.C. were to be pressed against their commercial judgment to invest the whole  2 millions in the equity ofT.H.Y., it would be necessary for the Government either to approve the provisional agreement between the Corporation and T.H.Y. andto accept the financial and commercial embarrassments which might result, or themselves to make a loan to the Turkish authorities on abasis which would defer repayments for a period of years, as hadbeen arranged in the case of the destroyers recently supplied to theTurkish Government.In discussion it was urged that there would be serious protests from Turkish creditors in this country if B.O.A.C. were, in effect,given priority in obtaining satisfaction of a commercial debt,especially since the insurance cover provided by the Exports credits guarantee Department had been almost completely withdrawn from commercial exporters to Turkey since 1955. On the other hand, theCorporation themselves would have no more security for the repay-ment of their debt than the guarantee attaching to the proposeddebenture, which the Turkish authorities might well prove to be incapable of honouring. Moreover, the political arguments in favourof a satisfactory agreement between B.O.A.C. and the TurkishNational Airline were strong; and, if the Corporation appeared to begaining too great an advantage over other Turkish creditors, it would always be possible to invite them to consider an arrangement wherebysome portion of their receipts might be made available in partialsatisfaction of other Turkish commercial debts.In further discussion it was agreed that the balance of advantage lay in authorising B.O.A.C. to finalise their provisional agreementwith T.H.Y. In order to demonstrate, however, that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment were not indifferent to the claims of Turkish creditorsin this country, the agreement should be coupled with an under-standing that arrangements for the progressive settlement of Turkishdebts would be maintained.The Cabinet-Authorised the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and. thePresident of the Board of Trade, to approve the proposal bythe British Overseas Airways Corporation to invest \ million in the equity of the Turkish National Airline andto make, in addition, a  1^ millions loan in the form of adebenture repayable in sterling over ten years, provided thatthis agreement was coupled with an understanding thatarrangements for the progressive settlement of Turkish debtswould be maintained.Suez Canal. 7.   The Minister of Defence said that a United States naval(Previous vessel would shortly be routed through the Suez Canal, and it was for reference: consideration whether we should now resume our normal practiceCC. (57) 39th of sending H.M. ships through the Canal whenever it was convenientConclusions, to do so. He proposed that, as an initial step, a Royal Fleet AuxiliaryMinute 2.)      vessel should pass through the Canal about mid-June and should befollowed by a frigate in July. The orders given to the first ship couldbe countermanded, if necessary, up to 6th June.The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that, while thepassage of a United States warship through the Suez Canal would notnecessarily establish a precedent for our own naval vessels, theEgyptian Government would have no legal grounds for refusing
passage to H.M. ships and were unlikely to do so. On the other hand,they might declare that they could accept no responsibility for anyincidents which might occur if a United Kingdom warship appeared in the Canal; and it would be desirable, therefore, to inform theEgyptian Canal Authority of our intentions well in advance of thedate of the ship&apos;s arrival in the Canal in order to ascertain theprobable reactions of the Egyptian Government.In discussion there was general agreement that it would be unwise to attempt to force a premature decision on this issue, whichshould be approached empirically. Arrangements should thereforebe provisionally made for the passage of a Royal Fleet Auxiliaryvessel through the Canal, and in the light of the reactions of theEgyptian authorities, further consideration should be given to thefuture use of the Canal by H.M. ships.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Defence, subject to further consultation with the Prime Minister, to make provisionalarrangements for the transit of a Royal Fleet Auxiliaryvessel through the Suez Canal during June.Cabinet Office, S.W.I.22nd May, 1957.
