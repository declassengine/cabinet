Jordan. 1.   The sEoneign Secretary said thai the Government of Jordan(Previous       had recently made enquiries about our Future contribution to the reference:      development programme in Jordan.   The discussion .of this &quot;subjectCC. (57) 38th would provide us with a convenient opportunity to renew our requestConclusions,    that United Kingdom aircraft should be granted, on a reciprocalMinute 3.)      basis, flying rights over Jordanian territory.   The fact that we (hadnot formally enjoyed such rights under the previous Treaty shouldnot prevent us from pressing a request which the Government of jordan had privately indicated, at the time of the negotiations for thetermination of the Treaty, that they would be prepared in principle to grant.The Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theMinister of Defence, to arrange that our request for flying,rights over Jordan should be vigorously pressed during theforthcoming discussions of the Jordan development programme.Home Guard.(previous reference:CC. (53) 62ndConclusions,Minute 6.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum (C. (57) 118)by the Secretary of State for War about the future of the home guard.The Secretary of State for War said that if the Home Guard wasto be kept in active existence it would be necessary to spend about 100,000 on it in the current financial year and thereafter an annualamount of about  50,000. In existing circumstances this expenditure would not be justified. It was not, however, possible formally to disband the Home Guard without further legislation; and he therefore proposed to announce that its remaining activities mustcease and that the first opportunity would be taken to introduce an amendment to the Home Guard Act which would enable the force to be formally disbanded now but to be raised again if need arose.In discussion it was recognised that the disbandment of theHome Guard might not be well received by public opinion in thiscountry and might reinforce the suspicion in other countries that wewere dismantling our home defence organisation. Would it be wise to risk creating this impression for the sake of an economy of  50,000a year? On the other hand it would be difficult to justify even modestadditional expenditure on the Home Guard at a time when theGovernment were enforcing economies in more essential elements ofdefence policy. It would be preferable, however, to allow the home guard gradually to lapse rather than to bring it formally to an endby legislation, and further consideration should be given to thepossibility of dispensing with legislation on the assumption that aminimum nucleus headquarters of the force might be kept in being.Pending further enquiry into this question no public statement shouldbe made about the future role of the Home Guard.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Secretary of State for War, in consultation withthe Attorney-General, to consider whether the home guard might be allowed gradually to lapse, withoutamending legislation, on the understanding that aminimum nucleus headquarters might be kept in being.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting in the light of the result of the enquiry to be made under conclusion (1) above.
2 SiOld-Age 3.   The Prime Minister said that it would be necessary in thePensions.        autumn to introduce legislation to increase the rate of retirement(Previous       pensions.   The Cabinet should consider whether this legislationReference :      should be confined to increasing the rates of contribution and benefitCC. (54) 82nd under the existing scheme or whether it should comprise moreConclusions,    comprehensive proposals for major changes in the provision for oldMinute 8.)      age.   There were two reasons why a decision of principle between these alternatives must be taken now.  First, if a major measure wasto be introduced in the autumn, much preparatory work would be needed and should be put in hand without delay.   Secondly, theLabour Party&apos;s plan for a new system of retirement pensions wouldbe published within the next few days, and the Governmenfscomment on it would depend, to some extent, on the question whetherthey intended themselves to introduce a comprehensive scheme of reform.There were several arguments in favour of a comprehensive scheme. First the existing scheme, based on flat-rate contributions and benefits, no longer satisfied public opinion, which was beginning to regard the higher paid worker as entitled to a more generousretirement pension than was possible under a flat-rate scheme.Moreover, one-third of the working population were already coveredby occupational superannuation schemes, and those who did not enjoy this advantage were now demanding that some comparableprovision should be made for them. The emerging deficit in theNational Insurance Fund, of which public opinion was becomingaware, reinforced the need for action. This deficit could be reduced if the Government introduced legislation limited to increasing bothcontributions and benefits under the existing scheme but raising thelevel of contributions by more than was required to finance theincrease in benefits. But the relief would only be temporary, sincethe increase in benefits would aggravate the deficit in later years. a comprehensive reform, on the other hand, would provide anopportunity to mitigate the burden which the provision for old agewould impose in future both on the Budget and on the economy as awhole. Finally, it would not be in the national interest that, in aGeneral Election, the two political Parties should compete with one another in promises to improve old-age pensions. Nor could theGovernment expect to outbid their opponents in promises of thiskind. It would be wiser, therefore, that they should deal with theproblem during the life of the present Parliament and, at the Election,should stand on what they had done.In the light of these considerations and after discussion with theMinisters directly concerned, he had reached the conclusion that itwould not suffice to introduce legislation limited to increasingcontributions and benefits under the existing scheme and that itwould be preferable that the Government should introduce, in thenext session, a more thoroughgoing measure of reform. The form which such a measure might take would need further consideration.It was possible to reject forthwith certain schemes to which therewere obvious objections. For example, it would be politicallyunacceptable to attempt to make all retirement pensions subject toa means test or to exclude certain specified categories of beneficiary.Nor would it be possible, in view of the pledge which theGovernment had given at the last General Election, to raise the retirement age under the existing scheme, although he did not altogether exclude the possibility of raising the retirement age aspart of an entirely new scheme related to earnings. There still remained, however, a range of questions which would need detailed examination. Should a new scheme be erected on the basis of theexisting occupational superannuation schemes, by making itcompulsory for all employers to make provision of this kind for theirworkpeople as an addition to the existing fiat-rate scheme? If so,what part should the life insurance companies play in this extensionof occupational schemes; and could they properly operate undercover of a statutory compulsion on employers?   How far need the
Government envisage providing an alternative method to meet thewishes of those employers and employees who might be reluctantthat this service should be provided by private enterprise? How farcould the existing fiat-rate scheme be transformed into a scheme under which both contributions and benefits would be related to earnings?Questions of this kind had already received some considerationby a small Ministerial Committee under the Chairmanship of theMinister of Labour. The Minister himself, however, had suggestedthat this Committee should be strengthened and enlarged; and itwould be appropriate that it should now be reconstituted under theChairmanship of the Home Secretary, the Minister of Labour acting as Deputy Chairman. The existing Committee of officials would continue its work under the direction of the new ministerial committee.If the Cabinet endorsed these proposals in principle, it wouldbe necessary to ensure that the public comment on-the Labour Party&apos;scheme by the Government and their supporters was consistent withthe Governmenfs intention to publish subsequently alternative proposals of their own.In discussion there was general agreement that, on botheconomic and social grounds, a comprehensive reform of theprovision for old age was to be preferred to a measure limited to increasing contributions and benefits under the existing scheme. TheLabour Party&apos;s proposals were likely to be attractively presented,and Government spokesmen should neither criticise them toodrastically nor appear to be anxious to try to compete with theirappeal. It would be relevant, however, to emphasise that they would impose a heavy additional burden on contributors; and the lifeinsurance companies, whose interests would be threatened by thescheme, should not be discouraged from criticising it. A scheme of graduated benefits related to earnings, of the type which thePrime Minister had outlined, might be less attractive politically thanthe proposals which the Labour Party were about to publish. On theother hand, it probably represented the only means of attracting themeasure of personal saving which was essential if the financing ofthe provision for old age was not to place an insupportable burdenupon the economy. Failure to solve this problem would probablybe the main weakness in the Labour Party&apos;s proposals; and it wouldbe important to ensure that the general public recognise this fromthe outset. In the formulation of the Governmenfs alternative scheme it would be wise to take account of the fact that public opinion was concerned, not merely to increase the income of old people, butalso to allow them to lead fuller and more active lives. Thisconception should be reflected in the Governmenfs own proposals,which should emphasise the scope for further useful work by people who had passed the conventional age of retirement.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for further examination to be made, as a matter of urgency, of thepossibility of drawing up a comprehensive scheme of reform of the provision for old age, with a view to the introductionof legislation in the following session.Oil Supplies. 4.   The  Cabinet considered the draft of a Parliamentary(Previous announcement that, as a result of the conclusion of interimReference: arrangements for the resumption of traffic through the Suez Canal,C.C. (57) 39th petrol rationing would be brought to an end on the following day.Conclusions, The Cabinet were informed that new ration books, which were beingMinute 3.) printed as a precautionary measure, would be available in six weeks and that, even if supplies of oil through the Suez Canal were againinterrupted, stocks should make it possible to defer the reimposition
of rationing -for a period of about ten weeks: It was agreed that, inthese circumstances, there was ,no need for the statement to refer tothe possibility that rationing might have to bexeimposed or to warn the public to retain the current issue of ration books. The position could, if necessary, be explained in answer to supplementaryQuestions.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister -of Power to make a statement inthe House of Lords that day, in the terms agreed in their discussion, announcing the end of petrol rationing, and toarrange for the Paymaster^General to make a correspondingannouncement in the House of Commons.5. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (C. (57) 112) and the Secretary of State forScotland (C. (57) 116) about the Development Areas.The President of the Board of Trade said that, in the light ofrecent Reports on the Development Areas by the Select Committeeon Estimates, the Economic Policy Committee had decided that thetime had come to adopt a more flexible policy. It was proposed toremove eight districts from the schedule of Development Areasincluding, in addition to those listed in C. (57) 112, South Lancashire,but to add North-West Wales to the schedule in view of the chronicunemployment in that district. These changes would reduce from18 per cent, to about 11 per cent, the proportion of the employedpopulation which would henceforward be comprised in development areas, and would redefine on a more realistic basis those parts of thecountry which could properly be described as being in special dangerof unemployment. The Governmenfs intentions should be announced forthwith, in order that the necessary consultationsmight proceed with the local authorities of the areas affected.Suitable arrangements would subsequently need to be made for thecontrol and management of Government-owned factories in areasremoved from the schedule; and amending legislation would also berequired.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that a primary purposeof the Housing and Town Development (Scotland) Bill which was now before Parliament was to make effective provision for encouraging the dispersal of Glasgow&apos;s surplus population amongneighbouring areas, including North Ayrshire. Glasgow itself would continue to be scheduled as a Development Area; but it was essentialto the success of the policy of dispersal that the whole area comprisingGlasgow and its environs should be treated as a single economic unit, and the Government would be exposed to the charge of inconsistency if, while asking North Ayrshire to prepare to receive a large part of the surplus population of Glasgow, theysimultaneously debarred the area from any possibility of assistance under the Distribution of Industry Acts. In these circumstances,North Ayrshire should be omitted from the list of areas which itwas proposed to de-schedule.Discussion showed that, while the Cabinet appreciated thearguments of principle in favour of adopting a more flexible policy towards the distribution of industry, opinion was divided on thedesirability of proceeding with controversial legislation on this subject at the present time. It was true that the present pattern ofDevelopment Areas could not be maintained indefinitely. It reflected the circumstances of a period in which there had been prolonged unemployment in the basic industries; and, as these industries were now finding it difficult to obtain adequate manpower, thede-rscheduling of certain Development Areas could be represented as evidence of the success of the Governmenfs measures in promoting greater stability and a higher level of employment inthose areas.   In Wales, the present was an opportune moment for
7CC. 40 (57)removing South-East Wales from the schedule, if North-West Walescould be added to it.Against this, however, it was argued that the advantagesassociated with the status of Development Areas had been largelyinstrumental in restoring confidence to districts which had suffered from severe unemployment before the war, and there was a danger that this achievement would be jeopardised by action which publicopinion in the areas concerned might not fully understand. Moreover,the degree of Government assistance to the Development Areas hadbeen substantially reduced in recent years; and it was forconsideration whether the objective of a more flexible policy on thedistribution of industry could not be achieved by a gradualcontinuation of this process without any formal amendment of theschedule. Finally, it was advisable that the Government shouldhave determined what dispositions it would be practicable and desirable to make for the future of the Government-owned factories in the Development Areas before making any public statement ofpolicy or committing themselves to legislation which it would, in any event, be difficult to accommodate in the programme for the 1957-58session.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, whilethe proposals under consideration might be capable of beingpresented in a politically attractive form, the memory of theunemployment in the years before the war still persisted, and publicopinion could be expected to be abnormally sensitive to anycomprehensive reduction in the schedule of Development Areas.Moreover, before reaching a decision the Cabinet should considerthe practical implications of the course proposed, in the shape of a programme which covered all the stages of the action to be taken and examined both the question of providing for the future ofGovernment-owned factories and the scope and nature of any legislation involved.The Cabinet Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in consultationwith the Home Secretary and the Chancellor of theExchequer, to submit for their consideration revised proposals, on the lines indicated in their discussion, for future policy towards the Development Areas.Representation 6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theof the Vatican Foreign Secretary (C. (57) 101) about the status of the representative in the United   of the Vatican in the United Kingdom.Kingdom. The foreign Secretary said that, while the United Kingdom(Previous        Minister at the Vatican enjoyed full diplomatic status, the VaticanReference :      representative in London did not.  But, although it would be logicalCC. (54) 36th to accord reciprocity in this matter, such a step might cause politicalConclusions,    repercussions in some parts of this country and provoke a revivalMinute 9.)      of the type of religious controversy which had died down in recentyears. On balance, he thought it would be inexpedient to make anychange, particularly since there appeared to be no considerable public support for it.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in agreement withthis view.The Cabinet Agreed that it would be inexpedient to respond favourably,at the present time, to representations that the representativeof the Vatican in the United Kingdom should be accordeddiplomatic status.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,14th May, 1957.
