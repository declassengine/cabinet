Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.Broadcasting. 2.   The Home Secretary said that the end had now been reachedThe Fortnight of the experimental period of six months during which the four teen-Rule, day rule had been suspended on an assurance from the broadcasting authorities that they would do their utmost to avoid anticipation ofParliamentary debate. After consultation with the Opposition heC.M.&quot;(56) io2ndrecommended that the Prime Minister should announce that these arrangements had worked satisfactorily and that, while theycontinued to do so, the fourteen-day rule would continue to be suspended.(previous reference:Conclusions,Minute 2.)The Cabinet Agreed that the Prime Minister should make an early announcement, in answer to a Parliamentary Question, ofthe Governmenfs intention to continue the suspension of thefourteen-day rule.Suez Canal.BritishEvacuees.(previous reference:CC. (57) 48thConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had given further consideration to arrangements for making through the Anglo-Egyptian Resettlement Board advances to British evacuees from egypt against assets sequestrated in that country. It had been agreedthat the Foreign Office would indicate to the Board the basis on which individual grants should be made. The Resettlement Board, however,were not in a position to assess the relative needs of individualclaimants and would only be able to make advances in accordancewith rules laid down by the Government. In view of this element ofinflexibility, he suggested that the scale of advances should be 50 percent, on assets up to  1,000 rising to  3,000 on assets between  15,000and  50,000. He proposed to discuss this scale with Colonel Moore,as the representative of the former British community in Egypt. Itmight be necessary to make modifications in the lower ranges of this scale in the light of this talk.In discussion it was recognised that under this arrangementdecisions on individual advances would in effect be taken by theGovernment. It was nevertheless important that these advancesshould be made through the Resettlement Board, or through an agency closely associated with the Board, in order to emphasise theirex gratia nature and to avoid any appearance that the Governmentwere assuming responsibility for the legal claims in respect of thesesequestrated assets. In general, advances should be based on need,and there should be sufficient flexibility in the arrangements to meetindividual cases of hardship. If this could be arranged, it would be justifiable to make advances up to  1,000 at the lower end of thescale, while at the other end the maximum advance might be limitedto  3,000. The Government should first decide on the general scale of payments to be used as a guide in making these advances. It wouldbe of political as well as practical advantage to enlist the co-operationof Colonel Moore and his associates in the working of the scheme andin assessing the extent of need in individual cases.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary, to settle inthe light of their discussion the arrangements for makingex gratia advances to British evacuees from Egypt againstassets sequestrated in that country.
ArmyOrganisation.(previous reference:CC. (57) 28thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (C. (57) 144) on the future organisation ofthe Army.The Secretary of State for War said that the decision to limit theArmy to 165,000 by the end of 1962 would involve reducing thenumber of major fighting units from 176 to 125. These reductions would be carried out in two phases: all but nine would be completed by the end of 1959, and the remainder by the end of 1962. special problems were presented by the need to reduce the number ofregiments in the Infantry of the Line, of which there were at present64, each with one battalion. In the first phase these would be reducedto 52 battalions by amalgamating 24 existing regiments in pairs toform 12 new regiments. In the second phase a further six regimentswould be amalgamated into three new regiments. All the new and remaining regiments would then be grouped into 14 brigades. Allregiments in these proposed brigades would wear the same cap badge,in order to provide the necessary flexibility in postings within the brigade and to allow for a common brigade promotion list. Theregiments would otherwise retain their individual buttons and otherinsignia. Where existing regiments were being amalgamated, theregiments concerned were being asked to produce suggestions fortheir future badges. If the proposals in his memorandum were approved he would seek an audience of Her Majesty The Queen atthe beginning of the following week and the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff would subsequently explain the new arrangements tothe Colonels of all the regiments. A White Paper on the future organisation of the Army would then be published about 24th Julyso that, if the Opposition so desired, a debate on the matter could take place on the Appropriation Bill. The public presentation of theseproposals would require careful handling and he proposed to discussthe arrangements with the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Inparticular it would be important that a statement about thecompensation terms for redundant Service personnel should bepublished before this White Paper was issued.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) There was likely to be considerable criticism, both inParliament and throughout the country, of the proposal to abolishregimental cap badges. Despite the administrative advantages of theproposal and the fact that it had been unanimously recommended byall the Army Working Parties which had considered the question of reorganisation, it would widely be regarded as a serious blow toregimental traditions. It would be advisable, therefore, to consider further the possibility of adopting some other insignia as the commonbadge for the proposed new brigades, so that regiments could retain their own cap badges.(b) Further consideration should also be given to alternative titlesfor some of the proposed new infantry brigades. Some of the titlesat present proposed, for example, the Home Counties Brigade and theMercian Brigade were unlikely to be popular with regiments which took pride in their existing County titles.(c) It would be undesirable at this stage to suggest that the newbrigades would eventually evolve into new regiments each with anumber of battalions. If further adjustments were necessary, it mightbe preferable to retain the individual regiments within a brigade andalter the nomenclature for a brigade.(d) The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that a finaldecision on the reorganisation of the Army should be deferred until further progress had been made in the discussions on the defence programme. Approval of a revised organisation for the Army would limit the scope for further adjustments in the programmes of theServices, and thus prejudice the chance of achieving the necessaryreduction in total defence expenditure.
The Minister of Defence said that the proposed reductions in theArmy up to the end of 1959 represented the maximum that were practicable. Approval of this outline organisation would not affectcosts during the next two years. In the second phase there mighthave to be changes in military dispositions or further amalgamations,but these would not be precluded by the present proposals.(e) Parliament had already been promised an announcementbefore the summer recess, and an early statement on the proposedfuture organisation of the Army was essential in order to help tobuild up recruitment. It would also be necessary to make astatement before the end of July announcing that the three separatearms of the Services would remain as at present.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for War to review the proposalto abolish regimental cap badges, and to reconsider theproposed titles for some of the new brigades, on the lines proposed in discussion.(2) Subject to any further modifications which might benecessary, in pursuance of Conclusion (1) above, approved in principle the proposals for the future&apos; organisation ofthe Army set out in C. (57) 144.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for War to consult the HomeSecretary and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterabout the arrangements for publishing these proposals.Town and country planning(Minerals)Regulations.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Local Government (C. (57) 150) about the amendment of regulation 10 of the Town and Country Planning (Minerals)Regulations, 1954.The Minister of Local Government said that amendingRegulations which would require affirmative resolution in parliament were needed to remedy a drafting defect in the Regulation introduced in 1955 relating to the compensation payable to a mineral operatorwho was refused permission to continue work over contiguous land.The question at issue was the timing of these amending Regulations,since they would affect the amount of compensation payable to theBerry Head Quarry Company under an application submitted in1954. There was no doubt that on planning grounds the right coursewould be to refuse this application, since further workings would destroy the amenities of Berry Head. But, if permission were refusedunder the Regulations as they stood at present, the company mightobtain compensation amounting to as much as  200,000 for loss of profits. Half this cost would fall on the Exchequer and the otherhalf on the Devon County Council. It would clearly be inequitableto impose this burden on rate-payers in Devonshire. On the otherhand, if the Regulations were amended before planning permissionwas refused, the Government would be open to the criticism that theyhad altered the Regulations specifically to influence the compensation payable on a particular application. Nevertheless, he considered thatthe right course was to amend the Regulations before refusingplanning permission, since the company concerned had been told atthe time of a previous application in 1949 that no further extensionof the workings would be permitted.In discussion there was general agreement with the course proposed by the Minister of Local Government. The company hadno claim in equity to this compensation, since they had been clearlywarned in 1949 that further applications would be refused. Moreover,at the time when they made their second application in 1954, the
defective regulation under which they would at present be able toobtain additional compensation had not been introduced. In effect,therefore, the proposed amendment would merely restore the positionto that which obtained at the time when the second application wasmade.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (57) 150.6. The Minister of Power said that the second report of the Ironand Steel Board on the development of the iron and steel industryover the period 1957-62, which he would be laying before Parliamenttowards the end of July, proposed an expansion in the production capacity of the steel industry from 21 million ingot tons of crude steelat the end of 1956 to 29 million tons by 1962. The Economic PolicyCommittee had accepted the desirability of this general objective. Ifthe industry were to maintain the. degree of prosperity which wouldenable it to finance the major proportion of the cost of this development, an increase in steel prices would be necessary. TheIron and Steel Board, who were empowered under the Iron and steel act, 1953 to fix maximum prices of steel in the United Kingdom, had proposed a 1\ per cent, increase to operate from 29th July and he considered that this proposal must be accepted notwithstanding that price increases of 5 and 6 per cent, respectively had taken place inMay and December of the preceding year. The proposed pricechange allowed for an increase of  2 per ton in scrap prices, whichwere subject to Government control. No greater increase, however,might be involved by removing control from scrap prices altogether atthis juncture, and he was considering this possibility.In discussion there was general agreement that the proposed price increase in steel must be accepted. This would tend to bring theprices of British steel nearer to Continental levels, but American steel prices had risen recently and German and French prices were expected to increase again shortly. This further increase in the priceof a basic industrial commodity was, however, bound to causewidespread concern.It was possible that the investment programme for the steelindustry could not be completed by .1962, and seme retardation might enable the industry to meet a higher proportion of the cost from itsinternal resources. Even so the programme would represent a formidable financial problem having regard to the difficulty of findingexternal investment capital for the industry because of the uncertainties surrounding its future. It was for consideration whether the Government, in order to promote a greater sense ofconfidence in the future stability of the industry, should declare an intention not to proceed further with their plans for denationalisingsteel (and perhaps also road transport), even though it was unlikelythat the Opposition would co-operate in any standstill arrangement.There might indeed be little alternative to such a policy if RichardThomas and Baldwins Limited, the only major steel firm stillremaining in public ownership, were to undertake the constructionof the projected new strip mill, since the financial commitment whichthis would involve was likely effectively to preclude the possibility of disposing of the firm to private interests. The Economic PolicyCommittee would give further attention to this matter.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the increases in the price of steel proposed bythe Iron and Steel Board.
development areas.(previous reference:CC. (57) 40thConclusions.Minute 5.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (C. (57) 147) amplifying his previousproposals for revising the schedule of Development Areas.The President of the Board of Trade said that he remainedconvinced that there was no justification for continuing to accord thestatus of Development Areas to districts containing 18 per cent, of thetotal employed population of the country. As there was an equallyvalid case for removing from the schedule of Development Areas allthe eight districts that he had proposed, it would be inequitable toremove some and retain others. The level of unemployment in NorthAyrshire would not justify according any special preference to that area; in view of continuing Irish immigration, it was particularly important that Merseyside should be removed from the schedule ofDevelopment Areas and this could not be contemplated if NorthAyrshire were to remain in the list. The deletion of the districtsproposed, by enabling resources to be concentrated, would make it possible to render more effective assistance to parts of the country which might qualify for the status of Development Areas in the foreseeable future. Moreover, a relatively lengthy list of proposeddeletions would provide greater scope for concessions which might befound to be necessary when consultations with the local authoritiestook place. He had been advised by independent experts that conditions were favourable for the outright disposal of the Govern-ment-owned factories in the Development Areas concerned, and he recommonded that this course should be followed. He also proposedthat the sale of these properties should be conducted by an organisation separate from the Board of Trade and speciallyestablished for that purpose.The Secretary of State for Scotland confirmed the views whichhe had expressed in earlier discussion. It was impossible to convincepublic opinion that there was no inherent connection betweendevelopment area policy and the problem of providing for the dispersal of the surplus population of the larger cities; and Scottishopinion would completely fail to comprehend the Governmenfsaction in making legislative provision for rehousing the surpluspopulation of Glasgow and simultaneously removing North Ayrshirefrom the list of Development Areas. In any event, with the impend-ing closure of a large ordnance factory in the district, unemploymentin North Ayrshire must be expected to rise to nearly 3^ per cent., ascompared with 2 per cent, in Scotland generally and 1 - 5 per cent, inEngland.Discussion showed that the Cabinet continued to entertainconsiderable doubts about the expediency of proceeding with theseproposals. On the one hand, there was clearly no justification forpersisting with special arrangements to attract additional industries to a dispersal area such as Merseyside; and it could be argued that,once a Development Area ceased to qualify for that status, it was appropriate that the industries concerned should be encouraged toacquire the Government-owned factories and to own their premises.In any event, if the factories were to be retained in Governmentownership, the administration of some of the trading states wouldrequire investigation and improvement. Against this, however,Parliamentary and public opinion would be sensitive to proposals(2) Invited the Minister of Power to arrange, in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the Iron andSteel Board, for the announcement of the proposed increases in price to be in terms which would help topromote the Governmenfs disinflationary aims.(3) Took note that the Economic Policy Committee would consider further the desirability of not completing thedenationalisation of the steel industry.
8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Local Government (C. (57) 152) proposing that a RoyalCommission should be appointed to enquire into the appropriatestructure of local government for the Greater London Area.The Minister of Local Government said that it had been contemplated, in the White Paper published in July 1956, that theCounty of London would remain unaffected by the governments proposals for the reorganisation of local government, but that the newLocal Government Commission should be entrusted with some limited responsibility for reviewing the needs of the County ofMiddlesex. In the meantime, the problems of local government organisation in Middlesex had become more acute and it was nolonger feasible to proceed on the basis outlined in the White Paper.He was satisfied that the Government had now no alternative butto address themselves directly to the problem of the appropriatestructure of local government for the Greater London Area as awhole, and could not put forward definite proposals on this matterLocalGovernmentOrganisation.(previous reference:CC. (57) 35thConclusions,Minute 4.)greater london.which might appear to imply a far-reaching change in development area policy. Legislation on this subject would be correspondinglycontroversial and could not easily be accommodated in theforthcoming session. The expenditure incurred on the development areas offered little scope for important economies and there was nobalance of substantial advantage in pursuing proposals which were certain to cause widespread objection. If, however, it were decidedto proceed with the proposals, the case for doing so should be presented constructively and related to the success which had been achieved in eliminating serious unemployment rather than to the criticisms expressed by the Select Committee on Estimates.The Prime Minister said that the arrangements devised for development Areas had always contemplated that, from time to time,some districts would be added to and others removed from the listof such areas, but the straightforward application of this underlyingprinciple was impeded by the apparent need for legislation to settle the future of the Government-owned factories in areas to be taken out of the schedule. It might suggest that the Government wereentertaining reservations about the very conception of development areas if they were suddenly to liquidate their interests in no less thaneight of them. From this point of view, he saw considerable advantage in taking steps to dissociate the Governments responsi-bilities in regard to property from the arrangements for periodicallyrevising the schedule of Areas. If this were done, while no further capital expenditure should be incurred in introducing new factoriesinto an Area which might be removed from the schedule, theGovernment would remain the owner of existing factories and would exercise the functions of a good landlord in regard to them providing,for example, capital for any extensions that might be justifiable. TheCrown Estate might serve as an analogy for this. It would no doubt be an advantage if such an arrangement could be introduced withoutneed for legislation. On the other hand, legislation for such a purpose, if it proved inescapable, could be represented as a constructive step importing a desirable flexibility into the arrange-ments for the Development Areas.The Cabinet Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to give furtherconsideration to the possibility of modifying the present arrangements for the Development Areas on the lines suggested by the Prime Minister and to report to theCabinet.
C.C. 49 (57)until it had been subjected to a thorough investigation. The appoint-ment of an independent enquiry represented the most satisfactory method of assembling the necessary facts and evidence and would be generally welcomed by Government supporters. The unique status and importance of London justified entrusting the investigation to a royal Commission rather than a Departmental enquiry. A RoyalCommission would of course be unlikely to render a report beforethe next General Election.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in agreement with theneed to put in hand an investigation of the most appropriate structure of local government for the Greater London Area and that thebalance of advantage lay on the side of entrusting this investigation to a Royal Commission rather than to a Departmental Committee.As regards alternative courses, it would not be practicable to provide in the forthcoming Local Government Bill for a separate Commissionof Enquiry on the matter without giving rise, during the passage ofthe Bill, to premature debate on the needs of the Greater london area. The appointment of a Royal Commission in the meantimewould preclude such a possibility. Nor would it be practicable to entrust the task to the proposed Local Government Commission for england and Wales. For, while there might be some risk that a RoyalCommission would reach findings on the needs of London whichmight conflict with the conclusions of the Local government commission on the requirements of the conurbations of birmingham and Manchester, the need to make progress towards a suitablestructure of local government for London had now become urgent and the Local Government Commission would be unable to assumesuch a formidable additional burden. In any event it had alwaysbeen accepted that London represented a unique problem in thisrespect.The Cabinet Approved the proposal to appoint a Royal Commission to enquire into the most appropriate structure of localgovernment for the Greater London Area.Local 9.   The Home Secretary said that, following discussion by theGovernment Committee of Ministers who had been considering the allocation ofFinance. the proceeds of the prospective new instalment of re-rating, the(Previous        Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Local government reference:      had reached in direct discussion agreement on a proposed apportion-C.C. (57) 48th  ment of this additional revenue. It was recommended that two-thirdsConclusions.     of the potential net revenue, after offsetting the loss which would be minute 5.)      suffered in central taxation, should be surrendered permanently to thelocal authorities who would therefore, at present rates of revenueyield, stand to benefit to the extent of  10 millions in England andWales and  0-8 millions in Scotland.   In order, however, that theExchequer should not be subject to any additional burden in any year in consequence of the financial arrangements as a whole, it was proposed that the payment of the additional  40 millions which would accrue to the local authorities as a result of the prospective changesin the method of paying Exchequer grant should be spread over aperiod of eight years.   It would be made clear in the forthcomingWhite   Paper   that   these   arrangements   represented   a   specialconcession to ease the transition to the new grant system.The Cabinet were informed that a settlement of this matter hadbeen facilitated by the abandonment of the proposed rearrangement of the highway grants. The county boroughs would therefore continue to suffer financially in consequence of the perpetuation of asystem which had become anomalous.
Housing Policy.Manchester.(previous reference:CC. (57) 47thConclusions,Minute 2.)10. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordChancellor (C. (57) 156) recommending that the enquiry which theCabinet had decided should be made into the housing needs of manchester should take the form of a public local enquiry under theTown and Country Planning Act, 1947, conducted by an eminentbarrister with relevant experience, and that its report should bepublished. The memorandum also proposed appropriate terms ofreference to ensure that the enquiry would be directed primarily to establishing the order in which the various possible sites should be developed on a realistic assessment of Manchester&apos;s probablerequirements in the years following 1960 and on the basis that thedevelopment of good agricultural land for housing should be deferredas long as possible.In discussion it was agreed that, in order to avoid the possibilityof divergent views being expressed by different GovernmentDepartments, the evidence for the enquiry should preferably beobtained from local bodies and organisations. Notwithstanding themounting pressure for an indication of the Governmenfs attitudetowards the problem of Manchester^ housing needs, there would be advantage in deferring the public announcement of the proposedenquiry until Parliament had risen for the recess, if that were practicable.The Cabinet (1) Approved the recommendations in C. (57) 156.(2) Invited the Minister of Local Government to settle, inconsultation with the Home Secretary and the Chief Whip,the timing of any announcement on this subject.White Fishand HerringSubsidies.(previous reference:CM. (56) 46thConclusions,Minute 7.)11. The Minister of Agriculture recalled that the white fish andherring subsidies were essentially a temporary measure to cover the modernisation of the fishing fleet. The subsidy rates had increased during each of the last two years, but to implement the government&apos;s policy and to keep within the financial limits which had been set bythe White Fish and Herring Industries Act, 1957 it would be necessaryto stabilise the subsidies with a view to their reduction over the next two years. It was therefore proposed that no change should be madein the level of the white fish subsidy for 1957-58, though a small increase of the order of  50,000 might be made in the subsidy toherring vessels. In consequence, taking into account increases in costs, the industry generally would be worse off than in 1956; but,while in England the objectives of the Governmenfs policy were beingslowly realised, pressures resulting from the difficulties which theScottish industry was experiencing might impair the Governmenfsability to sustain the present subsidy policy. The Secretary of Statefor Scotland and he had therefore concluded that an enquiry shouldbe set up into the organisation of the Scottish fishing industry. Adecision to make no increase in the subsidy for 1957-58 would be strongly opposed by the trawler owners, but the consultations whichhad been held with Government supporters particularly concernedwith fishery questions should serve to restrain Parliamentary criticismwhen the subsidy schemes came to be adopted.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement.The Cabinet Approved the proposals which had been agreed between theMinisters directly concerned for the apportionment of the proceeds of the additional instalment of re-rating.
11CC. 49 (57)OverseaInformationServices.(previous reference:CC. (57) 48thConclusions,Minute 2.)12. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster (C. (57) .157) covering a draft White paper on oversea information services.In discussion it was suggested that further consideration shouldbe given to paragraph 15 of the draft pending a decision on thearrangements for establishing a new broadcasting programme in theMiddle East which would be commercial in character, and to thephrasing of paragraph 29 regarding Exchequer supplementation ofthe salaries of teachers from this country who accepted posts overseas.The Cabinet Approved, subject to the points made in discussion, thedraft White Paper on oversea information services.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,4th July, 1957.
