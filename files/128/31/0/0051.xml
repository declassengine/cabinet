Minute 3)Suez Canal 1. , The Prime Minister said that a scheme for making ex gratiaBritish Evacueesadvances: to British evacuees from Egypt whose assets in that(Previous country: had been sequestrated was being discussed with their reference: representatives. It was important that the Government should note.C.

In the meantime,however, immediate hardship must be relieved by arrangements which would be generally regarded as. equitable. The present scheme would provide for maximum, payments of  5,000, which would represent about 25 per cent, of the larger claims, together withpayments of  1,000 at the lower end of the scale, representing about75 per cent, of the smaller claims. It was hoped to reach broadagreement with the representatives of the claimants on an arrangement on these lines; but in any event it would be for the Government todecide the scale of payments. Their decision should be announced during the debate in the House of Lords at the beginning of thefollowing week; and a similar statement should be made in theHouse of Commons. The terms of these statements would need to be considered in the light of the further discussions with therepresentatives of the evacuees.The Cabinet-^Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to discuss withthe representatives of the British evacuees from Egypt theproposals for a system of ex gratia advances against assetssequestrated and to prepare, for the Prime ministers approval, a draft of the necessary Parliamentaryannouncement.parliament . The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenin the House of Commons in the following week.It was uncertain whether the Government would be ready beforethe summer recess to announce new proposals for the future of cyprus and there was, therefore, no alternative but to accept therequest of the Opposition for a debate on Cyprus on 15th July.Administrative 3. The Lord Chancellor informed the Cabinet that the tribunals Committee which had been appointed in 1955 under the chairmanship(Previous of Sir Oliver Franks to enquire into the working of administrativeReference: tribunals and enquiries would submit their report to him at the cm. (56) 26th beginning of the following week.Conclusions, , The Committee&apos;s findings would, in his judgment, strike a minute. 8)       satisfactory balance between the needs of sound administration andthe provision of adequate safeguards for the liberty of the subject;and they would be generally acceptable to Government supporters.He recommended that the report should be published in the following week, as soon as practicable after presentation.The Cabinet Agreed that it should be announced in Parliament on18th July that the report of the Committee on administrative Tribunals and Enquiries was being published  that   day.Disarmament 4   The Foreign Secretary sought authority to announce, at the(Previous meeting of the Disarmament Sub-Committee that afternoon, that reference: the United Kingdom supported the United States proposal that theC.C. (57) 50th initial suspension of nuclear tests should be for &quot;a period of tenConclusions, months. The French and Canadian representatives had alreadyMinute 2) indicated their agreement with this proposal; and, in the absenceof any formal indication that the United Kingdom Government52550-1 B 2
also endorsed the period involved, there was a risk that therepresentative of the Soviet Union would attempt to exploit an.apparent division of opinion amongst the Western Powers.The Cabinet Approved this proposal.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Supply (C. (57) 155) about the probable effects on industry of the reductions in the defence programme.The Minister of Supply said that, in general, the resourcesreleased by the reductions in the defence programme should be readily absorbed by the civil economy. There would, however, be only limited scope for the re-employment of the scientific andtechnical specialists who were no longer required for defence work;and there was a risk that some of these might emigrate. Moreover,the contraction of the effort hitherto devoted to defence research and development would involve a net reduction in the nationalinvestment in scientific facilities unless there was a corresponding increase in scientific investment in the civil sector. Despite theearlier decisions to expand the number of development contracts for civil work, only a few such contracts had, in fact, been placed. Itwas for consideration, therefore, whether any special steps shouldbe taken to reduce the risk of damage to the nation&apos;s resources of scientific manpower and equipment which would otherwise result from the reductions in the defence programme.In discussion it was suggested that the export of scientific ideas and technical information was no less valuable to this country thanthe export of engineering goods. It might well be to our advantage,therefore, to take steps to expand the facilities for civil technologyas an offset to the reduction in military research. On the other hand the loss of skilled technicians through emigration should not be large. Moreover, in the past, the demands of defence had prevented the needs of industry for scientific manpower from being satisfiedin full. As a result, there was still a considerable shortage oftechnicians for civil purposes, particularly in atomic energy, and itshould be possible for many of the scientists and engineers who were no longer required for defence research, to find employment of thiskind. In any event, the main purpose of the reductions in the defence programme was to relieve the present strain on the economy; andthe economic benefits which they should yield should not be sacrificedmerely because they might involve some marginal loss of technical personnel. This question should, however, be further considered as part of the general review of the future of the aircraft industry on which the Chancellor of the Exchequer was at present formulatingproposals.The Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to take account,in his proposals for a general review of the aircraft industry,of the need to deal with any surplus of scientific andtechnical manpower which would result from the reductions in the defence programme.*6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (C. (57) 161) outlining a suggested new approach to theproblem of Cyprus, -*The Prime Minister said that this memorandum was the resultof consultations which he had held with the Governor of cyprus and the Ministers mainly concerned during the past few days. Three
possible courses of action were now open to us. First, we could continue to govern the Island ourselves on the basis that we had recently had some military success in the repression of terrorismand had also secured a political advantage by the release ofArchbishop Makarios, who was proving an increasing embarrassment to the Greek Government. Secondly, we could proceed to partition which would be an admission that our policy had failed and wouldbe liable to provoke a new outbreak of communal conflict which itmight prove impossible to localise. Thirdly, we could adopt thecourse outlined in C. (57) 161, whereby we would retain under ourown sovereignty certain enclaves which were strategically essentialto us but would surrender the rest of the Island to a condominiumof the United Kingdom, Greece and Turkey, who would jointly share the sovereignty between them. The whole of the Island outside theBritish enclaves would then be placed under the government of a governor, to be nominated by the three sovereign Powers or, indefault of agreement between them, to be appointed by the Powers(other than the three sovereign Powers) which were for the time beingmembers of the North Atlantic Alliance. Outside the British enclavesa system of responsible self-government would be introduced onthe general lines of the constitution proposed in Lord Radcliffe&apos;sreport; and, as regards internal affairs (other than internal security),the Governor would act on the advice of Ministers responsible toan elected Chamber, except where the constitution expressly providedotherwise. Defence, external relations and internal security wouldbe &quot; reserved &quot; subjects. As regards defence, it would be reasonablethat the three sovereign Powers, being members of the North atlantic alliance, should look to the Council of the Alliance to protect the island. The three Powers would themselves conduct its external relations. On matters of internal security the Governor should beable to call on a force comprising British, Turkish and Greekcontingents, in equal numbers, which would be available to supportthe civil power in maintaining law and order.The Chiefs of Staff had informed the Defence Committee that from the strategic point of view they would prefer that british sovereignty should continue to be maintained over the whole Island.But they recognised the political difficulties of this course and the increasing burden which it was liable to impose on the resourcesof the United Kingdom. They were therefore prepared to acceptthe new proposals, subject to a more detailed examination of the exact boundaries of the proposed enclaves. It was now necessaryto consider whether these proposals were likely to win support inthe United Kingdom and abroad and, if so, at what point they shouldbe made publicly known.In discussion there was general agreement that an attempt tomaintain exclusive British sovereignty over the whole Island was likely to involve political and economic consequences which couldnot be tolerated indefinitely. An act of partition by ourselves must also be rejected, as unacceptable to public opinion in this countryand damaging to our international reputation. In principle,therefore, an arrangement on the lines proposed in C. (57) 161 had much to commend it. Nevertheless, it would need furtherconsideration from the following points of view:-(a) It was uncertain whether these proposals would win eveninitial acceptance from the Greek and Turkish Governments. Itwould be necessary to bring all possible pressure to bear upon themfor this purpose; and the declared support of the United States andthe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) would be essentialto the success of the scheme. The Greek Government would be most susceptible to the influence of the. United States, and we should seek to secure that the United States Government would use their maximum influence to ensure Greek co-operation, in the new policy.Nevertheless, even though the United States appeared now to have abandoned their earlier support for the Cypriot claim to be unified
with Greece, they remained favourable in principle to the concept of self-determination, and they might not be prepared to endorsewhole-heartedly proposals which did not envisage self-determination of the Island within the foreseeable future. The Turkish Governmentwould be most likely to be influenced by the consideration that,if they rejected the present proposal and were also given no reasonto believe that the United Kingdom Government Would proceed topartition, a subsequent Government in the United Kingdom mightyield to the pressure of Archbishop Makarios for the unification of cyprus with Greece. This possibility should be brought clearly totheir attention. Nevertheless, it could not be assumed that our proposals would win acceptance from the Governments of greece and Turkey; and it was essential that, before we gave any publicity to them, we should have defined the policy which we should adoptif they were rejected. It was open to question whether, in that event,we should resume the government of the Island ourselves or should propose that the United Nations Organisation should assume responsibility for its partition. Partition, however effected, wouldbe bound to result in bitterness and bloodshed; but it was no lesscertain that we could not carry indefinitely the burden of sole responsibility for the administration of the Island.(^Alternatively, it was possible that the Greek and turkish governments would at the outset offer to co-operate, howeverreluctantly, in the working of an arrangement of the kind described in C. (57) 161, but that this arrangement would subsequently collapsein.the face of a renewed outbreak of terrorism.. In that event, itwould be very difficult, if not impossible,, for the United kingdom to resume exclusive sovereignty over the whole of Cyprus. It couldadmittedly be argued that, if the Greek and Turkish Governmentsinitially accepted pur proposals, they would realise that it was intheir joint interest that those proposals should prove effective in restoring peace and stability in the Island. They might be furtherrestrained from conniving at any renewal of communal strife by therisk that their own nationals in other areas of mixed Greek and turkish population outside Cyprus would suffer retaliation.Nevertheless we could not ignore the risk that communal strife mightbreak out afresh in Cyprus after the system of tripartite sovereigntyhad been brought into effect; and it was therefore desirable that,if a scheme on the lines proposed in C. (57) 16.1 was to be launched,it should provide some safeguard against this risk in the form of alternative arrangements which would be even more unpalatableto the Greek Government than the scheme itself.(c) It might also be desirable, that the scheme should enablethe Governor,, in an emergency, to suspend the constitution. If so,however, it would be necessary to decide whether, in that event,he would be entitled to rely on British troops in the enclaves as wellas on the British component in the joint force to be created tomaintain internal security.(d) The proposals might in any event place the Governor in aposition of considerable difficulty if, in a situation falling short of a major emergency, the representatives of the three sovereign Powerswho would be appointed to advise him were unable to agree on thepolicy to be followed. This difficulty, which was implicit in any system of tripartite sovereignty, might be overcome if british administration of the whole Island could be maintained under a mandate from NATO. An arrangement of this kind would havethe further advantage that it would strengthen our hold on the airfield at Nicosia and on the communications between the vital strategicpoints in the Island and Famagusta which would be their main source of sea-borne supplies. On the other hand, a mandate would not be consistent with the maintenance of British sovereignty; and thecomplete surrender of British sovereignty over Cyprus would be unwelcome to the Governmenfs supporters. Moreover, a mandatorysystem of this kind would too closely resemble a mere continuance
of the existing situation to be likely to command the acceptance ofthe Greek and Turkish Governments. It was clear, however, thatthe powers of the Governor as envisaged by the Radcliffe constitution would need to be reconsidered if a solution based on tripartitesovereignty was adopted. Lord Radcliffe had undertaken to examine this, question. ,Discussion then turned to the timing of publication of theseproposals, if they were eventually approved. The choice lay between,on the one hand, publishing them in advance of the forthcoming debate on Cyprus in the United Nations and, on the other hand,holding them in reserve, to be launched during or after the united nations debate, and limiting our action in the immediate future to proceeding with one of the other plans which had been discussed at an earlier stage, e.g., a tripartite discussion between the three governments or an invitation to the Cypriot communities to offertheir suggestions for amendment of the Radcliffe constitution.It was suggested that, since the Greek Government had recentlyindicated their support for the plan of independence for Cypruswhich had been put forward by the Secretary-General of NATO,there might be some advantage in our holding our new proposals in reserve. Moreover, the surrender of Cyprus to a condominiumwould be liable to be criticised by the Governments own supportersunless they were given an opportunity to reflect further on thearguments against any attempt to maintain indefinitely exclusiveBritish sovereignty over the Island.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet would need to give further consideration to the important issues involved in the new proposals outlined in C. (57) 161.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.CommonwealthEconomicDevelopment(previous reference:CC. (57) 44thConclusions,Minute 1)7. The Cabinet had before them a note by the commonwealth secretary (C. (57) 160) covering the draft of a White Paper on the role of the United Kingdom in Commonwealth economic development.The Commonwealth Secretary said that this draft had beenconsidered by the Economic Policy Committee at a meeting that morning. It would be re-drafted in the light of the commentsexpressed at that meeting and the revised draft would be submittedto the Cabinet in the following week.The Cabinet &apos;Took note of this statement.Malaya 8.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the(Previous Commonwealth Secretary and the Colonial Secretary (C. (57) 163)Reference: about a suitable presentation to the Federation of Malaya on itsCM. (56) lOOth attaining independence within the Commonwealth on 3.1st August.MinutTz)118&apos; The Commonwealth Secretary said that it was proposed, afterinformal consultation with the Chief Minister of the Federation,that the gift of the United Kingdom Government to mark this occasion should take the form of a post-graduate scholarship at a leading University in this country. The scholarship would be awarded over a period of perhaps ten years and would be open tolocally-born residents of the Federation.
sIn discussion there was general approval for this proposal.  Itwas suggested, however, that the scholarship might perhaps be.  awarded for a longer period than ten years.The Cabinet-Approved, subject to the point made in their discussion, theproposal in C. (57) 163 for a gift to the Federation of Malayaon its attaining independence.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,11th July, 1957.
