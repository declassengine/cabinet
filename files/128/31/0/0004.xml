Anglo-Egyptian       i.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theAgreement,     Foreign Secretary (C. (57) 9) on a number of issues arising from thedecision of the Egyptian Government to repudiate the Anglo-Egyptian Agreement of 1954.1954.(previous reference:CC. (54) 63rdConclusions,Minute 1.)The Foreign Secretary said that, although we had not received through the Protecting Power any formal notification of this decision,we should have to say, in answer to Parliamentary Questions,whether we intended to contest its validity. The Law Officers had advised that we could not sustain a case against it. But, although itwould be of no advantage to us in present circumstances to attemptto maintain the Treaty in operation, we were still concerned tosafeguard our interests in the physical assets in the Suez Canal Base.We must also consider whether the companies which had contractedto operate the Suez Canal Base should now be liquidated and their staffs discharged.The Attorney-General said that, in the opinion of the LawOfficers, the military action which we had taken against Egypt inOctober was inconsistent with the provisions of the Agreement andthe Egyptian Government were entitled to regard it as terminated.There was, however, no need to admit explicitly that we acceptedEgypfs abrogation of the Agreement: it would be enough to statethat we took note of the action of the Egyptian Government andregarded the Agreement as terminated. This would not affect ourtitle to our assets in the Suez Canal Base; but, if the Agreement was now treated as terminated, no further purpose would be served by maintaining the contractors&apos; companies in existence.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was desirable, on financial grounds, that these companies should be wound up as soonas possible and their staffs discharged. We were at present spending 90,000 a month in wages to the employees and  35,000 a month infees to the companies.It was the general view of the Cabinet that it would be undesirable to attempt to contest the action of the Egyptian Government inabrogating the Agreement of 1954 and that we should announce thatwe regarded it as terminated. No time should be lost in terminating the contracts with the contractors&apos; companies and discharging their staffs.In the final paragraph of the memorandum by the Law Officersannexed to C. (57) 9, it was suggested that our military action against egypt might constitute a breach of Articles IV and V of the suez canal Convention of 1888. This suggestion should be further considered.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the view of the Law Officers that there were no legal grounds for disputing the validity of the action ofthe Egyptian Government in abrogating the Anglo-Egyptian Agreement of 1954.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor, the Foreign Secretary and the attorney-General to settle, in consultation, the terms ofan answer to a, Parliamentary Question stating that thisAgreement must now be regarded as terminated.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for War, in consultation withthe Foreign Secretary, to arrange without delay for the contracts with the Suez. contractors&apos; companies to be terminated and for the companies&apos; staffs to be discharged.(4) Invited the Attorney-General to submit to the Cabinet the considered opinion of the Law Officers on the questionwhether, by invading and occupying Port Said, we werein breach of Articles IV and V of,the Suez CanalConvention of 1888 and, if so, how our right of free passage through the Canal might be affected.51159 1
Suez Canal.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 2ndConclusions,Minute 1.)BritishEvacuees.2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (57) 12) reporting the arrangements proposed for givingassistance to British subjects evacuated to this country from Egypt.The Home Secretary said that the Home Affairs Committee had set up a Sub-Committee of the Departments concerned to examine indetail the problems involved. Arrangements had been made toprovide temporary financial assistance for these refugees and some immediate provision had been made for the education of their children. Consideration would now need to be given to the longer-term problems involved in resettling these refugees and, in particular,to the question of compensating those who were entitled to pensionsor had other financial claims on the Egyptian Government. TheAnglo-Egyptian Aid Society would not be able effectively to discharge the wide range of administrative responsibilities which would be involved in resettling these refugees. It was proposed to set up a new organisation for this purpose, which might be called the Anglo-Egyptian Resettlement Board.The Foreign Secretary said that, apart from their obligation to afford immediate relief in cases of acute hardship, the Governmenthad a more general duty towards these people, since their misfortuneswere directly attributable to the action which the Government had felt obliged to take against Egypt. The cost of meeting or under-writing the legitimate claims of those who had pension rights or had lost their assets in Egypt should not raise any serious financial problem; and, both in equity and in order to avoid serious political criticism, the Government should adopt a constructive and generousapproach towards these problems.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he agreed in principle with this view, so far as it related to personal claims. Commercialclaims were in a different category; they lay rather against theEgyptian Government and should stand over for the time being.They might well be found to exceed the total of the Egyptian sterling balances held in this country.The Cabinet (1) Took note of C. (57) 12 and of the Home Secretary&apos;sstatement.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange, with the assistance ofthe Minister of Labour, for an Anglo-Egyptian Resettle-ment Board to be set up to administer assistance to Britishsubjects evacuated from Egypt and to deal with theproblem of their resettlement.(3) Invited the Home Secretary to submit to the Prime minister a draft reply to a Parliamentary Question by Mr. J.Grimond, M.P., setting out, in the light of their discussion,the Governments policy towards providing aid for Britishsubjects evacuated from Egypt.Withdrawal of The Foreign Secretary said that the United Nations AssemblyIsraeli Troops, were now debating the proposed withdrawal of Israeli forces from egypt. Hitherto Israel had refused to contemplate withdrawal except on the basis of specific assurances about her future security; but theUnited States had insisted that the Israeli withdrawal must beunconditional. The latest speech of the United States representative at the United Nations suggested, however, that the United states would now support a recommendation that both Egypt and Israelshould observe the provisions of the Armistice Agreement and that,in particular, neither of them should claim to exercise belligerentrights in the Straits of Tiran. There were, therefore, some grounds for hoping that the text of the resolution to be adopted by the general assembly would emerge in a form which would enable us to vote for it without appearing to ignore the legitimate claims of Israel for someassurances of her future security.
In discussion there was general agreement that, if we voted against any resolution requiring the withdrawal of Israeli troops inreasonable terms, or even if we abstained from voting on such aresolution, we should alienate Arab opinion and invite the risk offurther interruption of our oil supplies. If, however, the resolutionwere confined to a condemnation of Israel&apos;s refusal to withdraw hertroops it might be appropriate that we should abstain from voting.Our efforts should therefore be directed towards ensuring that theresolution in its final form embodied some constructive suggestionabout the terms on which an Israeli withdrawal might reasonablytake place, so that we might be able to vote in favour of it without being accused of indifference to the fundamental interests of Israel.The Cabinet (4) Invited the Foreign Secretary to instruct the United kingdom representative at the United Nations to be guided, duringthe debate on the withdrawal of Israeli troops, by the considerations which had emerged in their discussion.Rent 3.   The Minister of Housing said that the progress of theRestriction.      Committee stage of the Rent Bill was being seriously delayed.   It(Previous        was important that the Bill should receive the Royal Assent beforeReference:      the Whitsun recess, in order to avoid the danger of rents beingCM. (56) 86th  increased just before Christmas.  In these circumstances the further conclusions,    stages of the Bill would have to be made subject to the guillotine.Minute 2.)       If a guillotine Motion were taken on 4th February, the remaining stages of the Bill, subject to any additional time which might be needed for the Scottish clauses, could be completed in about five weeks.The Home Secretary said that he agreed that it would benecessary to have recourse to the guillotine for this Bill.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that a Motion should be tabled, for discussion on 4th February, to apply the guillotine to the remaining stages of the Rent Bill.(2) Invited the Home Secretary, the Secretary of State forScotland and the Minister of Housing to consider thetime-table for the Bill, taking into account the need toprovide adequate time for the Scottish clauses.Wales. 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the(Previous Minister of Local Government and Minister for Welsh AffairsReferences: (C. (57) .10) about a recommendation by the Council for Wales and cm. (56) 38th Monmouthshire that a separate Secretary of State should be conclusions, appointed with executive responsibility for GovernmentMinute 6, and   administration in Wales.CM. (56) 48th        jne Minister 0f Local Government said that, for the reasonsConclusions,    given in the annex to his memorandum, there would be noMinute 9.)       justification for setting up a separate administration for Wales on government    the Scottish model. In contrast with Scotland, Wales did not possessAdministration, any distinctive system of law or land tenure; its population wasonly 2\ millions against a Scottish population of 5 millions; and theinstitution of a separate administration would be both costly andcontrary to the best interests of Wales. The transfer of responsibilityfor Welsh affairs in the new Government from the Home Secretary tothe Minister for Local Government had been welcomed by Welshopinion, including the members of the Council.   There was stillscope for improving the administrative arrangements for dealingwith Welsh problems and he hoped, in consultation with his
colleagues, to be able to devise further measures of devolution whichwould help to satisfy moderate Welsh opinion. The Governmentshould, however, be able to announce their attitude towards the main commendation of the Report during the debate on Welsh affairs which was due to take place shortly.The Cabinet agreed that the appointment of a separate Secretaryof State for Wales would be neither justified on merits nor in the best interests of the Principality.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Lord Chancellor said that it would help to conciliatemoderate Welsh opinion if it could be made known that a ministerial committee had been set up to consider Welsh problems, with thesupport of a representative Committee of officials.(b) The Minister of Agriculture said that the forthcomingreorganisation of the regional staff of his Department in Wales would go some way towards meeting the recommendations of the Council.He would endeavour to expedite these arrangements in time for anannouncement to be made during the debate on Welsh affairs.(c) The Minister of Education said that the educational interestsof Wales were best served if the senior officials of his DepartmentsWelsh Office continued to be stationed in London, in close contact with Headquarters. The pressure for these officials to be stationed in Wales was primarily political.(d) There would be advantage in allowing the debate on welsh affairs to take place before the Governments decision on the council&apos;s recommendation was announced. The Minister for welsh affairs would consider whether there would be advantage in announcing during the debate any further measures of administrative devolution which could be introduced.(e) Further consideration should be given to the desirability of presenting a White Paper, in which the arguments of substanceagainst adopting the main proposal of the Council could be fullyset out.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the recommendation of the Council for wales and Monmouthshire for the appointment of a separateSecretary of State for Wales should be rejected.(2) Agreed that this decision should be announced after theforthcoming debate on Welsh affairs in the House ofCommons, and that consideration should be given to theissue of a White Paper setting out the reasons for thisdecision.5. The Prime Minister said that, in negotiations which were now proceeding with the German Government, the United kingdom representatives had proposed that Germany should contribute in theforthcoming financial year a sum equivalent to  55 millions in respectof support costs of our troops stationed in Western Germany. TheGerman Government had now offered to pay  45 millions. Weshould continue to press for a higher figure; but it was to our interestto secure an early settlement and our representatives should beauthorised to bring the negotiations to an end on the basis of thebest figure above  45 millions which they could secure.The Cabinet Agreed that we should how accept, as the contribution ofthe German Government to the support costs of our troopsstationed in Western Germany, the highest figure above 45 millions which our representatives could secure in thecurrent negotiations.
7. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of memoranda bythe Lord Privy Seal, the former Secretary of State for Scotland andthe former President of the Board of Trade (CP. (56) 282, 287 and289) about local government finance.The Home Secretary said that a reorganisation of localgovernment finance must be regarded as an essential element in the fiscal reforms which the Chancellor of the Exchequer had alreadyoutlined to the Cabinet. This reorganisation involved two main proposals first, that an initial instalment of industrial re-ratingshould be undertaken within the next two or three years; second,that a general grant should be substituted for certain of the existingspecific grants. Both these changes were contentious; but he believedthat both were desirable if the Government were to succeed in theirtwo-fold objective of reducing the financial dependence of localauthorities on the Exchequer and enlarging the scope for localinitiative and enterprise in local government. At the same time itwould be necessary to bear in mind the political implications of the redistribution of rate income among different local authorities, asillustrated in the Appendix to CP. (56) 282.In discussion it was suggested that, even though the progressiveintroduction of re-rating might be desirable in principle, it wouldbe accepted by industry only if it was one element in a more generousand imaginative fiscal policy towards industry as a whole, and itwould not be welcomed by the local authorities themselves unless a substantial part of the proceeds was left with them to be applied in relief of their own ratepayers.It was also suggested that the proposal for a block grant was open to even greater objection. It was apparently to take the placeof&quot; only a certain number of existing specific grants; and of theservices so affected education represented about 85 per cent, in termsof expenditure. The general grant would therefore be regarded by public opinion as a direct attack on the education service. Politically,this was open to serious objection. Education had been based upona structure of specific grants for many years; and on the last occasionwhen it had been proposed to substitute a block grant for thesespecific grants the proposal had been condemned by the unanimousopinion of all political Parties in the House of Commons. To reviveit now would invite the same criticism. Education was one of themost prominent and most popular elements in the Governmentspolitical programme. Moreover, it was a service in which policy needed to be kept under the close control of the responsible Ministers.   ItCyprus.Detention ofPrisoners.(previous reference:CM. (56) 59thConclusions,Minute 2.)LocalGovernmentFinance.(Previous -Reference:CM. (56) 104thConclusions,Minute 9.)6. The Minister of State for Colonial Affairs said that we had recently captured a number of exceptionally dangerous Cypriots who could hot safely be imprisoned in the Island. Some fifteen Cypriotprisoners had already been sent to the United Kingdom for detention,in accordance with an earlier decision of the Cabinet, and he nowsought authority to increase the total number to thirty. All the prisoners had been tried and convicted under due processes of law.The Home Secretary said that the increase in the number ofprisoners would present some difficulty, especially as it was necessaryto provide interpreters. Nevertheless, he would make every effort to provide for their accommodation in prisons in the UnitedKingdom.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of State for Colonial Affairs toarrange, in consultation with the Home Secretary, for thetransfer of further prisoners from Cyprus to prisons in theUnited Kingdom.
would be indefensible to leave the pattern of educational development to be determined by the varying views of individual local authorities,who would tend to concentrate expenditure on those features of theservice which were politically popular at the expense of the soundnessof the educational structure as a whole and the scope and quality of the instruction which it provided. Nor could it be validly argued that a general grant would make possible a better control over thegrowth of expenditure on education. To a large extent that expenditure was attributable to costs, such as salaries, which were not subject to control but were determined by national agreements. Itwas, therefore, misleading to argue that general grants would givelocal authorities a greater degree of freedom or increase their sense of responsibility.As against these considerations it was argued that large sectionsof public expenditure were now barely under control and wereincreasing at a rate which threatened to absorb every economy in expenditure which we could reasonably hope to achieve. A general grant provided the best means of curbing this tendency which couldbe devised. Specific grants were an incentive to extravagance: ageneral grant, to be applied by a local authority at its own discretion,subject to triennial review, would increase the sense of financial responsibility in local government and should help to attract moreable and public-spirited individuals to serve on local authorities. Itwas premature to assume that the changes proposed would be unpopular with the Governments supporters in the House ofCommons. Even that section of public opinion which regarded the needs of the educational service as having priority over all other considerations would welcome relief from the detailed control by thecentral Government which was implicit in the system of specific grants.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at a later meeting.Anglo-american relations.Meeting withPresidentEisenhower.8. The Prime Minister said that he had been invited by president Eisenhower to meet him for discussions towards the end ofMarch, either in Washington or in Bermuda. This invitation was a welcome sign that the United States Government were now preparedto resume friendly relations with this country, and he had acceptedthe Presidents suggestion that the meeting should take place in bermuda.It would not be possible for these arrangements to be announcedfor a few weeks. For President Eisenhower had also asked french ministers to visit him in Washington during February; and theFrench Government were anxious that this visit should not be announced until after the debate on Algeria in the French assembly on 10th February. It would be preferable that French ministers should have accepted an invitation to visit Washington before hisown meeting with President Eisenhower in Bermuda was made known.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,30th January, 1957.
