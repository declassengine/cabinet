Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.Suez Canal. 2.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that from the course(Previous        of the negotiations so far conducted between representatives of the reference :      Bank of England and the National Bank of Egypt in Basle it seemedC.C. (57) 36th likely that agreement might be reached with the Egyptians on theConclusions,    establishment of a new Egyptian No. 3 account, for the payment of minute 1.)      Canal dues and ships&apos; disbursements by United Kingdom shipping,provided that we would give assurances that this new account would remain free from restrictions and that, as soon as it was open, wewould initiate further discussions about the Egyptian No. 1 account and the resumption of normal trade between the two countries.In discussion it was agreed that the negotiations in Basle shouldcontinue on this basis. It would be convenient that the next meetingof the Suez Canal Users&apos; Association should, if possible, be arranged for 8th or 9th May.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their consideration of this question at a subsequent meeting.Jordan.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 36thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Minister of Defence said that it was disquieting that no progress had been made towards an agreement with the Governmentof Jordan guaranteeing us flying rights over Jordanian territory. TheGovernment of Jordan should be pressed to conclude this agreement as rapidly as possible.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (CommanderNoble) to consider, in consultation with the Minister ofDefence, what further action could be taken to secure thecompletion of an agreement with the Government of Jordangranting the United Kingdom flying rights over Jordanianterritory.Agriculture.(previous reference :CM. (56) 85thConclusions,Minute 10.)Export of cattle.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Agriculture(C. (57) 105) submitting proposals for controlling the export trade inlive cattle to the Continent.The Minister of Agriculture said that the conditions under whichthis trade was carried on had given rise to widespread public concern.A Committee of Enquiry had found no justification for prohibiting the trade altogether but had recommended that steps should be takento ensure that the animals were not required to undergo long journeysafter arriving on the Continent. It was therefore proposed that, untilnew legislation could be introduced, the Import, Export and CustomsPower (Defence) Act, 1939, should be used to require that thesecattle should be slaughtered, on arrival, at slaughterhouses whichwere within a specified distance from the ports of disembarkation.The extent of this limit would require further consideration if thetrade in live cattle with France and Holland was not to be frustrated;and it would also be desirable to emphasise our willingness to enterinto consultation with the Continental countries concerned with aview to devising mutually acceptable means of regulating the trade.It would not be practicable to slaughter the animals in this countryand to substitute a trade in carcase meat, since the Continental buyerspreferred to slaughter the animals themselves in order to obtain freshmeat and there were not adequate transport facilities for an exporttrade in chilled meat.
CommercialPoKcy.(previous reference:CC. (57) 37thConclusions,Minute 4.)OverseaTerritories.5. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (C. (57) 107) covering a report by officials about theassociation of oversea territories with the industrial Free Trade area and the European Customs Union.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that further examinationhad confirmed the earlier hypothesis that it would be to our advantage to continue to exclude oversea territories from the Free Trade area and to press for mitigation of the damage to the trade of our ownColonies caused by the association of oversea territories with theCustoms Union under the Treaty of Rome.The Colonial Secretary said that, while most of the Colonieswished to remain outside the Free Trade Area, Kenya and HongKong had asked to be admitted to it. It would probably be necessaryto refuse this request; but the refusal would need to be worded withcare if we were not to create an impression that we were indifferent to Colonial interests. For the same reason we should also press themembers of the Customs Union to concede the necessary arrangements for mitigating the damage to the trade of our colonies which would result from the Treaty of Rome, if necessary making these arrangements a condition of our consenting to the waiverrequired by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade for theassociation of oversea territories with the European Customs Union.Discussion showed that, despite the degree of public concern forthe welfare of animals, the Cabinet were doubtful whether regulations should be introduced for controlling the trade in live cattle in advanceof consultations with the Continental countries concerned. Untilconditions in our own slaughterhouses had been improved it was questionable whether we were entitled to attempt to prescribe a higher standard than Continental countries observed in the treatment of cattle to be slaughtered, and it might give rise to friction if, without consultation with our partners in this trade, we were to introduceregulations which we should have no means of enforcing after the animals had arrived on the Continent. In particular, at a time when we were concerned to promote the development of a free trade area in Europe, it was not in our interest to take unilateral action whichmight appear to be directed against France. Moreover, although theImport, Export and Customs Powers (Defence) Act, 1939, had been used on an earlier occasion to bring under control the trade in horses,it was doubtful whether emergency powers of this nature could be properly used for the purposes now in question and there was little prospect that Parliamentary time could be made available for permanent legislation in the near future. In these circumstances,action should be limited to putting into effect the recommendationsof the Burleigh Committee for the humane treatment of the animalswhile they remained in this country, and to initiating discussions withthe Continental countries concerned with a view to devising mutuallyacceptable arrangements for regulating the trade.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Ministerof Agriculture to open consultations with the european governments concerned with a view to devising mutuallyacceptable arrangements for regulating the export trade from this country in live cattle, and to report further tothe Cabinet in due course.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Ministerof Agriculture to obtain the opinion of the Law officers on the question whether it would be legitimate to invokethe Import, Export and Customs Powers (Defence) Act,1939 for the regulation of the export trade in live cattle.
5CC. (38) 57In discussion it was suggested that, while we could not agree inpresent circumstances to the admission of any oversea territories tothe Free Trade Area, their indefinite exclusion might create freshproblems, particularly in the case of imports from Hong Kong. Itwas for consideration, therefore, whether we should indicate that ata subsequent stage we might be prepared to re-examine this question in the light of developments. On the other hand we should need toavoid any action which might strengthen the claim advanced by france that French oversea territories, particularly Algeria, shouldbe included in the Free Trade Area.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (57) 107.6. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of memoranda bythe Minister of Power, the Minister of Transport and the Presidentof the Board of Trade (C. (57) 82, 83 and 86) on the price policy ofthe fuel and power industries. They also had before them amemorandum by the Postmaster-General (C. (57) 109) on the practicefollowed by the Post Office in this matter.The Minister of Power said that it was in accordance with soundcommercial principles that the nationalised power industries shouldbe required to fix the prices of their products and services at a level which would enable them both to cover rising operating costs and tomaintain and replace their capital assets. The electricity and gasindustries had in fact tended to follow such a practice, and theincrease in the price of electricity which Electricity Boards were currently making was directly attributable to this policy. TheNational Coal Board, on the other hand, had not hitherto followedthis course; but, since a high proportion of the new investmentrequired in the coal industry was directed towards the replacement of wasting assets, it was desirable that they should now be broughtinto conformity.The Minister of Transport said that he did not dissent from theview that the nationalised fuel and power industries should be obligedto cover their operating costs. But the extension to rail transportof a policy of fixing charges at a level which would cover, in addition,the cost of replacing capital equipment would necessitate veryconsiderable increases in rail charges which would have graverepercussions throughout the economy. It was arguable that, as amatter of principle, the nationalised industries should be required tokeep their prices as low as possible, in the interests of the generalpolicy of price stability.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the current wage increases of 5 per cent., emerging at the end of a period in whichprices had remained stable though costs had gradually risen, were making it impossible to maintain prices at their previous levels. Itwas already evident that prices in the private, as well as in the public,sector of the economy would rise and it was important to ensure thatrising prices were immediately linked in the public mind with the wage increases which had been responsible for them. It might thenprove possible to establish a new plateau of stability at a somewhat higher price level than before. It would be wise to take theopportunity of this new upward movement of prices to put the financing of the capital requirements of the nationalised industries onto a sounder footing and to relieve the Exchequer, as he had donein his Budget, of some part of the inflationary borrowing which thepresent practice entailed.The Minister of Labour said that, while he accepted the justification for price increases which resulted directly from increases in operating costs, including wages, he was not convinced of the wisdom of raising prices still further to enable the nationalised
industries to finance a greater proportion of their capital requirements. The cost-of-living index had tended to fall in recent months, and it would not necessarily prove impossible to hold pricesstable at or near current levels for a further period. Excessiveincreases in the prices charged by the nationalised industries, forwhich the Government were regarded as directly responsible, were liable to stimulate wage claims, and a further round of such claims would be provoked by a decision to require the nationalised industries to adjust their prices to cover the cost of replacing their capital equipment. To some extent the Government^ decision inthis matter had been prejudiced by the price increases which theelectricity industry was already making; but the proposal to increasethe price of coal by 2s. a ton as a contribution towards financing thecapital requirements of the industry would be bound to jeopardise the prospects of securing the collaboration of the trade union movement in the comprehensive investigation of the relation betweenprofits, prices and wages which the Government were contemplating.The President of the Board of Trade said that he was disturbed by the damage to our export trade which might arise from an increasein industrial costs resulting from higher charges for the products and services of the nationalised industries. Nevertheless, it was soundcommercial practice that these industries should to a greater extent be self-financing, and he was prepared to accept the need for theproposed increases in charges provided that their inflationary effectswere kept under restraint by a strict monetary policy.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were agreed upon the need to require the nationalised fuel and power industries to raise their prices by the amounts necessary to recover the increases in theiroperating costs, yielding a further  92 millions of revenue in the year1957-58. The desirability of requiring these industries to providea further  48 millions for the maintenance and replacement of capital equipment was more doubtful in view of the possible consequences for the Governmenfs price stabilisation policy and for their hope ofsecuring the collaboration of the trade unions in further measures forthe support of this policy. Nevertheless some further upward movement of prices in general now appeared to be inevitable, and itcould be argued that the Government should take this opportunityto establish the practice of regarding the expense of maintaining andreplacing capital equipment as an operating cost of the nationalised industries. In view, however, of the exceptional importance whichattached to increases in the price of coal, the proposed additionalincrease of 2s. a ton attributable to the greater self-financing of themining industry should be spread over a period of five years,especially since some part of the total proposed increase of Is. \0d.a ton was intended in part to recover an operating deficit which hadalready been incurred.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (57) 82, subject to thelimitation to M. a ton of the additional increase in 1957-58in the price of coal to be imposed in respect of the financing of capital requirements, making the total increase in theprice of coal 6s. 6d. a ton for that year.Malta. 7   -p^g Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the(Previous Colonial  Secretary  (C.   (57)   113)   about  the  basis  on  which reference: constitutional negotiations with the Maltese Government should beCC. (57) 35th resumed, together with a memorandum by the Minister of Defence,Conclusions, (C. (57) 114) summarising his discussion of defence economies with minute 6.) the Maltese Prime Minister during his recent visit to Malta.
The Colonial Secretary said that, if the Maltese Governmentwere not prepared to accept the offer of constitutional and economic development which we had made during the recent negotiations, thesuggestion that the political and economic aspects of integrationshould be explored in successive stages was preferable to either ofthe alternative courses which now appeared to be open to us, i.e., torest on the present dyarchy or to abandon integration and to allowMalta to become independent subject to the conclusion of a defence agreement with the United Kingdom. On this assumption we should now offer the Maltese Government a choice between, on the onehand, the proposals for integration which we had put forward duringthe recent negotiations and, on the other hand, interim arrangementsdesigned to cover a period of five years, at the end of which the twoGovernments would give further consideration to the future of Malta.These arrangements would re-incorporate the constitutional proposals which we had already put forward, subject to the exclusion of Maltese representation at Westminster but with the possibleadditional concession that Malta.should be regarded as one of theBritish Isles which did not enjoy representation in the UnitedKingdom Parliament. They would also renew in substance theeconomic proposals which we had already made, although we should need to define with caution the extent to which we should be preparedto provide financial assistance in the event of severe unemploymentdeveloping in Malta as a result of the defence economies.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Maltese Government would show themselves unmindfulof their own interests if, after their recent discussion with theMinister of Defence about the impact of the defence economies on Malta, they did not accept our offer of integration with the UnitedKingdom.(b) On the other hand, we should not sacrifice the benefits to be gained from the defence economies by undertaking extensivecommitments in relief of unemployment in Malta or by diverting to malta defence work which could more economically be carried outin United Kingdom establishments. It was important that the maltese Government should clearly understand that we intended to implement the economies which we had announced, and that,although we would co-operate with them in mitigating the effects asfar as possible, we could not undertake to guarantee that Maltashould be wholly insulated from the consequences.(c) Nevertheless, if severe unemployment developed in Malta, weshould be under a strong moral obligation to assist the Island to dealwith the social and economic problems which would arise.(d) Our new offer should be presented as a final effort to conclude discussions in which we had already treated Malta withgreat generosity. It should not be allowed to become the starting point of a new round of negotiations in which we should be expectedto make further concessions to Malta.(e) The final agreement with the Maltese Government would be embodied in an exchange of letters, the wording of which would need to be carefully considered by the Malta Committee.The Cabinet-(1) Approved, subject to the points made in their discussion, theproposals in C. (57) 113.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to submit, for consideration bythe Malta Committee, the text of the exchange of lettersin which the final agreement with the Maltese Govern-ment would be embodied.
8. The Minister of Labour said that officials were nowexamining the proposal to establish a new impartial body to considerthe wider economic problems involved in the inter-related factors ofwages, costs and prices, and it should shortly be possible to arrange the initial discussion with industry about the constitution of this board, its composition and terms of reference. It would be advisable that the Prime Minister should himself preside over this discussion.He proposed to take unofficial soundings of both sides of industry toprepare the way for this meeting and would submit proposals forconsideration by the Cabinet at a subsequent meeting.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,6th May, 1957.industrial relations.(previous reference:CC.
