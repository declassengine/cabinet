Nuclear 1.   The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that he hadWeapons authorised the representative of the United Kingdom GovernmentTests, on the Disarmament Sub-Committee of the United Nations to submit(Previous        to the Sub-Committee formal proposals for the registration, limitationReference:      and eventual cessation of nuclear tests.   These proposed that an c.c.. (57) 34th   agreement should be made between the Governments of the united conclusions,    Kingdom, the United States and the Soviet Union for the registrationMinute4.)       of nuclear tests; that a committee of technical experts should beappointed to consider possible methods of limiting tests; and thatthe cessation of all tests should follow the prohibition of theproduction of fissile material for weapons purposes as part of a general disarment agreement.  It was contemplated that these proposals should also include a statement that in the meantime the UnitedKingdom Government would voluntarily undertake to conductnuclear tests only in such a manner as would ensure that worldradiation did not rise to more than a small fraction of the levels thatmight be hazardous.   He would consider, in consultation with theForeign Secretary, how and when it should be made known that this initiative had been taken by the United Kingdom Government.In discussion it was pointed out that the offer to exercise restraint in carrying out tests was no more than a unilateral offer and as suchwas different in character from the three proposals for international action or agreement. It might therefore be excluded from the formalproposals which were to be submitted in writing to the Sub-Committee, though it could be mentioned orally by the UnitedKingdom representative in discussion in the Sub-Committee.The Cabinet Agreed that proposals relating to nuclear tests should beput before the Disarmament Sub-Committee of the united nations in the terms suggested by the Prime Minister, on theunderstanding that the offer to exercise restraint inconducting tests should not be included in the writtenproposals but should be mentioned orally by the UnitedKingdom representative in the discussions in the Sub-Committee.Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.The Home Secretary said that in his Statement on Business that day he proposed to announce that the Government accepted therecommendations of the Select Committee on Procedure which were concerned with simplifying the procedure for debating the service estimates. The revised procedure recommended by the SelectCommittee was acceptable to the Opposition and it would be broughtinto effect for the debate on the Air Estimates on 9th May. Theprocedure for debating Civil Estimates would remain unchanged.Channel 3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisterTunnel. of Transport (C. (57) 104) seeking authority to arrange for an examination to be made of the potential value of a Channel tunneland to announce in Parliament that such an examination had been putin hand.The Minister of Transport said that fresh interest was now beingtaken in the project for a Channel tunnel. The French element inthe Suez Canal Company, with the support of the French railways,were contemplating the reinvestment of the Company&apos;s assets in this project; and an American company had indicated willingness to join in a syndicate to undertake an economic and engineering survey of it.
commercial policy.previous reference:CC. (57) 29thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Cabinet had before them notes by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (C. (57) 106 and 107) covering reports by officials on(i) the European Free Trade Area and (ii) the European economic community in relation to overseas territories.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there was aconsiderable body of opinion in Europe which wished to see theEuropean Customs Union established without a Free Trade Area.The negotiations about the latter were proceeding very slowly, mainly by reason of the dilatory attitude of the French Government. If,however, the Customs Union came into being unaccompanied by a free Trade Area, the United Kingdom would be confronted with aA report favouring the project had also been prepared by the british transport Commission. Preliminary estimates suggested that the costmight be in the region of  200 millions, but dollar assistance mightbe forthcoming. The creation of a free trade area in Europe wouldenhance the competitive importance of transport costs and we oughtnow to re-examine our cross-Channel communications from thispoint of view. We should act quickly if we were to forestall an initiative by the French Government.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were reluctant to conclude,without further enquiry, that the balance of considerations would favour the construction of a Channel tunnel. Our economic interest might be better served by devoting our share of a possible expenditureof  200 millions to the improvement of our roads and ports. germany would probably become our most important market in the proposedfree trade area and the development of an adequate ferry service tothe Rhine might prove a more valuable investment. The constructionof a Channel tunnel would make it easier for European manufacturers to compete effectively in our home market. The proposed surveyshould therefore extend to the consideration of the most advantageousmethod of conveying our goods to the Continent on the assumption of our participation in a free trade area.In further discussion the point was also made that it was notnecessarily in our interests that the assets of the Suez Canal company should be reinvested either in a Channel tunnel or any other enterprise.It might be more to our advantage, as a substantial shareholder, thatthe Company should be liquidated and its assets distributed. Aseparate examination should therefore be made of our interests inthis matter and of the legal entitlement of the Suez Canal company to divert their assets to alternative forms of investment. Meanwhile,until the Government were in a position to indicate their consideredattitude in the matter, it would be inadvisable to volunteer any announcement in Parliament about the Channel tunnel.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Transport, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to arrange for an urgent examination of the most advantageous method ofconveying goods to and from the Continent on theassumption of our participation in a free trade area, taking into account the revival of interest in the construction ofa Channel tunnel.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for an examination of the legal entitlement of the Suez canal company to divert their assets to other forms of investment, and of our interests in this matter generally.(3) Agreed that no statement about the Channel tunnel project should be volunteered in Parliament until the Cabinet had considered the matter further in the light of the reports to be furnished under Conclusions (1) and (2) above.
European economic bloc which would discriminate against our exports, and we should be liable to suffer severe damage as a resultboth of the loss of European markets and of the intensifiedcompetition from members of the Customs Union in markets overseas.The ratification of the Treaty of Rome which established the customs union was likely to be debated in the French and GermanParliaments later in the summer, and it was important that themembers of the Customs Union should, if possible, be persuadedpublicly to endorse the Free Trade Area before ratifying the treaty in order that they might not be able subsequently to break off thenegotiations for the establishment of a Free Trade Area or to imposeunacceptable terms as a condition of accepting it. Diplomatic action should be taken to this end. In particular, it would be helpful if thePrime Minister would make representations to this effect to theFederal German Chancellor during his visit to Bonn. It might alsobe desirable that Her Majesty&apos;s Representatives accredited to themembers of the Customs Union should be instructed to seek to dispelthe prevalent impression that our only purpose was to prevent theCustoms Union from coming into being at all.In discussion there was general agreement that the Treaty of rome derived basically from political considerations and that itsreal objective was the creation of an integrated European Community,capable of exerting a considerable political influence in its own right.We must therefore expect resistance to any action on our part whichcould be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the impetus of this movement or, by linking the new European grouping too closely withthe Atlantic Community, to make it less independent of the UnitedStates. Nevertheless, if this effort to establish a European &quot; thirdforce &quot; succeeded in its present form without our being associated insome positive fashion with the new alignment of power in Europe,the consequences would be very grave. Our existing European policy would be undermined and our special relationship with the UnitedStates would be endangered if the United States believed that our influence was less than that of the European Community.In these circumstances it was necessary to consider urgentlywhat further measures could be taken to persuade the members ofthe Customs Union that an industrial Free Trade Area would bethe natural complement to their own policies and that they wouldbe ill-advised to confine their efforts to creating the Customs union in a context which excluded the participation of the United Kingdom.On the one hand, they should be reminded of the importance of theUnited Kingdom market to their exporters, and they should be warned that, if they pursued policies which did not pay sufficientregard to our interests, it might become necessary for us to adoptprotective measures against them, even to the extent of reversingthe policy of trade liberalisation which we had pursued in recentyears. On the other hand, it would also be important to ascertain what positive inducements we could offer to the members of theCustoms Union to participate more actively in the negotiations forthe establishment of a Free Trade Area. It would be difficult tooffer any concession on agricultural products without alienating theCommonwealth and gravely offending the Governments own supporters in Parliament. It might, however, be possible to agreethat other countries in Europe, not being members of the customs union, should adopt arrangements as regards agricultural products which would be acceptable to the members of the Union withoutinjuring our own agricultural interests or the interests of the othermembers of the Commonwealth. In addition, a re-examination ofour association with the European Coal and Steel Community mightbe undertaken. It might also be desirable to adopt a more positiveattitude towards the contribution of finance for co-operativeEuropean investment either in Europe itself or in the overseasdependencies of the members of the Customs Union, e.g., for thedevelopment of the oil resources of the Sahara.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,2nd May, 1957.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thesituation which had developed was serious. During his visit to Bonnhe would speak frankly to the German Chancellor about the political implications of an attempt to create a Customs Union which excludedthe possibility of an industrial Free Trade Area of the kind whichthe United Kingdom Government had proposed. This must leadinevitably to the disintegration of the European policy which, in common with our allies, we had hitherto pursued, involving the collapse of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and of the existing system of defence of Western Europe against the Soviet Union. Itwas therefore in the interests of all Western European governments that the conception of the Customs Union should be extended toinclude an industrial Free Trade Area within which the UnitedKingdom could maintain and strengthen its association with western europe. But if the members of the Customs Union felt unable toco-operate effectively with us to this end, they must expect us toadopt such measures of self-protection as we could devise in termsof our commercial policies. Similar representations should be madeto the French Government.In the meantime, officials should be instructed to study thevarious suggestions which had been made in the Cabinefs discussionfor indicating our willingness to make a practical contribution to agreater degree of European integration, as an inducement to themembers of the Customs Union to commit themselves to accept a free Trade Area. They should also consider what policy we should pursue if, in the event, the Customs Union came into existencewithout a Free Trade Area, including the means which we should adopt to mitigate its adverse effects upon ourselves.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for officials to examine, as a matter of urgency (i) the suggestions which had been made in their discussion for offering some further inducementsto the members of the Customs Union to commit themselves to accept a Free Trade Area;(ii) the steps which we should take, if these negotiationsfailed, to mitigate the adverse effects upon theUnited Kingdom of a Customs Union without a free Trade Area.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.
