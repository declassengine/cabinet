Shipping.(previous reference:CM. (45) 5thConclusions,Minute 4.)1. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of War Transport (CP. (45) 135) on shipping and shippingpolicy.The Memorandum proposed that, while dispensing to the utmostwith other forms of shipping aid from America, in view of the changed Lend-Lease situation, we should try to secure continuanceof the charters of American ships now under the British flag for alimited period, not exceeding three years, with an option to termin-ate them earlier on suitable terms. With regard to the disposal of surplus shipping, we should make it clear that we cannot afford toaccept any reductions in the amount of tonnage that we are able tokeep&apos; at sea, though we should offer to do what we could to ease thesurplus by scrapping tonnage which it is no longer economical to run. We should take no steps to terminate the United MaritimeAuthority Agreement before its expiration in February 1946, andshould support its continuance until that date should any other country propose an earlier termination. In the meantime, we should consist-operate with other countries in simplifying the operation of theAgreement with a view to promoting a return to more normal com-mercial conditions. Should the question of prolonging the agree-ment in a simplified form or substituting for it some other form ofinternational co-operation be raised, we should adopt a non-com-mital attitude until we were better able to gauge the prospects ofany arrangement being reached which would be acceptable to us.There would be a meeting of the United Maritime Executive board in Washington very shortly, and in view of this and of the Lend-Lease developments, it was desirable that an immediate decision should be reached on the proposals put forward in the Memorandum.In discussion, there was general support for the proposals setout in CP. (45) 135. In particular, any suggestion by the UnitedStates that we should acquire the vessels which we desired to con-tinue to use should not be accepted, since it would involve us in a formidable dollar obligation. If it were impossible to persuade theUnited States to agree to charter the vessels the matter should bebrought before the Cabinet again.Further points in discussion were : (a) It was estimated that at the end of 1945 the total availabletonnage on United Kingdom register of ships of 1,600 gross tonsand over, excluding tankers, would be about 10^- million gross tons,to which fell to be added -7 million gross tons of Canadian shipschartered for the duration of hostilities and nearly two million grosstons hitherto lent to us by the United States on Lend-Lease terms.The total German tonnage available to us and included in the10^ million gross tons was 400,000 gross tons, and there was no prospect of our obtaining any appreciable addition to our tonnagefrom Japanese shipping.(&amp;) Every effort was being made by the Ministry of War Trans-port to ensure that the best use was made of the available tonnage,but the termination of Lend-Lease would compel us for financial reasons to rely to a greater extent on supplies from more distantcountries with the result that our effective carrying capacity wouldbe reduced. The turn-round of ships had been affected by &quot;goslow &quot; movements, but it was hoped that conditions in the dockswould improve during the next few months.(c) The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the admiralty would discuss with the Ministry of War Transport certain difficul-ties which might arise with regard to the treatment of auxiliaryvessels which the Fleet now had on Lend-Lease terms.(d) It was explained that there had been a fall in the output from shipbuilding yards during the present year, due partly to theswitch to construction of more specialised types of vessel and partly to the fact that the long hours which had been worked during thewar could no longer be maintained. There were very heavy out-standing commitments for ship repairs and to concentrate on this problem was the most profitable way of securing an increase in our[30725-3] b 2
shipping resources. For this purpose it might be necessary to restrict to some extent the number of workers made available earlier in the year for the conversion of trawlers with a view to increasingthe available supplies of fish. The licensing system for new building was still in operation, but any British owner who was willing tobuild could obtain a licence without delay.The Cabinet-Endorsed the proposals with regard to shipping and shipping policy put forward by the Minister of war transport in CP. (45) 135.Europe. 2.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Secre-Danger of tary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP. (45) 148) drawing attentionEpidemics.      to the risk of epidemics caused by conditions in Central Europe.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that thereports which he was receiving from Europe showed that therewas a real danger of epidemics during the forthcoming winter.It was not possible to supply coal or food to the Continentin sufficient quantities to counteract the danger, and it would benecessary to concentrate on the organisation of medical help andto decide what steps we could take in this country to improve the resistance of our own people. The responsibility for counter-measures on the Continent lay partly with U.N.R.R.A., partly withthe Control Commissions and partly with the Governments of the liberated countries, and it seemed desirable that early steps shouldbe taken to make sure that all the available resources of these bodies,together with any resources which we might be able to spare, shouldbe mobilised so that they might be used to the best advantage. Sofar as our own people were concerned, it might well be worth con-sidering some increase of rations in this country, particularly offats, in order to build up resistance over the coming winter even at&apos;   the cost of making heavy inroads into our stocks.In discussion the following points arose : 1 -(a) The Minister of Health said that so far as the Cabinet was concerned, responsibility seemed to rest primarily with U.N.R.R.A.,to whom his Department were giving, all possible assistance. Hewould deprecate the establishment of any additional organisation,the work of which might overlap with that of U.N.R.R.A.(b) In view of the world situation, there seemed very little prospect of our being able to increase the ration of fats in thiscountry.- (c) Steps had been taken to impress on the Governments ofRussia, Poland and Czechoslovakia the undesirability of accentu-ating the problems of Central Europe by further forced transfers of population, and the point would continue to be pressed.id) The possibility of reducing the scale of rations to membersof the Armed Forces was being examined, and the Service ministers would also review the arrangements which had already been madefor preventing the waste of food in the Services. The question ofmaking some reduction in the scale of rations to merchant seamenshould also be examined.(e) The First Lord of the Admiralty drew attention to the factthat an international Co-operative Conference was meeting inLondon during the following week. It would be useful if a repre-sentative of the Government could give some indication to theConference of what we were doing to help the peoples of Europe.The Prime Minister said that it was clearly desirable that thereshould be a general review of the position, in order to make sure thatall possible steps were being taken to assist the peoples of Europeduring the coming winter, and to protect our own people againstthe dangers envisaged in CP. (45) 148.
The &quot;Daily 3.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the worker&quot; Secretary of State for War (CP. (45) 136) reviewing the history ofand Accredited the discussions that had taken place during the war regarding theWar granting of permission to the Daily Worker to have accredited warCorrespondents, correspondents.   It had been decided in January 1944, as a matter(Previous       of principle, that no correspondents of the Daily Worker should be reference:      accredited because of the danger to security.   The reasons for this.M.(45)49th decision had been explained at the time in the House of Commons.Conclusions,    Immediately after VE-day a further application bad been made by minute 7.)      the Daily Worker asking for reconsideration in the light of the changed situation.   No decision had been given upon this at thetime of the recent change of Government.   Early in August theapplication had been renewed by the Editor in a letter to the Secre-tary of State for War.The Secretary of State for War said that now! that hostilitieshad ended, he felt that the grounds on which the earlier requests ofthe Daily Worker had been refused were no longer applicable. Apartfrom this, the continued refusal to grant the request would be hardlyconsistent with certain matters discussed at the Berlin Conference.In these circumstances, he recommended that he should be authorisedto accede to the request of the Daily Worker that they might be permitted to have accredited war correspondents, and that in thismatter they should receive comparable treatment to that accorded tothe other daily newspapers.i After discussion, the Cabinet-Approved the proposals of the Secretary of State for Warand invited him to proceed accordingly.War Graves 4.   The Cabinet considered a Memorandum prepared by theon German predecessor of the Secretary of State for War (CP. (45) 69) on the soil. subject of war graves on German soil, recommending; (i) That the Chairman of the Imperial War graves commission should be informed that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment took note that the Commission wished to adhere to their present policy of refusing requests fromnext-of-kin that bodies of officers and men ofHis Majesty&apos;s Forces buried overseas should be returnedto their home countries for burial, and were prepared tosupport this policy,(ii) That graves in military cemeteries in Germany should be concentrated in suitable military cemeteries in thegeneral zones in which the men fell, irrespective of whether these were or were not in the British zone ofoccupation or were East or West of the Rhine.He suggested that the Minister of State should review the whole position, in consultation with the Service Ministers, the Minister ofHealth, the Minister of Food and the Minister of War Transport.The review should cover the question whether there was adequateco-ordination among the several agencies concerned with theprevention of epidemics in Europe, and whether all available resources were being mobilised. It should also include the questionof what action should be taken to protect our own people. Once the review had been completed a report should be submitted to theCabinet.The Cabinet Agreed that the Minister of State should undertake a review on the lines proposed by the Prime Minister.
The Secretary of State for War said that he endorsed theproposals made by his predecessor. The policy to which theImperial War Graves Commission were anxious to adhere in thematter of repatriation of bodies was one that had been constantlyapplied since the last war. The arguments for it were very strong and he felt that we should support its maintenance. As regardsthe second point, the main question was in respect of burials inGermany and the question arose whether, even if bodies were notrepatriated to their own countries, all the graves should be con-centrated in countries West of the Rhine. On a balance of considerations, he was clear that the wise course would be to concentrate graves in military cemeteries in Germany in the zonesin which the men fell.After discussion, the Cabinet Approved the proposals of the Secretary of State for Warand invited him to proceed accordingly.Parliament. 5.   The Cabinet had before them a joint Memorandum by the electoral Home   Secretary   and   the   Secretary  of   State   for   ScotlandReform. (CP. (45) 129) submitting proposals for legislation to provide for(Previous an effective electoral register during 1946 and for certain relatedReference: matters and recommending the appointment of a Committee toW.M.(45)58th advise what changes should be made in the machinery of registra-Gonclusions, tion to bring it into conformity with peace-time requirements.minute 6.) 27le ffome Secretary explained that the proposed Bill would extend the validity of the register published annually in Octoberuntil the 15th October following and so avoid the need for thepreparation of ad hoc registers for elections initiated in the period the 1st January to the 9th September. Experience in the prepara-tion of the registers during the current year showed.that with thedepleted registration staffs and the shortage of labour for printingit would be physically impossible to prepare an ad hoc registerfor a general election in 1946. Nor did it seem justifiable to providefor a fresh register every six months. It was also proposed thatthe Parliamentary Electors (War Time Registration) Act, 1944,which was due to expire on the 31st December, 1945, unlessextended by resolutions of both Houses of Parliament, should beextended until the 31st December, 1946, by a provision in theproposed. Bill. A supplementary Service register, including the names of Service voters whose declarations were received too latefor inclusion in the October Service register and of persons dis-charged from the Forces or from- the merchant navy after the30th June, 1945, would be published on the 1st March, 1946, so asto be available for the local elections held in the spring as wellas for any Parliamentary elections initiated after that date. TheBill would also enable postal voting facilities to be extended on application to all persons who had removed from the addresses atwhich they were registered, subject to the grant of a discretion to the registration officer to reject an application if it appearedto him that the elector could, without serious difficulty, vote in person. In addition, provision would be made for the compilationof fresh jury lists for England and Wales based on the 1946 register.The proposed legislation would adapt the existing registrationarrangements to the present transitional period. It was, however,also necessary to settle the permanent lines of post-war electoral registration, and a committee should be appointed to advise on this.The committee should report in time to enable the necessary legis-lation to be prepared and passed in 1946 and to come into effect from 1947. The legislation could deal also with the outstandingrecommendations of the Speaker&apos;s Conference.In discussion the following points were raised : (a) If registration officers were given unfettered discretion to reject applications for facilities for postal voting, there might be
considerable inconsistency of practice in different parts of thecountry. Would it not be advisable to give the Home Secretary andthe Secretary of State for Scotland power to impose by regulationor by statutory direction at least some limitation on the discretion of the registration officer?The Home Secretary said that he would examine this point.General guidance, would, of course, be given to registration officers with regard to the exercise of their discretion.(b) Would the facilities for postal voting given to civil servants and other workers stationed abroad during the last general electionbe continued ?The Home Secretary said that he was doubtful whether itwould be possible to continue these arrangements, since theyinvolved delay in announcing the results of elections. He would,however, look into the matter.(c) The proposed Bill would not deal with the redistribution of seats. Under the Representation of the People Act, 1945, the workconnected with the general redistribution of seats would begin onthe 15th October, 194.8. This date could be postponed by order,but the Home Secretary did not contemplate any postponement.(d) In constituting the proposed committee to advise on changes in the machinery of electoral registration the LiberalNational Members should not be treated as one of the main political parties entitled to separate representation. This would not precludea Liberal National Member from sharing in the representationallotted to the Conservative Party.(e) The proposed committee would not deal with questions ofpolicy connected with electoral reform (e.g., the business premisesvote, the representation of the City of London), nor with the out-stancling recommendations of the Speaker&apos;s Conference, but wouldbe confined to making recommendations with regard to the adapta-tion of the machinery of electoral registration to peace-time requirements.The Cabinet :Subject to the points made in discussion, approved thepreparation of the legislation proposed by the HomeSecretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland, andthe constitution of a committee to advise on changes inthe machinery of electoral registration on the lines set outin Part VI of CP. (45) 129.Selling-Price 6.   The Minister of Health said that he felt that it would not of Houses. be possible to introduce legislation to implement the recommenda-(Previous tions of the Morris Report on the selling&quot; price of houses duringEeference: the current Session.   There might be a good deal of criticism of w.M. (45) 15th the  Government  if  legislation  were not  introduced,   and  he conclusions, accordingly proposed to circulate a Memorandum to his colleaguesMinute 3.) setting out the reasons which had led him to this conclusion.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,6th September, 1945.
