1. At their meeting on the 4th October the Cabinet had invited,the Palestine Committee to report on a proposal made by the Seere&quot;tary of State for Foreign Affairs for the appointment of an Anglo-American Commission to consider means of alleviating the situation of the Jews in Europe and to examine the problem of immigration into Palestine in that context.The Lord President of the Council summarised the recom-mendations made in the report (CP. (45) 216) now submitted by thePalestine Committee. It was proposed in the report that the UnitedStates Government should be invited to join with His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in setting up a Committee of Enquiry :(i) to examine the position of the Jews in Europe;(ii) to make an estimate of the number that could not besettled in the countries from which they originated;(iii) to examine the possibility of relieving the position inEurope by immigration into other countries outside europe including the United States; and(iv) to consider other available means of meeting the needs ofthe immediate situation.The Foreign Secretary stressed the importance of seeking asolution of the problem of Palestine as part of the policy of HisMajesty&apos;s Government for the Middle East as a whole. At thesame time, it was essential to take steps to allay the agitation in theUnited States which was poisoning our relations with the UnitedStates Government in other fields. He did not accept the view that none of the Jews now in Europe could ever find a permanent homethere. The report made by Mr. Earl Harrison to President Trumanhad not been based on a proper investigation, and there would be great advantage in holding a careful enquiry in which the UnitedStates were associated with us. The United States should make some contribution to receiving those Jews who had to be removed from Europe. In this connection we should point out that, in assess-ing our ability to contribute, account must be taken of the fact thatin accordance with the pledge given by Mr. Churchill the BritishCommonwealth had a responsibility for finding homes for largenumbers of Poles, some of whom would be Jews.The Secretary of State for the Colonies and he had seenDr. Weizmann and had understood that, if a new and determinedapproach were made to the whole problem, he would co-operate in seeking to arrange a truce in Palestine pending the outcome of thediscussions.The method of approaching the Arab representatives on the&apos;continuance of Jewish immigration into Palestine would require careful consideration. It might be desirable to send a special envoyto Ibn. Saud.The Colonial Secretary said that he hoped it would be possibleto give Dr. Weizmann some definite information as to the lines onwhich His Majesty&apos;s Government were working before he left forthe United States on the 22nd October, The Cabinet must, how-ever, appreciate that it would be some time before even the interim arrangements could be worked out and that the situation in Pales-tine, which was already serious, was likely to deteriorate. Armedbands of Jews had already attacked camps where illegal immigrantswere detained.The following points were raised in discussion : (a) It should be made clear in any public announcement thatthe enquiry into the position of the Jews in Europe would be con-fined broadly to the British and United States zones of occupation.(b) The proposed Committee should take into consideration thepossibility of increasing the scope for immigration into Palestineby the development of the Negeb area.[30777-2]  . b 2Palestine.(previous reference:C.M.(45)38thConclusions,Minute 7.)
(c) The proposal in paragraph 7 (b) of CP. (45) 216 that action should be taken with a view to securing a modification of the rate of immigration was not intended to lead to any reduction in the rate.(d) If the Committee began their enquiries in Europe, therewas a risk that they would be impressed with the hardships of theJews in Europe before they realised to the full the difficulties of accommodating them in Palestine or elsewhere; and reports of theirviews might leak out and aggravate the fears of the Arabs. would it not be desirable, therefore, that the Committee should visitPalestine at a very early stage in their investigations and hear repre-sentations from both Arabs and Jews?(e) The Home Secretary drew attention to the increasing pressure for the admission of Jewish refugees from the Continentinto this country. So far he and his predecessors had been able to resist pressure of this kind, but it would become increasingly difficult to hold the position.(f) The Minister of State said that it was hoped that the trusteeship Council of the United Nations Organisation would be suffiently well established by January to be ready to consider any proposals submitted by His Majesty&apos;s Government for an agreementplacing Palestine under trusteeship.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet were grateful to theForeign Secretary for the time and energy which he had devoted tothe formulation of this new approach to the question of Palestine.It was clear that there was general support for the proposal to associate the United States Government in a Committee of Enquiry,and for the view that the problem of Palestine should be dealt withas part of the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government for the middle east as a whole. The form of any announcement to be made was,however, of the utmost importance and the draft annexed to CP.(45) 216 would require some revision. Thus, it should bring out more prominently the fact that this constituted an entirety new approach to the problem. It should also state the actual positionof the Jews in the British zone of occupation in Europe, and theextent to which the United States Government were committed to consultation with the Arabs on the question of Palestine. It wasalso for consideration whether there could not be a simultaneousstatement with regard to our general policy in the Middle East,which would indicate the steps which we proposed to take to assistthe Arab populations in that area. It was desirable that theGovernments policy should be announced without delay, but theannouncement in Parliament, could, if necessary, be postponed untilthe week beginning the 21st October. Meanwhile, it was of theutmost importance that the strictest secrecy should be observed withregard to the proposals.The Foreign Secretary said that he would like to consider theplan further in the light of the views expressed by the Cabinet.He was not sure whether his negotiations with regard to the Levantand Egypt could be quickly brought to a stage which would permit of simultaneous announcements with regard to policy in Palestineconsider this point.The Cabinet-(1) Approved in principle the policy outlined in the report ofthe Palestine Committee (CP. (45) 216).(2) Agreed that the United States Government should forth-with be invited to join with His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin setting up a Committee of Enquiry on the lines proposed in that report.(3) Agreed that the Governments of the Dominions and theGovernment of India and the High Commissioner forPalestine should be informed of this approach to theUnited States Government.and policy in the Middlewould, however,
155cm. w (my.international labour conference.(previous reference:W.M.(44)50thConclusions,Minute 1.)(4) Took note that, in the light of the discussion, the foreign secretary, in consultation with the Lord President of theCouncil and the Colonial Secretary, would give furtherconsideration to the procedure to be followed by theCommittee of Enquiry and to the form and content ofthe proposed announcement of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment&apos;s policy on Palestine.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Labour and National Service (CP. (45) 212) outlining the instructions which he proposed to give to the British Delegatesregarding the principal items on the agenda of the 27th Session ofthe International Labour Conference, which was to open in Parison the 15th October.Discussion turned on the extent to which the British delegates should be instructed to press the point that the International LabourConference should not concern itself with matters which were primarily the concern of other international bodies, existing orprojected, forming part of the United Nations Organisation.The Minister of Education took exception on this ground to thedraft resolution, mentioned in paragraph 5 of CP. (45) 212,advocating a comprehensive plan for the general organisation ofthe protection of children and young persons as future workers or as young workers already in employment. The scope of this draft resolution was admittedly very wide, and covered health, social welfare and education. It was inappropriate that the InternationalLabour Conference should seek to deal with the educational aspect of this question; and this was particularly undesirable now that theUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural organisation had been established for the international discussion of educationalquestions.The Minister of State said that a similar point arose in connec-tion with the resolution mentioned in paragraph 3 of CP. (45) 212,on the maintenance of a high level of employment. This expressedviews on a number of matters in the economic field which would more appropriately be handled by other international bodies to beestablished under the United Nations Organisation.The general view of the Cabinet was that it would not be enough for the British Delegates to approve these resolutions inprinciple and to content themselves with pointing out that thesematters would be the primary concern of other international bodies.On that basis it would be open for the International Labour Con-ference to approach Governments on matters which were primarilythe concern of other international bodies. The British Delegatesought therefore to propose appropriate amendments of these resolu-tions which, while preserving the right of the International LabourConference to express its view on these matters so far as they affected the labour questions with which that Conference was concerned,would make it clear that the Conference was not proposing itselfto take the lead in international discussion of matters which were primarily the concern of other international bodies established, orto be established, under the United Nations Organisation.The Cabinet -(1) Invited the Minister of Labour and National Service toamend the instructions proposed in paragraphs 3 and 5of CP. (45) 212 so as to take account of the views of theCabinet, as summarised above.(2) Subject to this point, approved the proposals put forward in CP. (45) 212 regarding the instructions to be givento the British Delegates at the forthcoming session ofthe International Labour Conference.[30777-2]b 3
Migration.(previous reference:W.M.(45)46tl)Conclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs (CP. (45) 198).The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that thismemorandum dealt with two points outstanding from a discussion by the War Cabinet, in the time of the Coalition Government,regarding emigration to Australia.First, his predecessor had been asked to press the australian government to agree that ex-Service men and women emigratingfrom this country to Australia should receive the same treatment asregards preference for employment as was accorded to Australianex-Service men and women. This point has been taken up with theAustralian Government who, while adhering to the principle thatpreference for employment must be limited to Australian ex-Servicemen and women, were now willing to extend the benefits of australian social insurance schemes to accepted ex-Service migrantsfrom this country and also to make available certain other benefitsgiven to Australian ex-Service men and women. The details of theAustralian offer were set out in the annex to CP. (45) 198; and theSecretary of State recommend that this offer should now be accepted.Secondly, the War Cabinet had decided that the contributionto be made towards assisted passages to Australia by emigrantsother than ex-Service men and women should be fixed at  15. TheAustralian Government maintained their view that the emigrantscontribution should be limited to  10. The Secretary of State nowproposed to invite the Australian authorities to join him in discus-sions with the shipping interests, with a view to reaching some definite understanding about future passage rates for assistedemigrants; and to leave open for decision, in the light of these discussions, the question whether the Australian proposal to limit the emigrants contribution to  10 could be accepted.Points in discussion were (a) Was it desirable that any steps should be taken to encourageemigration from this country, in view of the prospective decline inthe population? Would it not be preferable to leave emigrationto be determined by the natural attraction of wider economic oppor-tunities, without the artificial stimulus of assisted passages?As against this, it was pointed out that the numbers likely totake advantage of these assisted passages were not so large as tohave any appreciable effect on population trends. The proposedsubsidy towards the cost of passages would not be enough to influencea man&apos;s judgment on the question whether or not he should emigrate:it Avould do no more than make it easier for those to emigrate whohad already made up their minds to do so. A number of men andwomen in the Services wished to settle in the Dominions many ofthem as a result of association with Domini on troops during the war and it was reasonable that they should be assisted to do so.(6) Were there satisfactory assurances that people emigratingfrom this country to Australia would not be forced to seek employ-ment outside the towns 1 Experience between the wars had beenunhappy in this respect.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that therewas now little risk that the Australian authorities would seek to force all emigrants to work on the land. The greater risk wasthat they might seek to obtain too many of our skilled industrial workers, whom we ourselves could ill spare. He had already had occasion to warn the Australian authorities that we shouldnot be able to agree to their exercising their discretion to &quot;approve &quot;emigrants in such a way as to select only skilled industrial workers.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to conclude an agreement with the Australian Governmenton the lines indicated in CP. (45) 198 regarding the emigration of ex-Service men and women from thiscountry to Australia;
(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to ask the Australian authorities to join him in discussions withthe shipping interests regarding future passage ratesfor other assisted emigrants, on the understanding thata further report would be made to the Cabinet in due course on the Australian proposal to limit the emigrantscontribution to  10 per adult.LocalGovernmentElections.Participationby Ministers.4. The Cabinet discussed a Note by the Prime Minister (CP.(45) 203) proposing that Cabinet Ministers and Ministers abovethe rank of Under-Secretary should not participate in municipalelections.The Prime Minister explained that his Note was intended toapply to county council, as well as borough council elections. Therewas, of course, no objection to a Ministets sending a message toa candidate; but he thought it would be preferable that ministers should not accept speaking engagements in the election campaigns.The public duties of Ministers imposed a heavy charge on their time;and it would give an undesirable impression if a number of Ministersengaged in election speeches in various parts of the country duringthe days immediately preceding the elections.In discussion it was pointed out (a) that some Ministers hadalready accepted invitations to speak during the elections, beforethe Prime Ministets Note was circulated; (b) that some ministers would find it specially difficult to decline such invitations, in viewof their past association with local government affairs; and (c) thatit was difficult for a Minister to avoid speaking if he happened tobe in his constituency during the election period.The Cabinet Agreed that, wdiile it should be the general rule that cabinet Ministers and Ministers above the rank of Under-Secretary should not accept speaking engagements inconnection with local government elections, individual ministers might have discretion to depart from this general rule in special circumstances, particularly in their ownconstituencies.Justices of 5.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord Chan-the Peace. cellor (CP. (45) 192) proposing the appointment of a RoyalProposed Commission to enquire into the selection and removal of Justices of appointment the Peace and certain other aspects of the administration of Sum-of Royal mary Jurisdiction.Commission. There was general support for this proposal.  The Lord Presi-sident of the Council, however, said that he hesitated to assent for two reasons. First, he understood that one of the objects was tosecure that recommendations for appointment to the Commissionof the Peace should no longer be made on a political basis; and he himself thought it desirable that a due proportion of persons holdingLabour views should continue to be appointed to the Commission.Secondly, an enquiry by a Royal Commission would result in a reportrecommending legislation; and he doubted whether legislation onthis subject could be undertaken in the near future, in view of theheavy programme to which the Government were already committed.The Lord Chancellor said that his intentions had been misunder-stood by the Lord President. His desire was, not to reduce, but toincrease the number of Justices holding Labour views. But he was satisfied that the existing machinery was not working satisfactorily,and he thought it essential that some better method of selectionshould be devised. He would like to have an opportunity of dis-cussing this point with the Lord President.
The Cabinet Invited the Lord Chancellor to discuss this matter withthe Lord President; and authorised him to proceed withthe proposals in CP. (45) 192 if, as a result of that dis-cussion, the Lord President, withdrew his objections tothose proposals.national health service.(previous reference:CM. (45)9thConclusions,Minute I.)6. The Cabinet had before them memoranda on the future ofthe hospital services by the Minister of Health (CP, (45) 205) andthe Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland(CP. (45) 207).The Minister of Health recalled that in the White Paper on aNational Health Service (Cmd. 6502) it had been proposed to leavethe voluntary hospitals under their own independent management,though subject to a certain measure of control in return for theassistance which they would receive from the Exchequer and local rates. Estimates made by the Ministry of Health showed that, whenthe National Health Service was established, at least 70 per cent.,and in some cases as much as 80 or 90 per cent., of the income of a voluntary hospital would be derived from public funds. If incomedrawn from investments and past endowments were ignored, thecurrent voluntary support given to voluntary hospitals would be negligible. Moreover, apart from the big teaching hospitals,voluntary hospitals did not render a satisfactory, service and hadconspicuously failed to provide the conditions necessary to maintain an adequate nursing profession. He had accordingly reached theconclusion that there was an overwhelming case for putting the voluntary hospitals under some form of public control. If this was admitted, the first question was whether this control could beexercised through some form of local government machinery. Theexisting local government areas were neither large enough nor soconstituted as to suit the needs of hospital administration. He had considered the possibility of creating some new form of localgovernment unit for this purpose, but he could not find any satis-factory solution either by the creation of new directly electedauthorities or by the establishment of joint boards. He accordinglyfelt that the right course was to constitute a new National hospital service which would take over both the voluntary hospitals and thelocal authority hospitals, including sanatoria, mental hospitals andmental deficiency institutions. Safeguards against undue centralisation-tion would be provided by the setting up of a regional board foreach natural hospital region, and provision would be made forfurther delegation to divisional committees where the geography ofa region made this desirable. It was only by a scheme of this kind that it would be possible to give contributors an equal return for theequal contributions which they would be required to make under thenew scheme of national insurance. His proposals would undoubtedlyexcite strong opposition by the voluntary hospitals and the localauthorities. He was confident, however, that their opposition couldbe overcome; and his conversations with the medical profession, sofar as they had gone, left him with the impression that, confronted with a choice between a primarily local government service and aprimarily nationalised service, the great majority of the doctorswould prefer the latter.As regards the suggestion of the Joint Parliamentary Uncler-Secretary of State for Scotland that the voluntary teaching hospitals should be brought within the proposed National Hospital service it was not his intention that the big teaching hospitals should be excluded altogether from the Service, but only that special provision should be made for them within the scheme.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that, in]principle, he supported the proposals put forward by the Minister
of Health. The existing organisation of hospitals by local govern-&quot;ment areas was incompatible with an efficient service, and -are organisation on the regional basis suggested by the Minister ofHealth was desirable. At the same time, the opposition likely to be shown to the proposals should not be underrated, and much pre-liminary work and propaganda would have to be done before thescheme could successfully be brought into being. Provision shouldbe made in the scheme for giving the maximum freedom to themedical profession for research and experiment and for improving the conditions of service of the nursing profession.The Lord Privy Seal said that the voluntary hospitals were already finding it difficult to provide an adequate service; and whenthe new scheme of national insurance came into force the incomederived by voluntary hospitals from contributory schemes would inevitably dry up. It should be recognised, however, that a radicalreorganisation of the kind proposed by the Minister of Healthwould take some years to carry out, and there would have to beprotracted discussions before a scheme could be formulated whichcould be embodied in legislation.The Minister of Labour and National Service supported theproposals made by the Minister of Health. He was convinced, fromthe experience of the L.C.C. in running municipal hospitals, thatif the voluntary hospitals were brought under public control a betterservice could be provided. Another merit of these proposals wasthat they would do away with the current methods of seekingvoluntary contributions.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was in generalsympathy with the proposals, but must reserve his final judgmentuntil he had had an opportunity of examining their financial implications. There would clearly have to be some readjustment ofthe block grant, which would take account of the extent to whichthe transfer of hospitals from the local authorities to a NationalHospital Service would ease the burden on local rates.The Cabinet Agreed to resume discussion of the proposals in CP. (45)205 and 207 at their meeting on the 16th October.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,11th October, 1945.
