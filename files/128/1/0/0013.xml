India.(previous reference:C.M.(45)24thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Cabinet had before them a Report by the PrimeMinister, Chairman of the India and Burma Committee (CP. (45)155), on Indian policy, to which was attached the draft of a state-ment proposed to be made by the Viceroy on his return to India.The Prime Minister reminded the Cabinet that at their meetingon the 20th August they had agreed that Lord Wavell should beinvited to return here immediately for discussion of general policyin India. Since his arrival, the field had been thoroughly exploredwith him and in the result it was now proposed that on his returnto India Lord &quot;Wavell should make a statement in the termsappended to CP. (45) 155 and that this should be accompanied, ifthe Cabinet approved, by a short broadcast by himself.The discussions had centred round the desirability of making it clear that it was our intention to convene a constitution-makingbody, as envisaged in the Cripps offer of 1942, as soon as possibleonce the results of the forthcoming Indian elections were known.The Viceroy had felt some doubt as to the wisdom of a public under-taking to this effect, but the India Committee had made clear to him that in the view of the Government it was essential to face what-ever risks there might be and to give India and the world a clear indication of our intentions without further delay. They hadalready approved an announcement about the holding of the elec-tions. The statement now to be made by the Viceroy would makeit clear that it was our intention to convene a constitution-makingbody as soon as possible thereafter, that we were proceeding tothe consideration of the content of the treaty which would requireto be concluded between Great Britain and India, and that theViceroy had been authorised as soon as the results of the ProvincialElections were made public to take steps to bring into being an executive Council which would have the support of the main Indianparties.The following points were made in discussion : (a) It was suggested that the proposed announcement to bemade by the Viceroy might be deferred until a simultaneous announce-ment could be made in Parliament. It was pointed out, however,that during the long interval before Parliament reassembled therewould be great danger of leakage and difficulty in India.(6) Was it wise to refer in the proposed statement to the offer of 1942 in view of the fact that this offer had been rejected at thetime, and it was now clear that there was a substantial difference of opinion among the main parties ?It was recalled that all the parties had expressed themselves infavour of the 1942 ofier, which had been rejected in 1942 verylargely owing to the circumstances of the time.After further discussion, the Cabinet: (1) Approved the making by the Viceroy of an announcement in the terms appended to CP. (45) 155 on his return toIndia.(2) Agreed that this should be accompanied by a short broad-cast by the Prime Minister.Future 2.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the SecreProvision of     tary of State for India (CP. (45) 137), to which was attached aOfficers for the Memorandum by the Commander-in-Chief in India, outlining hisIndian Armed proposals for the future officering of the Indian Armed Services.Services.        These proposals which were based on the premise that ultimatelythe control of India&apos;s Armed Forces would be exercised by an autonomous Indian Government, envisaged the gradual and pro-gressive replacement by Indians of the British element in the officercadre of the three fighting Services; the future maintenance of thatdiminishing British element in each Service by secondment from[30725-4] b 2
the corresponding British Service instead of by the grant, as hereto-fore, of permanent commissions into the Indian Services, and theimmediate grant (a proposal to which effect had now been given)of a limited number of permanent commissions to Indian officers who were now holding temporary or emergency commissions.The Secretary of State for India said that these proposals,which had the strong support of the Viceroy, were, in his view, thebest practical solution of the problem before the Cabinet and desirable from the political angle. The Chiefs of Staff Committeeregarded them as acceptable in principle, subject to detailed examination by each of the Service Departments, in consultation,as necessary, with the India Office and with the appropriate authorities in India.The Secretary of State for Air said that the Air Staff would prefer to speak of attachment rather than secondment. Subject tothis detail, which he would discuss separately with the Secretary ofState for India, they supported the proposals.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the Naval Staffequally supported the proposals, but they were anxious to clarifycertain points departmentally. In particular, was secondment tobe purely voluntary and if not, what was its period to be 1After further discussion, the Cabinet : Approved in principle the proposals of the Secretary ofState for India, subject to subsequent examination of thedetails as recommended by the Chiefs.of Staff Committee.3. ^ At their meeting on the 3rd September the Cabinet had authorised the Secretary of State for the Colonies to enter intoconfidential discussions with Mr. Senanayake on the basis of the Soulbury Report.The Cabinet now had before them a Memorandum by the Secre-tary of State for the Colonies (OP. (45) 184), proposing that on mr. Senanayake&apos;s return to Ceylon he should take with him forconfidential disclosure to his Ministers, but not for general publi-cation, copies of the Soulbury Report, and that copies should alsobe made available to the India Office in order that the Governor-General might disclose them confidentially to his Executive council at the same time as copies were given to the Ceylon Board ofMinisters.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he had nearlycompleted his discussions with Mr. Senanayake, who would beleaving for Ceylon on the 17th September. It seemed clear that theproposals in the Soulbury Report would have a better chance of acceptance if it were shown confidentially to the Ceylon Board ofMinisters before its publication, while, so far as the Governmentof India was concerned, a definite pledge had been given by his predecessor that, in view of their interest in minorities in Ceylon,they would have an opportunity of considering the proposals before his Majesty&apos;s Government accepted them.In the course of the discussions which had taken placeMr. Senanayake had made it plain that the primary purpose of his visit was to request the grant to Ceylon of Dominion status. Thiswas not the purpose for which he had been invited to come to thiscountry and it was proposed to make it clear to him that HisMajesty&apos;s Government adhered to the 1943 Declaration as the basis for the grant of a new constitution and were not prepared to grantany form of Dominion status.In discussion the view was expressed that if the SoulburyReport were shown confidentially to the Ceylon Board of ministers and the Governor-General&apos;s Executive Council, its contents wouldbe bound to leak out. Eor this reason it was felt that it would bebetter to publish the report simultaneously in this country, in CeylonCeylon.(previous reference:CM. (45)27thConclusions,Minute 2.)
4.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (CP. (45) 154) proposing that, inorder to save dollar currency, there should be a cut in the amount ofUnited States, tobacco purchased on His Majesty&apos;s Governments account from theUnited States 1945 crop.The President of the Board of Trade explained that instruc-tions had been given to the United States Commodity CreditCorporation to buy 273 million lb. of tobacco from the 1945 crop.In view of the desirability of reducing dollar purchases, however,the Board of Trade had examined the possibility of a cut in theamount purchased and had reached the conclusion that, by allowingstocks to run down it would be possible to reduce the amountpurchased by 35 million lb., which would effect a saving of 18 million dollars. This cut could be made without any reduction in the rateof manufacture and consumption during the present year, but weshould run the risk of being unable to maintain manufacture orconsumption in 1946, and we should have to face the possibility ofbeing unable to purchase our full requirements from the 1946 crop,or, alternatively, of having to purchase them at an increased price.He had, therefore, felt it right to bring the matter before theCabinet.The following points arose in discussion :-(a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he strongly supported the proposed cut, which he regarded as the minimumacceptable on financial grounds. A demonstration of this kind tothe Americans of our determination to save dollars would have agood effect on the negotiations now in progress.(&amp;) Would it not be possible to replace American supplies by increased imports of tobacco from the Empire and from Turkey,Greece or Bulgaria ?So far as the Empire was concerned, it was pointed out thatthere had been a large increase in production in Southern Rhodesiaduring the war years and that it might be dangerous to encourageproduction any further unless there could be an assurance of a continuing demand in this country for Empire tobacco. Moreover,judging from experience of the effect of the substantial preferencegranted to Empire tobacco in the past, it was very doubtful whetherincreased supplies of Empire tobacco could be absorbed. Withregard to other sources of supply, Turkish tobacco was extremelyexpensive and Bulgarian supplies were entirely taken up by Russia.(c) Would the proposed cut affect the export trade in tobacco ?Tobacco.purchases in theand in India.   The publication of the Report did not mean that its recommendations had been accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government..... -   -and would not be inconsistent with the pledge that the Government r ftof India would be given time to formulate their conclusions before ** &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government reached a final decision.With regard to the question of Dominion status for Ceylon,it was pointed out that, while there could be no question of accepting the claim put forward by Mr. Senanayake, it would be undesirable to make any pronouncement at all on this matter before the cabinet had considered the recommendations in the Soulbury Report. Inany event it did not lie with His Majesty&apos;s Government to grant orwithhold Dominion status.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to arrange that the Soulbury Report should be published simul-taneously in this country, in Ceylon and in India onthe date on which copies were given to the Ceylon Boardof Ministers and the Governor-GeneraTs ExecutiveCouncil.(2) Agreed that the Secretary of State for the Colonies should refrain from making any statement with regard to dominion status for Ceylon in the course of had discussions with Mr. Senanayake.
The President of the Board of Trade said that he was satisfiedthat the proposed cut would not be detrimental to our export trade.(d) The President of the Board of Trade said that he intendedto put an end to the scheme of gift parcels of tobacco for troopsstationed overseas, except in the case of troops in South-East AsiaCommand and men in His Majesty&apos;s Ships. Since the end ofhostilities the amount of tobacco and cigarettes sent to troops in north-West Europe had more than doubled and it was clear that thescheme was being abused. There would be in compensation a slight increase in the amount of tobacco supplied through N.A.A.F.I.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposal in CP. (45) 154 to cut by35 million lb. the amount of tobacco purchased on HisMajesty&apos;s Governments account from the United States1945 crop.(2) Took note that the scheme for the supply of gift parcels of tobacco to members of the Forces stationed overseas, otherthan those in South-East Asia Command and in HisMajesty&apos;s Ships would be suspended.Disposal of italian colonies and of ItalianMediterraneanIslands.(previous reference:C.M.(45)27thConclusions,Minute 1.)5. At their meeting on the 3rd September the Cabinet had hadpreliminary discussion with regard to the future of the italian colonies.The Cabinet now had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP. (45 162) submittingrevised proposals prepared in the light of this discussion and of subsequent developments.The Foreign Secretary said that, in preparing his proposals,he had consulted the Dominions Office and the Colonial Officeand had taken account of the views expressed by Field-marshal smuts. It was now clear that the United States Governmentwere disposed to leave Italy with all her Colonies under trusteeship,while the Russian view was likely to be that the territories should remain under the supervision of the United Nations witha right to each of the Powers, including Russia, to establishbases in these territories. He was convinced that the proposal toleave the Colonies under Italian trusteeship would scandalise a largesection of opinion in this and other countries and would seriouslydamage our prestige in the Middle East, while the Russian proposal would inevitably lead to conflicts between the Powers. It wasnecessary for the Cabinet to decide what line he should take in thediscussions on the Council of Foreign Ministers, and he proposedthat, so far as the Somalilands were concerned, while we should press for a United Somalia, we should suggest that the choice of trustee should be deferred until the time came to draw up the trusteeship agreement provided for in Articles 79-85 of the charter of the United Nations. At the same time we might canvass thepossibility of the acceptance of the trusteeship by the United States,since if they were unwilling to assume it, they would have moredifficulty in rejecting a British claim. Our ultimate policy mightbe a trusteeship exercised jointly by members of the BritishCommonwealth but administered by a single one, possibly SouthAfrica or the Government of India. With regard to Cyrenaica,strong arguments had been advanced in favour of our claiming the trusteeship of this territory as a strategic area under Articles 82and 83 of the Charter. The Chiefs of Staff were giving furtherconsideration to the strategic questions involved. In all the circum-stances it seemed to him that the wisest course might be to aim atkeeping both Cyrenaica and the Somalilands under British military government until the World Organisation had been set up. It mightbe embarrassing to seek to establish the areas under trusteeshipbefore the machinery of the Trusteeship Council had been worked out. With regard to Tripolitania, the choice of a trustee might beleft over, but if in discussion the claims of Italy were pressed, he
did not think that we should oppose them.   Pantellaria and the -Pelagian Islands should be left under Italian sovereignty but should,be permanently demilitarised, while the Dodecanese should be cededto Greece with the exception of Castel Rosso, which should go to turkey.Points in discussion were :; (a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that while he was concerned at the burden which would be imposed on this country ifwe became permanently responsible for Cyrenaica and UnitedSomalia, he would have less objection to our undertaking the short-term liability involved in the continuance of military control.(b) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs pointed outthat the selection of South Africa to administer the trusteeship ofa United Somalia would be undesirable, while the Secretary ofState for the Colonies said that there would also be objections tothe administration of the trusteeship by the Government of India.It had to be borne in mind that part of the United Somalia wouldbe British Somaliland and that we were under an obligation to consult the people of this Protectorate before banding them overto any other Power.(c) The First Lord of the Admiralty stressed the strategic importance of the territories in question from the point of view ofthe protection of the imperial lines of communication.(d) The Lord President of the Council said that the arguments in favour of our undertaking the trusteeship of both Cyrenaica andthe Somalilands seemed to be strong. If we did so, we should bein a better position to arrange for the use of some part of the territories as a Jewish settlement.(e) The Minister of Fuel and power  suggested that before a final decision was reached on the future of the two territories, theCabinet should be supplied with full information on the strategic and economic considerations involved. In this connection theMinister of Health said that he was not convinced by the arguments on strategic grounds for our retaining control of the territories,since the whole strategic picture might be changed once the united nations organisation was set up. Nor did he think that we should assume that we must retain control of these territories for economic reasons.The Cabinet Authorised the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs toadopt in his discussions on the Council of foreign ministers the general line which he had indicated to theCabinet.Parliament.Report of theSelectCommittee on elections.6. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the lord president of the Council (CP. (45) 151) to which was attached acopy of the Report by the Select Committee on Elections.The Lord President of the Council recalled that the Committeehad been appointed to consider whether the elections ofMrs. Jean Mann and Mr. John C. Forman were invalid on theground that at the time of their election they were members of a tribunal constituted under the Rent of Furnished Houses Control(Scotland) Act, 1943. The Committee had reached the conclusionthat the elections were invalid and had recommended that a Statuteshould be enacted to relieve the two members from the pecuniarypenalties which they had incurred and to validate their elections.The Committee had also recommended that the whole question of offices of profit should be examined with a view to avoiding hardshipin similar cases. The opinion of the Law Officers on these recom-mendations had been obtained and was set out in an Annex to
CP. (45) 151. He agreed with the Law Officers that the electionsshould be validated, but he felt that to do so was a serious stepand that the possibility of stressing in the preamble to the Bill the exceptional nature of the two cases and of making it clear that theyshould not be regarded as weakening the principle that irregularelections ought not to be validated by Statute should be considered.If the Cabinet approved the proposal to pass a special Statute, anannouncement to this effect should be made as soon as possible afterthe House reassembled. So far as the wider question was concerned,it did not seem to be possible at present to find Parliamentary timefor legislation to implement the second recommendation of theSelect Committee. The Secretary of State for Scotland was inagreement.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that steps had alreadybeen taken by the Treasury to have the necessary Bill prepared.The Cabinet Approved the proposals put forward by the Lord Presidentof the Council in CP. (45) 151.Palestine. 7.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Lord(Previous President of the Council (CP. (45) 156) making proposals for the reference: short-term policy to be adopted in Palestine in the light of theW.M. (44) 155th reCommendations of the Committee of Ministers.Minute 1) &apos; ^ general discussion took place, a record of which is containedin the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of Cabinet Conclusions.In the outcome, the Prime Minister suggested that, subjectto further consideration of the question of timing, the general linerecommended by the Lord President and the Committee of ministers should be approved. He also thought that the Colonial Secretary,: X &quot; ! in consultation with the Foreign Secretary, should consider whethera statement, and, if so, in what terms, should be made in the nearfuture, and should also report on the best way of examining long-term policy. It would be desirable that the Chiefs of Staff shouldalso again review the security aspects of the problem.The Cabinet *(1) Approved the Prime Ministers suggestion at &quot; X &quot; and invited the Colonial Secretary, in consultation with theLord President and the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, to make arrangements on the lines proposed.(2) Invited the Chiefs of Staff to review the security aspectsof the problem.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,11th September, 1945.
