IGJapan.Offer of surrender.(previous reference:C.M.(45)20thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Prime Minister recalled that on the 11th August theUnited States Government had sent to the Swiss Government, for transmission to the Japanese Government, the following message on behalf of the Governments of the United States, the UnitedKingdom, the U.S.S.R., and China : &quot; With regard to the Japanese Governments messageaccepting the terms of the Potsdam Proclamation but eontain-ing the statement &apos; with the understanding that the saiddeclaration does not comprise any demand which prejudicesthe prerogatives of His Majesty as a Sovereign Ruler,&apos; ourposition is as follows : &quot; From the moment of surrender the authority of theEmperor and the Japanese Government to rule the State shallbe subject to the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers,who will take such steps as he deems proper to effectuate the surrender terms.&quot; The Emperor will be required to authorise and ensurethe signature by the Government of Japan and JapaneseImperial General Headquarters of the surrender terms necessary -sary to carry out the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration,and shall issue his commands to all the Japanese Military,Naval and Air Authorities and to all the Forces under their control, wherever located, to cease active operations, surrendertheir arms, and to issue such other orders as the supreme commander may require to give effect to the surrender terms.&quot; Immediately upon the surrender the Japanese Govern-ment shall transport prisoners of war and civilian interneesto places of safety, as directed, where they can quickly be placedaboard Allied transports.&quot; The ultimate form of Government of Japan shall, inaccordance with the Potsdam Declaration, be established by thefreely expressed will of the Japanese people.&quot; The armed forces of the Allied Powers will remain in japan until the purposes set forth in the Potsdam Declarationare achieved.&quot;No reply had yet been received to this communication. In thesecircumstances it had been necessary to prepare plans for the meetingof Parliament on the 15th August and for the King&apos;s Speech on alternative bases. It now seemed likely, from Japanese Pressmessages, that the reply of the Japanese Government would bereceived during the course of the day. If so, and if the reply was satisfactory, the Services of Thanksgiving for the two Houses ofParliament would be held during the afternoon of the 15th August,and both Houses would be invited to pass, later that day, Addressesof Congratulation to His Majesty. The Debate on the Addresswould then be opened on Thursday, the 16th August. As soon as itwas known that the Japanese Government had agreed to surrenderon the terms stated by the Allied Governments, the Prime minister would make a short announcement over the wireless. He would arrange for representative members of the Cabinet to go thereafter to Buckingham Palace to wait upon The King. His Majesty wouldbroadcast at 9 p.m. The Prime Minister would deliver a broadcastspeech after an interval of one or two days.Some discussion followed about the desirability of securing that the news of Japan&apos;s surrender was announced simultaneouslyby each of the four Allied Governments.   It was pointed out thatChiefs of Staff. l. The Prime Minister said that he was glad to convey to theChiefs of Staff the congratulations of the Cabinet on the high dis-tinction which had been conferred on them by His Majesty. Thisrecognition of the outstanding services of the Chiefs of Staff had given great pleasure to all members of the Cabinet, and especially to those Ministers who had worked with, them in the time of the coalition Government.
Terms of surrender.(previous reference:CM. (45) 20thConclusions,Minute 3.)if the Japanese Government broadcast their reply as they had broad-cast their original offer of surrender, it would be impossible to control the time of publication. In any event, the initiative in this matter lay with the United States Government. They had been informed ofour desire that, if practicable, the times of announcement shouldbe synchronised, and that we should be given a few hours&apos; notice in advance; but we could not press the point further.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that from thelatest telegrams from Washington it appeared that the UnitedStates Government did not intend to consult other Allied Govern-ments about the actual terms of surrender. We had, however,already communicated to the United States Government our viewson the points which, in our judgment, ought to be covered in the instrument of surrender and we had informed Dominion Govern-ments of the substance of our communication.The Chiefs of Staff indicated that from the military point ofview the position would be sufficiently protected if the United StatesGovernment, in framing the terms of surrender, took account ofthe points which we had brought to their notice.The Cabinet-Took note of the statements by the Prime Minister andthe Foreign Secretary.press censorship.Continuanceafter surrender of Japan.3. The Cabinet considered a Memorandum on this subject bythe Minister of Information (CP. (45) 106).The Minister of Information said that it had been suggestedby some representatives of the Press that the existing system of press censorship might be brought to an end immediately uponthe surrender of Japan. He recalled that on the surrender of Ger-many censorship of Press messages affecting Germany had been continued until all possibility of offensive action by German sub-marines or other naval forces had ceased; and this had meant, ineffect, the continuance of censorship until about three weeks afterVE Day. He recommended that the same policy should be appliedon the surrender of Japan.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Information to inform thePress that the existing system of Press censorship would continue to operate until such time as the Japanese militaryforces had carried out the Armistice conditions laid downby the Allied Governments.Greece.(previous reference:C.M.(45)10thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Cabinet considered a Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs (CP. (45) 107) seeking approval of thefollowing proposals as regards policy towards Greece : (i) We should press for the elections and plebiscite to be heldin Greece as soon as possible. The elections should, ifpossible, precede the plebiscite, but this was a matter on which the Greeks themselves must take the initiative and responsibility,(ii) The Voulgaris Government should be maintained in poweruntil the elections. All reasonable steps should, however,be taken to meet justifiable criticism by the Left-wingparties and to ensure that law and order were maintained on an impartial basis.(iii) The Regent should be invited to this country to confer with His Majesty&apos;s Government.(iv) If Russia continued her propaganda about Greece, it wouldbe necessary to make our position plain to the SovietGovernment.
(v) We should do our utmost to secure the full support of the&quot;Dominions for our whole Greek policy. We should alsolose no opportunity of associating the United StatesGovernment with us in this matter.The Foreign Secretary briefly developed the reasons given in cp. (45) 107 in support of these recommendations. The wise coursewould be to maintain the Voulgaris Government in power untilelections could be held which would produce a stable Governmentresting on the will of the people. In the meantime we should take all reasonable steps to maintain law and order and to meet justifiableLeft-wing criticism. The Varkiza Agreement provided that the plebiscite in Greece should come before the elections. He thoughtit would be better to reverse the order. But the responsibility fordeparting from the Varkiza Agreement on that point must beassumed by the Greeks themselves. A visit here by the Regentmight be timed to coincide with the first meeting of the Council ofForeign Ministers. It was desirable that representatives of theDominion Governments and of some Allied Governments should,if possible, take part in the supervision of the Greek elections.Straightforward but resolute handling of the Greek situation would greatly strengthen our position throughout the Middle East.Finally, the Foreign Secretary pointed out that the policy whichhe was now recommending to the Cabinet was in full accord with what he had said at the Labour Party Conference on the14th December, 1944.In discussion the following points were made :  (a) The registers for the Greek elections were to have beenready on the 15th August, but owing to the uncertainly of theGovernments position and the delays in completing the organisationof the Gendarmerie, they would not now be completed until the15th September.(b) Further reference was made to the importance of holdingthe elections before the plebiscite. It was said that the officer cadresin the Greek Army were recruited predominantly from Royalistquarters, and that the Government were not giving full effect to thepolitical amnesty. A number of Left-wing sympathisers were stillin gaol awaiting trial for minor offences. These conditions made it all the more important that elections should be held as quickly aspossible, and that the plebiscite should be held later, when it couldbe conducted under the auspices of an elected Government.The Foreign Secretary said that he had already impressed onthe Regent the desirability of giving full effect to the amnesty. Theimportant thing was that the present Government and the Regentshould know that they could count on staying in office until theelections.&apos; A decision to defer the plebiscite until after the electionsmust be left with the Greek Government, since it would involvemodifying an Agreement between the Greek parties. The policy nowproposed would bring it out that, while we supported the retentionof the Voulgaris Government until the elections, we also expectedproper safeguards for Left-wing criticism, and the maintenance oflaw and order.(c) The Foreign Secretary said that he was anxious that our troops in Greece (which The Secretary of State for War confirmedwere being maintained at full divisional strengths) should be onthe alert to prevent any interference from outside with free elec-tions. If they were withdrawn from the frontier, the Bulgariansmight regard this as a sign of weakness and might endeavour tointerfere.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that it was desir-able that a clear ruling should be given on the question whether the role of the British troops in Greece was merely to maintain internal order or to defend the frontier. If they were required to discharge the double responsibility they might have to be increased.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals of the Foreign Secretary as set outin CP. (45) 107.
(2) Took note that the Defence Committee would consider thepoint raised in discussion regarding the role of theBritish troops in Greece.Parliament.ModificationsinParliamentaryProcedure.(previous reference:W.M.(45)7thConclusions,Minute 10.)5. The Cabinet considered a Memorandum by the Lord Presi-dent of the Council (CP. (45) 103) proposing the appointment of a select Committee on Parliamentary Procedure.The Lord President of the Council said that the Governmentcould not hope to get through the heavy volume of legislation whichthey were anxious to pass during the next few years unless theysecured some modifications in Parliamentary procedure. Under the coalition Government a Committee of Ministers had put forward proposals for alterations designed to facilitate the progress of legis-lation during the reconstruction period. He had annexed to cp. (45) 103 the memorandum drawn up by this Committee. this had been submitted to the War Cabinet who, without expressing anyview on the proposals, had instructed the Whips to take soundingsamong members of the House of Commons in order to ascertaintheir attitude towards the appointment of a Select Committee on parliamentary Procedure. The Whips had reported that a majorityof members of the old Parliament were likely to take the view thatit would be more appropriate to defer the appointment of such a select Committee until after the General Election; and the WarCabinet had therefore decided on the 22nd January, 1945, that forthe present no steps should be taken to secure the appointment of a select Committee.The Lord President of the Council said that it would clearly be appropriate that one of the first acts of the new parliament should be to appoint a Select Committee to consider parliamentary procedure. He proposed that steps should be taken for the imme-diate appointment of such a Committee, with power to sit whilethe House was in recess. He also thought it would be wise to suggestthat this Select Committee should take as its starting point theproposals which had been worked out while the Coalition Govern-ment were in office. The Committee might be asked to submit an interim report without delay on the points covered by those pro-posals, though their terms of reference should not preclude them from going on to consider other questions of parliamentary procedure.There was general agreement with the proposal for the earlyappointment of a Select Committee on Parliamentary Procedure.Discussion centred on the question whether this Committee shouldbe invited to take as its starting point the proposals worked out under the Coalition Government. On this question the followingpoints were raised : (a) If the present Government now put forward proposalswhich had been worked out under the Coalition Government, would this be an embarrassing precedent? There were other subjects,e.g., civil aviation, on which the present Government would wish toput forward proposals differing from the compromise proposals towhich Labour members of the Coalition Government had assentedin order to secure agreement with their Conservative colleagues. Itwas important to preserve the right of the present Government toput forward fresh proposals on matters which had been the subjectof compromise under the Coalition Government.It was the view of the Cabinet that this right would not been dangered by the adoption of the suggestion now under discussion.The memorandum annexed to CP. (45) 103 had not been approvedby the Coalition Government. Nor would it be put forward as representing the final views of the present Government. It wouldbe put forward only as a starting point for the enquiries of theSelect Committee. Moreover, it was the tradition of parliament that these questions of procedure should be handled on an &quot; all-Party &apos;&apos; basis; and it would be consistent with that tradition thatthe Select Committee should be asked to consider proposals whichhad been worked out under a Coalition Government.
(b) Would the freedom of the Select Committee be limited by&apos;the publication of these proposals ?It was pointed out that, although the Committee might be askedfor an early interim report on the points covered by these proposals,the scope of their enquiry would not be limited to these points, nor would they be precluded from recommending changes different fromthose envisaged by these proposals. A great deal of thought had gone into the framing of these proposals : if these changes of pro-cedure were to be ma.de, it was important that they should be madeearly in the forthcoming Session : and it was most desirable that theSelect Committee should have the advantage of the work already done on this subject.(c) If these proposals were to be communicated to the SelectCommittee as the work of a Cabinet Committee under the coalition government, it would be necessary first to obtain the consent of theleaders of the Conservative Party.(d) It was pointed out that the memorandum annexed to cp. (45) 103 could not appropriately be presented, in its present form, to a Select Committee appointed by the new Parliament. Thefirst three paragraphs contained various references to the coalition government which would need modification. On the other hand, ifthe language of these paragraphs were modified, the memorandumcould not be presented as the report of the Cabinet Committee.The conclusions of the Cabinet were as follows :  (1) The Lord President of the Council, as Leader of the Houseof Commons, should arrange for a Motion to be tabled ata very early date for the appointment of a Select Com-mittee on Parliamentary Procedure, with power to sitwhile Parliament was in recess.(2) Subject to consultation with the leaders of the conservative party, the substance of paragraphs 4-12 of the memo-randum annexed to CP. (45) 103 should be put beforethe Select Committee, not as the actual report of aCabinet Committee, but clS  L description of proposalswhich had been worked out by a Committee of ministers under the Coalition Government. The Lord Presidentof the Council would take steps to ascertain, through theWhips, the views of the Conservative Leaders on thispoint.(3) The terms of reference of the Select Committee should bewide enough to cover all questions relating to the reform of Parliamentary procedure. The Select Committeeshould, however, be asked to submit an interim report,with the least possible delay, on the matters dealt with inparagraphs 4-12 of the memorandum annexed to cp. (45) 103.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,lith August, 1945.
