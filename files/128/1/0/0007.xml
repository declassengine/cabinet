India.constitutional problem.(previous reference:CM. (45) 17thConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for India (CP. (45) 121) putting forward, in thelight of discussion in the India Committee, a broad outline of his suggestions for implementing the proposals for the long-termsolution of the Indian constitutional problem contained in theDeclaration of 1942, and the draft of a statement to be made bythe Viceroy as regards the holding of elections for the Central and provincial Legislatures. The Cabinet also had before them two telegrams (1333S and 1337S of the 18th and 19th August) from theViceroy to the Secretary of State for India.The Secretary of State for India briefly informed the cabinet of the present position in regard to commutation of sentences, therelease of detenus, the treatment of persons engaged in fifth-columnactivities in India during the war, and the holding of elections.The Viceroy was anxious that elections should be held without delayfor both the Provincial and the Central Legislatures. ProvincialGovernors were in agreement except in the Punjab, where theViceroy was not anxious to force the hands of the ProvincialPremier.The terms of the offer of 1942, which had been made with theapproval of the Coalition Government, committed us to considering a long-term solution of the Indian problem to be worked out by a constituent Assembly drawn by proportional representation fromProvincial Legislatures elected by fresh elections held on the cessation of hostilities. We had repeatedly stated that this offerstill held the field, and it would not be possible for the present government to make any proposals which fell short of this offer.The India Committee had been anxious that the Viceroy should takethe first step to implement the offer by arranging Provincial electionswhich would lead to the appointment of an electoral college which,with representatives of the Indian States, would form a constitu-tion-making body. They had also favoured asking the Viceroy tocome home to discuss the position with His Majesty&apos;s Government;and Lord Wavell had been so informed, though he had been given no indication of the line of action which the Government had inview. The Viceroy bad now made it clear, however, that he was anxious to be consulted on the main issues, and on the languageto be used in any public statement, before decisions were taken.The Secretary of State thought it was very desirable that the viceroy should be so consulted, particularly in view of the considerationsadvanced in the telegrams before the Cabinet against an immediate announcement of our long-term intentions in advance of definite conclusions on the Pakistan issue.In discussion there was general agreement on the followingpoints : (a) The Viceroy should be authorised at once to announce thatelections would be held for the Central and Provincial Legislaturesin the coming cold weather.(b) No exception to this would be justified in the case of the punjab. The justification for elections was the non-representativecharacter of the present legislatures, which dated from 1936. More-over, if the new legislatures were to be used to produce an electoralcollege for a Constituent Assembly, it would be impossible to justifyeither omitting the Punjab or using for this purpose an out-of-datelegislature.(c) Mr. Rajagopalachariar&apos;s solution of the problem, as set outin Annex II to CP. (45) 121, had not found any general acceptanceand could not be regarded as meeting the case.(d) The Viceroy should be invited to return at once for consul-tation on the long-term plan. Were he to be in London in time topermit of some further statement being made during the firstmeeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers, that would be of value as reducing any risk of the Indian position being used to embarrassus in discussions on other matters.
Discussion followed on the question whether the announcementof the holding of elections in India should be linked with an indication that the new legislatures would be used to provide anelectoral college for a Constituent Assembly.In favour of an announcement in this sense it was urged thatit was important, on psychological grounds and because of publicopinion in India, the United States and this country, that HisMajesty&apos;s Government should take the initiative and should notappear to act only in response to pressure from India. It was also desirable that we should let India know beyond question the course which we had in view. Those elements which were opposed to freshelections might take a different line when it was made clear whatwas to follow.It was represented, on the other hand, that an announcementof the decision to hold elections could not well be postponed, sincethe issue would arise on the introduction of the Indian FranchiseBill in the House of Lords on the following day. The Viceroy had strongly represented his desire to be consulted about the terms ofany statement on long-term policy; and, if his desire was to bemet, it would not be possible to make in the debate on the following day a statement linking the holding of elections with the terms ofthe 1942 offer. Further, an announcement which in terms linkedlong-term policy with the holding of elections would almost certainlyprovoke a demand for a general debate. Would it not suffice to announce the decision that elections were to be held, and to add thatthe Government had already been giving consideration to the general question of Indian policy, now that hostilities had ceased, and thatthe Viceroy had been invited home for discussions ? This wouldmake it possible to avoid an extended debate, would make it clearthat the initiative had been taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government andwould give us time for consideration.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that thegeneral sense of the Cabinet was that the Viceroy should announceimmediately, but without comment, that it was proposed to holdelections for the Provincial and the Central Legislatures during theforthcoming cold weather. The Punjab should conform to thegeneral decision. The Viceroy should be invited immediately toreturn home for discussion of general policy. It was desirable toavoid at this stage any extended debate in Parliament on the Indianquestion at large. The wiser course would be for the Secretary ofState to announce that elections were to be held and to add that theViceroy had been invited home to discuss the position generally.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Secretary of State for India should authorise the Viceroy to announce at once that electionswould be held in the Centre and in the Provinces duringthe next cold weather, but not to make any referenceto the implications of this decision.(2) Agreed that the Secretary of State for India, in the courseof his speech introducing the Indian Franchise Bill,should announce that elections were to be held, andshould add that the Viceroy had been asked to come home to discuss the general position.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for India to authorise theViceroy to announce that he had accepted an invitation to return home for discussions with His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.
economic controls in theTransitionPeriod.Supplies and services(transitional powers) Bill.(previous reference:CM. (45) 23rdConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The President of the Board of Trade said that it had beenbrought to his notice that this Bill, as at present drafted, whileapplying existing Defence Regulations for the extended purposesof the transition period, would not confer power to make new regulations. He thought it would be convenient for the Govern-ment, in carrying out their industrial policy, to have power tointroduce by Regulation various provisions which were not of major importance and hardly merited the introduction of special legisla-tion. He therefore suggested that further consideration might begiven, even at this late stage, to the question whether this Bill shouldnot include a power to make fresh Regulations.The Minister of Health said that the Ministers concerned with housing were anxious that there should be adequate powers in the transition period to control the use of our building resources insuch a way as to ensure that a due proportion was devoted to theneeds of the housing programme. They would like to be assured that the control which they thought necessary could be securedunder the powers to be conferred by this Bill.The Lord President of the Council said that the Bill had been drafted after prolonged consultation with all the interested Depart-ments, and he had been given to understand that the departments were satisfied that the Bill would give them all the powers they required for the economic purposes of the transition period. Toinclude in the Bill a power to make fresh Regulations would betantamoimt to saying that the emergency powers which had beenadequate for war purposes were not sufficient for the purposes ofthe transition. Before committing themselves to such an extensionof the Bill, the Government should consider very carefully whetherthe existing powers would not, in fact, suffice for the purposes ofthe transition. The existing Regulations which would be applied by the Bill Defence Regulation 55 for example conferred very wide and drastic powers; and the Government should be satisfied by specific illustrations that there were, in fact, necessary policies for which powers should be provided and would not be provided under the terms of the present Bill.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to communi-cate to the Lord Privy Seal, as Chairman of theLegislation Committee, specific illustrations of the typeof transitional policy which would not, in his view, be covered by the Bill as at present drafted.(2) Invited the Legislation Committee to consider at their next meeting, on the basis of the information to be furnishedunder (1) above, whether there were grounds for extending the scope of the Supplies and Services(Transitional Powers) Bill on the lines suggested by thePresident of the Board of Trade.Cabinet Of/ice, S.W. 1,20th August, 1945.
