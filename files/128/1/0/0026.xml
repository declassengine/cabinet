1. At their meeting on the 11th October the Cabinet had agreed to resume discussion of the memoranda on the future of thehospital services by the Minister of Health (OP. (45) 205) and by conclusions, memoranda, a memorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilMinute 6.)      (CP. (45) 227) and a further memorandum by the Minister ofHealth (CP. (45) 231).The Lord President of the Council said that, while he fully appreciated the attractions of a logical and clean-cut scheme ofthe kind proposed by the Minister of Health, he felt that, beforeaccepting the Ministers proposals, the Cabinet ought to considerfully whether the opposition which they would arouse and thedetrimental effect which the loss of hospital functions would have on local government in general, did not outweigh the argumentsbased on grounds of administrative convenience and technical efficiency.   It would be unwise to underrate the pride which localpeople took in their hospitals, whether voluntary or municipal,and he feared that the Ministers scheme, for which there was no authority in the Party Programme and which involved a departure from the terms of a resolution passed at the last annual party conference,  would  arouse such  a  storm of  opposition as  to jeopardise the passage of the National Health Service Bill in thecurrent Session.    The Government were virtually committed to schemes for the nationalisation of electricity, gas and transport services, which would mean the transfer of important functionsfrom local authorities, and there might also be other functions,such as those relating to water supply, of which the local authoritiesought to be deprived.    If, in addition, they were to lose thehospital services and  possibly other  health services  (eg., the maternity and child welfare clinics, the school medical service),the fabric of local government might be dangerously weakened.The Regional Boards and District Committees proposed by theMinister of Health would either be mere creatures of the ministry or they would have to be given a dangerous freedom to pursuepolicies of their own at the expense of the Exchequer.   Was it notreasonable to expect that the voluntary hospitals would in timedecline and fall under public control, and, in these circumstances,would it not be better to adopt a solution which would admittedlynot be perfect, but which would not range all the interests againstthe Government and create serious divisions among government supporters both in Parliament and in the country, at a time whenlocal elections were impending ?The Minister of Health said that, he had considered very carefully the points made by the Lord President of the Council,but that he still felt that the only way to make the hospital servicesefficient was to centralise responsibility for them.   Since it wasimpossible to leave the position as it was and since any change would involve controversy, was it not better for the Government to ,propose the scheme which would give the most efficient service and jcould best be defended on merits?   He did not believe that asatisfactory service could be run under a system of joint committees, \which would have to obtain their funds by precepting on localauthorities of varying resources.    Even if the local authorities were to lose the hospital services and certain other health services \connected with them, they would still be left with more than enoughwork.    There was no reason to believe that, if the voluntary thospitals were left with their independence, they would in time jlapse into the hands of the State.   On the contrary, the Exchequer jsubsidies which it would be necessary to give to them would con-lsolidate their position.   He was convinced that a bold scheme onlthe lines he had proposed would have the backing of Government 1supporters throughout the country.Reference:W.M. (45) 40th
The Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for.Scotland said that it had not been possible to consult the Secretaryof State for Scotland and that he could not guarantee that theSecretary of State would have endorsed the views expressed in cp. (45) 207. While the efficiency of Scottish municipal hospitalshad improved greatly since 1930, nevertheless, they were not asefficient as the voluntary hospitals and, in his view, the leastsatisfactory course would be to transfer the voluntary hospitalsto the local authorities, particularly having regard to the strong opposition of the medical profession to any such step. As indicatedin CP. (45) 207, it was most important to include the Scottishteaching hospitals in any national scheme.In the discussion which ensued the following points weremade : (a) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs stressed theimportance of providing for the co-ordination of thehospital services with the other health services, includingthe general practitioner service. He favoured a national scheme, especially because of the improvements whichit would enable to be made in the arrangements for thetraining of nurses and the wider opportunities whichit would give to the medical profession to find an attractive career in the hospital service.(b) The Home Secretary said that there seemed to him to be agood case for bringing the small voluntary hospitals in country areas under public control, and for rational-ising the existing distribution of hospital functionsamong local authorities. He saw considerable objection,however, to the transfer of hospital services from the major local authorities, who had a good record in hospital administration, and he feared that any suchstep would make it more difficult to attract the righttype of person into local government.(c) The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that theproblem could not be solved by transferring the voluntary hospitals to the existing local authorities,since these hospitals, in many cases, served not only theareas in which they were situated but also the surrounding areas. Thus the choice lay between theproposals of the Minister of Health and some systemof joint committees of local authorities. There would undoubtedly be strong opposition, at least for a time,to the proposals of the Minister of Health but, in his view, they were to be preferred on merits.(d) The Minister of Education said that the proposals of theMinister of Health would, in her view, commend them-selves to Government supporters throughout the country.A national hospital scheme was a logical consequenceof a national scheme of health insurance. The voluntary hospitals ought not to retain their independent status and it was clear that the medical profession would prefer a national scheme to any scheme of local authoritycontrol. Moreover, the creation of a national hospitalscheme would facilitate advances in the field of medical education.(e) The Lord Chancellor suggested that, in view of the diffi-culties involved in bringing the administration of allhospitals under State control immediately, the minister might, in the first instance, take power to give directions in order to ensure that hospitals were efficiently run, witha reserve power to take over the administration of anyhospital which failed to come up to the necessarystandard of efficiency.(f) The Secretary of State for War said that in general he supported the proposals of the Minister of Health.   It[30777-^], b 2
was most important to preserve the existing enthusiasmof the local people for their own hospitals, but he was satisfied that this could be done through the district committees referred to in paragraph 14 (5) of CP. (45)205.(g) The First Lord of the Admiralty urged that there shouldbe a more detailed examination of the proposals made bythe Minister of Health before the Cabinet reached afinal decision on them. In particular, if special pro-vision was to be made for the big teaching hospitals itwas for consideration whether similar arrangements should not also be made for specialised hospitals whichdrew their patients from the whole country. Whilemost voluntary hospitals would have to be subsidisedvery largely from public funds, this did not apply in allcases, and difficult financial questions might arise inconnection with the treatment of endowments specificallygiven for the support of particular hospitals. Once thescheme had been worked out in more detail, the cabinet would be in a better position to judge the strength ofthe opposition.(h) It was suggested that further consideration should be givento the size of the areas over which the regional boardsproposed in paragraph 14 (3) of CP. (45) 205 would operate. While there were advantages in adhering tothe ten regions which had always been a feature of pro-posals for reorganising hospital services, there might bea case for smaller regions. A decision of this pointdepended, however, on the proposed size of the districtsreferred to in paragraph 14 (5) of CP. (45) 205.(i) It was essential that careful consideration should be givento the financial aspect of the proposals and the Chan-cellor of the Exchequer should be kept closely in touchwith the working out of the details.The Prime Minister said that the differences between the pro-posals made by the Minister of Health and the alternative schemesuggested by the Lord President of the Council were possibly lessfundamental than they seemed to be. On either alternative, the major part of the expenditure on the hospital service would have tobe met from the Exchequer, and the regional boards and district committees proposed by the Minister of Health in sub-paragraphs(3) to (5) of ^paragraph 14 of CP. (45) 205 would in all probabilityconsist very largely of the same persons as would be members of thejoint committees under the Lord Presidents scheme. Whichevercourse was adopted, there would inevitably be controversy, and the predominant feeling in the Cabinet seemed to him to be generally in favour of the solution proposed by the Minister of Health.While approving this proposal in principle, however, the cabinet would want to look at the details again when they were more fullyworked out. In particular the Minister of Health and the joint parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland should develop further their proposals for regional boards and district committees in the light of the discussion, keeping in view the desir-ability of meeting the criticism that a national service would tendto a diminution of local interest. They should at the same timetake discreet soundings as to the attitude of Government supporters,but there should be no disclosure at this stage of what the Govern-ment had in mind. It would probably be convenient if the social services Committee, with the addition of the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs and other Ministers who had a special interestin the matter, were to work out the details and thereafter submit a report to the Cabinet.The Cabinet: Endorsed the course of action proposed by the PrimeMinister.
CivilAviation.(previous references:W,M.(45)27thConclusions,Minute 2, and cm. (45)5thConclusions,Minute 5.)2.   The Cabinet had before them the following papers on Civil&quot;Aviation Policy : (i) CP. (45) 221 a memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs reporting the recommendations ofthe Civil Aviation Committee on proposals submittedto them by the Minister of Civil Aviation,(ii) CP. (45) 222 a memorandum by the Minister of CivilAviation asking for Cabinet approval for certain pro-posals arising out of the recommendations of the CivilAviation Committee, and(iii) CP. (45) 232 a memorandum by the Joint parliamentary under-Secretary of State for Scotland regarding the useof Prestwick Airport.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that the CivilAviation Committee agreed that the Minister of Civil Aviationshould adhere to the policy of regulation but not restriction of inter-national civil flying, and should continue with the negotiation of bilateral agreements on the lines followed hitherto. They had alsoendorsed, the policy of Commonwealth co-operation and the proposal that all airfields in the United Kingdom, including those belongingto local authorities, should be owned by the State.The most important point which the Committee had had toconsider was the part to be played by private capital in operating-air line services. The Ministers predecessor had proposed that commonwealth air services, services to the United States, and services to China and the Far East should be operated by B.O.A.C.without the participation of private capital; that services to SouthAmerica should be operated by a corporation in which the shipping lines operating to South America would have a majority holding,*.while B.O.A.C. had a minority holding; and that European and internal services should be operated by a corporation in .which therailway companies, the short sea shipping lines, the travel agencies,and B.O.A.C. should all participate, no participant having amajority holding. The Committee had taken the view that thereshould be no change in the arrangements for Commonwealth servicesand for services to the United States, China and the Far East. Sofar, however, as the corporation which were to operate the SoufhAmerican service and the European services were concerned, theCommittee recommended that the total extent of private participa-tion should be 20 per cent., and that the short sea shipping lines should not participate at all.The Minister of Civil Aviation said that later in the day hewould have to reply to a Motion by Lord Swinton asking HisMajesty&apos;s Government to make a full statement of their polic)&apos; withregard to civil aviation. If the Cabinet approved, he would proposeto promise to make a. full statement in about a fortnights time. Inhis view, it was doubtful whether the railway companies and the travel agencies, whose assistance in developing the South American,and European services would be most valuable, would be content witha stake limited to 20 per cent., that he would like to have authorityto negotiate within a maximum of 40 per cent, in the case of theEuropean corporation, and 33^ per cent, in the case of the south american corporation. An undertaking had been given by theprevious Government that, pending the completion of Heath Row,British land-ba,sed aircraft on passage to and from Canada andthe United States would be required to stop to pick up and set down at Prestwick. The implication of this was that all land-based air-craft, no matter what their points of arrival and departure were,must call at Prestwick. It did not seem reasonable, however, thataircraft travelling on the southerly route should be compelled tomake a stop at Prestwick, and he suggested that the compulsorystop at Prestwick should be limited to aircraft travelling from New-foundland via the northerly route to London, whenever a stop at prestwick was desirable on operational grounds.
The following points were raised in discussion  (a) The Labour Party had in the past advocated the completenationalisation of internal air services. Further, if therailway companies were allowed to participate in theproposed European corporation, awkward questions ofcompensation might arise when the time came to nationalise the railways.On the other hand, it was urged that there was.much to be said for enlisting the experience of the rail-way companies, shipping lines and travel agencies, andthat, provided that the State retained a majority interest,there was no reason why the participation of private companies should be strictly limited to 20 per cent.(b) The&apos; Lord President of the Council said he hoped that before a final decision was reached the Minister of CivilAviation would give further consideration to the viewsof the Civil Aviation Group of the parliamentary labour Party. It might be desirable for the memoran-dum, which the Group had prepared, to be circulated tothe Civil Aviation Committee.(c) It was explained that the proposals made in paragraph 12of CP. (45) 222 with regard to priorities for the pro-duction of civil aircraft would have to be considered bythe Defence Committee.(d) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he hoped thatcare would be taken to keep the proposed negotiationsfor a bilateral agreement with the United States separate from the current financial and economic negotiations in washington.(e) The Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State forScotland said that the previous Government had given a clear undertaking that Prestwick Airport would beused for transatlantic traffic pending the completion ofHeath Row. It had never been intended that this under-taking should apply to flights on the southerly atlantic route, but the wording of paragraph 9 of CP. (45) 221and of paragraph 11 of CP. (45) 222 seemed to suggestthat it would be open to the Minister of Civil Aviationto permit aircraft on the northerly route to land inIreland instead of at Prestwick. This would be a departure from the undertaking already given. TheMinister of Civil Aviation said that he was preparedto withdraw the qualification that the use of Prestwickshould be determined by operational requirements.The Cabinet-(1) Approved in principle the proposals outlined in cp. (45) 221 and 222, and authorised the Minister ofCivil Aviation to promise that a statement of the Govern-ment&apos;s civil aviation policy would be made in about a fortnight.(2) Reserved for further consideration the question of the participation of private interests in the proposed Euro-pean and South American corporations. The Ministerof Civil Aviation was invited to ascertain the views ofthe Civil Aviation Group of the Parliamentary LabourParty and thereafter to formulate revised proposals forconsideration by the Civil Aviation Committee prior totheir submission to the Cabinet.(3) Took note that the question of the provision of labour and materials for the manufacture of civil aircraft would beconsidered by the Defence Committee.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,18th October, 1945.
