Conscientious 1.   The Cabinet had before them Objectors. ^ a memorandum by the Minister of Labour and NationalService (C.P. (45) 139) regarding the release of con-ditionally registered conscientious objectors from theconditions on which they had been registered; and(ii) a memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(CP. (45) 146) regarding the treatment of conscientious objectors in the Civil Service.The Cabinet considered first the proposals made by the Ministerof Labour and National Service in CP. (45) 139.The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Labour and,National Service, explained that, under the National Service (armed forces) Act, 1939, a conscientious objector who was ordered by a tribunal to be registered on conditions was bound by these conditionsuntil the end of the existing emergency. The date fixed for the endof the emergency might be some considerable time in the future and it seemed desirable that legislation should be introduced to empower the Minister of Labour and National Service to releaseconditionally registered conscientious objectors from their con-ditions before the legal end of the emergency. The Minister ofLabour and National Service would propose to use this power to release conscientious objectors by groups based on their age andthe length of time during which they had been conditionallyregistered, and he would arrange, so far as possible, for the groups to be released after the completion of the release of the equivalentArmy groups. Conscientious objectors released from their con-ditions would be subject to any controls which were at the timeapplicable to other civilians of the same age.The following points were raised in discussion : (a) It was pointed out that the Royal Air Force might have to postpone the release of men in particular groups after men in the equivalent groups had been released from the Army. In thesecircumstances, would it not be desirable to postpone the release ofconscientious objectors until the completion of the release of the equivalent groups in all three of the Services?(b) Conscientious objectors who had undertaken agricultural work would remain subject to the operation of the Essential WorkOrder after their release.(c) It was explained that it was not proposed to release con-scientious objectors in Class &quot; B.&quot;The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Minister of Labour and National service to prepare a Bill amending the National Service (armed forces) Act, 1939, on the lines proposed in CP. (45) 139.(2) Invited the Minister of Labour and. National Service toconsider, in consultation with the Service Ministers,whether it would be possible to arrange to defer releasingconscientious objectors in any particular age and lengthof service group until after the completion of the releaseof the equivalent age and length of service groups in allthe three Services.The Cabinet then considered the proposals made by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (45) 146).The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that a number ofconscientious objectors had been directed to remain in the CivilService and that, in order that they should not profit by comparisonwith their colleagues who had entered the Armed Forces, they hadnot received promotion and, where they had undertaken increasedresponsibilities, had been given no increase in pay. By the end of., 1945 a substantial number of Civil Servants would have returned from the Forces and new recruits from the Forces would have begun to enter the Civil Service.   It was accordingly proposed that from
this date the ban on promotion should be removed. It was also pro-posed that conscientious objectors who had been in the Civil Serviceand, on being directed to other forms of national service, hadobeyed their instructions, should be reinstated, although their war service would not reckon for pension, as would the war service ofother Civil Servants. Conscientious objectors who had refused toobey directions were not entitled to reinstatement, but any case inwhich the person concerned applied for reinstatement would beconsidered by the Treasury on its merits.In discussion it was urged that, until the Cabinet had beforethem further information with regard to the rate at which demobili-sation would proceed, it would be undesirable to come to a finaldecision with regard to the date from which the ban on the pro-motion of conscientious objectors should be removed, since therewas likely to be considerable discontent if conscientious objectorswere promoted at a time when any considerable number of their colleagues were still serving with the Armed Forces.The Cabinet (3) Gave general approval to the proposals for the treatmentof conscientious objectors in the Civil Service set out in cp. (45) 146.(4) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would bring before the Cabinet again the question of the date from which conscientious objectors who had been directed to stay in the Civil Service would be allowed toreceive promotion, once further information was avail-able with regard to the rate at which demobilisationwould proceed.2. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Home Department (CP. (45) 143) aboutthe celebration of Armistice Day.The Home Secretary explained that until 1939 it had beencustomary for Armistice Day to be celebrated by the holding ofa special service at the Cenotaph in Whitehall at 11 a.m. on the11th November, and of local services throughout the country at thesame hour. During the war, however, the holding of services onthe 11th November had been abandoned. The question now arosewhether on Sunday, the 11th November next, there should be areversion to the pre-war practice of a ceremony at the Cenotaphand a decision was also required on the more general question ofcommemoration ceremonies in future years.On the general question, he felt that there should not beseparate days of remembrance for the two wars, and he proposedthat, should The King approve the holding of the Armistice Dayservice on the 11th November next, the preliminary announcement should make it clear that, although Armistice Day would be celebrations-brated on the usual lines this year as a day of remembrance for those who had fallen in both wars, in the near future some otherdate would be fixed as a national day of remembrance on which those who had fallen in the two wars would be honoured andremembered. Meanwhile, he would examine with representativesof the Churches, of the British Legion and of other interested parties the question of settling a national day of remembrance for 1946and future years.In discussion the question was raised whether it was desirableto hold the special service at the Cenotaph in Whitehall on the11th November next, and the suggestion was made that it might besufficient to continue this year the practice adopted during the war.The general view was, however, that the balance of advantage layin reverting on this one occasion to the pre-war practice under whicha special service had been held at the Cenotaph.-5] b 2
With regard to the selection of a national day of remembrancefor 1946 and future years, it was pointed out that, while theArmistice celebrations in November had become in some sense are recognised institution, the uncertainty of the weather at this timeof year was a strong objection, and that the Sunday following the11th November was normally celebrated as Civic Sunday. Therewere also objections to the selection of the anniversary of the endof the Japanese war since this would make the ceremony fall during a holiday period. Attention was called to the desirability, if it were possible, of fixing a day which the United States would also be willing to observe as Remembrance Day, and the suggestion wasmade that the possibility of relating the date selected to the dateof the signature of the Atlantic Charter should be considered. Itwas also pointed out that before any final decision was reached anopportunity should be given for consultation with the Dominions.The Cabinet-&apos;(1) Agreed that the Home Secretary should take The King&apos;pleasure as to the revival of the ceremony at the Ceno-taph on the 11th November, 1945.(2) Invited the Home Secretary, in the light of the discussion and in consultation with the. interests concerned, to oon-sider further the selection of a date on which a NationalDay of Remembrance for both wars could be celebrated.3. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the LordChancellor (CP. (45) 149) on the subject of the Trade Disputes andTrade Unions Act Repeal Bill.The Attorney-General said that the Lord Chancellor had felt it desirable to bring to the attention of the Cabinet the proposal which had been provisionally approved by the Legislation Committeethat the Bill, which would, of course, arouse considerable political controversy, should be introduced very early in the Session. Thequestion also arose as to which Minister should be responsible forthe Bill in the House of Commons. Since the proposed Bill providedfor a straightforward repeal of the Act of 1927 and did not raisethe complex legal points which had arisen on the Bill of 1930, itwas for consideration whether some Minister of Cabinet rank shouldnot be made responsible. It was also essential that one department should undertake the responsibility for preparing briefs and gettingfacts together for the use of the Minister in charge of the Bill.In discussion there was general agreement that the Bill shouldbe debated as early as possible in the Session, and it was felt that theMinister of Labour and National Service should accept primary responsibility for the Bill in the House of Commons. It wouldprobably be necessary to allow two days for the Second reading of the Bill, and it might be convenient if the Attorney-Generalmoved the Second Reading. The Minister of Labour and NationalService could then wind up on the first day and the foreign secretary might speak at the end of the second day.Attention was drawn to the proposal referred to in paragraph 2of CP. (45) 149 that it should be for the executive committee of eachunion to approve the form of the new rules that would be required as a result of the repeal&apos; of the Act of 1927. It was pointed outthat difficulties might arise if the Bill purported to lay down theprocedure to be adopted by unions in this matter, and that it mightbe preferable to provide that, while the executive committee mightcirculate new rules, they should not be operative until the next general meeting of the union. Alternatively, it might be providedthat the rules should be approved by the appropriate authority under Jthe constitution of the union.Trade disputes and TradeUnions ActRepeal Bill.(previous reference:CM.

Bank of 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theEngland Bill.   Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (45) 167) covering the draft of aBill to bring the Bank of England under public ownership.After the Chancellor had explained the main provisions of theBill discussion followed, of which the main points were thefollowing : (a) The Lord President pointed out that the Bill, as a hybridBill, would be the subject of a special procedure, and it would benecessary to take special steps to ensure that the Governmentsinterests were duly safeguarded.(&amp;) Discussion showed general agreement with the proposals in Clause 1, as to the terms on which the existing Bank Stock wouldbe taken over. It was important, however, that it should be made clear that the basis of compensation to holders, while appropriate in the present case in respect of Bank Stock, which was a Trusteesecurity, would not necessarily be appropriate in other cases of nationalisation and should not therefore be regarded as a precedent.(c) The main discussion took place on Clause 4 (3), whichconferred on the Bank of England power to request information from, and to make recommendations to, banks on banking operations and authorised the Treasury, if they thought it expedient in thepublic interest, to make such regulations and give such directions as they thought necessary for the purpose of ensuring that any suchrequests or recommendations were carried out.(d) It was pointed out by the Secretary of State for India thatthe wording of this Clause was very wide and, indeed, was wider than the power conferred on the Treasury in Clause 4 (1) to give directions to the Bank of England, which power was limited by clause 4 (2).(e) The use of the term &quot; banking operations &quot; was questionedby the President of the Board of Trade, who thought that this mightbe regarded as covering day-to-day operations, and suggested thatthe words &quot; in regard to hanking operations &quot; should be omitted from Clause 4 (3). Some consequential amendment of the long title of the Bill might also be necessary.(/) Several Ministers asked what were the sanctions behindClause 4 (3). The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that to insert a clause containing such sanctions or imprisonment or a finewould look unreal. Discussion showed general agreement with theview expressed by the Minister of Health that the real sanctionswere those implicit in the relations between the Bank of Englandcentral Bank and the commercial Banks.(g) The view was also expressed that, while it was necessarythat there should be power to give directions, it was undesirable alsoto take the power to make regulations. If the latter power wastaken, the question would at once arise whether such regulations would be the subject of affirmative or negative resolutions.  WhileThe Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Second Reading of the Trade Disputes andTrade Unions Act Repeal Bill should be taken at anearly date after Parliament had reassembled and gavegeneral approval to the arrangements for the debateoutlined at &quot; X &quot; above.(2) Agreed that the Minister of Labour and National service should be generally responsible for the Bill in the Houseof Commons and that his Department should undertakeany work connected with the preparation of briefs.(3) Invited the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Ministerof Labour and National Service, to consider in the lightof the discussion the provisions to be included in the Billwith regard to the approval of trade union rules.
the actions of the Minister could, of course, be called in question byParliament, it was undesirable that the directions given in thesematters should be automatically brought before Parliament.(h) The Foreign Secretary thought that it would be better to redraft Clause 4 (3) on the basis that the Treasury should have powerto authorise or request the Bank of England to issue directions tothe Joint Stock Banks, and in their relations with the Joint StockBanks the Treasury should act through the Bank of England. Thiswas in conformity with the view already expressed that the ultimatesanction in these matters was a banking sanction.This suggestion met with general approval.The Cabinet-(1) Expressed general approval of the Bank of England Billappended to CP. (45) 167, subject to the amendment of clause 4 on the lines indicated in discussion.(2) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange forthis Clause of the Bill to be redrafted, and to submit theBill to the Legislation Committee without further reference to the Cabinet.IndustrialDisarmamentof Germany.(previous reference:C.M.(45)8thConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Cabinet had before them a Report by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs, Chairman of the Overseas Reconstruc-tion Committee (CP. (45) 160), on the industrial disarmament ofGermany.At their meeting of the 15th June, 1945, the Cabinet had approved certain proposals as regards the initial measures to betaken for the destruction of-Germany&apos;s industrial war potential, but had deferred consideration of the more detailed proposals. Thesedetailed proposals had now received further consideration, and inthe result the statement of policy on industrial disarmamentappended to CP. (45) 160 had been prepared. The statement was based on the following assumptions which were vital to the whole scheme : (i) Germany would be prohibited for an indefinite period frommaintaining armed forces, possessing arms and munitions or maintaining plant for their manufacture;(ii) Germany would not be dismembered, though important-territories would be ceded to neighbouring States; inparticular, the Rheno-Westphalian industrial districtwould not be withdrawn from the German economiccomplex;(iii) Germany would not be occupied indefinitely but for a sufficiently long period (not less than ten years) to allow the changes in her industrial structure, which wouldresult from the measures recommended, to have a chanceof becoming permanently established.The immediate purpose was to achieve security against thepossibility of future German aggression, and the proposals in thememorandum therefore embodied a drastic policy over a selectedfield of German industry with a view to eliminating the basis ofGermany&apos;s industrial war potential. Arrangements were beingmade for a study to be undertaken separately of the longer termaspect of our policy towards German industry, viz., the economic andtrade aspects from the point of view of British exports and balanceof payments.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theproposals now put forward on behalf of the Overseas reconstruction committee represented the result of long and careful discussion.Our representatives on the Control Commission for Germany and on
the Reparations Commission were in urgent need of definite instructions as to our immediate policy towards German industry,and he trusted that, the present proposals, which . were solelyconcerned with the security aspect, would commend themselves tothe Cabinet. The economic aspect would have to be considered separately on merits.The following points were made in discussion : (a) On the one hand, it was strongly urged that it was almost impossible in practice to draw a clear line of division between theeconomic and the security aspects of this matter. Was it notdifficult to reach a final conclusion on the recommendations now before the Cabinet, save in the light of a review of economicreactions? Surely it was necessary to consider Germany&apos;s require-ments from the economic and social point of view, if there was to beany hope of maintaining order in that country over a long period ofyears. And must not account be taken of the fact that reconsfcruc-tion in Germany would be a costly business and must involve somerestoration of her industrial potential ? How was such recon-struction to be financed? It could only be either by generallydeveloping export markets on a sufficient scale or by loans from theAllies. Experience after the last war had shown the grave problems involved in either of these courses.(b) The policy proposed in the paper was one of great severity.It contemplated the destruction, or at any rate the putting out ofaction of a very wide range of German industry. It had in view,further, the occupation of Germany for a period of not less than ten years. Could we rely on the continued support, over so long aperiod, of public opinion in this country for these drastic steps ?Conditions in the forthcoming winter would probably greatlyappeal to humanitarian feeling in the United Kingdom. Was itwise to commit ourselves to a policy which lack of support heremight make it impossible for us to carry tb rough ?(c) It was urged, on the contrary, that the policy embodied inthe statement appended to the Report by the Overseas Recon-struction Committee, was not nearly as severe as was desirable. Inparticular, it was unwise to exclude the remainder of the chemical industry, including precision and optical instruments and radio,from the groups to be destroyed or placed under control. A similarpoint arose in connection with the postponement of action againstthe manufacture of ball and roller bearings, on which the report was inconsistent with itself.It was explained that in the case of ball and roller bearings, allthat was involved was a postponement to enable sufficient bearingsto be produced to make possible the small amount of Germanindustrial reconstruction that was regarded as inevitable. Theposition of the remainder of the chemical industry was already under urgent examination by the Control Commission, which wouldbe reporting in due course, and no final decision had yet beentaken on this.(d) Admittedly we had to contemplate the risk of an emotionalreaction against the policy now proposed. But the facts had to be faced. The choice before us was between the adoption of severemeasures of reconstruction of this character or a revival of theconditions which in the period between the wars had led to Germanyfinding herself in a position to involve the world in the war whichhad just concluded, and this would have to be made clear to the electorate. Moreover, if public opinion was not prepared to support a policy of the order now in view, it would greatly reduce theprospect of the World Organisation^ being able, when established,to attain its objectives.(e) We must take full account of the demands of the economicside and of the risks that as a result, e.g., of the bankruptcy of the ruhr, we might find ourselves with the need for disposing of astarving population and the political and internal security risks which that involved. On the other- hand, as the Cabinet was aware,there was very strong pressure from Allies who had suffered in the
war, for a substantial measure of reparation, even from western germany, at whatever cost to the population of that area. Ourpresent object was to provide a measure of reparations material from those industries which we did not want Germany to continue.(/) The need for a review of economic reactions was fullyaccepted and arrangements for a report upon them had already beenmade. The present proposals were essentially interim in character and did not prejudice the long-term, issue. As explained in para-graph 7 of the Annex to CP. (45) 160, the programme before theCabinet represented no more than an initial one for dealing withcertain industries so important to the war potential of germany that there could be no reason for delay in dealing with thempending more detailed examination of the whole field.(g) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said thatField-Marshal Smuts had indicated his strong support for theproposals now put forward by the Foreign Secretary.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that wewere confronted with a difficult balance of considerations. Thediscussion had made it clear that the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposalsdealt purely with a short-term programme and so were limited tothe bases of war as we knew them now, and that a separate examina-tion would be made of the longer term aspect of our policy.Meanwhile, it was urgent to instruct our representatives on theControl Commission and on the Reparations Commission and thegeneral sense of the Cabinet was, he thought, that for this purpose the statement of policy on industrial disarmament annexed to theForeign Secretary&apos;s paper should be accepted.The Cabinet-Agreed with the view expressed by the Prime Ministerat &quot;X,&quot; and invited the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to communicate the statement of policy of in-dustrial disarmament annexed to CP. (45) 160, to theBritish representatives on the Control Commission for germany and on the Reparations Commission for theirguidance.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1, &apos;13th September, 1945.
