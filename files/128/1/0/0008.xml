Syria and the lebanon.(previous reference:CM. (45) 5thConclusions,Minute 2.)1, The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Secre-tary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP. (45) 123) containing pro-posals for seeking a settlement of the Levant problem.The Foreign Secretary summarised the main points in his pro-posals as follows :  (i) We had already made it clear that British troops would be withdrawn from the Levant States as soon as the French troopswent, and there were indications that the French might now beprepared to agree to total withdrawal of troops. They were, how-ever, suspicious of our intentions and feared that, if withdrawal oftroops were followed by a breakdown of law and order necessitatingintervention by troops, British troops would be employed for thispurpose. He therefore proposed that it should be made clear &apos;,o allconcerned that if, after withdrawal, disturbances occurred on a scalenecessitating intervention, it would be the French who would send troops to deal with the situation. It must be understood, however, that french troops could not be sent back on the initiative of the FrenchGovernment alone: and the Governments of the United Kingdomand United States would have also to be agreed that the situationnecessitated such intervention.(ii) The foreign advisers required, if Syria and the Lebanonwere to have security forces efficient enough to enable them to main-tain order, should not be British. The local Governments shouldbe urged to recruit them from some disinterested country, e.g.,Sweden or Denmark.(iii) The question of military bases in the Levant should beleft over to be dealt with by the World Organisation.(iv) The Syrians and Lebanese should give guarantees asregards the proper treatment of legitimate French interests in the levant French schools should receive treatment as favourable asthat accorded to the American schools.(v) The local Governments should be informed that british assistance in the purchase and distribution of wheat could not be. continued after the withdrawal of our forces, and they must atonce put in hand arrangements for taking over full responsibilityfor this work. They should also be warned that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment could accept no liability, e.g., in respect of additional imports, in the event of a breakdown in these arrangements.The Foreign Secretary said that these were tentative proposalsWhich would form the starting point in the discussions. The out-come of the discussions might be different. It was, however, essen-tial that we should try to break the present vicious circle. At themoment the temper of the French was easier, and if we were ableto approach them with definite proposals on the lines now suggested,some progress might be made. It was important that we shouldmake some move in this matter before the meeting of the Councilof Foreign Ministers. Before opening discussions, however, he wished to know whether he would have the support of the Cabinetin making an approach to the problem on these lines.Discussion centred on the following points : :(a) Attention was drawn to the importance of the wording ofany announcement to be made on this matter. We must not riskany misunderstanding on the part of the Syrians and the Lebaneseor give the impression that, if disorder broke out, the French wouldbe free to send in troops at their own discretion.The Foreign Secretary said that his first anxiety was to reach some agreement with the other Governments concerned, and he hadnot yet given consideration to the terms of any announcement. If,however, agreement were reached on the proposals set out in thisMemorandum, it would be clear that French troops could not be sentback unless the Governments of the United States and the UnitedKingdom, as well as the French Government, were satisfied thatthis was necessary.(&amp;) Would it not be expedient to bring the Soviet Governmentinto these discussions 1   Should we not at least invite them to take
part ? If they declined, we should have a complete reply to theParliamentary criticism which might be expected if they were leftout. Russia already showed signs of an exaggerated sense of isola-tion; and we should do nothing to aggravate this.It was pointed out, on the other hand, that the Soviet Govern-ment had expressed no desire to be associated with these discussions.The area was one with which they had never been closely concerned,and there would be risk of grave misunderstanding in Turkey, withthe question of the Straits still unsettled, and in the Middle Eastgenerally, if we now brought Russia into these discussions.(c) Would it assist in meeting any objection to the exclusion of the Soviet Government if we refrained from bringing the UnitedStates Government into the discussions ? Was there any reason tothink that they would be prepared to co-operate on the basis pro-posed? And were their interests in the area sufficiently great tojustify their association with the action proposed ?The Foreign Secretary said that he did not know what theattitude of the United States Government would be. They had,however, a very definite interest in this area. They had MissionSchools there. And they were closely interested in the wholeMediterranean problem and, in his judgment, it was most important that an invitation should be extended to them.id) Would there be advantage in treating the matter morebroadly and taking the line that agreement would have to be reachedinternationally without at this stage specifying the Powers con-cerned ?The Foreign Secretary thought that such a procedure would be dangerous in advance of any decision as regards Mandates and Terri-torial Trusteeship.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that there were great advantages in dealing with this matter on a three-Power basis between the French, the United States and ourselves. The position was that we were in occupation in this area and were trying to get out of it. The French, who held a mandate for it, were closely and directly concerned with it. TheUnited States had certain interests in it. The proposal now beforethe Cabinet afforded a means of seeking a possible solution whichwould avoid the appearance of competition between France andGreat Britain.(e) The Secretary of State for War said that neither the Syriansnor the Lebanese were yet in a position to assure us of their capacity to maintain order when foreign troops were withdrawn. GeneralPaget was due to arrive in this country next week, and he suggestedthat this part of the problem should be discussed with him before a final decision was taken.The Foreign Secretary said that he would be very ready to see general Paget but he wished meanwhile to make some progress withthe discussion of the general policy. It was, of course, essential thatthe local Governments should press on with the organisation of theirGendarmerie; and there would be no question of our withdrawinguntil we were satisfied that the local Governments had a reasonable prospect of being able to maintain order.(/) The President of the Board of Trade thought there was serious risk of a breakdown in food supplies on the withdrawal ofthe wheat-buying and distributing organisation at present run bythe British military authorities. Would it not be possible to put the military personnel concerned on to a civilian basis and allow them to carry on for a time under the local Governments ?The Foreign Secretary said that he was willing that this sugges-tion should be considered, and he would amend his proposals on thispoint (paragraph 8 of CP. (45) 123) so as to read &quot;british assistance cannot be continued indefinitely after the withdrawal ofour Forces.&quot;
The Cabinet Agreed that the Foreign Secretary should initiate discus-sions on this matter on the general lines indicated in cp. (45) 123, subject to the points noted at (e) and (/)above.2. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (45) 124) proposing the early introduction of legis-lation suspending the obligations which the Civil Defence Actsimposed on local authorities and others to make preparations againstthe risk of air attack, but empowering the Secretary of State to revive any of these suspended obligations by Order in Council, either generally or in particular areas, when he thought it expedient.There was general support for the proposal to introduce legis-lation on the lines proposed in the Home Secretary&apos;s Memorandum.Discussion turned on the extent to which it was necessary tomaintain a system of air-raid precautions. It was generally agreedthat the Home Office should continue to carry on research and planning for the future of civil defence. There was, however, somedivergence of view on the extent to which the nucleus of a civil defence organisation should be maintained throughout the country.In discussion of this question the following points were raised: (a) Much experience had been gained during the war in thelocal organisation of civil defence; and it would be wasteful to let the existing organisation disappear without any attempt to holdtogether a nucleus of those who had acquired this special experience.A proposal to retain a nucleus of the existing organisation wouldexcite little public attention : to establish a new organisation later on would be more difficult and would give rise to much more publiccomment.(b) On the other side, it was contended that a skeleton organisa-tion for local civil defence services would either become moribundfor lack of functions; or, if it were given functions to keep it alive,would become a nuisance.(c) When the legislation proposed by the Home Secretary was introduced, it might be necessary to indicate whether the nucleus of a local organisation for civil defence was to be maintained. some ministers felt that public avowal at this stage of an intention toretain a skeleton organisation would seem inconsistent with con-fidence in the future of the World Organisation. Other Ministerstook the view that the Government could not yet be expected toproceed on the assumption that no preparations need be made against future war; and made the further point that it would bemuch less alarming to public opinion, both in this country andabroad, to maintain the nucleus of an existing organisation than tobe forced at some future date to take fresh steps for the creationof a new organisation.(d) The Minister of Works said that his Department would need guidance on the extent to which regard should be paid to civil defence considerations in the construction of new buildings.War-time experience had shown the value of steel-frame buildingswith cellars. Was it desirable that his Department should givea lead, in the construction of buildings (e:g., Post Offices) for whichthey were responsible, by concentrating on this form of building and making the cellars stronger than they need otherwise be?The view was expressed that, if the Ministry of Works showedany preference for this type of building, they should base it on theincreased advantages from the point of view of fire-risk rather thanits value for air-raid shelter.(e) It was pointed out that, until more was known of the effectsand the future of the atomic bomb, it would not be possible to reach any firm conclusions about the future organisation of civil defence,or the standards of protection required in buildings, &amp;c.
The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals put forward in CP. (45) 124 forthe early introduction of legislation to suspend the civil defence Acts, 1937-39.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to review, in the light of thediscussion, the question of maintaining a nucleus of thelocal organisation for civil defence; and to submit his proposals in the first instance to the Lord presidents committee.Education. 3,   xhe Cabinet considered Memoranda by the Minister of raising of Education (CP. (45) 117) and the Secretary of State for ScotlandSchool Leaving (CP. (45) 119) proposing that local education authorities should nowAge. oe informed that the school leaving age would be raised to 15 onthe 1st April, 1947.The Minister of Education said that the raising of the agecould not be postponed beyond the 1st April, 1947, without fresh legislation. Local education authorities would not, however, presson with their administrative preparations unless it was made clearthat the Government were firmly resolved to adhere to this date.From the political point of view it was clearly undesirable that this government should have to postpone the date; and there was every reason for pressing local authorities to make ready for the 1947date, if it were practicable to complete the necessary preparationsin time. The Minister said that she had gone very carefully intothe requirements, both for teachers and for accommodation, and shewas satisfied that these could be met in time if a sufficient allocation of man-power were made to the educational services. The detailscould be taken up with the Man-Power Committee : what sherequired was a decision of principle that the school leaving ageshould be raised on the 1st April, 1947, and that local educationauthorities should be told at once that they must make their prepara-tions accordingly.The Secretary of State for Scotland supported this proposal.He had not yet been able to frame precise estimates of the accommo-dation and man-power involved in Scotland. The physical diffi-culties were, however, less in Scotland than in England and Wales,where air-raid damage had been more extensive; and he believedthat the necessary preparations could be completed in time. Hewas aware that some people took the view that it would be preferable to delay the raising of the school age rather than continue to haveovercrowded classes. He did not share this view : he attached verygreat importance to raising the leaving age by the latest date speci-fied in the Act.The Secretary of State added that, if the Cabinet approved the proposals now before them, the announcement in respect ofScotland should be made simultaneously with that relating toEngland and Wales.There was general agreement that from the political point ofview it would be a great embarrassment to the present Governmentto have to bring forward legislation postponing the raising of theschool leaving age beyond the latest date determined by the lastParliament. Discussion turned on the question whether it wouldbe practicable to complete the preparations required in time topermit of the age being raised on the 1st April, 1947. The main points raised in discussion were : (a) Had the implications of this proposal, as regards man-power and building resources, been discussed with the other ministers concerned ?The Minister of Education said that the building requirementsup to the end of 1945 had been discussed with the Ministry ofWorks.  Figures for 1946 were now available and could be discussed
with the interested Departments. It would be necessary to ask theMinister of Health to raise, in respect of schools, the existing banon new building in the London area.(b) As regards teachers, it was stated in CP. (45) 117 that,apart from the 13,000 additional teachers required to match theincreased number of pupils, a much larger number would be needed to replace the married women and teachers over the normal age of retirement who might leave the profession in the near future. had any estimate been made of this further requirement ?The Minister of Education said that about 25,000 would berequired to replace the abnormal wastage, and a further 20,000 ifthe size of classes was to be reduced to the desired level.(c) The Lord President of the Council said that, before any public announcement was made, the Government must be satisfiedthat it would, in fact, be practicable to complete the preparationsrequired in time. There would certainly be criticism if the datehad to be deferred. But there might well be even more damagingcriticism if proper preparations could not be made before 1947 and,as a result, there was overcrowding of classes, shortage of teachers and a lower standard of education.(d) The Home Secretary said that it had been the intentionof the former Minister of Education to raise the age on the30th September, 1946. He himself thought it preferable that theage should be raised in April, rather than September, because ofthe relation between primary and secondary education; and he strongly favoured a decision to raise the age on the 1st April, 1947.It should be borne in mind that, if this were done, many children would not be affected until September 1947; and it would not beuntil April 1948 that the full effect of raising the age would be felt. A further point was that in many parts of the country therewas an excess of accommodation in the schools because of the drop in the child population. Educationally, it would be preferable toreduce the size of classes rather than raise the school leaving age;but politically he had no doubt that this Government must make every effort to carry out the provisions of the Act, which gave effectto a policy which the Labour Party had advocated for many years past. As regards the attitude of local education authorities, he strongly endorsed the views of the Minister of Education. no progress would be made with the preparations required until it-was made clear that the Government were firmly resolved to raisethe age on the 1st April, 1947. If there were further postponement,progressive education authorities would be disheartened and theless progressive authorities would be confirmed in their view thatthe raising of the age could be postponed indefinitely.(e) The Minister of Health said that, while he agreed that thedate should not be deferred, he would deprecate any early announce-ment because of its effect on the housing programme. Many localauthorities were responsible for both education and housing : theyhad been urged to give immediate attention to their housing pro-grammes : and it was undesirable at this moment, when there wasa grave shortage of technical staffs, that their attention should be diverted to the problem of school accommodation. He fully recog-nised that, in planning new housing estates, proper provision shouldbe made for schools, but it was one thing to insist on such provisionbeing made, and another to require that the building of the schoolsshould be put in hand at once. He also made the point, withreference to paragraph 6 of CP. (45) 117 and paragraph 5 of cp. (45) 119, that it was undesirable that those responsible forallocating building resources should have their hands tied by anyover-riding obligation to meet in full the requirements of the educa-tion services.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed in principle that it was desirable that the school leaving age should be raised to 15 on the 1st April, 1947; and that
a public announcement to that effect should be made as soon asthe Government were satisfied that it would in fact be practicable to complete the necessary preparations in time to enable this to bedone. A Committee of Ministers should consider, as a matter of urgency, whether these preparations could be completed in time,consistently with a proper allocation of resources to the other essen-tial national needs, including housing.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord President of the Council to arrange forthe appointment of an ad hoc Committee comprising theMinisters primarily concerned, to consider and. report tothe Cabinet as soon as possible on the practical implications of a decision that the school leaving age should be raised to 15 on the 1st April, 1947.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,23rd August, 1945.
