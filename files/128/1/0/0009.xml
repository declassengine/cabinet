Assistance forLiberatedEurope.(previous reference erence:CM. (45) 13thConclusions,Minute 5.)Personnel.Vehicles.1.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the&apos;Minister of State (CP. (45) 122) urging that assistance should begiven to U.N.R.R.A. in terms of personnel, transport and possiblyclothing.The Cabinet first considered the question of personnel. It wasagreed in principle that His Majesty&apos;s Government should make their due contribution towards the needs of U.N.R.R.A. for keypersonnel. There could be no question of U.N.R.R.A. being given  an over-riding priority in respect of any particular individual; but,subject to that understanding, the Minister of State was encouraged to press upon the Ministers concerned the importance of making available the individuals for whom U.N.R.R.A. were asking.The Cabinet next considered the question of assistance in termsof vehicles. They were informed that there were some 350,000lorries at the moment under the control of Service Departments.The Minister of State said that as a matter of urgency he was anxious to secure 5,000 vehicles from Italy and 2,000 to 3,000vehicles from the United Kingdom. As regards the longer-term problem, he was advised that before next summer 250,000 lorrieswould be required in Europe. He had suggested in discussion witha representative of the United States Government that we mightaim at providing 100,000 of these, and there was reason to thinkthat the United States might be prepared to contribute a propor-tionate scale. The principle to which he was anxious to work wasthat vehicles in running order should be supplied to non-payingU.N.R.R.A. countries and debited against our contribution toU.N.R.R.A. Vehicles not in running order should be assigned topaying countries which had garages which could rehabilitate them.In discussion the following points were made : (a) The urgent need was for some assistance by the end ofSeptember. U.N.R.R.A. needed by that date 44,000 tons lift. WewTere prepared to provide 3,000 vehicles from Italy and 1,500 fromthe United Kingdom. Canada would provide 7,200, the UnitedStates 2,950. That left a deficit of 30,000 tons. Could we notdispose of this immediate problem without prejudice to our planning of the long-term arrangements ?(&amp;) The Service Departments were in a position to help; and substantial numbers of vehicles were already being transferred tothe Ministry of Supply for disposal.(c) The Secretary of State for Burma said that in any globaldistribution the position of Burma should not be overlooked.Transport was essential to the restoration of civil government in burma.(d) The needs of this country, particularly in connection with housing, should not be overlooked in the review of the general position.(e) We should verify that petrol would be available for anylorries which we might supply. We should also know whether weshould be called upon to contribute towards the supply of petrol and spare parts for these lorries.After further discussion the Prime Minister said that theissue was primarily one of disposals policy. He suggested that theMinister of Supply should put in hand at once a comprehensiveover-all review of the position, to cover both British surplus lorriesand lend-lease surplus lorries. All interested Departments shouldbe associated with this enquiry. In the light of the report of this enquiry it could be decided by the Lord Presidents Committee how many lorries could, having regard to competing claims, be madeavailable for U.N.R.R.A.Clothing. Clothing. The Minister of State urged that there should bean investigation of the extent to which we could help U.N.R.R.A.by making clothing available from Army stocks.[30692-6] B 2
It was agreed that this was a matter for investigation underthe authority of the Minister of Supply.The Cabinet-(1) Took note that the Minister of State would pursue with theMinisters concerned the question of the release of keypersonnel required for service with U.N.R.RA.(2) Invited the Minister of Supply to arrange for a review tobe made on the lines suggested by the Prime minister in discussion of the long-term requirements for surpluslorries and to report on this issue to the Lord presidents committee.(3) Asked the Minister of Supply to consider whetherU.N.R.R.A.&apos;s immediate needs of lorries could be met without prejudice to the long-term arrangementsreferred to in (2) above.(4) Asked the Minister of Supply to consider what suppliesof clothing could be made available to U.N.R.R.A. fromArmy stocks.Middle East. 2.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theFuture Policy. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP. (45) 130) on british policy in the Middle East.The Foreign Secretary said that he wished to summon HisMajesty&apos;s Representatives in the Middle East to an early meeting in London to discuss our general policy in the Middle East andwas anxious to be assured that his colleagues approved the lines on which he proposed to conduct those discussions.We should consider whether we were to continue to assert our political predominance in the Middle East and our over-ridingresponsibility for its defence, or whether, alternatively, on financialand man-power grounds, we should decide to seek the extensiveassistance of other Powers in the defence of the Middle East.Redistribution of our armed forces would have to be considerednow that the war had come to an end. This was an opportune moment for a general review of our Middle Eastern policy. the disappearance of the post of Resident Minister, Middle East, raisedproblems in connection with co-ordination. Arrangements had tobe made for carrying on certain of the functions of the Middle EastSupplies Centre, which would shortly be closing down. It was important that we should have an economic and social policycovering the Middle East as a whole.He proposed to associate with these discussions all the various departments concerned and, in particular, the Colonial Office, IndiaOffice and Treasury. No overt action should be taken (e.g., callinghome the High Commissioner in Palestine to join in the discussions)which might imply that the conference was considering the Jewish-Arab problem in Palestine; but he would certainly take advantageof Lord Gorts presence in this country to consult him privately onaspects of the wider Middle East problems which affected Palestine.He would similarly be ready to arrange for consultation with arepresentative from Cyprus.As regards consultation with the Heads of the Defence services in the Middle East, he thought the wiser course was to concentratein the first instance on the social and economic aspects of this matter.He recognised, however, that it would be essential to considerseparately its defence aspects and later to bring together the resultsof the two enquiries.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals of the Foreign Secretary as setout in CP. (45) 130 and invited him to proceed accordingly.
Ceylon. 3.   The Cabinet had before them a report from the Colonial&quot;(Previous        Affairs Committee on the Report of the Soulbury Commission on reference:      constitutional reform in Ceylon (CP. (45) 132),CM.(45) 14th The Committee were.in general satisfied that the new Constitu-Conclusions, tion proposed, a summary of which was contained in their Report,Minute 6.)      appeared to provide a suitable measure of constitutional progress.On the question whether the final acceptance of any scheme of constitutional reform should be conditional on acceptance by three-quarters of the members of the State Council, they considered thatin i the discussions which he was proposing to hold withMr. Senanayake, Leader of the Ceylon State Council, the Secretaryof State for the Colonies should be given a discretion, if mr. Senanayake raised this matter, to inform him that it should be his object to secure the maximum possible majority in the state council for the Soulbury proposals; that that majority shouldpreferably include the largest possible element of minority represen-tation; and that on this understanding His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould not necessarily insist on holding to the three-quartersmajority contemplated in the Declaration of 1943.It was proposed to make suitable arrangements for consulting the Government of India and also the Ceylon State Council before final conclusions were reached on the Report.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that if authorisedto enter into confidential discussions with Mr. Senanayake on thebasis of the Report as modified by the proposals of the Committee,it would be his intention again to report to the Cabinet after those discussions had taken place and to obtain their approval of any constitutional scheme which he might then wish to recommend beforesteps were taken to lay it before Parliament for consideration. all he asked at the moment, however, was authority to enter into these discussions without in any way committing the Cabinet.A general discussion followed. In the result the Cabinet feltunable to reach conclusions on the important matters covered by theReport or to authorise the Secretary of State for the Colonies toproceed even with the tentative and non-committal discussions withMr. Senanayake which he had in mind, until the Report as a wholehad been circulated to the Cabinet and there had been opportunityto discuss its recommendations in closer detail.The Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to circulate the Report of the Soulbury Commission and the minutes ofthe meeting of the Colonial Affairs Committee at which ithad been considered, with a view to resuming their dis-cussion at a meeting early in the following week.Man-Power. 4.   The Minister of Labour and National Service drew atten-(Previous       tion to the persistent criticisms in the Press of the working of the reference:      demobilisation scheme and in particular to an article in the DailyCM.(45)23rd  Mail by Mr. Garry Allighan, M.P.   These criticisms were causingConclusions,    discontent both among the public generally and among the Forces,Minute l.)      and he felt that it was desirable that the Prime Minister should ata very early date make a statement which would reaffirm theprinciples of the scheme and explain why demobilisation could not take place more rapidly.The Minister of Health said that in his view a radical revisionof the demobilisation arrangements was required if the civil Depart-ments were to obtain the labour which they required. There seemedto him to be unnecessary delay in Class A releases; and, now thatthe Japanese war had ended, men were not willing to volunteerfor release in Class B under the conditions prescribed in the scheme.The housing programme depended to a large extent on Class b releases and he feared that, unless steps were taken to modify theexisting Class B release arrangements, the Government would be faced with unemployment among building workers by the end ofthe year since the necessary supervisory and technical staff wouldnot be available. He asked for an early meeting of the Man-power committee to review the whole position.
The Foreign Secretary recalled that the principles of the demobilisation scheme had been the subject of prolonged and carefulconsideration in the light of the lessons learned in 1918-19. HisMajesty&apos;s Government had heavy commitments abroad for which itwould be necessary to maintain powerful Forces both in Europe andin the East, and it would be disastrous to alter the scheme in sucha way as to cause discontent among these Forces. It was natural that, with the end of the Japanese war and the prospect of earlierrelease in Class A, men should be less willing to volunteer for release in Class B, but the civil Departments had themselves insistedin the past that the men released in Class B should be subject todirection so that they might be used to meet the most urgent needs, of reconstruction at home. A report was being prepared for theMan-Power Committee on the question whether, within the prin-ciples of the existing scheme, any further action could be taken to speed up releases. This report would be considered at a meetingof the Man-Power Committee to be held on Monday and the Com-mittee&apos;s recommendations would thereafter be submitted to theCabinet.The Foreign Secretary pointed out that the existing practice,under which separate announcements about the scheme were madeby the individual Service Departments, was apt to lead to confusion and misunderstanding. He suggested that all announcements shouldbe made by the Minister of Labour and National Service, who should in each case give the Press in advance a full explanation and justi-fication of what was proposed.In further discussion it was urged that all possible steps shouldbe taken to avoid unnecessary delay in releases under the demobilisa-tion scheme and to remove the feeling of frustration among men andwomen who were retained in the Forces without being fully employed. At the same time the Cabinet recognised the danger of creating a state of affairs similar to that in 1918-19 when theposition of His Majesty&apos;s Government in international affairs was seriously weakened by the rapidity with which the Forces weredemobilised. There was general agreement that the arrangementsfor the making of announcements regarding the scheme should become-ordinated on the lines proposed by the Foreign Secretary, andy it was suggested that the Prime Minister should make a statementstressing the need for-the retention of substantial Armed forces to carry out the commitments of His Majesty&apos;s Government abroad.The Prime Minister said that demobilisation was one of themost difficult and critical of the problems confronting the Govern-ment at the present time. It was essential that there should be no avoidable delay in releasing men and women from the Forces. Onthe other hand, full weight must be given to the lessons learned atthe end of the last war and to the heavy tasks which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were still bound to discharge in connection with theoccupation of ex-enemy countries.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Man-Power Committee to submit an early reportto the Cabinet on the question whether any modificationscould be made in the demobilisation scheme which wouldaccelerate releases in Class A and increase the numberof ^workers released in Class B.(2) Agreed that any future public announcements about the demobilisation scheme should be made by the Ministerof Labour and National Service; and that, in particular,the Minister of Labour and National Service should holda Press Conference in the following week in order toexplain any decisions which the Cabinet might reachwith regard to modifications of the scheme.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would thereafter con-sider making a public statement on the lines suggested at &quot;X&quot; above.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,30th August, 1945.
