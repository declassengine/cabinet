Disposalof the dodecanese.(previous reference:C.M.(45)30thConclusions,Minute 5.)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum on this subject by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP. (45) 251).The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that none of theGovernments represented on the Council of Foreign Ministers had opposed the suggestion that the Dodecanese should be ceded to greece, and he thought that His Majesty&apos;s Government could properly arrange for the Greek Government to assume the de factoadministration of the islands, pending a final decision regarding their ultimate disposal. He hoped that the Cabinet would approvethis in principle and leave it to him to determine the appropriate moment at which to make, and announce, the arrangement.   &apos;The Chief of. the A ir Staff said that the Chiefs of Staff agreedthat it was unnecessary to maintain British military government inthe Dodecanese and had no objection to the Foreign Secretary&apos;proposal.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed in principle that arrangements should be made for; the Greek Government to assume de facto administrationof the Dodecanese, pending a final decision regarding theultimate disposal of the islands. &quot;      .; ,&apos;/(2) Authorised  the  Foreign   Secretary  to   implement   andannounce this decision at such time as he consideredappropriate.Burma.(previous reference:W.M.(45)61stConclusions,Minute 6.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum bv the Secre-tary of State for Burma (CP. (45) 258) describing the situationreached in discussions with the Anti-Fascist People&apos;s IndependenceLeague regarding the constitution of the Executive Council in Burma.The Secretary of State for Burma said that the claims madeby this League would not only have given them a clear majority on the Executive Council, but would have put them in a positionto determine the composition of the Council as a whole. They had also claimed the right to nominate the members of the LegislativeCouncil, which was to be set up later in the year. If these claimshad been conceded, the League would have been placed, without anyelectoral mandate, in decisive and exclusive control of the Govern-ment. In these circumstances the Governor of Burma had taken theright course in declining to accept the demands of the League and extending independent invitations to individuals (some of whom were on the League&apos;s list) to join the Executive Council.The Secretary of State said that he had already assured theGovernor of his full support for this line of action; but he had thought it right to bring the matter to the notice of the Cabinet.The Cabinet took note with approval of the policy whichthe Governor of Burma was pursuing in the selection ofhis Executive Council. , :::Parliament. 3.   The Lord President of the Council recalled that bothMotion of Houses of Parliament were to be invited that day to pass MotionsGratitude to of Gratitude to the Services on the victorious conclusion of the war.the Services. It had been suggested, on behalf of the Opposition, that on theconclusion of this business the House of Commons should be adjourned for the remainder of the day. This suggestion could bejustified on grounds of sentiment, but he thought it would&apos; be more in accord with majority opinion to spend the remainder of the day in making progress with other business.[30832-1] b 2
AdjournmentMotion on atomic Bomb.Statement ofPolicy. on CivilAviation.(previous reference:CM. (45)46thConclusions,Minute 2.)Supplies and services(Transitional, Powers) Bill.(previous reference:&apos;&apos;CM.(45)24thConclusions,Minute 2.)The Cabinet were informed that Parliament had not been specially adjourned on the corresponding occasion at the end of thelast war. ;The Cabinet  ;(1) Agreed that, after passing the Motions of Gratitude to theServices, both Houses of Parliament should proceed withother business until the normal time for adjournment.The Cabinet were informed that Captain A. R. Blackburn,M.P., was proposing to raise on the Adjournment that day thequestion of the atomic bomb. It did not seem desirable that thePrime Minister should make a statement on this subject in thecourse of a debate on the Adjournment. If, therefore, the matter was raised, it would be preferable that the Lord President, as leader of the House, should reply.The Cabinet-(2) Took note that the Lord President would deal with anydebate which took place on the Adjournment that dayon the subject of the atomic bomb.The Lord President of &quot;the Council recalled that the Ministerof Civil Aviation was to make a statement of policy in the Houseof Lords on the 1st November. It was desirable that his Parlia-mentary Secretary should make a simultaneous statement in theHouse of Commons. The MinisterV statement was to be made inthe course of a Debate; and there was likely to be a demand for acorresponding Debate in the House of Commons. This demand would have to be met; and it was impossible for the Debate to beheld on the Adjournment, since this would preclude any discussionof future legislation. In these circumstances there was much tobe said in this particular case for presenting a White Paper onwhich the Debate in the House of Commons could be taken.The Cabinet-(3) Agreed that a statement of Government policy on civilaviation should be made in the House of Commons on the1st November.(4) Invited the Minister of Civil Aviation to arrange for a white Paper on the Governments policy on civilaviation to be presented as soon as possible, so that itwould be available before these issues were debated inthe House of Commons.The Secretary of State for Air said that the Second reading of the Supplies and Services (Transitional Powers) Bill was beingmoved in the House of Lords that afternoon and that he would bereplying to the Debate. There was likely to be substantial support in the House of Lords for the view that the duration of this Billshould be reduced from five years to two. He presumed that theCabinet were not prepared to make any concession on that point.The Cabinet-(5) Invited the Secretary of State for Air to resist strongly any pressure to reduce the duration of this Bill.supplies for Europe.(previous reference:C.M.(45)45thConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Food (CP. (45) 254) on wheat supplies for Germanyand Austria.The Minister of Food said that the proposal made in cp. (45) 254 was that he should ship no further wheat to Germanyand Austria until he had received assurances from the mainexporting countries that they were willing to reduce their stocksof wheat at the 30th June, 1946, to levels consistent with theminima under the International Wheat Agreement. In view,however, of the urgent representations received from Field-MarshalMontgomery after the circulation of this memorandum, and as it
Pood Policy 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theand Future of Minister of Food (CP. (45) 236) covering a draft announcementMinistry of on Government controls and food policy which had been approvedFood. by  the Lord Presidents Committee   (L.P.  (45) 37th Meeting,Minute 2).The Minister of Food explained that if the Cabinet approvedhis proposals immediate steps would be taken to work out, in consul-tation with the Departments concerned and, when necessary, withwas unlikely that any reply would be received to the representations made to the United States Government for three weeks, he had now given orders for the shipment of 112,500 tons of wheat, representingthe first instalment of the 225,000 tons which we had agreed tosupply in response to the original request for half a million tons ofwheat in the six months up to March 1946. At the present timestocks of wheat in the United Kingdom, excluding stocks on farms,amounted to 14 weeks&apos; supply, which was considerably higher thanthe available stocks in 1939, but he felt bound to have regard to the prospective position at June 1946, and he felt that we could not meet the full demands for supplies for Germany and Austria, aswell as those for supplies for liberated countries and India, withoutreducing our stocks below the safety level.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster pointed out thatField-Marshal Montgomery had now asked for supplies of wheatamounting to approximately 900,000 tons up to March 1946, andhad indicated that, unless supplies on this scale were provided, aserious situation would arise in Germany and, in particular, thenecessary coal production would not be secured. He urged that theadditional demands made by Field-Marshal Montgomery should bemet, even though this involved reducing stocks in this country.In discussion there was general agreement with the view thatthere could be no complete stoppage of wheat shipments to Germanyand Austria pending negotiations with exporting countries. Withregard to the demands for additional supplies made byField-Marshal Montgomery, it was pointed out that these repre-sented a considerable increase on the amounts already agreed to andthat it might be desirable to send a mission to Germany, including arepresentative of the Ministry of Food, in order to ascertain whether these demands could not be reduced and to ensure thatall possible efforts were being made to collect wheat from theGerman harvest.The Prime Minister said that it seemed desirable that these issues should be further sifted by the Lord Presidents Committeein the light of the most recent telegrams from Field-MarshalMontgomery.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Minister of Food had arranged to ship to Germany an instalment of 112,500 tons of wheat,which would meet the needs of the British Zones for November.(2) Invited the Lord Presidents Committee to consider thematter afresh with a view to focussing the issues for decision by the Cabinet. For this purpose the Chan-cellor of the Duchy of Lancaster should circulate to theCommittee a memorandum setting out the requirements for Germany and Austria, while the Minister of food should circulate a memorandum indicating what supplies were being provided at the present time, to what extentwe had outstanding commitments to supply wheat toGermany and Austria and how far supplies could bemaintained or increased over the coming months.
Empire Tele-commumoa-tions.(previous reference:W.M.(45)lstConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The Cabinet had before them . a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (45) 257) recommending thatapproval should be given to the recommendations of the Common-wealth Telecommunications Conference with regard to the futureof Commonwealth telecommunications services.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the ministerial committee on Empire Telecommunications Services had approved the recommendations of the Conference. These recommendationsprovided for the establishment in each Dominion (except Eire), inIndia and the United Kingdom of public corporations to whichwould be transferred those telecommunications assets of; theCommonwealth which were not already publicly owned, and a commonwealth Telecommunications Board which would be an advisory body in the first instance but would in time develop, it was hoped, into something more. A conference on rates and certain other questions was to be held with the United States and theDominions in Bermuda in November, and it was desirable that anthe food trade interests, plans in respect of the procurement, distri-bution and sale of all foods which played an important part in thenation&apos;s diet. The Government policy in respect of bulk purchase and other forms of food control would be settled in consultationwith the President of the Board of Trade and the Minister of Supplyand Aircraft Production, who were responsible for other forms ofbulk purchase. The Lord Presidents Committee had agreed thatthe Ministry of Food should continue as a separate and permanentDepartment, but it had not been felt that there would be any advantage in including a statement to this effect in the proposed announcement.In discussion it was urged that the draft announcement should include such a statement, and it was pointed out that the Leader ofthe House of Lords had already made an announcement to this effect in a debate in the Hbuse of Lords on the 24th October. On the otherhand, it was suggested that it might be premature to make any suchannouncement until the demarcation of functions between theMinistry of Food and other Departments had been finally settled;and the Minister of Health suggested that further consideration should be given to the question whether, after the period of foodshortages had passed, the Ministry of Health should not assume theremaining functions of the Ministry of Food, apart from those relating to bulk purchase, which might be discharged by the Ministryof Supply.The view of the Cabinet was that the Ministry of Food shouldcontinue as a separate and permanent Department, and that anannouncement to this effect should be included in the proposed statement on food policy.Other points in discussion were : (a) It was agreed that, in order to include fishermen as well asagricultural producers, &quot;home producer&quot; should be substituted for&quot; home farmer &quot; in the fifth paragraph of the announcement.(b) It was agreed that the last two lines of the draft announce-ment should be omitted.   .-The Cabinet-(1) Decided that the Ministry of Food should be retained as aseparate and permanent Department of Government, andthat this decision should be announced without delay.(2) Agreed that an announcement on food policy should be madeat an early date in the terms of the draft annexed to cp. (45) 236, subject to the inclusion after the first paragraph of a sentence to the effect that the Ministry ofFood will be continued as a separate and permanentDepartment, and to the drafting amendments noted at(a) and (b) above.
parliamentary procedure.Report ofSelectCommittee.(previous reference:C.M.(45)21stConclusions,Minute 5.)announcement about the recommendations of the CommonwealthTelecommunications Conference should be made before this conference met. If the Cabinet approved, he would propose to.make an announcement, in reply to an arranged parliamentary question, in the terms of the draft annexed to CP. (45) 257&apos;Negotiations would then be started for the transfer to the new organisation in the United Kingdom of the assets owned by cable and Wireless Limited, and the proposed terms of compensation would be submitted to the Cabinet for approval before any finalcommitments were made.The Cabinet Approved the recommendations made in paragraph 2 ofOP- (45)257 with regard to Commonwealth telecommunications-nations services, and authorised the Chancellor of the-Exchequer to make an. early announcement in the termsof the draft annexed to CP. (45) 257.7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord Presi-dent of the Council (CP. (45) 253) covering the First Report fromthe Select Committee on Parliamentary Procedure.The Lord President of the Council said that this Report was confined to the views of the Select Committee on the scheme, put before them by the Government, for accelerating proceedings on public Bills. The Committee had endorsed the main features ofthis scheme, though they had rejected two minor proposals anddeferred their final views on two others. He recommended that early steps should be taken to bring this scheme into operation, butasked that he should be given some latitude in dealing with the minor points On which the Committee&apos;s Report deviated from thememorandum put before them by the Government.Points in discussion were :  (a) One of the proposals which the Select Committee had rejected was that no opportunity should be given for amendmentor debate on the Report stage of a Financial Resolution. The SelectCommittee had now to go on to consider the whole question ofprocedure on financial business; and it might be suggested to themthat they should reconsider this particular proposal regarding theReport stage of a Financial Resolution in their general study ofprocedure on financial business.(&amp;) The Select Committee had suggested that, in view of theproposal to increase the number of Standing Committees, theGovernment might consider the appointment of a third Law Officer.There was general agreement that, while it would be undesir-able to appoint a third Law Officer, other steps should be taken toensure that Standing Committees had expert guidance on points oflaw. The Lord President was invited to consider whether this point could be met by amending the Standing Orders so as to enable theLaw Officers&apos;to attend and speak in any Standing Committee, andto empower the Chairman of a Standing Committee to suspend dis-cussion on a point of law until such time as a Law Officer could be present.It was recognised that, if the Law Officers were thus requirecto give more time to the work of Standing Committees, it would benecessary to modify the existing tradition by which the legal workof the Law Officers took priority over their Parliamentary work.The Lord Chancellor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer already had this point under consideration.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the First Report of the Select Committee on parliamentary Procedure should be accepted, subject tothe two points noted at (a) and (b) above and subjectto further consideration by the Lord President of theremaining points at which the Report differed from thescheme submitted to the Committee by the Government.
(2) Invited the Lord President to arrange for the Report, andthe necessary amendments of the Standing Orders, to be debated in the House of Commons during the following week.Parliamentary 8. The Lord President of the Council recalled that at their labour Party, meeting on the 18th October the Cabinet had invited the Minister of views of Civil Aviation to ascertain the views held by the Civil AviationSpecialist Group of the Parliamentary Labour Party on the future organisa-Groups on tion of British civil aviation; and that a memorandum by thisParticular Group had been circulated with the Report (CP. (45) 245) whichAspects of had subsequently been made to the Cabinet by the Civil AviationGovernment Committee. He thought it would be helpful if Ministers couldPolicy. make it a regular practice to inform their colleagues of views heldby particular groups of Government supporters on matters coming forward for decision by the Cabinet or by one of its Committees.It was specially desirable that this should be done on occasions when a section of Government supporters was likely to criticise apolicy advocated by a Minister.In discussion it was agreed that, while Ministers should take appropriate steps to make such views known to their colleagues,it was preferable that memoranda prepared by groups of Govern-ment supporters should not as a general rule be formally circulatedto the Cabinet or its Committees.The Cabinet-Agreed that Ministers should take appropriate steps toinform their colleagues of views held by particular sectionsof Government supporters on matters coming forward fordiscussion by the Cabinet or its Committees.Dockers&quot; 9.   The Minister of Labour and National Service gave theStrike. Cabinet the latest information about the dockers&apos; strike.   There was(Previous no definite change to report, but there were indications that the reference: men might now be seeking means by which they could resume work.G.M.(45)46th The Minister indicated the lines on which he was proposing to conclusions, reply to a Private Notice Question that afternoon. While he would minute 3.) continue to stress the determination of the Government to do nothing which would jeopardise the constitutional procedure for resolvingdifferences between employers and workers, he would give an assurance that negotiations under that procedure could be resumedwithin 24 hours after the men had returned to work, and he would say that in this event the Government would keep in close touch withthe proceedings.In discussion, it was suggested that some indication might alsobe given that the negotiations would not be unduly prolonged.Attention was drawn to the need for avoiding a,ny implication that the joint machinery in this industry was cumbrous or slow,or any suggestion that the Government could ensure a rapid solu-tion of the issues outstanding. It would be unwise to under-estimate the difficulty of the questions which had to be negotiated.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that he hadbeen assured by the two sides that, once negotiations had been resumed, they would proceed with all possible speed and he wouldbe kept informed of all developments. It was agreed that it wouldbe helpful if some words to this effect could be included in the state-ment which the Minister was making in Parliament that afternoon.The Cabinet-Took note of the information given by the Minister ofLabour and National Service.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,BOth October, 1945.
