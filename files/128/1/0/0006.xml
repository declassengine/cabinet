The Cabinet now had before themConclusions,    Memoranda  by  the   Secretary  of  State   for   Foreign  AffairsMinute 4.)      (CP. (45) 113)   and   the   President  of   the  Board   of   Trade(CP. (45) 114) reporting the results of a preliminary review whichhad been made by the Man-Power Committee and the Joint war production Staff.   The first of these Memoranda dealt primarily with the release of men and women from the Forces, and contained the draft of a statement to be made on this subject in the courseof the Debate on the Address.  The second dealt with the release oflabour from the munitions industries, and with certain other matters arising from the cuts to be made in munitions production.In discussion of the proposals regarding releases from the armed Forces the following particular points were raised : (a) The Minister of A griculture and Fisheries referred to the acute shortage of labour in agriculture and suggested that early consideration should be given to the possibility of increasing thenumbers of agricultural workers to be released from the Forces in class B.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs hoped that thissuggestion would not be pressed. Any wide extension of Class b releases was likely to cause discontent in the Forces which would endanger the smooth working of the demobilisation scheme. Thereshould be other means of meeting the man-power requirements ofagriculture. He had already stressed, at a recent meeting of theMan-Power Committee, the importance of ensuring that no partof this season&apos;s harvest was lost for lack of labour; and had receivedthe assurance of the Secretary of State for War that the Army were ready to do their utmost to meet all demands for the services of menawaiting demobilisation to help in getting in the harvest. farmers were, however, slow to make application for this assistance, andtended to wait until they were already in difficulties before theyapplied. The Agriculture Ministers should take this matter up with the Farmers&apos; Union, in order to ensure that the farmers took the initiative in giving early notice of their need of help from theArmy.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries undertook to look into this matter, in consultation with the Secretary of State forWar.(&amp;) The Minister of Fuel and Power said that, while he wel-welcomed the recommendations of the Man-Power Committee for theearly release in Class B of all ex-miners still in the Armed Forces,it did not follow that an increase in the labour force of the coal-mining industry would produce a corresponding increase in coal pro -duction. That would depend on the extent to which the men releasedcould be rapidly re-absorbed into productive work at the coal face.He therefore proposed to discuss with the Minister of Labour andthe Service Ministers a procedure for selecting for release men who could most readily be absorbed in productive work.The Minister said that he also attached importance to the orderof priority in which he had put his labour demands to the Man-Power Committee. The early provision of relatively small numbersof skilled men for open-cast coal production was even more impor-tant than an increase in the numbers of underground miners. he also needed further man-power for coal distribution, and for themaintenance and operation of the gas and electricity supply indus-tries. He hoped that every effort would be made to meet the demands which he had put forward.(c) The Minister of Health said that, with the end of active operations in all theatres of war, there should be a drastic changein the attitude of the War Office towards the release of men andwomen urgently needed for the reconstruction of civil life in this
country. He instanced the difficulties which had already been experienced in securing the release of doctors from the Forces. he understood that Mr. Churchill had given specific directions for therelease of substantial numbers of doctors, but the Service Depart-ments had failed to comply with these directions.It was pointed out that the needs of the Services for doctorsfor the war in the Far East had been very substantial; and therehad been a period when the Army medical services in Burma hadbeen seriously under-staffed. Even though military operations hadno longer to be undertaken, the Services would have to maintainlarge medical staffs in the East; and in our Colonial territories which would be evacuated by the Japanese they would have to under-take for some time to come much of the work which would ordinarilybe done by the Colonial medical services. It was, however, thegeneral view of the Cabinet that the Service Departments must berequired to introduce every practicable economy in their medical services. In particular, the Service Ministers should undertake a vigorous scrutiny of medical establishments; and should see thatproper consideration was given to the suggestions which had beenmade for pooling doctors and nurses between the three Services.(d) The Minister of Health also referred to the difficultieswhich the Health Departments had experienced in securing therelease from the Forces of the technical staffs required by localauthorities in connection with the housing programme.The Foreign Secretary said that it had been necessary to holda balance between the needs of the Forces and those of the localauthorities; and it was his experience that the local authorities hadnot always been reasonable in the claims which they put forward.He hoped, however, that with the end of the war with Japan, itwould now be possible to secure the release of larger numbers of thesetechnical staffs.In discussion of the proposals for releases from the munitions industries the following further points were made : &apos;(e) The Foreign Secretary said that at the end of paragraph 1of CP. (45) 113 the estimated release of 1,155,000 from munitionsover the next eight weeks was compared with the existing cut of900,000 up to the end of 1945. The releases contemplated were,however, more substantial than might appear from this comparison;for the 900,000 was a reduction over the whole of the second halfof 1945, and it was estimated that about 250,000 of these had alreadyleft the munitions industries. Thus, the figure of 1,155,000, whichwas a reduction on current strengths, represented an increasedrelease of about 500,000 as compared with earlier plans.(/) The Lord President of the Cotmcil drew attention to para-graph 9 of CP. (45) 114, in which it was stated that the Ministerof Labour did not expect that the estimated releases from the muni-tions industries would result in widespread unemployment. Thereleases contemplated were very large; and it seemed to him thatthe risk of unemployment would have to be carefully watched.The President of the Board of Trade said that this point wouldcertainly be kept in mind by the Ministry of Labour and the supply departments. Wherever possible, cuts would be made in placetswhere the labour released could readily be re-absorbed. It should,however, be noted that the numbers to be released would include a large proportion of people who would not seek further employ-ment in industry.(g) The Lord President of the Council asked whether it was proposed to make any general arrangements for giving some weeks&apos;notice of the termination of contracts. Though this might involve some unnecessary expenditure, it would be preferable to throwinglarge numbers of workers suddenly out of employment, and therebycreating a demand for a general increase in the rate of unemploy-ment benefit.
It was explained that this was a matter which could best be handled by the Supply Departments in relation to particular con-tracts. In areas where the labour displaced could readily bere-absorbed, there was no reason to give long notice of the termina-tion of a contract. In other areas, where alternative employmentwas not readily available, special arrangements would be made toavoid the sudden discharge of large numbers of workers.(h) The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew special attention tothe point raised in paragraph 11 of CP. (45) 114 regarding theneed for clearing factory space noAv used for storage purposes. he hoped that early action would be taken on the lines indicated in that paragraph.Discussion then turned on the terms of the draft statement annexed to CP. (45) 113.Some Ministers thought that this was too discouraging in toneand would not be well received. Would it not be preferable to reverse the order of the statement and to give greater emphasis tothe promise to accelerate the rate of release from the Forces ? other ministers thought it was necessary at this stage to bring it home to the public that, even though active fighting was over, the strengthof the Armed Forces would have to be maintained at a fairly high level for some time to come.The Foreign Secretary said that he was particularly anxious that, until after the first meeting of the new Council of foreign ministers in September, nothing should be said which might create the impression that there was to be a very rapid reduction in thestrength of our Armed Forces.The Prime Minister said that there were three main points tobe borne in mind (i) We must retain sufficient armed strength toenable us to support our Allies in the disturbed conditions whichwere likely to follow the end of the war, and to fulfil our obligations in connection with the occupation of enemy countries, (ii) We mustpreserve a fair and orderly system of reducing the Forces to their&quot; occupational &quot; strength, (iii) We must avoid creating discontentin the Forces, such as had compelled the withdrawal of the firstdemobilisation scheme introduced at the end of the last war. Whatwas needed therefore was a carefullv-balanced statement on the linesof the draft annexed to CP. (45) 113.There was general agreement with the view expressed by thePrime Minister. On the detailed terms of the draft statement, it wasagreed that the concluding words of the fifth paragraph should be altered so as to read &quot; the Government propose that the age upto which men may be called up shall be retained for the present at 30,&quot; the word &quot;may&quot; being substituted for &quot;will&quot; in orderto avoid the implication that all men under 30 would be called upto the Forces.A short discussion followed about the machinery for reviewing the man-power demands of the Departments. It was suggested thatthe Man-Power Committee should hold a meeting at which theMinisters in charge of all Civil Departments claiming additional supplies of man-power could put forward their views. After dis-cussion, it was agreed that in the first instance there should be ameeting of officials which could draw up a report defining the issues which required consideration by Ministers.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals put forward in paragraph 1 of cp. (45) 113 regarding the release of men and women from the Forces;(2) Took note that in his speech that day in the Debate on the address the Prime Minister would make a general state-ment in the terms of the draft annexed to CP. (45) 113,subject to the amendment noted above;
(3) Took note with approval of the arrangements described in cp. (45) 114 for the release of labour from the muni-tions industries and the curtailment of munitions pro-duction;(4) Invited the Man-Power Committee to prepare and submit to the Cabinet early in October a detailed man-powerbudget for the period ending the 30th June, 1946;(5) Instructed the Secretary of the Man-Power Committee toarrange that, in the meantime, the plans for dealing withthe man-power situation should be discussed with senior officials of the interested Departments with a view to thepreparation of a Report defining the issues requiringconsideration by Ministers.economic controls inthe transition period.Supplies and services(transitional powers) Bill.(previous reference:CM. (45) 18thConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Secre-tary of State for the Home Department (CP. (45) 111)&apos; covering adraft of the Supplies and Services (Transitional Powers) Bill.The Home Secretary said that, as the Bill was now drafted, thepowers conferred by it would expire after two years unless theywere then renewed by affirmative resolution of both Houses ofParliament. In his view the period of original duration should beextended to five years. In two years&apos; time from now, it was possiblethat the House of Lords might be unwilling to pass the affirmative resolution required to continue these powers in operation.There was general support for the view expressed by the HomeSecretary. It was pointed out that, apart from the possibility thatthe House of Lords would be unwilling to renew these powers intwo years&apos; time, it was important that the Government should atonce establish the principle that the next five years would be aperiod of transition in which the exercise of emergency powers bythe Executive would be as necessary as it had been in war. It wasalso pointed out that after the last war the period of industrial andeconomic difficulty had not begun until 1921; and it was arguable that, if the Government had then enjoyed sufficient powers of econo-mic control, it Avould have been possible to avoid the industrial crisesof 1921, 1924, and 1926.In further discussion, the Cabinet were informed that it was intended to introduce the Bill immediately before Parliament rosefor the Recess. Earlier introduction would prevent full discussionof these matters during the Debate on the Address. It was hopedthat the Bill would be passed into law soon after parliament reassembled in October. Meanwhile, the purposes to be secured bythe Bill could be met by the use of Regulations under the Emer-gency Powers (Defence) Acts.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Supplies and Services (transitional powers) Bill should provide that the powers to be con-ferred by it should continue in force for an initial periodof five years and should then be renewable from yearto year by affirmative resolution of both Houses ofParliament.(2) Subject to (1) above, approved in principle the draft Billannexed to CP. (45) 111; and took note that the HomeSecretary would submit the draft for detailed examina-tion by the Legislation Committee.

If a public statement were now to be made, they should beinformed in advance that this was contemplated.The Cabinet (1) Approved  the  draft announcement  appended  to CP.(45) 109.(2) Agreed that Dominion Governments should be informed inadvance that this announcement was to be made.Overseas 4.   The Prime Minister said that the Chancellor of theFinancial Exchequer was circulating to the Cabinet a Memorandum on our prospects. overseas financial prospects (CP. (45) 112). The Chancellor of theExchequer, who had consulted him on this matter, felt that his col-leagues generally should be made aware of the position. He wished,however, to remind the Cabinet that the detailed figures set out inthe Memorandum, and also the indications given as to possible linesof approach to the United States Government, should be treatedas matters of the utmost secrecy. There were also one or twostriking phrases in the Memorandum (e.g., in paragraphs 27 and 28)which might have unfortunate consequences, if used outside thecircle of confidential Ministerial discussions.The Cabinet-Took note of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement.Cabinet Office, S.
