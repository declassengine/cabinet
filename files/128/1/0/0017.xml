Television. 1.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the lord president of the Council (CP. (45) 173) to which was annexed thereport of the Television Committee and an extract from the draft report of the Broadcasting Committee giving their views on thereport.It was explained that the views of the Broadcasting Com-mittee had been examined by the Lord President of the Council,in consultation with the Minister of Information, the Postmaster-General and the Minister of State, and that they endorsed these views.The report recommended that television transmission shouldbe restarted as soon as possible on the basis of a system of405-line definition. The Americans had developed a service basedon a 525-line standard but the difference between the two systemswas indistinguishable to the naked eye. A switch over to a systemof higher definition would involve a long delay and it was mostimportant from the point of view of the export trade thattransmission should be restarted at once. The first transmissionwould be from London, but this would be followed by an extension to a number of provincial centres and it might be possible toprovide for a higher standard of definition in the system installedat some of these centres. The Minister responsible for broad-casting policy would also be responsible for television, but theBoard of Trade would be kept in close touch with developments.While the Minister would require the help of some form of advisory committee, it was felt that the recommendation made inparagraph 13 of the report would fetter unduly the freedom of theMinister and that it would be preferable to leave him free to seek advice by whatever means he thought best. The estimatedcost of reopening the London service and of extending televisionto the provinces amounted to between  1 million and  If million a year and capital expenditure would amount to a further 1^ million. It was intended that the owners of television setsshould pay a special fee in addition to their ordinary wirelesslicence fee, but until the number of receiving sets increased greatly,the income from this additional fee would not make a substantial contribution towards the cost of the service, and it was proposedthat the cost of television development should be borne by theB.B.C out of its licence revenue, which would be increased by the raising of the ordinary wireless licence fee from 10s. to  1 at anearly date.In discussion, it was urged that the adoption of the recom-mendation of the report would tend to leave research and develop-ment too much in the hands of private firms and that, in view ofthe success of State organised research in similar fields during thewar, it would be preferable to organise television research moredefinitely under, the control of the State. On the other hand, itwas pointed out that in the past the British commercial interests concerned had led the world in research. Moreover, the recom-mendation of the report was that research should be co-ordinatedunder Government auspices, and it would be open to the responsible minister to arrange for the carrying out of research under Statecontrol to any extent which seemed right to him.Other points in discussion were (a) The Postmaster-General explained that there would inevitably be a delay of about nine months between the release ofthe technicians required for the reopening of the television serviceand the first transmissions. It was accordingly essential that thesetechnicians should be released as soon as possible.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that he saw no difficulty in making arrangements for the release of the persons concerned.
Divorce.(previous reference:W.M. (45) 29thConclusions,Minute 8.)2. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the LordChancellor (CP. (45) 169) seeking approval for the introductionof a Matrimonial Causes (Divorce Commissioners) Bill.The Lord Chancellor said that the number of petitions fordivorce filed annually had risen from under 1,000 before the first world war to a figure of nearly 19,000 in 1944. Moreover, from20,000 to 25,000 Service cases had accumulated in the organisationset up to provide legal aid for the Forces and at any time now thecourts might be called on to deal with these cases. On the otherhand, if experience after the last war could be relied on, there was likely to be a falling off in the number of cases within a year ortwo and the immediate problem was, therefore, to provide some temporary means to meet difficulties due to the accumulation ofcases. One possibility would be to appoint more divorce judges,but for the reasons given in paragraph 7 (i) of CP. (45) 169, he was unwilling to take this course. Another solution would be to conferjurisdiction upon the county courts to try undefended cases. Thiswould have the merit of tending to reduce delay in hearing cases and would also greatly reduce the cost of obtaining a divorce. Onthe other hand, it would give rise to acute differences of opinion and to violent controversy, particularly in the House of Lords. Hehad, therefore, come to the conclusion that the right course was tointroduce a Bill giving power to the President of the Probate,Divorce and Admiralty Division, with his concurrence, to direct that undefended divorce cases should be heard by divorce registrarsselected from among the registrars of the principal ProbateRegistry. Admittedly, this solution did not deal with the problemof the expense of obtaining a divorce, or meet the other criticisms of the present machinery. It had the advantage, however, ofproviding a flexible means of&apos; coping with any additional volumeof work and of being a proposal which had been approved by the late government and would probably be accepted by the Archbishop of canterbury. If the necessary legislation were passed it was proposed that in the first instance two registrars should be selectedto hear undefended cases.In discussion it was urged that the proposal made by the LordChancellor was open to objection, since it would do nothing to remedy the real defects of the present system, namely, the delays andthe expense involved in obtaining a divorce. Moreover, it was doubtful whether the proposed divorce registrars would command asmuch public confidence as county court judges. The point was alsostressed that the introduction of any legislation on the subject ofdivorce at the present time would be bound to arouse controversy inParliament on a matter which did not form an essential part of theGovernments policy, and that the limited legislation proposed in cp. (45) 169 would be criticised, not only by those who took the viewthat divorce should not be rendered easier, but also by those who felt(b) The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Supply, said thatthe suggestion made in paragraph 7 of CP. (45) 178 that capacity in Royal Ordnance factories should be used for the manufacture of television equipment was being examined.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the recommendations of the Television Com -mittee should be accepted, subject to the points to which: the draft report of the Broatlcasting Committee had drawn attention, and authorised the Minister ofInformation to take immediate steps to implement therecommendations.(2) Took note that the Minister of Labour and National Service,in consultation with the Minister of Information, would arrange for the immediate release of the techniciansrequired for the reopening of the television service.
that the radical solution of conferring jurisdiction upon the county courts was the right one. In these circumstances, it might be better to appoint additional divorce judges. Three additional judgescould, if necessary, be appointed without legislation and,should the number of divorce cases to be dealt with fall off after ayear or so, it would be possible to transfer some of the judges nowdealing with divorce cases to other work. At the same timeenquiries might be instituted into the possibility of more radicalreforms designed to reduce the expense and delays involved in theexisting system. The question would in any event arise in connec-tion with the recommendations of the Rushcliffe Report (Cmd. 6641)in so far as they had a bearing on the cost of divorce litigation.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Lord Chancellor should appoint one ormore additional permanent judges to deal with divorcecases as soon as it appeared that the number of existingjudges was likely to be insufficient to deal with thevolume of cases coming forward.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would consider theappointment of a ministerial committee to-review theposition generally, with particular reference to thepossibility of cheapening and expediting the procedure in divorce cases.Parliament. 3.   The Lord Chancellor drew attention to the difficultiesHours of which arose in carrying out the judicial business of the House of meeting of Lords owing to the fact that the House met at 2 p.m. on Tuesdays,the House of Wednesdays and Thursdays.   One solution would be to arrangeLords. that the House should meet at 4 p.m. on these days.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord Chancellor to discuss with the leader of the House of Lords the suggestion that the time of meeting of the House of Lords should be altered.Meetings of 4.   The Prime Minister said that he hoped that it would bethe Cabinet. possible to avoid, a meeting of the Cabinet during the early part ofthe coming week; and that an effort should be made to reduce thenumber of Committee meetings during that week. It would,however, be necessary to have a Cabinet on Friday to consider therecommendations of the Man-Power Committee on the question of accelerating the rats of demobilisation.Sir Gilbert 5.   The Prime Minister said that Sir Gilbert Laithwaite wasLaithwaite. about to take up his new duties as Deputy Under-Secretary of Statefor Burma, and that this would be the last Cabinet meetingattended by him as a member of the Cabinet Secretariat. TheCabinet desired to express their warm appreciation of the services which Sir Gilbert Laithwaite had rendered over the past two years,and especially for the most valuable work which he had done as secretary of the India Committee;&quot;and to convey to him their bestwishes for the new work which he was undertaking.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,20th September, 1945.
