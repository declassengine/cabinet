1. The Minister of Food informed the Cabinet that he-proposed to announce at his Press Conference later in the day thatthe cuts in the fat and cheese rations which had been made in Maywould be restored and that increased supplies of wines and spiritswould be imported in the remainder of 1945 and in 1946. He had alsoreached the conclusion, after examining the stock position, that itwould be possible to give the public a bonus in the form of extrasupplies of rationed foods during Christmas week, and he wouldlike to announce this as soon as the difficulties due to the dockers&apos;strike were over. If extra rations were to be made available, itwould be necessary to start moving additional supplies into thehands of retailers at an early date, and there was a danger that information about the Government&apos;s proposals would leak out beforethe official announcement, should the announcement be delayed too long.In discussion, it was urged that, while there was no objectionto the restoration of the cuts made earlier in the year in the fatand cheese rations, the proposal to announce a bonus in the shape of additional food at Christmas required further consideration.Any such announcement would be criticised by many sections ofopinion in this country on the ground that any spare supplies offood ought to be used for the relief of Europe, and it might well have an adverse effect on opinion in the United States, whether itwas made before or after the conclusion of the present Lend-Leasenegotiations in Washington. It was also pointed out that coalminers were dissatisfied with their present scale of rations andmight be aggrieved. if any spare supplies were distributed in theform of a bonus to the general population.On the other hand, it was argued that the amount of foodrequired to give increased rations at Christmas would have no appreciable effect on the position in Europe and that it could fairly be represented that the increases given during the Christmas weekwere designed to take account of the fact that far more people would be at home for meals during that period and were thus, ineffect, a reallocation of the total supplies between canteens and restaurants and the domestic consumer. The solution of the problemof the miners lay in the increased use of canteens, since it wouldbe impossible to give increased rations to individual miners without giving rise to claims for similar concessions from other classes ofworkers which would wreck the rationing scheme.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, that the Minister of Foodproposed to announce later in the day the restoration ofthe cuts in the fat and cheese rations made earlier in theyear and an increase in the import of wines and spirits.(2) Authorised the Minister of Food to announce on Tuesday,the 13th November, that additional supplies of food would be made available to domestic consumers duringthe Christmas week, on the understanding that theannouncement would be made in such a way as toindicate that the grant of the additional suppliesconstituted a readjustment of distribution as betweenthe domestic consumer and canteens and restaurants, inorder to take account of the fact that more meals wouldbe taken at home during the Christmas period.
Dockers&apos;Strike.(previous reference:CM. (45)41stConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Minister of Labour and National Service informed theCabinet that there was evidence pointing to an improvement in thestrike situation and that there was a probability that the majorityof the men would return to work in the course of this week.The Cabinet &apos;Took note, with approval, of the statement made by theMinister of Labour and National Service.Political 3.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of the broadcasting. Cabinet (CP. (45) 214) to which was annexed a minute by theLord Privy Seal reporting the results of discussions with the B.B.C.on the question of political broadcasting.It was explained that in the discussions with the B.B.C. theLord Privy Seal had been accompanied by the Minister of Informa-tion and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury. Amemorandum, representing the views of the Lord Privy Seal andhis colleagues, had been given to the B.B.C. and the B.B.C. hadthereafter handed to the Lord Privy Seal a memorandum repre-senting their views. The two documents, copies of which wereannexed to CP. (45) 214, had been broadly agreed, and, subject tothe views of the Cabinet, it was now proposed that the opposition leaders should be approached with a view to reaching agreementwith them on the proposals.Discussion concentrated primarily on the extent to which ministers should be free to broadcast to the public on questions ofnational importance without any rejoinder by an Opposition broad-cast. It was pointed out that paragraph 3 of the memorandum bythe B.B.C. left it to the B.B.C. itself to decide whether a broadcastgiven by a person of Ministerial rank was on a controversial subject and should therefore be answered by a broadcast expressingdiffering views. There would be a natural tendency by the B.B.C.,in any case of doubt, to take the view that the subject wascontroversial, and the result might be that Ministers would be precluded from using the medium of the B.B.C. on occasions when this was clearly the best way of giving information and guidance to the public on matters of national importance. Thus the B.B.C.had already raised difficulties about a proposal that the Presidentof the Board of Trade should broadcast about the export drive.Another good instance was the recent broadcast by the Minister ofLabour and National Service on demobilisation. It had been clearlynecessary for this broadcast to have the authority of a Minister.But if the B.B.C. had oared to put a strict interpretation on paragraph 3 of their memorandum they might have argued thatthe broadcast ought to have been answered by an Oppositionspeaker.Particular difficulties arose over broadcasts concerned withforeign affairs and there might well be situations in which it would gravely damage the interests of this country if a broadcast state-ment of the policy of the Government were to be followed by otherbroadcasts given by speakers expressing views at variance withthose of the Government.It was also pointed out that paragraph 5 of the memorandumby the B.B.C., which stated that when debates on major matters ofpublic policy were imminent or taking place in Parliament, broad-casts of Ministerial statements would not be allowed until thelegislation had had its third reading in the House of Commons orthe business had been completed, required amendment, since, ifstrictly interpreted, it would preclude a broadcast by the Chancellorof the Exchequer immediately after his Budget statement.On the other hand, it was urged that the Government mightbe open to very serious criticism if it gave the impression that itsought to impose undue restrictions on the use of the facilities of
the B.B.C. by the Opposition, more especially seeing that the line 1 U ibetween objective statements made by Ministers primarily for theinformation of the public and controversial broadcasts would not always be easy to draw. The general conclusion was thereforereached that reliance must be placed primarily on the good sense of the B.B.C. and their willingness to adopt a reasonable attitudetowards the Government of the day; and for this purpose it was important that very careful consideration should be given toappointments to the Board of Governors.Other points in discussion were : -(a) The Minister of Information said that the B.B.C. had now asked that the following sentence should be added to their memorandum :&apos; 1&apos;&apos; Nothing in this Agreement is to be taken as overridingany of the provisions of the B.B.C. Charter and Licence.&quot;There appeared to be no objection to accepting this suggestion.(b) The Prime Minister said that he had agreed to certaindrafting amendments in the memorandum drawn up by the lord privy Seal, which had been suggested by the Lord President of theCouncil. In particular, it would be made clear in paragraph 8 (/)that any rejoinder on behalf of the Government should normally be made by a Minister, and the last sentence in paragraph 8 (g)would be amended to indicate plainly that what was excluded wasa series of broadcasts immediately prior to the series arising outof the General Election itself.(c) The Minister of Information explained that the B.B.C.had represented that a decision should be reached urgently withregard to the arrangements for broadcasts after the Budget. Theyhad suggested that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should broad-cast after the nine o&apos;clock news on the 23rd October and that a conservative Opposition speaker should broadcast on the following day. If the Government so desired, the B.B.C. would be willing that the Financial Secretary to the Treasury should make a shortrejoinder on behalf of the Government on the 25th October.(d) It was suggested that in any further discussions betweenthe Lord Privy Seal and the B.B.C. he should take up the questionof their refusal to allow Mr. Donovan to broadcast to the public in this country in connection with the dockers&apos; strike.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Lord Privy Seal, in consultation with the LordChancellor, to reconsider the terms of the memorandumby the B.B.C. annexed to CP. (45) 214 in the light ofthe discussion and to discuss any necessary amendmentswith representatives of the B.B.C. before approaching the Opposition Leaders.(2) Authorised the Minister of Information to inform theB.B.C. that arrangements should proceed in regard tobroadcasts about the forthcoming Budget on the lines proposed, namely, the Chancellor of the exchequer would broadcast on the 23rd October, a conservative opposition speaker on the 24th October, and theFinancial Secretary to the Treasury on the 25th October.Electricity 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theand Gas Minister of Fuel and Power (CP. (45) 217) on the future of theIndustries.      electricity and gas industries.The Minister of Fuel and Power recalled that the programme on which the general election had been fought provided for the nationalisation of the electricity and gas industries as well as the
coal industry. A definite announcement of the Government&apos;s inten-tions was urgently required if developments in these industries werenot to be held up. Moreover, in the absence of a declared policy bythe Government difficulties would arise when local authoritiesdesired to exercise their statutory rights to buy out electricitycompany undertakings. He accordingly suggested that he shouldbe authorised to make a brief statement to the effect that theGovernment proposed, during the present Session, to put forwardplans for the reorganisation of the gas and electricity industries in the form of White Papers. He also desired to put in hand the drafting of the necessary legislation, although he assumed it wouldnot be possible to deal with the electricity industry under the1946-47 Session and the gas industry until the 1947-48 Session.In discussion there was general agreement that a statementof the Governments intentions with regard to the electricity and gas industries should be made with the least possible delay. Itwas felt, however, that it would be a mistake to promise to publish the proposals of the Government in the form of White Papers, since this would lead to demands for debates in Parliament on theproposals before legislation was introduced, this occupying valuableParliamentary time.The Lord President of the Council said that the general problems connected with the nationalisation of the electricity and gas industries arose also in the case of other industries, e.g., road and rail transport. It was therefore desirable that the proposed statement by the Minister of Fuel and Power should be examined with a view to ensuring that the Government were following a consistent policy in their treatment of industries due to be nationalised. It was of particular importance that, before any statement was made, a solution should have been found for theproblem of ensuring that any necessary development of industries which were to be nationalised took place in the period betweenthe announcement and the date when the Government&apos;s proposalsfor nationalisation could be brought into force.So far as the preparation of legislation was concerned, it waspointed out that the programme for the current Session was already imposing a heavy burden on the Office of parliamentary counsel and that it was impossible to give any guarantee thatpreparation of legislation for the 1946-47 to 1947-48 Sessionscould be put in hand in the immediate future.The Cabinet *(1) Agreed in.principle that a statement of the governments intentions with regard to the nationalisation of theelectricity and gas industries should be made with theleast possible delay, on the understanding that no promise would be given to publish the Government&apos;sproposals in the form of White Papers.(2) Invited the Lord President of the Council, in consultationwith the Minister of Fuel and Power and the other ministers concerned with the nationalisation ofparticular industries, to arrange for further considera-tions to be given, in the light of the discussion, to theform and timing of the proposed statement.Old-Age 5.   The Lord President of the Council drew attention to thePensions. Motion which had been put down by a number of government supporters calling upon the Government to take action to raise the weekly income of old-age pensioners forthwith by 7s. Qd. a week for single persons and 12s. Qd. a week for married couples. It was essential that the Government should indicate their attitude to this motion at a very early date and he suggested that the right course was to make it clear that the Government could not accept the motion.
The Minister of National Insurance explained that the policy -which he had announced in the House of Commons on the -11th October with regard to old-age pension increases (viz., thatany increase in rates should await the passage of the main national insurance Bill) had been approved by the Social Services Com-mittee. An increase in the rate of old-age pensions would in itselfbenefit only a small fraction of those in receipt of supplementary pensions, and to provide for the increases of 7s. Qd. and 12s. Qd.in the weekly income available to old-age pensioners called for bythe Motion would entail not only legislation increasing the basic rate of pension and amending the law with regard to the means testfor non-contributory pensions, but also new regulations with regardto the scale on which supplementary pensions were paid whichwould have to be approved by an affirmative resolution of bothHouses of Parliament. Moreover, any scheme for the immediate increase of old-age pensions would accentuate the administrative difficulties with which the Ministry of National Insurance were already faced and to that extent delay the introduction of the comprehensive scheme. He was, therefore, in full agreement withthe Lord President of the Council.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Motion calling on the Government toincrease the income of old-age pensioners could not beaccepted and endorsed the policy announced by theMinister of National Insurance in the House of commons on the 11th October.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,16th October, 1945.
