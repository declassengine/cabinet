Review of 1.   The Prime Minister said that it had been the practice in military the past for the Chiefs of Staff to give a weekly review of military,Situation. naval and air operations. As the scale of operations had so greatly(Previous diminished, he proposed that these reports to the Cabinet should reference: now be made at longer intervals. There would, however, be aCM. (45) 13th Defence Committee of the Cabinet, which would meet with theConclusions, Chiefs of Staff and keep in close touch with the progress of minute l.)      operations.Military. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the cabinet of the present strength and disposition of land forces in the varioustheatres and of the present position of operations against Japan.The principal tasks of our armies of occupation in Germanyand Austria were : &apos;(a) The handling of prisoners of war. In Germany we had held1,894,000 prisoners on VE-day; and we had nowdisposed of 694,000 of these. We had still to handleabout 1 - 2 million; and in addition there were about175,000 to be brought into Germany from Norway.(&amp;) The disposal of displaced persons. Of 2,233,694 onVE-day, mainly Russians and Poles, about 1,000,000had now been repatriated.(c) The restoration of communications and the provision of accommodation for use in the coming winter. On both these tasks German labour was being used under allied supervision.When these initial tasks had been completed, our eventualcommitments would be the guarding of the frontiers and theprovision of mobile reserves to deal with any outbreak of disorder.All possible steps were being taken to reduce effective strengthsas quickly as the situation permitted. Our land forces in 21 ArmyGroup on VE-day had been 1,041,000 : they had been reducedalready to 797,800, and we were aiming at reaching a Stage IIlevel of 251,000 by May 1946. In areas where the situation was still uncertain, e.g., in Istria, substantial forces must be retained for the time being on an operational, not an occupational, basis.In South-East Asia formations had been reduced in strengthas a result of the reduction of the period of service. This wouldbe compensated in due course by the return of Indian divisions from Italy, and eventually from Greece.In Greece we had two British divisions and we hoped to haveequipped and trained a Greek Army of three divisions byFebruary 1946. Apart from the need to maintain internal law andorder, there was the threat of frontier disturbances; and it wasto be noted that there were very substantial forces to the west and north of the Greek frontiers in Albania, Yugoslavia and Bulgaria.In discussion, questions were raised about the methods by whichthe Greek Army was being recruited. The Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff said that, while this was a matter for the GreekGovernment, he understood that men were being called up in age-groups and that there was no discrimination apart from the exclusion of certain individuals who were considered to be undesirable. It was suggested that the men who were being called up in the new age-groups were not regarded as eligible forcommissions.Questions were also raised about the provision of equipment for the Police Mission to Greece. It had been stated that there wasdifficulty in obtaining adequate motor transport for this Mission.The Home Secretary undertook to provide the Prime Minister witha report on this point.Air. The Chief of the Air Staff said that the R.A.F. had to fulfilcommitments all over the world and at the same time to reduce ;tsstrength to the approved Stage II level. One of its major difficultieswas the transfer of resources from operations to transportation,in the face of an acute shortage of transport aircraft, of whichit had not been possible to obtain from the United States the fulldemand which we had made.[30622-4]b 2
In the F t, which was now the only theatre of active operations, the monsoon was still restricting air operations. air transport of stores in this theatre, which at its peak had reached2,000 tons a day, was now averaging- only about 20,000 tons amonth. In addition, about 10,000 men per month were beingcarried. Operations in tactical support of the Army had been specially successful. Strategic bombing had been concentratedmainly on railways, ports and the Japanese base at Singora.In the Pacific our strength in first-line aircraft would be only about 8 per cent, of the total Anglo-American strength; and weshould not therefore be in a position to claim effectively to influencedecisions as regards operations. The Australian and New Zealandair forces had not so far had the opportunity they deserved ofshowing what they could do, but proposals had now been made which would give them a better opportunity and, if these were accepted, the Air Ministry would do its best to secure propercredit and publicity for their work.United States operations in the Pacific were on a veryconsiderable scale. In the last month 17,000 sorties had been flownfor the loss of only 80 aircraft. Super-Fortresses operating against japan had lost, in the last month but one, only 19 in 4,000 sorties,and in the last month only 9 out of 5,000 sorties. The Japanesenominal strength of first-line aircraft of all types was 4,500, butit seemed clear from these figures that they were not trying todispute the United States attack in the air. Super-Fortresses had dropped 34,000 tons of bombs on Japan in the last month, whichwas an increase of 8,000 on the previous month, and compared with67,000 tons dropped on Germany in March 1945 by bomber command.Naval. The Vice Chief of Naval Staff explained the dispositions ofHis Majesty&apos;s ships in the various naval commands. On present plans 62 per cent, of the Royal Navy would be employed in the warin the Far East. This did not include Dominion naval forces.During the last six months the Japanese Fleet had been almost wholly destroyed, and the naval war in the East was now verylargely a struggle between Allied sea-borne air power and Japaneseshore-based air power. The most difficult problem was logistic, theFleet having to be maintained for long periods in an operationalarea some 4,000 miles from its main base, necessitating the employ -ment of a large Fleet Train. Since the 10th July the combinedFleets had sunk 8 Japanese warships, including 1 battleship,and damaged 28, including 3 battleships and 7 carriers; sunk165,000 tons and damaged 195,000 tons of merchant shipping;destroyed 519 aircraft and damaged 684; and inflicted severe damage on port installations, armament works, &amp;c. Our losses were 1 United States destroyer and 191 aircraft, of which 64 were british.The present total of the Japanese mercantile marine was estimated at about 1,000,000 tons, which was practically all lyingin Japanese waters. About 500,000 tons had been lost in the last three months.Much progress had been made with minesweeping operations in all theatres. In home waters, there were employed on mine-sweeping about 15 Fleet minesweepers, over 200 smaller vessels,450 German minesweepers, 63 Allied vessels and 100 vessels atContinental ports. 5,100 mines had been swept since VE-Day,particular attention being given to the fishingAs regards U-boats the following figures had become available from German sources : 1Under Allied control ... ... ... 156Scuttled or dismantled ... ... ... 221Sunk during the war ...&quot; .... ... 782Not yet accounted for ... ... ... 8In Japanese hands ... ... ... 7Total1,174
Germany. 2.   In connection with the discussion recorded in the precedingOccupied Minute, the suggestion was made that there would be advantage in areas. arranging for Members of Parliament to visit the British zone ofoccupation in Germany, so that they might see the conditions withwhich our armies of occupation had to contend. This might leadto a wider realisation of the need for maintaining large numbersof troops in Germany.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, in his view, it was even more important that Ministers in charge of departments such as the Ministries of Education, Health andLabour should visit Germany and discuss on the spot with british members of the Control Council what assistance could be given toour forces in carrying out their tasks. The great need at themoment was for a relatively small number of technical experts andadministrators. Experienced Borough Engineers and medical officers of Health, and persons experienced in the administrativeside of education, would be able to give invaluable help.The Prime Minister endorsed the view expressed by theForeign Secretary and undertook to refer it to the Standing Com-mittee of the Cabinet which he was proposing to set up to considerthe problems of occupied Europe.ForeignAffairs.3. The Cabinet had before them a Note by the Secretary(CP. (45) 95) covering the agreed English text of the Protocol ofthe proceedings of the Berlin Conference.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs summarised themain conclusions reached by the Conference, and explained theattitude Avhich the United States and Soviet Delegations had taken up towards some of the principal problems which had been discussed.In discussion the following points were raised : -(a) As regards the transfer of populations there was some ground for thinking that the Czechoslovak Governmenthad behaved with great inhumanity. It was pointedout on the other hand that, according to the Russians,this was not the result of a settled Government policy but of the bitterness of feeling among the Czechoslovakpeople. Given the history of tbe last seven years, itwas very difficult to keep such feeling within bounds.(&amp;) We should be at great pains to ensure that reparationshipping was not brought here to the detriment of ourshipbuilding industry and of our mercantile marine.The Prime Minister said that this point had beenfully considered at an earlier stage and steps would betaken to safeguard it.These figures tallied fairly closely with the estimates previouslymade by the Admiralty of the total U-boat strength and the numberssunk during the war.The Minister of Health asked whether it was proposed thatthe Cabinet should review the man-power demands of the three services in the light of the latest appreciation of the probableduration of the Japanese war.The Prime Minister said that in the first instance the DefenceCommittee must, with the Chiefs of Staff, review the strategic position as a whole. If, as a result of their review, changes weremade in the strategic assumptions on which the man-power require-ments of the Services had been calculated, a fresh survey of theman-power position would be undertaken.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Chiefs of Staff.
(c) The Lord Chancellor said that he was uneasy about thearrangements for the trial of war criminals. Theprocedure proposed was liable to involve great delay.It was most important that we should dispose of thesetrials as expeditiously as possible. The Prime minister agreed. We must impress on those concerned theimportance of avoiding long-drawn-out trials.(d) The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he understoodthat, in connection with the discussions on the Repara-tions Commission at Moscow, a proposal had been made that over a period of eight years 50 million tons ofGerman coal should be made available for export. Hewas disturbed at the implications of this proposal; andwould take an early opportunity of bringing the matter to the notice of the Cabinet.The Prime Minister said that he had been present throughoutthe discussions, at the Berlin Conference. Very little had beenbrought to a conclusion before he and the Foreign Secretary had returned to Berlin after Mr. Churchill&apos;s resignation. The foreign secretary&apos;s success in picking up the threads, and handling soskilfully the discussion of this wide range of complicated problemswas a remarkable achievement, for which the Cabinet owed him agreat debt of gratitude. He thought that on the whole we couldbe very well satisfied with the results that had been secured.The Lord President of the Council said that he would liketo express to the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary thegratitude and admiration of the Cabinet for the skill with whichthey had handled the discussions at the Berlin Conference and forthe results which they had secured.The Cabinet-Warmly endorsed the views expressed bjy the lord president of the Council.Tangier. 4.   At their meeting on the 23rd April, the War Cabinet had(Previous       agreed that discussions should be opened with the United states reference:      Government, and thereafter with the French Government, with aW.M. (45) 49th view to arranging for an international conference to determineConclusions,     the future administration of Tangier as an international zone.Minute 6 and   Arrangements had  then been  made  for  informal  discussionsCM. (45) 13th  between representatives of the three Governments to be held in conclusions,    Paris in July; but the Soviet Government, on being informed of minute 4.)      these arrangements, had asked that the discussions should be postponed in order that Soviet representatives might take part in them.   At the Berlin Conference it had been agreed that repre-sentatives of the Soviet Government should participate in these discussions; and arrangements had now been made for representa-tives of the four Governments to hold preliminary discussions inParis in the near future.The Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP. (45) 93) to whichwere annexed draft instructions for the British Delegation. Thememorandum drew special attention to two points (a) theimportance of ensuring that the Spanish administration and armed forces would be withdrawn peacefully from Tangier, so that noresort to force would be necessary; and (b) the importance ofsecuring that the Spanish Government were invited to take partin the full-scale international conference on the future administra-tion of the Tangier Zone, which would follow the preliminary discussions now to be held in Paris.In discussion, there was general agreement about the importanceof avoiding a situation in which the existing Spanish administra-tion of Tangier would have to be terminated by resort to force.
Parliament. 5.   The Cabinet had before them a Note by the Lord PresidentKing&apos;s Speech of the Council (CP. (45) 94) covering a draft of The King&apos;s speech on the Opening on the Opening of Parliament prepared by a Committee of ministers of Parliament, under his chairmanship.The Lord President of the Council said that in preparing the draft the Committee had taken into account the suggestions made by Departments for legislation during the 1945-46 session and had sought to restrict the amount of legislation promised inthe Speech to what could be achieved within the Session. It shouldbe realised, however, that the Bills mentioned in paragraph 2 of cp, (45) 94, together with other essential business, would makevery heavy demands on the available Parliamentary time. For thisreason as much use as possible should be made of delegated legislation, within proper limitations, and early steps should alsobe taken to consider what might be done to expedite parliamentary procedure. A report on this last question had been drawn up bythe War Cabinet Committee appointed by the Coalition Govern-ment to review the Machinery of Government; and he hoped to bring before the Cabinet shortly proposals based on that Report.With regard to the Bills specifically mentioned in paragraph 2of CP. (45) 94, he drew attention to the importance of proceeding as rapidly as possible with the legislation for the nationalisation of the coalmining industry and the Bank of England. The scopeof the Supplies and Services (Transitional Powers) Bill might have in this connection, the Secretary of State for Air said that inpresent circumstances we should find it difficult to provide air forces to support military operations in this area.On the second point, the Foreign Secretary said that therewere important Spanish interests in the Tangier Zone, and theSpanish community was by far the largest white community there.Spain&apos;s interest in the future of the Zone could not, therefore, be ignored; and the Spanish Government had a right to be invitedto participate in the formal conference about the future administra-tion of the Zone. He thought, therefore, that, whatever theattitude of the Soviet Delegation on this point, the british delegation should maintain at the outset that the Spanish Govern-ment should be invited to take part in the formal conference.It was pointed out that if, as was likely, the Soviet Delegationtook the line that the Spanish Government should not take piart inthe formal conference, there was a risk that we should appear tobe supporting the Franco Government as against the Soviet Govern-ment. If, as a result, the Soviet Government dissociated themselves from the further discussions about Tangier, this would have an unfortunate effect on public opinion both in this country and abroad.The Foreign Secretary said that, if on this point our Delegationtook the line recommended in his memorandum, they were likelyto have the support of both the French and the United StatesDelegations. All he was asking for at this stage was authority forthe British Delegation to take this line at the outset. He would, ofcourse, keep in touch with the progress of the conversations, andwould refer again to the Cabinet if it seemed likely that adherence to this line would lead the Russians to dissociate themselves fromthe preliminary discussions or to decline to participate in the formalinternational conference.  On this understanding The Cabinet-Approved the draft annexed to OP.  (45) 93 of theinstructions to be given to the British Delegation to theforthcoming   discussions   in   Paris   about   the   future administration of Tangier as an international zone.
to be widened, and&quot; it was for consideration whether it should not provide for a duration of five years. (The Bill presented toParliament in the previous Session had proposed a duration oftwo years with a power to extend for further periods by Ordersubject to an affirmative resolution.) It had been ascertained thatthe Trade Union Congress favoured the complete repeal of theTrade Disputes and Trade Unions Act, 1927.In discussion the following suggestions were made with regardto the draft Speech : (a) Paragraph 1 should state in a more vigorous fashion theintention of the Government to promote peace and social justice in concert with all other peace-lovingGovernments.(b) The Speech should include a reference to the governments intention to work in close consultation with the Govern-ments of the Dominions.(c) Paragraph 5 should be redrafted to take account of thedecision that a British land force should take part inthe invasion of Japan, and also of the part played by theEast Indies Fleet in the Burma campaign.(d) In paragraph 11 the reference to the proposal to bring the coalmining industry under public ownership should beso worded as to indicate that it was part of a plan forthe general co-ordination of the fuel and powerindustries.(e) There should be substituted for the reference in pari-graph 11 to a National Investment Board a referenceto machinery for more effective planning of investment in the interests of employment policy and nationaldevelopment.(/) In paragraph 13 there should be an indication that theGovernment intended to deal with the housing shortage in country areas as well as in towns.(g) The last sentence of paragraph 13 should be examined inorder to ensure that it did not rule out legislation tofacilitate the acquisition of land for public purposes and to enable land to be requisitioned, if necessary, for housing.(h) Paragraph 17 should be amended so as to avoid committing the Government to carrying out the plans announced inthe White Paper on British Air Transport (Cmd. 6605).(i) Paragraph 19 should be amended so as to bring it out that india must make her contribution towards the task of achieving self-government. The reference to the colonies should also be separate from the reference to India.. The following points arose in discussion on the legislative programme for the 1945-46 Session : (j) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, since it wouldbe possible to deal with exchange control in the proposed legislation for the more effective planning of investment,it would be unnecessary to widen the scope of theSupplies and Services (Transitional Powers) Bill to coverthis matter.(k) There was general agreement that it would be desirableto repeal the whole of the Trade Disputes and TradeUnions Act, 1927, and that the necessary Bill shouldbe limited to this purpose. If the repeal of the Act of1927 left the position unsatisfactory, a further Bill couldbe introduced.(I) It was desirable that a Local Elections (Service Abroad)Bill, an Electoral Registration Bill and an IndianFranchise Bill should be passed at a very early date inthe Session. There was reason to think that the Opposi-tion would raise no objection to the rapid passage ofthese Bills.
6. The Chief Whip said that he had had discussions with theOpposition with regard to the hours of sitting and the arrange-ments for the Debate on the Address.Since there was no likelihood of any improvement in London&apos;stransport services before the Christmas Recess, it was proposedto continue the arrangements in force at the end of the past Session,under which the House met at 2-15 p.m.There would be a general Debate on the Address on the 16thand 17th August, and it had been suggested that the 20th Augustshould be set aside for a Debate on the Berlin Conference. the debate on the Address would be brought to a close on the21st August, and it was suggested that there should be a separateDebate on the United Nations Charter on the 22nd and 23rd August.The House would rise on the 24th August and would reassemble onthe 9th October.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that theHouse of Lords would desire to debate the United Nations Charteron the same day as the House of Commons. It had also beensuggested that there should be a Debate in the House of Lords onthe Berlin Conference, separate from the Debate on the Address.It was pointed out in discussion that, if the Prime Ministertook part in the general Debate on the Address on the 16th or17th August, it would be impossible for him to speak on the20th August, except with the leave of the House. In these circum-stances it might be preferable to arrange the business in such away as to finish the Debate on the Address on the 20th August andto have a separate Debate on the Berlin Conference on the21st August.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statements made by the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs and the Chief Whip.(2) Invited the Chief Whip to explore the possibility of bringing the Debate on the Address in the House ofCommons to a close on the 20th August and having aseparate Debate on the Berlin Conference on the21st August.Parliament.Hours of sitting andDebate on the address.Cotton 7.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Presi-Industry.        dent of the Board of Trade (CP. (45) 92) to which was annexed a proposed statement of Government policy with regard to the cottonindustry.The President of the Board of Trade said that immediate stepsmust be taken to re-establish the cotton industry on sound lines.With this in view discussions with representatives of the industry on proposals designed to improve the spinning section of theindustry had been initiated by the present Chancellor of theExchequer when President of the Board of Trade and continued by his successor under the late Government, and there seemed good[30622-4] c(m) The Minister of Health pointed out that it might benecessary to pass a Housing (Rural Workers) (Amend-ment) Bill at an early date in order to continue the powerto make grants for the reconditioning of rural houses.The Cabinet Invited the Committee of Ministers which had prepare the draft Speech annexed to CP. (45) 94 to submit,for consideration at a meeting of the Cabinet on the9th August, a further draft of the Speech revised in thelight of the points raised in discussion.
reason to hope that both sides of the industry would within the nextfew days agree (i) that a statement should be made by the employersabout their willingness to improve wages and conditions in theindustry; (ii) that a joint commission should be set up to work out a simplified and modernised wage structure; and (iii) that certainpromising experiments which were being tried out at Wye Mill and elsewhere should be encouraged. To these short-term proposals itwould be necessary to add certain others of a more long-termcharacter which were set out in paragraph 10 of CP. (45) 92. this programme ought to be put to the industry at once and to be coupled with a clear statement of the Governments general attitude to theindustry. He accordingly proposed that he should visit Manchesteron the 11th and 12th August in order to reach a settlement withthe spinning section of the industry and thereafter to put his general programme to a delegate conference of both sides of thewhole industry, including the merchants, and to the operatives inone or two of the principal Lancashire towns.Discussion centred on paragraph 3 of the annex to CP. (45) 92,in which it was stated that it was not part of the Labour Govern-ment&apos;s programme to nationalise the cotton industry during thepresent Parliament. In favour of retaining this statement, it was urged that it would be prejudicial to the industry to allow the threat of nationalisation to hang over it for a long period and thatthe operatives themselves had indicated that they would welcome a clear statement of the Governments intention in this matter. Onthe other hand, it was pointed out that, in view of the grave stateinto which the spinning section of the industry had fallen and theextent to which inefficiency in this section affected not only other sections of the cotton industry but also other industries, it would be unwise to give any pledge which would prevent the government from intervening should the spinning section fail to set its ownhouse in order. In these &quot;circumstances it might be preferable to redraft the proposed statement of Government policy in such a way as to indicate that, in view of the large number of workers both inthe cotton industry itself and in other industries who were depen-dent on the spinning section, the Government must reserve the rightto take any steps necessary to ensure that this section of the industryadequately met the needs of the cotton industry itself and of those other industries which were dependent on it. The Government didnot, however, propose to make any change in the ownership of thissection of the industry unless, after having been given a reasonableopportunity to reorganise itself, it still failed to reach the necessarystandard of efficiency.Other points in discussion were : &apos;(a) The President of the Board of Trade undertook to confirm that his programme would not rule out the proposals put before theReconstruction Committee by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,when President of the Board of Trade, for the establishment of a statutory Spinning Board and the centralisation of the purchase ofraw cotton and the sale of yarn (R. (44) 61st Meeting).(b) The Foreign Secretary urged that the Chairman of the pro-posed commission to work out a revised wage structure for theindustry should be appointed by the Minister of Labour and national Service rather than by the President of the Board ofTrade. The President of the Board of Trade said that he was prepared to accept this change.The Cabinet (1) Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in consulta-tion with the Foreign Secretary, to revise the proposed statement of Government policy annexed to CP. (45) 92on the lines indicated at &quot; X &quot; above.(2) Subject to (1), gave general approval to the proposals in.CP. (45) 92.
Procedure: 9.   The Prime Minister said that it was desirable that regularFuture times should be fixed for meetings of the Cabinet.   It would be con-Meetings, venient if the regular meetings could be held in the morning. Forthe present, it would probably be necessary to arrange for tworegular meetings each week. He would consider which would be themost convenient days. When these times had been fixed, regulartimes could be determined for meetings of the main standing committees of the Cabinet.The next meeting of the Cabinet would be held on Thursday, the9th August, at 11 a.m.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,7th August, 1945.Standing g.   The Prime Minister outlined the arrangements which heCommittees of had in mind for the constitution of the principal Standing Com-the Cabinet.    mittees of the Cabinet. He said that he would discuss these arrange-ments with some of his colleagues, and would then circulate a memo-randum to the Cabinet setting out his proposals in detail.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he intended to hold regular meetings with the Secretaries of State forDominion Affairs, the Colonies, and India and Burma, so as tosecure full co-ordination of foreign and imperial policy. He also proposed to hold regular meetings with the Chancellor of theExchequer and the President of the Board of Trade to secure full co-ordination of overseas economic policy and foreign policy. he did not think, however, that for either of these purposes a formalCabinet Committee need be constituted : these consultations could best be held through informal, though regular, meetings with hiscolleagues.   The Prime Minister agreed.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would circulate amemorandum setting out the composition and terms ofreference of the principal Standing Committees of theCabinet.
