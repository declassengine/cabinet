Japan.Offer of surrender.1.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, \%according to an announcement broadcast from Japan by the DomeiAgency, the Japanese Government had that day addressed thefollowing communication to the Governments of Switzerland and sweden for transmission to the Governments of the UnitedKingdom, the United States and the U.S.S.R. : &quot; In obedience to the gracious command of His majesty the Emperor who, ever anxious to enhance the cause of world peace, desires earnestly to bring about an early termination ofhostilities with a view to saving mankind from the calamitiesto be imposed upon them by further continuation of the war,the Japanese Government asked several weeks ago the SovietGovernment, with which neutral relations then prevailed, torender its good offices in restoring peace vis-a-vis the enemyPowers.&quot; These efforts in the interest of peace unfortunatelyhaving failed, the Japanese Government in conformity withthe august wish of His Majesty to restore the general peace,and desiring to put an end to the untold sufferings entailed by war as quickly as possible, have decided upon the following.&quot; The Japanese Government are ready to accept theterms enumerated in the joint declaration which was issued atPotsdam on the 26th July, 1945, by the Heads of the Govern-ments of the United States, Great Britain and China, and later subscribed to by the Soviet Government, with the under-standing that the said declaration does not comprise any demand which prejudices the prerogatives of His Majesty asa sovereign ruler. The Japanese Government hope sincerelythat this understanding is warranted, and desire keenly thatan explicit indication to that effect will be speedily forth-coming. &apos;&apos;No official communication to this effect had yet been receivedfrom the Governments of Switzerland or Sweden; and no official information had yet reached the Poreign Office apart from thestatement issued by the Domei Agency. There was, however, everyindication that this was, in fact, an official communication fromthe Japanese GovernmentThe Foreign Secretary said that difficulty might arise over thestipulation which the Japanese Government were seeking tomake regarding the position of the Emperor. The wording of the communication on this point was somewhat ambiguous and wouldprobably need clarification. It was possible, however, that, inview of this stipulation, the United States Government might regard the communication as falling short of unconditional surrender. He was taking steps to ascertain the views of the UnitedStates Government on this point. Meanwhile, he would be glad to hear the views of his colleagues. For himself, he doubted whether it would be expedient for the Allied Governments to insist on terms of surrender which would result in the Emperor&apos;s losingauthority over the Japanese people. In the first place, we ought not to increase unnecessarily our difficulties in occupying Japanafter her surrender; and there would be obvious advantages in being able to deal with the Emperor as a central authority throughwhom the directions of the Occupying Powers could be transmitted to the Japanese people. Secondly, the religious influence of theEmperor was such that, if the terms of surrender involved hisabdication, there was a serious risk that the J apanese Forces wouidchoose destruction rather than surrender in which eventhostilities throughout the Far East would be prolonged for many months. Provided, therefore, that the Emperor undertook tocomply with the directions of the Allied Powers, the foreign secretary was disposed to think that it would be expedient to imposeterms of surrender which left unimpaired his sovereignty over theJapanese people.[30622-6] B 2
The Prime Minister recalled that the proclamation issued bythe Allied Governments from Potsdam on the 26th July, while it did not refer in terms to the position of the Emperor, called forthe elimination &quot; for all time of the authority and influence ofthose who had deceived and misled the people of Japan intoembarking upon a campaign of world conquest.&quot; Those wordsmight be construed as requiring the abdication of the Emperor.He was doubtful, however, whether the United States Governmentwould insist on the abdication of the Emperor if that involved aprolongation of hostilities and further sacrifice of american troops.In further discussion the following points were made : 1(a) It would be necessary to ascertain more precisely whatwas meant by the phrase &apos;&apos; the prerogatives of His Majesty as a sovereign ruler.&quot; It would be argued that the Allied occupationof the Japanese ports would prejudice the Emperor&apos;s prerogatives :and, if this was meant, such a stipulation could not be accepted.On the other hand, the phrase might be intended to mean merelythat the terms of surrender should not require the Emperor &apos;sabdication; and in that event the stipulation would not be incon-sistent with the spirit of the Potsdam declaration.(b) Public opinion in this country was sensitive to the sufferings of prisoners of war and civilians now in Japanese hands;and the people of this country would be reluctant to see hostilitiesprolonged on what might be regarded as a technicality, once thesubstance of &quot; unconditional surrender &quot; had been obtained.(c) It would not be justifiable to insist on our right to treat the Emperor of Japan as a war criminal, if the result of suchinsistence was substantially to prolong hostilities in the Far East.(d) It was, of course, essential that we should not take any action on this communication save in concert with the Governmentsof the United States, the U.S.S.R. and China.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said thatit was the view of the Cabinet that it would be inexpedient to insist on terms of surrender involving the abdication of theEmperor of Japan if it seemed likely that this would have theresult of delaying substantially the end of hostilities in the far east. The first step was, however, to exchange views on thispoint with the Governments of the United States, the U.S.S.R. and china, and to seek a common agreement on this matter betweenthe Four Powers. The Foreign Secretary should arrange for this to be done at once through the diplomatic channel. Meanwhile,as the statement issued by the Domei Agency had already been published by the Press and the B.B.C. in this country, it wasadvisable that an official statement should be issued at once urgingpeople to carry on as usual until it was officially stated that Japan&apos;ssurrender had been accepted.The Cabinefs conclusions were as follows : (1) In anticipation of the receipt of an official communication from the Government of Switzerland or Sweden, theForeign Secretary should make arrangements to ascer-tain through the diplomatic channel the attitude of theGovernments of the United States, the U.S.S.R. and china towards the statement put out by the DomeiAgency. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors in Washington,Moscow and Chungking should be informed that theprovisional views of His Majesty&apos;s Government were as stated at &quot; X &quot; above.(2) The Minister of Information should arrange for theimmediate issue to the press of a statement in thefollowing terms : &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government have notyet received any official communication from theJapanese Government, but they are in communicationwith the Governments of the United States, the Soviet
Union and China about the radio broadcast from Tokyo j[ 3as to surrender terms. A further statement will be madeby His Majesty&apos;s Government as soon as the situationis clarified. In the meantime, everyone should continue at work as usual.&quot;Japan. 2.   The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that theMilitary Chiefs of Staff already had in preparation a plan for the dispositionDispositions of our military forces in the event of a sudden surrender by Japan,on Surrender. These plans would not be ready for two or three days, but he explained in very general terms the arrangements which would haveto be made to accept the surrender of the Japanese forces in thevarious areas and to provide for the occupation of liberated andconquered territories.Special arrangements would have to be made for British troops to be sent in to Hong Kong. This was not in the British zone formilitary operations; but we had already contemplated that a detach-ment oi British troops should accompany the United States Forceswhen the course of their operations brought them near Hong Kong.Emergency arrangements would now have to be made; and themost convenient course Avould probably be to send a naval force to hong Kong with a detachment of Marines. This force wouldprobably be drawn from the British Pacific Fleet. The PrimeMinister thought that it might be advisable for him to send a personal telegram to President Truman on this point in view ofthe important political considerations involved.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that, as regardsthe main islands of Japan, the United States plan provided forthe inclusion of a British contingent in the occupying forces. Thiswould have to be found, in the first instance, from the South-east asia Command, Arrangements would be made to include in thiscontingent troops from Australia and New Zealand, and also troops from Canada and India.The Cabinet -Took note of this statement.Japan. 3.   The Prime Minister recalled that at the meeting of theTerms of Cabinet on the 9th August he had suggested that a Committee of surrender. officials should be appointed to study various problems which would(Previous arise in connection with the treatment of Japan after her defeat.reference: This work would now have to be pressed forward as a matter of cm.(45) 19th the greatest urgency; and, in view of the important questions of conclusions, policy which would be involved, he thought it would be convenientMinute 5.) if a Ministerial Committee were now appointed in addition to theCommittee of officials which he had previously proposed.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that a Committee composed as follows : Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Chairman),Secretary  of   State  for  the  Colonies   (deputy chairman),Chancellor of the Exchequer,Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,Secretary of State for India and for Burma,First Lord of the Admiralty,Secretary of State for War,Secretary of State for Air,should be appointed to review the situation arising out. . of the surrender of Japan in its political and adminis-trative aspects.

The Prime Minister said that an immediate review ofProduction munitions production should be undertaken, in the light of theand situation which would be created by the surrender of Japan.  EveryMan-Power. effort must be made to taper off the production of munitions asAdjustment rapidly as possible. Arrangements should also be made to ensureafter Surrender that raw materials now earmarked for munitions production should of Japan.       be made available as rapidly as possible for civil production.A review should be undertaken of the plans for demobilisation and call-up to the Armed Forces; and the present allocations ofman-power for the second half of 1945 should be urgently reviewed.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to arrangefor the Joint War Production Staff to undertake animmediate review of munitions production.(2) Asked the Man-power Committee to make an immediatereview of the man-power position.Parliament.King&apos;s speech on the Openingof Parliament.(previous reference:CM. (45) 19thConclusions,Minute 1.)5. The Prime Minister said that, if the news of Japan&apos;ssurrender had been confirmed before the opening of Parliament onthe 15th August, it would be necessary to make certain changes inthe draft of the King&apos;s Speech which had been considered by theCabinet at their meeting on the 9th August.For the first paragraph of the present draft, a new passageshould be inserted expressing thankfulness for victory anddeliverance and referring to all those through whose efforts andsacrifices the war had been won.Paragraphs 5, 6 and 8 of the draft should be omitted, and some reference should be added to the tasks which our Forces would haveto discharge in the liberation and rehabilitation of the territoriesoccupied by Japan.In paragraphs 11 and 13 of the draft the references to &quot;theEuropean War &apos;&apos; and the &apos;&apos; war against Germany &apos;&apos; should be amended.The Cabinet-Approved in principle the amendments suggested by thePrime Minister, and invited him to settle on their behalfthe final wording of the draft Speech.Arrangements Q    The Cabinet held a preliminary discussion  about the for celebrating arrangements to be made for celebrating the end of the war.the end of The following were the main points made in discussion ;  the War.(a) Broadcasts.The arrangements should follow those adopted for VE-Day,viz., there should first be a brief official announcement by the PrimeMinister, and thereafter a broadcast by The King.
