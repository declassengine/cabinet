2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to atelegram (No. 6407) which had just been received from Washington,stating that the United States Government felt obliged to go aheadat once with the simultaneous presentation of a Note to HisMajesty&apos;s Government and to the Soviet Government, signifyingtheir intention of negotiating with the Government of Iceland along-term lease for the use of certain bases in the island. Thisquestion had been mentioned to him a few days previously byMr. Byrnes, but the matter had apparently been suddenly broughtto a head by rumours already current in Reykjavik.The American proposal was to lease from Iceland :  .   (i) a naval base at Hvalyord;(ii) an air base for land aircraft in the Keflavik area; and(iii) an air base for sea aircraft in the Reykjavik area.The Americans were prepared to agree that civil aircraft ofany nationality should have landing rights on the airfields in theKeflavik area and that such aircraft would be treated on a basisof complete equality with their own aircraft as regards terms,fees, &amp;c. If Iceland became a member of the United Nations, theUnited States would be prepared to consider allowing the bases tobe made available to the Security Council under article 43 of the charter. The Americans had felt that they must secure the bases in the interests of their own security, and had expressed the hopethat we would recognise that their proposal was in our interests also.The First Sea Lord said that the Chiefs of Staff had not yet had enough time to study the proposals. At first sight they had theadvantage of denying Iceland to any potentially hostile thirdPower, but the result of the action by the United States government might be to encourage the Russians to seek bases in northern norway and elsewhere. On balance, it would probably be to our advantage to have the Americans in Iceland. We should, however,try to obtain from them an assurance that their presence in Icelandwould not, in any circumstances, be allowed to compromise thesecurity of our North Atlantic communications, and an agreement for diversionary landing rights on the Icelandic airfields for Serviceaircraft and for the operation of navigational and meteorologicalstations. The Chiefs of Staff would wTelcome an opportunity ofgiving the proposals further study before expressing a final view on them.United StatesBases inin Iceland.Council of. 1.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported to theForeign Cabinet on the position which had arisen at the Council of foreign ministers.        Ministers.After a discussion, a record of which is contained in the reference; Secretary&apos;s Standard File of Cabinet Conclusions, the Cabinet : CM. (45) 32nd J - &apos;Conclusions.) (1) Agreed that the Foreign Secretary should take &quot;the line thatthe Conference should now adjourn, since it had become apparent that through lack of sufficient preparatory work, there was a risk that the interests of the peoplesconcerned would suffer. During the adjournmentfurther preparatory work would take place and the deputies would continue to deal with the questions referred to them. In the interval the Governmentsconcerned could also explore what would be the bestprocedure to adopt for the future consideration of the issues involved in the peace settlement.(2) Agreed that the Foreign Secretary should see the presswhen the Conference was adjourned.(3) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would look into thequestion of giving guidance to the B.B.C. with regardto broadcasts on the subject of the Conference.
The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that theCanadian Government were already somewhat concerned about theAmerican intentions with regard to bases in Newfoundland andthat it would be desirable to obtain their views on the american proposals with regard to Iceland.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Chiefs of Staff to report to the foreign secretary by noon of the following day on the military implications of the American proposals with regard, tobases in Iceland.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs toobtain the views of the Canadian Government on theproposals as a matter of urgency.Allied Control 3.   The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that at theMachinery       18th Meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers, the Sovietin Japan.        Delegation had put forward a proposal for the immediate establish-ment of an Allied Control Council in Tokyo.Mr. Byrnes had appealed to him for his support in keeping thisproposal off the agenda of the Council of Foreign Ministers, andalthough we had ourselves, on the 14th August, suggested that inaddition to the Advisory Commission in Washington an effective control Council should be established in Tokyo under general macarthur, he had felt it right at this juncture to support theUnited States Delegation. His own view was that the matter shouldnot be dealt with by the Council of Foreign Ministers but should besettled on another plane between the Governments concerned.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that earlier in the day he had indicated to Dr. Evatt that, although we had originally proposed the establishment of a Control Council in Tokyo,on which Australia would be represented, we might find it necessaryto yield to the American objections to this proposal. WhileDr. Evatt had made it clear that Australia would not contemplatesurrendering her right to have a say in the formulation of the peace terms to be imposed on Japan, he had given the impression that he might be willing to waive the proposal for the establishment of control Council in Tokyo if he could be satisfied that the Australianpoint of view could be represented in some other way for example,if the Advisory Commission in Washington were to be given realpower. Dr. Evatt had also made it clear that he would be opposedto the discussion of the matter by the Council of Foreign Ministers.It would, in his view, be most helpful if the Foreign Secretary andMr. Byrnes were to have a meeting with Dr. Evatt.In discussion there was general agreement that the foreign secretary should take the line that the question of the Allied Contrelmachinery in Japan should not be discussed by the Council ofForeign Ministers. At the same time we should not forthwith&quot; X &quot; abandon the proposal for a Control Council at Tokyo, and, as analternative to the discussion of the matter by the Council of foreign ministers, we might suggest that it should be taken up between theGovernments of all those countries who had been actual belligerentsin the war against Japan.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Foreign Secretary should proceed on thelines indicated at &quot; X &quot; above.(2) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would arrange tomeet Dr. Evatt, in the first instance alone, and subse-quently with Mr. Byrnes.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,25th September, 1945.
