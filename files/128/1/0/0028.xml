1. The Cabinet had before them a memqrandum by theMinister of Food (CP. (45) 237) regarding the line to be taken onbehalf of the Government in the Debate in the House of commons on the 26th October on a Motion expressing concern at thepossibility that numbers of people in Europe might die of starvation-tion and cold during the coming winter and urging that all possible steps should be taken to prevent this disaster. This memorandumoutlined the general statement which might be made on behalf ofthe Government regarding the supply of food-stuffs to Europe;and submitted for decision by the Cabinet the question whether anattempt should be made to provide additional supplies of food for Europe by either, or both, of the following means  (i) Making shipping available to transport to Europe anytinned foods bought on points by individuals andcollected by voluntary agencies for shipment;(ii) Supplying  for  the  British  Zones  in   Germany  and austria, or for distribution through some relieforganisation to displaced persons or others in greatest need in Europe, such additional supplies as could bemade available without prejudicing food supplies forthe United Kingdom. For this purpose it would bepossible to provide a number of packs of concentratedfoods surplus to Army requirements, a quantity of driedfruit not suitable for consumption in this country, tea,cereals and possibly potatoes, and small quantities ofother miscellaneous food-stuffs.The following were the main points raised in the course of ageneral discussion : - (a) There were already signs of growing public uneasinessabout the prospects of widespread starvation in Europe during thecoming winter. The strong public feeling on this question wouldbe reflected in the House of Commons; and public pressure wouldgrow as the situation in Europe deteriorated during the course ofthe winter.On the other hand, conditions differed widely from one partof Europe to another, and people in some European countries were better off in some respects than people in this country. Itwas important that any sweeping generalisations about conditionsin Europe as a whole should be corrected. It should also beremembered that, while many people in this country would besympathetic towards suffering in Germany and Austria, there wasa large body of public opinion which would be quick to protest against the diversion to ex-enemy countries of food-stuffs whichmight have been made available to people in this country, especiallytypes of food which had long been scarce or unobtainable in theUnited Kingdom.For these reasons it was important that everything possible should be done to make known to the public in this country the truefacts regarding present conditions in Europe and prospects forthe coming winter. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterreported the views held by the military authorities in the BritishZones in Germany and Austria. They considered that, unlesssupplies could be increased, there was grave danger of widespreadstarvation during the winter, and consequent risk of epidemics and disorder. They feared, in particular, that it would be impossibleto prevent British troops from giving their rations to German and austrian children though many of these had already becomeprofessional collectors for the black market in food.(b) The Minister of Food said that the maintenance of asatisfactory nutritional standard throughout the British Zones inGermany and Austria turned very largely on the special problemof fulfilling the programme for deliveries of wheat to thosecountries. This problem was discussed in separate papers whichhad been submitted by himself (CP. (45) 241) and by the Minister
of State (CP. (45) 233) but were not at present before the Cabinet.This was a very complex situation, and he was making enquiries into various possible means of easing it. He hoped that, when&quot;these enquiries had been carried a little further, he might havedefinite proposals to put before the Cabinet.The Secretary of State for War said that any reduction inthe supplies of wheat to these countries would have very serious results. He hoped that the Cabinet would not reach final decisions on this question until he had had further time to consult with theControl Commissions.In discussion, it was pointed out that this issue was likelyto be brought forward in the course of the Debate; and here againthere were advantages in making the facts known. The present world shortage of wheat could be alleviated if less wheat were fedto cattle in the United States and less maize used as fuel in theArgentine. Should it not be made clear in the Debate that theshortage was due, in part, to the failure of exporting countries to make their maximum contribution to the needs of the world ?If the United States could arrange to take some of the surplusmaize from the Argentine and use it as feeding-stuffs, more wheat(from the United States could be made available for Europe.The &quot;Lord President of the Council said that these problemshad already been under consideration by the Lord presidents committee (L.P. (45) 37th Meeting, Minute 1), who had set on foot a number of enquiries designed to find means of relieving thesituation. In particular, the Minister of Fuel and Power hadbeen invited to consider the possibility of supplying crude oil tothe Argentine so that increased quantities of maize might be exported from that country instead of being used as fuel.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that themain difficulty in securing larger supplies of food from theArgentine had been for some time, and was still, caused by thestrained political relations between v the United States andArgentine Governments. If the United States Government couldbe persuaded to accept even a temporary truce in these political difficulties, it should be possible to make some arrangements to tapthe food resources available in the Argentine. He would beprepared, if the Cabinet agreed, to renew the attempts which hehad already made to reach an understanding on this point withthe United States Government.It was generalty agreed that it would be advantageous if theForeign Secretary made a further approach to the United StatesGovernment on this question.(c) \The Minister of Food referred to the figures given inparagraph 3 of CP. (45) 237 for the average calorie level per headin various- countries of Europe. These figures were being realised in practice in all European countries except Germany. The latestevidence suggested that in the British Zone in Germany the foodavailable represented an average level of only about 1,300-1,400calories per head.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that themilitary authorities in the British Zone could not accept even1,550 calories as a level sufficient to prevent disease and unrestunder present conditions in Germany. He also said that the com-parisohs made between one country and another were misleading.Conditions varied; and comparisons with civilian ration scales inthis country did not take into account the other foods available to people in this country in addition to the standard rations. It was desirable that some proper standard of comparison should be worked out. The supplementary supplies mentioned in para-graph 10 (b) of CP. (45) 237 would, he understood, provide in totalonly 7 lb. per head of the population in the British Zones of[30816-2] b 2
Germany and Austria. So small an addition to the supplies,already in sight would not be sufficient to enable our militaryauthorities to get through the winter without very serious trouble.The Minister of Education said that calculations of food supplies in terms of calories per head of population were misleading,because they took no account of the great differences between different sections of the population. Large numbers of people inGermany were reasonably well supplied with food : there was no serious shortage in rural areas, nor were conditions specially bad inthe towns which had suffered no war damage. The real problem was that of the children in the towns, especially the heavily-damagedtowns. In her view, our main effort should be concentrated on providing additional food for these children.The Home Secretary supported this view. If the additional supplies mentioned in paragraph 10 (b) of CP. (45) 237 would pro-vide 7 lb. per head of the whole population throughout the winter,and if children of school-age represented about one-third of the popu-lation, these supplies, if confined to school children, would provideeach child with about 1 lb. of extra food per week throughout the worst of the coming winter; and, if the supply were further confined to children in the towns where food was scarcest, possibly as muchas 2 lb. per head per week could be made available. If the foodcould be providea through a school-meals service, there would be nodifficulty in ensuring that it reached those for whom it was intended.There was general support for the view that any additionalfood-stuffs that could be made available should be supplied, through an organisation under British control, for the benefit of children under the age of 16.(d) The Foreign Secretary pointed out that, though the discus-sion had turned so far on the question of food supplies, the Motionwhich was to be debated on the 26th October was in wider terms. Itreferred to the compulsory transfer of populations, the need forincreased production of coal in the Ruhr, the supply of transport and the appointment of a Supreme Economic Council. He thoughtit likely that the Debate might develop into a discussion of Russianpolicy in Europe; and he would have to consider very carefully what line he should take in dealing with these issues. As regards food supplies, it had always been the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government,both under the Coalition Government and under the present administration, that Europe could not be properly fed unless it was treated as a whole. But the Soviet Government seemed to be followingpolicies inconsistent with that view. Thus, Roumania and Bulgariahad in the past produced food surpluses; but, from enquiries made when the Council of Foreign Ministers were considering theproblem of food supplies for Austria, it appeared that no surpluseswould be available from either of those countries this year and noneseemed likely to be available next year. The proposed commercial treaty between Russia and Hungary seemed likely to have the effectthat half of any food surplus in Hungary would pass in future toRussia. Soviet policy in South-Eastern Europe generally seemed likely to divert to Russia any food surpluses which might be avail-able, though Russia herself had in the past been able to export food-stuffs. He was inclined to think that the time had come to referpublicly to the effect of these Soviet policies on the food situation inEurope as a whole. He would also like to refer to the attitude takenby the Soviet Government towards the proposals which the UnitedStates Delegation had put forward at the Council of foreign ministers for the control of international waterways in Europe proposals which, if they had been adopted, would have substantiallyeased the problem of transporting supplies for the relief of sufferingin Europe.As regards the proposal for the establishment of a supreme economic Council, he would wish to point out that there was already in existence an Emergency Economic Committee for Europe, butthat the Soviet Government had hitherto declined to co-operate inthe work of that body.
It was the general view of the Cabinet that it would be advan-,tageous if some of these points could be made, on a factual basis andwith due caution and reserve, in the course of the Debate.(e) The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster drew special attention to the reference in the Motion to the need for increased production of coal in the Ruhr. This was, he thought, vital to therestoration of the German economy : and it was a matter of common-sense, not sentiment, to provide more food for miners in the Ruhr.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that his Department hadbeen doing all they could to this end, e.g., by sending technical experts to the Ruhr and affording other assistance. Coal produc-tion in the Ruhr was increasing, and the position was not whollyunsatisfactory. Any further increase in food supplies for Germanminers should, in his view, be carefully considered from the point ofview of the possible reaction of miners in this country, who were by no means satisfied with the ration scales available to them.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that themain points to be made by the first Government speaker in the debate were the following : (i) We had been engaged for the past six years in inflicting the greatest possible damage on Germany, andwe should not, therefore, expect that the German economy couldrecover within a few months after the end of hostilities. Conditionsin Germany were bound to be distressing, and were likely to getworse during the winter. Moreover, we had specifically warned theGerman people in the spring of the consequences of prolongingtheir resistance, and the conditions which we had then prophesiedhad come about through the fault of the German people and through no fault of ours, (ii) The situation was aggravated by theaction of certain European Governments in expelling Germans fromtheir territory and thus increasing the number of displaced persons to be handled in the British and United States Zones. The foreign secretary would also consider what could properly be said about thedifficulties due to certain aspects of Russian policy in Europe,(iii) Present conditions in Germany could not be materiallyimproved by unilateral action on the part of the British government alone. Full credit should be taken for the supplies already sent fromthis country as indicated in paragraphs 2-9 of CP. (45) 237; but itshould be made clear that additional supplies on a scale sufficient tobring any widespread relief must be organised on an internationalbasis with the co-operation, in particular, of food-exporting countries, (iv) We must look to the exporting countries to make their full contribution. The additional quantities of food whichthey could provide would depend, in part, on the extent to which itcontinued to be thought necessary to feed wheat to cattle in theUnited States and on the possibility of making arrangements forthe export of maize and other food-stuffs from the Argentine.The Foreign Secretary, who would speak first in the Debate,could handle the matter on these general lines. The Minister ofFood, in replying to the Debate, could announce the small additional contribution of food-stuffs which could be made from this country.He could refer, in general terms, to the supplies mentioned in para-graph 10 (b) of CP. (45) 237, and could outline the arrangements which he had in mind for securing that these additional supplies were made available for school-children in the British Zones ofGermany and Austria.The remaining question for the Cabinet was whether anypromise should be held out, on the lines of paragraph 10 (a) of cp. (45) 237, to facilitate the transport to Europe of food which individual people in this country might wish to make availableout of their rations. On this question differing views were expressed. On the one side it was urged that any arrangement ofthis kind would be open to abuse : collecting agencies would be liable to bring undue pressure to bear and people might be induced to give up food which they needed for themselves.   There was also
some risk that, if any facilities were provided by the Government,it would be claimed that the movement had official support. Onthe other hand, it was suggested that some outlet for private altruismshould be provided; and that, if people were enabled to givepractical expression to their sympathy for human suffering inEurope, much of the present sense of frustration would be removed and the public agitation which would otherwise arise might bereduced.The Cabinet-(1) Took note that the Foreign Secretary, in the first speech on behalf of the Government in the Debate in the Houseof Commons on the 26th October, would deal with thegeneral issues raised by this Motion on the broad lines indicated by the Prime Minister in summing up theCabinet&apos;s discussion;(2) Invited the Minister of Food to reconsider, in the light ofthe discussion, the question whether individuals in thiscountry should be given any facilities to surrender food-stuffs for transport to Europe, on the lines indicated inparagraph 10 (a) of CP. (45) 237; and to settle inconsultation with the Prime Minister what, if anything,should be said on this point in the Debate.Prisonersof War.(previous reference:CM. (45) 33rdConclusions,Minute 3.)2. , The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP. (45) 219) proposing that arrangements should be made for the return to Germany and austria of &quot; white &quot; German and Austrian prisoners of war.The Foreign Secretary said that he proposed to arrange for thereturn to Germany from this country and, so far as transport facilities allowed, from the Middle East, of non-Nazi and anti-Nazi prisoners of war previously domiciled in the British Zoneor in the British sector of Berlin, in order that they might take part in the general work of rehabilitation in those parts of Germany.In addition, the British Commander-in-Chief in Germany shouldbe instructed to propose to his three colleagues on the control council (or, if he thought preferable, to his United States andFrench colleagues only) that we should repatriate &apos;&apos; whiteprisoners now in this country who were previously domiciled intheir zones or sectors. An equivalent number of unclassifiedGerman prisoners now held in the British Zone of Germany or elsewhere under British control could, if required, be sent to theUnited Kingdom to replace the labour hitherto supplied by the&quot;white&quot; German prisoners returned from this country.Corresponding arrangements should be made for the return of&apos;&apos; white &apos;&apos; Austrian prisoners to the various zones of Austria andsectors of Vienna, on the understanding that such prisoners wouldbe replaced, not by Austrians, but by additional German prisonersof war.-The following points were made in discussion : (a) The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries reminded theCabinet that the pool of labour available for agriculture was already being reduced as a result of releases from the Women&apos;s Land Armyand the repatriation of Italian prisoners of war. He must there-fore stipulate that replacements should be provided for any&apos;&apos; white &apos;&apos; prisoners of war now employed in agriculture who wererepatriated.(&amp;) Attention was drawn to the shortage of passenger shipping,both on the North Sea and Mediterranean routes, and it was pointedout that men in the Services travelling home on release or on leavemust have priority over prisoners of war. There would, of course,be further consultation with the Ministry of War Transportregarding the rate at which these movements of prisoners could becarried out.
The Cabinet Approved the proposals made in CP. (45) 219 for thereturn to Germany and Austria of &quot; white &quot; prisoners of-war. on the understandings (i) that, in so far as this involved a reduction in the available prisoner-of-war labour in the United Kingdom, replacements would be provided;and (ii) that the rate at which the transfers were made would be determined in consultation with the Ministry ofWar Transport.Supply ofEquipmentto Spain.(previous reference:W.M.(45)49thConclusions, -Minute 4.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP. (45) 220) about thesupply of equipment to Spain.The Foreign Secretary recalled that this matter had beenconsidered by the War Cabinet on the 23rd April, 1945, but no finaldecision had then been taken as it had been thought that in thefirst instance an attempt should be made to reach agreement withthe United States Government on a common policy. The state department, whose views were set out in a telegram from lord halifax annexed to CP. (45) 220, had made it clear that they wereagainst supplying actual weapons of war to Spain and had indicated that, so far as concerned semi-military equipment, they were againstsending to Spain anything calculated to increase the strength of theSpanish armed forces. If this distinction was accepted, as seemedright, it could be applied in practice by making subject to licenceall exports to Spain of goods listed in Group 17 of the First Scheduleto the Export of Goods (Control) (No. 7) Order, 1945, and, inpresent circumstances, refusing licences except in cases where such goods were manifestly intended for civilian use.The Foreign Secretary said that, if this recommendation was approved, the United States Government would be informed. Hewas averse to doing anything which would strengthen the present regime in Spain, but it seemed clear that if His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment adopted too strict a policy in controlling exports to thatcountry the result would be to divert valuable export orders from theUnited Kingdom to the United States.The Secretary of State for Air drew attention to the extent towhich civil aircraft could be used for warlike purposes against anadversary not possessing any aircraft. He hoped that the Boardof Trade would keep this point in mind in considering applicationsfor licences to export aircraft.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the Admiralty wouldtake up with the Board of Trade certain questions regarding theexport of items (e.g., dockyard equipment and blue prints forweapons of war) which were not covered by Group 17 but might beused to strengthen the Spanish armed forces.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that no weapons of war should be supplied to spain and that, in order to restrict the export of goods of a semi-military character to those manifestly required for civilian use, all exports to Spain of goods in Group 17of the Export of Goods (Control) (No. 7) Order, 1945,should be made subject to licence.(2) Took note that the President of the Board of Trade would consult the First Lord of the Admiralty and theSecretary of State for Air with regard to the export of aircraft and of items, not covered by Group 17, whichmight be used to strengthen the Spanish armed forces.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,23rd October, 1945.
