social insurance.national insurance(industrial injuries) Bill.(previous reference:W.M. (45) 62ndConclusions,Minute 5.)1. The Cabinet considered a Memorandum by the Lord privy seal (CP. (45) 210) suggesting that in the Second Reading debate on the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Bill certain conces-sions should be announced to meet points which had been raised bythe Trades Union Congress and the Miners&apos; Unions.The Lord Privy Seal said the Bill prepared by the coalition government had been broadly acceptable to the Trades UnionCongress and the Lord President had accordingly announced thatthe present Government would introduce a Bill in substantially thesame form. The Trades Union Congress had, however, decided attheir meeting in September to press for improvements in the Bill,and they were supported in this by the Miners&apos; Unions, The two points to which they attached most importance were (i) an increasein the basic rates of injury benefit and disablement pension to 55s.and 60s. a week respectively; and (ii) some provision to meet thecase of partially incapacitated workers who, owing to their injury,could not resume their former occupation. Prom discussions withrepresentatives of the Trades Union Congress it was clear that, ifthe Government agreed to increase the basic rates to 45s. a weekand made provision in the Bill for a 25 per cent, addition to the basic rate where a partially incapacitated claimant could show that by reason of his injury he could no longer follow his previousoccupation, the critics of the Bill would be satisfied. If, however,no such concessions were made the Bill would be strongly opposedon behalf of the Trades Union Congress and by Members of Parlia-ment representing mining constituencies. The Social services committee had considered the position and recommended the concessions set out in paragraph 3 of CP. (45) 210.In discussion it was pointed out that there was already a widegap between the basic rates under the Bill and those proposed for sickness and pensions under the general insurance scheme, and that,if the basic rates under the Bill were further increased it wouldbe difficult to resist demands for increases in the rates under thegeneral scheme. So far as concerned partially incapacitatedworkers who could not resume their former occupation, was theproposal made in paragraph 3 (6) of CP. (45) 210 consistent withthe principle of not basing compensation on previous earnings,which was a fundamental feature of the Bill ? Moreover, if theproposal were adopted, the Minister of Pensions would almost inevitably be driven to make a similar concession to war pensioners.On the other hand, it was urged that the Trades UnionCongress, while accepting the original Bill as the best they could get from a Coalition Government, had not formally agreed to it. Inparticular, they had never supported the proposal that no special provision should&apos; be made for partially incapacitated workers who could not resume their former occupation; and, on merits, therewas a good case for giving an extra payment where the workers&apos;injury involved a loss of skill in his chosen occupation. Higherbasic rates under the Industrial Injuries Scheme could be justified on the ground that workers did not insure separately againstindustrial injury, as many of them did against sickness. Theincrease proposed would be met by raising the worker&apos;s contribu-tion by Id. a week; and, while it was true that there would bedemands for similar treatment for war pensioners, it should beborne in mind that war pensions represented a falling charge.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the suggested provision for dealing with the case of the partiallyincapacitated worker did not take sufficiently into account the-possibility that he might be re-trained for an occupation in whichhis standard of earnings could be equivalent to that of his formeroccupation. It was most desirable that injured workmen shouldbe encouraged to make the fullest possible use of the extendedfacilities for re-training which would be available in future; andthere seemed to be no reason why an injured workman who, afterundergoing a course of training or otherwise, could follow an[30777-1] b 2
occupation of an equivalent standard of earnings to that which hehad followed before his accident should receive any additionalpayment.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries)Bill should be amended (i) to provide that injury benefit and 100 per cent.disablement pension should be at the basic rate of45s. a week, and that there should be an increaseof Id. a week in the contribution payable by theworkers;(ii) to enable an addition of 25 per cent, to be made tothe basic rate of benefit where a partiallyincapacitated claimant can show to the satisfac-tion of a local tribunal that he is no longer ableto follow his previous occupation and that he cannot follow, and cannot be so re-trained as toenable him to follow, an occupation of an equivalent standard of earnings.(2) Authorised the Minister of National Insurance to announce, in moving the Second Reading of the national insurance (Industrial Injuries) Bill, that the Govern-ment would propose on the Committee Stage amend-ments to give effect to (1) above.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Health (CP. (45) 208) suggesting that he should take an early opportunity of making in Parliament a comprehensive statement on the Governments housing policy, and outlining themain points which he would propose to include in such a state-ment.The Minister of Health explained and amplified the points setout in his memorandum and, in addition, made the following further points : -(i)&apos;Over the next few years the problem of housing would be largely an administrative one, and the bulk of the work would haveto be done through the local authorities. A high proportion of thehouses built between the two wars had been built by private enter-prise for sale : the bulk of the houses to be built in the next fewyears should be built by local authorities for letting. There wouldbe a strong campaign for relaxing controls so as to give furtherscope for house-building by private enterprise, but such a coursewould, in his view, lead to administrative chaos and inflated costs.(ii) Paragraph 4 of CP. (45) 208 referred to the central pur-chase on behalf of local authorities of standardised houses of non-traditional construction. The Health Departments had seen the prototype of a steel house which seemed likely to prove sufficientlysatisfactory to warrant the placing of a large order; and they had indicated that, if satisfactory arrangements for mass production could be made, the Government would be prepared to place an order for 50,000 of these houses. Deliveries could not begin until earlyin 1947; but these houses would be a valuable supplement to thehousing programme, and it was possible that an export market mightbe found for them after the immediate needs of the domestic markethad been met.(iii) It was important that some system of standardised houseconstruction should be devised, if only as a stimulus to the efficiency of the building industry. The Cabinet were informed that forthis purpose a small Committee was being appointed under theChairmanship of Professor J. D. Bernal to consider whether it waspossible to select, from the numerous systems of non-traditional con-struction, various elements which in combination would provide a housing.proposed statement ofPolicy.
system which, could be firmly recommended by the Government for adoption by local authorities.(iv) In amplification of paragraphs 14r-15 of CP. (45) 208, theMinister mentioned three specific proposals for increasing theamount of emergency accommodation to be made available duringthe coming winter. First, he proposed to take powers to facilitate the conversion of large houses into flats by relieving lease-holders, in proper cases, from compliance with restrictive covenants prohibitingsuch conversion. These powers would be sparingly used at first,because conversion was uneconomical of labour, but the powers should be available for use as required. Secondly, it would benecessary to secure the use of spare accommodation in occupiedhouses. He proposed to submit a Defence Regulation enabling localauthorities to secure the use of such accommodation, where neces-sary, by compulsory powers. He hoped, however, that this objectcould be largely achieved by voluntary means, on the basis of apublic appeal to householders, the compulsory powers being kept in reserve for use only in extreme cases. Thirdly, he proposed thata Defence Regulation should be made requiring that the consentof the local housing authority should be obtained before house pro-perty was converted for use as offices.The Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotlandsaid that he was not dissatisfied with the progress which was beingmade with preparations for the post-war housing programme inScotland. The main difficulty was the shortage of building labour.If that could be remedied, he believed that solid progress would bemade in Scotland, even in the Glasgow area where housing condi-tions had been specially unsatisfactory in the past.The following were the main points made in discussion :- (a) The Minister of Health said that there was no foundation for the suggestion that there had been delay in authorising localauthorities to go to tender. The real cause of delay in making a start on construction was the continuing shortage of technical staffsfor local authorities. In spite of the previous discussions about therelease of these technical staffs from the Armed Forces, there were still outstanding about 600 cases of men whose release had been requested by the Health Departments, but not yet been granted bythe Service Departments.The Prime Minister recalled a Directive which he had issued to the Service Ministers on this subject.The First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of Statefor War said that they had given instructions on this matter, andtheir attention had not previously been called to any failure tocomply with these instructions.After discussion, the Prime Minister asked the three service ministers to provide him with a report on these outstanding cases.(b) The Minister of A griculture and Fisheries pointed out thatthe statement set out in CP. (45) 208 contained no reference tothe provision of houses in rural areas. Any general statement inthe House of Commons on the Governments housing policy which included no reference to rural housing would meet with strong criticism from both sides of the House. Paragraph 13 of the state-ment set out the principle that &quot;contractors must look for lessprofit on more houses and not to more profit, on fewer houses,&quot; butthis principle had little or no application to the problem of rural housing. Nor was much comfort to be found in the proposal inparagraph 5 of the statement to rely on default powers, for it waswell-known that such powers were ineffective in practice. He under-stood that the Ministry of Health and the Treasury were consideringthe rates of subsidy in respect of house-building by local authorities;but there had been no consultation with his Department about thesubsidy for rural housing.
The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs endorsed these views. In particular, he believed that default powers would proveunavailing; and that, in order to secure an adequate provision ofhouses in rural areas, it would be necessary for the Central Govern-ment to take power themselves to build houses in areas where theywere satisfied that adequate progress was not likely to be made bythe local authority. Adequate housing in rural areas was essentialto home food production.(c) The Foreign Secretary said that, in his view, the Ministryof Works should have power to build houses; and that this power should not be restricted to the rural areas. He believed that, apartfrom other reasons, such a power was necessary in order to forcedown building costs.id) The Foreign Secretary also suggested that the Co-operativePermanent Building Society had a contribution to make towardsthe post-war housing programme, and suggested that they should bebrought into consultation.(e) The Foreign Secretary said that it was worth considering whether some of the labour employed in repairing war damage toold houses in London could not be more profitably used in con-structing new houses on adjacent sites where the houses had been entirely destroyed but the services were already available.The Lord President of the Council said that, from the Parlia-nientary point of view, he was apprehensive about the effect of ageneral statement of policy on the lines indicated in CP. (45) 208.The target figures given in paragraph 2 of the statement did not differ from those put forward by the Coalition Government whichhad at the time been subjected to heavy criticism. The statementincluded many negative propositions which were also open to criti-criticism e.g., the failure to make any provision for the man who wished to own his house, and the failure to give the building societies any part in the programme. More specific information should also be given of the means proposed for giving effect togeneral policy in such matters as the control of prices and the manu-facture of components. The present statement would, he feared,give the impression that the housing policy of the new Govern-ment had no distinctive feature and was nothing more than acollection of miscellaneous expedients. Finally, from the Parlia-mentary point of view, he would much rather that a general state-ment on housing policy should be made in relation to a housing bill than that two days&apos; valuable time should be spent on a general debate which would give wide scope for criticism and would resultin nothing more than the passing of a resolution.The Prime Minister said that he also would like to see such astatement related more closely to proposals for legislation. Thestatement in CP. (45) 208 foreshadowed the taking of freshpowers, both by Defence Regulation and by Bill; and he thoughtit important that such a statement should not be made until theGovernment were ready to proceed without delay to bring intoforce the powers required to give effect to their declaredintentions.Apart from this point, however, the discussion had shownthat there was still a good deal of ground to be cleared before ageneral statement of policy could be made. In particular, further efforts should be made to reconcile the outstanding differences ofview between Departments; and there should be a further definition of the legislation required, so that the Legislation committee could consider how this legislation could be fitted in to thelegislative programme for the Session. He suggested that theMinister of Health should consider the matter further in the lightof the various points which had been raised in the discussion, andshould arrange for further consideration of these issues by theHousing Committee before the question was brought up again tothe Cabinet.
The Cabinet&apos;s conclusions were as follows :  (1) The three Service Ministers should submit to the PrimeMinister a report on the applications made for therelease from the Armed Forces of local authoritytechnical staffs required for the housing programme,showing the number of such applications still out-standing, and, in respect of each outstanding case, theperiod for which it had been outstanding and the reasons why release had not so far been authorised;(2) The Minister of Health should consider, in the light ofthe points raised in the discussion, the timing and content of a statement of Government policy on housing, and should arrange for these matters to befurther examined by the Housing Committee before submitting revised proposals to the Cabinet.3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs (CP. (45) 206) proposing that Britishand French military experts should meet to draw up a detailedprogramme for the evacuation by stages of British and french troops from Syria and the Lebanon.The Foreign Secretary said that at the present stage he asked only for approval of the directive to the experts whichwas reproduced in Annex A of his memorandum. The FrenchGovernment had submitted further proposals for Anglo-french -operation in the Eastern Mediterranean, which were set out in annex B of the memorandum; but these raised far-reachingquestions with which he did not wish to trouble the Cabinet atthe present time.The Secretary of State for War said that if the British troops were withdrawn from the Levant States before the French troops were withdrawn, there was likely to be an outbreak of disorder;and he suggested that it should be made a condition of the agree-ment that the British troops should not be entirely withdrawnunless the French troops were withdrawn simultaneously.The Foreign Secretary said that he was not prepared to insist on such a condition. British troops had been sent into the LevantStates for reasons arising directly out of the war, and we had no justification for retaining troops in that area for other reasons.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, while he did not dissent from the Foreign Secretary&apos;s view, he thought difficulties might arise if, as seemed probable, the French insisted on keepingtroops in Beirut. Was it not likely that France, as a permanentmember of the Security Council, would be able thereafter to vetoany proposals involving the withdrawal of their troops fromBeirut? Might not this point be raised in the course of theproposed discussions between the Governments of the UnitedKingdom, France and the Levant States ?The Foreign Secretary said that, if this point were raised, itshould be left as an issue between the Governments of France andthe Levant States.    It was not an issue in which the UnitedKingdom need, or should, become involved.   He had no doubt thatthe offer to withdraw British troops must be a straightforward and unconditional offer.The Cabinet-Agreed that a military plan for the evacuation of Britishand French troops from Syria and the Lebanon should beprepared, in accordance with the draft directive reproduced in Annex A of CP. (45) 206.
Dockers&apos; 4.   The Minister of Labour and National Service said that aStrike. serious situation was developing as a result of the dockers&apos; strike.There were six ships containing cargoes of perishable food-stuffsawaiting unloading in Liverpool. Two of these contained cargoes of bacon; and he was informed that, if these cargoes were lost,an immediate reduction in the bacon ration would be necessary.He was disposed, subject to the views of his colleagues, to arrangefor military labour to be used for unloading these cargoes offood-stuffs.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour and national Service; and noted with approval the actionwhich he was proposing to take.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,9th October, 1945.
