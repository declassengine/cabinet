The Cabinet had before them the following papers on the future organisation of Government Supply :  (i) CP. (45) 178 : a note by the Prime Minister covering an exchange of minutes with the Lord President of theCouncil and a draft public statement;(ii)- CP. (45) 177:  a memorandum by the parliamentary under-Secretary of State for War;(iii) CP. (45) 181 : a memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Air;(iv) CP. (45) 197 : a memorandum by the Chiefs of staff the Prime Minister said that the broad issue for decision was whether the Ministry of Supply should continue as normal part ofthe peace-time organisation, or whether there should be a reversion to the previous practice under which the Service Ministrieshandled their own supply questions independently. It was agreedthat the Ministry of Supply should have certain continuingfunctions in regard to,common user supplies, but the memoranda by the Secretary of State for Air, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for War and the Chiefs of Staff were opposedto the proposal made by the Lord President in his minute of the14th September that the Ministry of Supply should deal withresearch, design, development and production in the case of specialised war-like stores. The crux of the matter was whatconstituted the limits of the sphere of common user. The Secretaryof State for Air, for example, held that the production of aircraft should be the responsibility of the Air Ministry : but the R.A.F.were not the only customers for aircraft, and if production were placed under the Air Ministry the needs of the R.A.P. would inevitably tend to come before those of the Admiralty, the WarOffice and the Ministry of Civil Aviation. Past experience (e.g.,in tank production) did not bear out the contention that there was less contact between user and producer when they were in separateDepartments than when they came under the single Department.In modern warfare civil industry had to be mobilised on the largest possible scale and the lessons of both wars went to show that agreater concentration of effort was possible by having a singleSupply Department. He saw no reason why there should be a gap between military thought and weapon development because thelatter was the responsibility of the Ministry of Supply.The Lord President of the Council said that under modern conditions it was impossible to create an adequate war potentialwithout undertaking responsibility for the organisation of theengineering industry as a whole in its war potential aspects, and clearly the Service Departments were not fitted to do this. More-over, the atmosphere of the Service Departments was not conductive to the freedom of discussion which was essential if the best results in the fields of research, design and development were to be obtained.At the same time, he agreed that the fighting Services must notbe cut off from the business of supply and that there was a real problem to be solved in integrating the requirements of theService Departments with the responsibilities of the Supply Depart-ment and in ensuring that the best brains in both the service departments and the Supply Department worked in close co-operation.The President of the Board of Trade said that the whole setup of the Service Departments was designed with a view to the efficient organisation of the fighting Services and that a completelydifferent machine was required for the organisation of supply.He did not believe that it would be possible so to reorganise theService Departments as to give sufficient weight to the productionside without detriment to their other responsibilities. Moreover,experience showed that to divide responsibility between the service departments led to competition on the part of individual service departments for productive capacity and a disinclination to share the resources of particular firms with other Departments.   The
engineering industry must be handled by a single Department, notonly for the production of warlike stores but for civil production.His experience as Minister of Aircraft Production showed thatthere was every advantage in making the production of aircraft the responsibility of a single Department. A decision bad beentaken by the Coalition Government that civil aviation should betaken away from the Air Ministry. If the production of aircraft were to be put back under the Air Ministry many of the advantages of this decision would be lost. It would, of course, be essential tosecure close contact between user and producer at a high level butthere should be no real difficulty in achieving this.The Minister of Supply and Aircraft Production said that he agreed that it was essential to maintain the closest tie betweenthe Service Departments and the Supply Department. This,however, could be achieved by the establishment of a Supply council which would include representatives of the Service Departmentsconcerned and would be given real responsibility, and by makingcareful arrangements for the closest co-operation at all lower levels. War potential resided in civilian industrial capacity and scientific and industrial leadership and it was essential that thereshould be a single Supply Department with the responsibility fouplanning and developing the industries on which our safety in wardepended. An important aspect of this was the maintenance ofemployment in these vital industries during peace-time, and it wasonly through the agency of a Ministry of Supply that this couldbe done.The Secretary of State for Air said that if the proposal madeby the Lord President were adopted an awkward parliamentary situation would arise. It was his duty under statute to providefor the air defence of the country, but under the arrangements proposed it would be impossible to hold him responsible if themost up-to-date aircraft for this purpose were not being produced.Aircraft were to the R.A.F. what warships were to the Navy and,while he agreed that there would have to be some co-ordinatingauthority to deal with the engineering industry as a whole, he feltthat it was essential that the Air Ministry should be responsiblefor the whole chain of processes from research to production inthe case of aircraft. No other arrangement would ensure the close contact with the Air Staff which was essential.The Vice-Chief of the Air. Staff said that it was essential thatthe R.A.F. should have aircraft of the highest possible quality, andthat to secure this there must be the closest contact between theAir Staff and the scientists, designers and industrialists responsiblefor the production of aircraft so that there was a real integration of military and scientific thought. Unless officers concerned with production worked under the same roof as those concerned withoperations there was bound to be a loss of efficiency, since the user-would be less able to formulate his demands because of not being fully aware of the possibilities. Relations between the Air ministry and the Ministry of Aircraft Production had been good, but, even so, as the war progressed the gap between the user and the producerhad tended to widen and it was inevitable that in peace-time thedividing lines between departments should harden. However freelyofficers were interchanged between the Service Departments andthe Ministry of Supply there would always be a tendency for thosestationed in the Ministry of Supply to get out of touch with the operational requirements.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for War said that both the Secretary of State and he had started with a bias in favourof the establishment of a permanent Ministry of Supply. They had,however, been convinced by the evidence put before them that itwould be preferable to adopt the plan favoured by some of themembers of the Machinery of Government Committee and by the
Minister of Production, the Minister of Supply and the three Ser-vice Ministers in the Coalition Government when they gave evidence to the Committee. The Select Committee on National Expenditurein their memorandum of March 1944, on tank production had recommended that the responsibility for obtaining production of technical instruments of war such as tanks should rest with the WarOffice, and had stated that the transfer of responsibility to the Minis-try of Supply had revealed most serious disadvantages throughoutthe whole field of technical stores. While the arrangement of having a separate Ministry of Supply had worked tolerably well during thewar, thanks to the spirit of co-operation between the War Office andthe Ministry of Supply, the opinion of those in the War Officemost intimately concerned with the working of the arrangementswas that the war-time system could not continue to the publicadvantage. He felt that there was an underlying fallacy in treatingthe Ministry of Supply as a producer department when they were,in fact, directly responsible for production in only a part of thefield and acted rather in the capacity of the middle-man or merchantfor the rest. There would, of course, have to be a joint organisation for carrying out research of a fundamental nature and for theallocation of industrial capacity among competing demands. these functions, however, could best be carried out by a nucleus Ministryof Production organisation, comprising an interdepartmental committee and located in the office of the Minister of Defence.If the War Office were given responsibility for research, design,development and production of warlike stores, they would appoint a first-class officer of wide industrial experience who w^ould be amember of the Army Council and be assisted by the best availablescientific advice and by technical officers of the very highest calibre.The War Office would have their own research department whichwould be in touch both with other Government research departments and with research carried out in non-governmental institutions. Asregards production, they would rely partly on the output of theirown factories and, for the rest, would be able to deal directly withthe private manufacturers on whom they depended.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stressed the difficultieswhich the user had in getting the producer to supply him with the weapons which he needed. These difficulties could be illustrated bythe experience of the War Office in the case of the 25-pdr. gun,and they would inevitably be greater if the Service departments had to operate through the channel of the Ministry of Supply.Technical officers who were put on to production problems inevitablytended to lose touch with the needs of the fighting man and this tendency would be accentuated if they were attached to another department.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, although the First.Sea Lord did not agree with him, his own view was that the right course was that proposed by the Lord President. Responsibility forcertain stores for which the Admiralty had developed special arrangements for research and practical experiment must remain with the Admiralty. Over a large range of common user weapons,however, including aircraft, the argument for the establishmentof a single Supply Department seemed to him to be conclusive. Atthe same time, it would be essential in the organisation of theMinistry of Supply to provide for a Supply Council on which each service Department would be represented by an officer of high rank.Moreover, if the proposed Ministry of Supply were to have responsi-bility for the general control of the engineering industry it. mustbe clearly understood that the work of research and developmentof warlike stores would not be retarded by the undue concentration of the Departments attention on peace-time products.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs stressed theimportance of combining all the productive resources of. the country under a unified direction and said that his experience in the war
of 1914-18 had shown clearly the disadvantages of entrusting theproduction of stores to the Service Departments. If a single Depart-ment had collective responsibility for production there was likely tobe much better collaboration with research scientists and designers.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that, while he was ingeneral agreement with the proposal made by the Lord President,he attached great importance to making provision for the carryingout of a certain amount of research and experiment by the service departments themselves. It was important that the Service Depart-ments should have an opportunity of going some distance towardsworking out their own ideas for new developments in order to enablethem to formulate their demands in a preliminary way. Once thesepreliminary steps had been taken, the work could be furthered ina central establishment. It should be borne in mind if there were only a single research organisation the advantages of competitionmight be lost.The Minister of Civil A aviation said that if he was to fulfil his responsibilities for the development of civil aviation it was essentialthat suitable civil aircraft, both for use by British air lines and forexport should be produced. If the production of aircraft were leftas the responsibility of the Air Ministry, research would not be suffiently devoted to the production of civil aircraft and the creamof the design staffs would tend to be turned on to the productionproblems of military aircraft.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that,while he had given full weight to the points made in favour of retaining in the War Office and the Air Ministry responsibility forthe supply of specialised warlike stores, he felt that the balanceof argument lay with the proposal of the Lord President. Theexperience of two wars had shown the need for the creation of aspecial department capable of mobilising the productive capacityof the nation; and there was undoubtedly a wide range of technicalproducts which could best be covered by a single organisation for research, design and development. The problem of maintainingclose liaison between user and producer arose just as acutely withina single department as between one department and another, andthere was no doubt that, if a determined effort was made to get over this problem, it could be successfully tackled. It would be for theService Ministers and the Minister of Supply to ensure that inthe organisation of their departments the utmost scope was providedfor the profitable two-way exchange of ideas between users andproducers, and he hoped that the Service Ministers would regard the Ministry of Supply as a department intimately linked withtheirs and, in a sense, their offspring. It was essential that adecision on the matter should now be reached, and it seemed clearthat the general sense of the Cabinet was in favour of the proposal made by the Lord President.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the recommendation made by theLord President of the Council in his minute of the14th September to the Prime Minister that a Ministryof Supply responsible inter alia for specialised storesfor the Army and R.A.F. should be a permanent feature of the machinery of Government, on the under-standing that the Ministry would be so organised as to assure the Service Departments of continuous and specific attention to their problems, that there would bea free interchange of actively-minded officers betweenthe Fighting Services and the Ministry of Supply andthat research and development would be so organised asto give full scope to the interests and initiative of theuser departments.
(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would appoint aCommittee of Ministers to consider the detailedorganisation necessary to secure the objects set out in (1)above.(3) Agreed that a statement on the lines of the draft annexed to the Prime Ministers minute of the 5th Septembershould be made, and invited the Prime Minister to settle the final form of the statement in consultation with theLord President of the Council, the Service ministers and the Minister of Supply and Aircraft Production.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,2nd October, 1945.
