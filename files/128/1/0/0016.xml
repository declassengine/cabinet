Parliament.legislative programme.(previous reference:CM. (45) 18thConclusions,Minute 5.)1. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the lord privy Seal (CP. (45) 158) covering the Legislative Programme forthe 1945-46 Session drawn up by the Legislation Committee.The Lord Privy Seal explained that the Bills included in theProgramme had been classified into (i) Essential Bills, such as annual Bills and Bills arising outof the end of hostilities, which must be passed in thecurrent Session. Some of these Bills would be non-controversial.(ii) Important Bills, including those mentioned in the King:sSpeech.(iii) Other Bills, including Bills to which Departments attachedspecial importance and Bills which might proceed ifParliamentary time was available.It was proposed that the Legislation Committee should review theprogramme at intervals of about six weeks in order to assess theprogress made and make any necessary adjustments. Meanwhile,the Committee had urged Ministers who were responsible for bills which had to be introduced early in the Session to make every effort to have them ready as soon as possible.The following points were raised in discussion : (a) It was essential that Departments should press on withthe preparation of the legislation set out in the Programme and forthis purpose it would be desirable if the Legislation Committeewere to review the Programme at monthly intervals.(b) The Minister of Health said that he wished to make a.statement on general housing policy shortly after parliament reassembled and to refer in it to the Acquisition of Land Bill. This.Bill was urgent and he hoped that it would be possible to introduceit at an early date. The Bill would cover the acquisition of landnot only for housing but also for other purposes, and its provisionscould not therefore be included in a Housing Bill.The Cabinet-(1) Gave general approval to the Legislative Programme forthe 1945-46 Session annexed to CP. (45) 158.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to arrange that the legislation committee should review the Programme at monthly intervals.Prisonersof War.(previous reference:CM. (45) 13thConclusions.Minute 3.)2. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Secre-tary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP. (45) 163) examining theposition in relation to the repatriation of Italian prisoners of war.The Soviet Government had recently announced that those in theU.S.S.B. were to be &quot;liberated&quot; and repatriated as soon as theavailable transport permitted, and General de Gaulle had also informed Signor Nenni that Italian prisoners of war in France and north Africa were in principle to be repatriated, though there mightbe some delay on account of transport difficulties. German prisoners were being released to their homes and Count Carandini had madepressing representations to the Foreign Secretary about thedeclining morale of the prisoners in this country. In these circum-stances, while there could be no repatriation from this country before the harvest was safely gathered and while our demobilisation and redeployment schemes would have a prior claim on shipping for some time to come, the Foreign Secretary wished to be authorisedto inform the Italian Government that we agreed in principle thatrepatriation might begin in the near future, and he asked for theconcurrence of the Cabinet in the terms of a communication, to bemade to Count Carandini, set out in paragraph 5 of CP. (45) 163.The following points were made in discussion : (a) The Minister of Labour suggested, and the Minister ofState agreed, that the draft communication to the Italian Govern-ment should be amended by the substitution in its first sentence for[30754-1] b 2
the words &quot; Italian prisoners of war in this country shall be repatriated to Italy &quot; of the words &apos;&apos; the repatriation of italian prisoners of war in this country to Italy shall begin.&quot; CountCarandini had made it clear that he would be satisfied if someItalian prisoners of war began to move before Christmas.(b) The Secretary of State for India suggested, and&apos;the cabinet agreed, that the Government of India should be informed in thesame way and at the same time as the Dominions governments before any public announcement was authorised.After further discussion, the Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs and invited him, subject to priorreference to the Dominions Governments and the Govern-ment of India, to proceed as proposed in CP. (45) 163.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs andthe Secretary of State for India to inform the dominions governments and the Government of India before any public announcement was made.Prisoners 3.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theof War. Minister of Labour and National Service (CP. (45) 172) regardingEmployment    the employment of prisoners of war in Great Britain,of German The Memorandum proposed that the continued employment ofand Italian prisoners should be determined in the light of the man-powerPrisoners position in Great Britain and should be kept under periodicalof War. review.  The Inter-Departmental Committee on the Employment of(Previous Prisoners of War should be instructed to arrange for the transferEeference: Qf prisoners at a steady rate over the coming eight months from allCM. (45) 13th other employments to employment in one or other of the following : Conclusions, (i) Agriculture, including forestry.Minute 3.) (ii) Building and civil engineering.(iii) Removal of stores from buildings required for other purposes.(iv) Employment by the Service Departments on work whichwould otherwise have to be done by soldiers, sailors orairmen.As an experiment, arrangements should be made to billet a small number of German prisoners on farms, and an early report shouldbe made on the result of this experiment. The arrangements underwhich 225,000 German prisoners were held on the Continent against future needs in this country should be continued, subject to review in six months&apos; time, or earlier at the request of the Secretary ofState for War, if the continued holding of these prisoners wascausing serious difficulty. The possibility of putting to work ardentNazis, and other German prisoners hitherto deemed unemployable,who were held in this country, should be examined by the Depart-ments concerned, and the War Office should not, pending further instructions, implement the decision which had been reached by theWar Cabinet at their meeting on the 18th May (W.M.&apos; (45)62nd Conclusions, Minute 3) that German prisoners of war, whoby reason of their extreme Nazi views could not easily be put towork in the United Kingdom, should be returned to Germany.It was explained in discussion that at a recent meeting of the reparations Sub-Committee of the Overseas Reconstruction Com-mittee (O.R.C. (R) (45) 1st Meeting) agreement had been reached that the needs for prisoner-of-war labour in Great Britain, as atpresent known, could almost certainly be met from prisoners of warin our hands or, failing that, by a small transfer from Canada. Inthese circumstances it was felt to be desirable that, before any decision was reached on the proposal that the employments on whichprisoners of war should be engaged should be restricted to those setout in paragraph 11 of CP. (45) 172, there should be a further review of requirements in order to see whether they could not be
met from the number of prisoners available. Meanwhile, thepresent arrangements under which 225,000&apos; German prisoners of war were held on the Continent against possible future needs in thiscountry should be continued.There was also general agreement with the proposal that german prisoners of war who held extreme Nazi views should notbe returned to Germany.Further points in discussion were : -(a) The Minister of Fuel and Power] said that it was essentialthat prisoner-of-war labour should be available for gas works, for coal distribution and for open-cast coal workings.(b) The Minister of Food drew attention to the importance ofprisoner-of-war labour in the food processing industries in whichover 5,000 Italian prisoners were at present employed. Untilsubstitutes could be trained to take their place he could not agreeto the withdrawal of these prisoners, and it should be borne in mind that there might be difficulties in employing German prisoners in factories.(c) The Minister of Works said that it would be essential to useprisoner-of-war labour in some of the building materials industries,as well as in building and civil engineering.(d) The Minister of State suggested that arrangements shouldbe made to send to the Ruhr any miners among the German prisonersof war in this country.It was pointed out, however, that the number of miners amongprisoners of war was likely to be very small, and that if prisonerswho held extreme Nazi views were sent to the Ruhr the result mightbe to stir up trouble. For this reason the matter seemed to require futher investigation before any decision could be taken.(e) The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for War saidthat the British authorities in Germany were embarrassed by having to hold so many prisoners of war against possible future needs, andthat requests had been made by the Russian and French authorities that some of the prisoners of war now held should be lent to them.(f) The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Warpointed out that the movement of prisoners of war to or from thiscountry would involve demands on shipping which might affect therate of demobilisation and leave arrangements.(g) The War Office estimated that if more than 400,000prisoners of war were retained in this country the release of menfrom the Army would be delayed owing to the need to provide adequate guards for the prisoners.(h) The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of A griculture andFisheries said that it was estimated that about 200,000 prisoners ofwar would be required for agriculture in 1946. Italian prisonersof war should not be repatriated at such a rate as to affect the potato and sugar beet harvests, which, in effect, continued until about the end of the year.(i) The Minister of State pointed out that once a Peace treaty had been concluded with Italy we should have no right to keepItalians as prisoners of war.(j) The Minister of State said that the Foreign secretary proposed to submit proposals to the Cabinet with regard to there patriation of a certain number of anti-Nazi prisoners of warwhose presence in Germany would be helpful to us.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of Labour and National Service, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer andin the light of up-to-date estimates of the numbers ofprisoners of war required for employment in this countryand of the numbers already in this, country or who could
be transferred from Germany or Canada, to give furtherconsideration to the question whether prisoners of warneed be restricted to the employments referred to inparagraph 11 of CP. (45) 172, and to report to theCabinet.(2) Agreed that, pending consideration of the report referredto in (1), 225,000 German prisoners should be held onthe Continent against future needs in this country, andthat any requests from the French or the Russians forthe loan of prisoners of. war should be refused.(3) Agreed that the Foreign Office, the War Office and theMinistry of Labour and National Service should jointlyexamine the possibility of putting to work in GreatBritain ardent Nazis and other German prisoners of war at present deemed unemployable, and that, meanwhile,no steps should be taken by the War Office to return toGermany prisoners of war who by reason of their extremeNazi views could not easily be put to work in the UnitedKingdom.Man-Power. 4.   In connection with the discussion, recorded in Minute 3Employment above, on the employment of prisoners of war in this countrySituation. attention was drawn to the difficulties which would arise if prisonersof war were employed in large numbers in this country at a timewhen as a result of the failure to absorb into employment labourreleased from munitions production there was a considerable amountof unemployment in many areas and when large numbers of menwere still being held in the Services. Stress was laid on theimportance of taking all possible steps to ensure that employmentwas found without delay for any redundant labour, and it wassuggested that, where necessary, consideration should be given tothe transfer of workers from one area to another. For this purposefull use should be made of the Government hostels which had beenprovided in connection with munitions production.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that,although there were some pockets of unemployment, particularly inLanarkshire and South Wales, the general situation was not dis-quieting and the change-over from munitions production to other forms of employment was, on the whole, proceeding well. Theunemployment figures tended to be swollen by the inclusion of women who had taken up war work but who would not really be in thepeace-time labour market. He would submit to the Cabinet a full report on the situation, including the possibility of meeting theproblem by the transfer of labour. With regard to the use ofGovernment hostels, the National Service Hostels Corporation were finding difficulty in retaining their staff since they could give themno definite guarantee of future employment. As a result, however,of proposals which he had put before the Lord Presidents Com-mittee (L.P. (45) 27th Meeting, Minute 4) he would now be ableto give the necessary assurance.The Cabinet-Took  note that the Minister of Labour and NationalService would submit at an early date a full report onthe general employment position.Relationswith Eire.(previous reference:W.M.(45)24thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Secre-tary of State for Dominion Affairs (CP. (45) 152) on relations withEire, to which was attached a survey of the position by Sir JohnMaffey, the United Kingdom representative to Eire, and a note onthe salient points in the relations of this country with Eire during recent years.
travel facilities.Relaxation ofRestrictionson TravelOverseas.(previous reference:CM. (45) 17thConclusions,Minute 1.)6. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (45) 166) proposing a further relaxation of therestrictions on the departure of British subjects and aliens for overseas destinations.The Home Secretary recalled that on the 24th July certain proposals had been approved in principle under which the require-ment of an exit permit for each journey would be abolished andreliance would be placed instead on the endorsement of Britishpassports as valid for specific destinations, as a signal to the immi-gration staff at the ports that departure for any of these destina-tions was duly authorised. Now that Japan had surrendered therewas no need to maintain a security check in the interests of Alliedoperations, and it seemed undesirable to attempt to control entry into other parts of the Empire or to Protectorates or mandated territory by checks on departure from this country. He accordingly proposed that British passports should in future ordinarily be issuedwith the traditional British Empire endorsement and that the atten-tion of travellers should be drawn by an enclosure in the passportto the need for obtaining a visa, entry permit or military permitfor those parts of the Empire where admission still needed to be specially controlled. Any security check necessary would underthis system be applied at the stage of application for visa, entryThe Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that he had thought it well to bring Sir John Maffey&apos;s interesting review beforethe Cabinet at this stage. We were at present on pretty strong-ground in relation to Eire if we wisely used the advantage of ourposition, and the Eire Government was conscious that they on their side were not in a very good position. In his judgment, there was much to be gained by a policy of quiet and friendly relations withoutany ostentation, particularly so far as the Trade Account was con-cerned. He would like, subject to the approval of the Cabinet, to pursue that general policy.Since his paper had been circulated, certain soundings hadbeen taken of him on behalf of the Eire Government. There was reason in the outcome to believe that they were anxious to cometo International Conferences with us if we were willing to receive them; and in particular the suggestion had been made thatMr. Lemass should visit this country for informal discussions on civil Aviation. The Minister of Civil Aviation was agreeable tothis and he (the Dominions Secretary) thought that there was every-thing to be said, while avoiding forcing the pace, for responding to advances of this character.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he favoured thegeneral line proposed by the Dominions Secretary. The fact thatEire was in the sterling area was of a certain convenience to us atthe moment.The Minister of Food hoped that the question of possibleexports of food to the United Kingdom would be looked into.The Home Secretary said that the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries w^ould wish to be associated with any trade discussions with Eire which might take place as a result of the proposals of theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs.In discussion there was general support for the broad lineof policy in relation to Eire proposed by the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs.The Prime Minister suggested, and the Cabinet agreed^ That we should in the first place proceed with the proposed conversations with Mr. Lemass. These could be followed,if that was thought desirable, by departmental discussions as to the next stage.
or military permit. Under the proposals approved on the24th July, applications by persons in the call-up age group (18 to 30)were to be submitted to the Ministry of Labour and NationalService before passports were issued and it was proposed to retainthis check for the present. The Home Office could not, however,undertake to scrutinise statements made by applicants for pass-ports as to their age. Agreement had been reached on the principles on which the Priority Passage Board would operate and the wayseemed clear for making an announcement of the simplifiedprocedure. This announcement, which should, if possible, be made about the 1st October, should be accompanied by a strong warning that no additional transport for long sea voyages was likely to beavailable. Any decision to refuse travel documents or leave to embark on security grounds would be the responsibility of the HomeSecretary, while refusals of passports on man-power grounds wouldhave to be defended by the Minister of Labour and NationalService.The Cabinet Approved the proposals for the relaxation of restrictionson the departure of British subjects and aliens for over-seas destinations set out in CP. (45) 166.7. The Home Secretary said that there appeared to bea possibility that William Joyce might be found not guilty of thecharges brought against him, on the ground that he had at no timeowed any allegiance to the British Crown. To meet this contingencyhe had thought it right to have in readiness a direction providingfor his internment as an undesirable enemy alien. The existenceof this direction would enable Joyce to be held in custody until adecision could be reached as to his disposal.It was pointed out in discussion that it would be advisable to ascertain what would be the attitude of the United StatesGovernment if it should be established that Joyce was an Americancitizen. It was also suggested that, whether Joyce proved to beof German or of United States nationality, the best course mightbe to return him to Germany, where he could be dealt with either as a German prisoner of war or as a displaced person.The Cabinet Approved of the action taken by the Home Secretary and invited him to take steps to ascertain what would be theattitude of the United States Government if it were established that Joyce was of United States nationality.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,18th September, 1945.
