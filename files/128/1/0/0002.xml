Parliament. 2.   The Chief Whip said that, in view of the heavy programmeParliamentary of Government legislation, it would be impossible to find time for time. Private Members&apos; Bills or Motions during the current Session.   In1939 the Labour Party had suggested that Private Members shouldbe allowed.to present Bills in the usual way, although no time was set aside for them and they would make no progress unless theywere taken up by the Government. It was doubtful, however,whether even this compromise would be feasible in the present session.In discussion there was general support for the view that theGovernment must take all the time of Private Members duringthe present Session; and that there would be no advantage inputting forward the compromise arrangement suggested by theLabour Party in 1939.&apos;&apos;., The Lord President of the Council recalled that in theproposals for the reform of Parliamentary procedure which hadbeen put forward by the Machinery of Government Committee(W.P. (44) 424) it had been suggested that throughout the recon-struction period it would be necessary for the Government to take all Private Members&apos; time. It was important that any statement made at the present stage should imply no guarantee that theGovernment would restore Private Members&apos; time in future sessions of this Parliament.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposal of  the  Chief  Whip  that theGovernment should take all Private Members&apos; time during the current Session.(2) Took note  that the  Prime Minister  would  make  anannouncement to this effect in the course of the debate on the Address.[ 30662-5]Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord PresidentKing&apos;s Speech 0f the Council (CP. (45) 98) covering a revised draft of the King&apos;soh the Opening-Speech.&apos;&quot;(Previous ^ following modifications of the draft were approved inEeference:        discussion :-CM. (45) 18th (a) A passage dealing with the atomic bomb should be addedConclusions, to paragraph 3.Minute 5. (&amp;) A reference to the aid received in the Burma campaignfrom the United States and China should be inserted inparagraph 5.(c) A new paragraph should be added after paragraph 5dealing with the Russian declaration of war on Japan.This paragraph should include a sentence in substitution for the last sentence of paragraph 5.(d) A new paragraph should be inserted after paragraph 9drawing attention to the continuing shortages of houses,food, clothing and fuel which would have to be faced.(e) The last sentence of paragraph 14 should  include a reference to legislation dealing with the question ofcompensation and betterment and should omit the reference to legislation on the subject of national parks.A number of other drafting amendments were adopted.The Cabinet-Invited the Prime Minister and the Lord President of theCouncil to approve on their behalf a final draft of the speech taking account of the points raised in discussion.
Manufacture 3,   The Cabinet considered a Memorandum by the Presidentof Mosquito of the Board of Trade (CP. (45) 101) regarding the desire of theAircraft in French Government to manufacture Mosquito VI aircraft inFrance. France.The President of the Board of Trade explained that this project had previously been vetoed by the United States Govern-ment on the grounds that it was a post-war enterprise, that theycould not agree to our supplying the French with materials for thepurpose from our Lend-Lease supplies, and that French man-power would be better employed on work directly connected withthe European war. Now that the war in Europe was over, these objections were no longer valid, and he proposed that the FrenchGovernment should now be allowed to proceed with this project.He suggested that we should not again consult the United StatesGovernment, who might raise other objections, but should inform them that we had decided to give these facilities to the French.The Secretary of State for Air said that his advisers took theview that the course proposed by the President of the Board ofTrade, might have unfavourable reactions on deliveries from theUnited States of aircraft, engines and components required by us for the Japanese war. They would therefore prefer that the UnitedStates Government should be informed that in the changed circum-stances we now proposed to allow the French to proceed with this project unless the United States Government still saw objectionto it.The President of the Board of Trade said that no Lend-Leasematerials were required for the manufacture of this particularaircraft; and he did not consider that the course which he proposed would endanger the American deliveries required for our ownmilitary programme. He was anxious that these facilities shouldbe given to the French without delay, as American companies were already trying to sell combat aircraft to the French.In further discussion, reference was made to the importanceof avoiding at this stage any unnecessary difficulties with the UnitedStates Government over Lend-Lease supplies. It was the view ofthe Cabinet that, before action was taken on the lines proposed bythe President of the Board of Trade, there should be further discussion between the Departments primarily concerned in orderto establish beyond dispute whether any Lend-Lease materials would be used in the manufacture of these aircraft, and to obtainthe best available judgment on the question whether the grant ofthese facilities to the French would endanger American deliveriesfor our military programme or would otherwise prejudice ourrelations with the United States Government on Lend-Leasequestions.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to arrangefor immediate consultations to be held on these pointsbetween representatives of his Department, the Treasury,the Air Ministry and the Ministry of aircraft production.(2) Agreed that the result of these consultations should be reported to the Prime Minister, who, if he were satis-fied that there was a sufficient measure of agreementbetween the Departments, would authorise action toproceed on the lines proposed in CP. (45) 101. Other-wise, the question would be brought forward for further discussion by the Cabinet.
4.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that a___large quantity of German political documents and diplomaticarchives had come into the possession of the British and UnitedStates authorities; and questions were arising about the disclosure of these to other Allied Governments.The immediate question was whether use might be made ofthese documents for the trial of war criminals. On this, he proposedthat selections from the documents should be made available to thequadripartite authority responsible for the prosecution of the major war criminals; but the Foreign Office would retain discretion todecide which of the documents should be disclosed for this purpose.The next question was whether the Soviet Government and theFrench Government should be informed of the documents in ourcustody and offered access on a reciprocal basis to the joint Anglo-American collections. On this, he proposed to invite the UnitedStates Government to join in making such an offer to the Soviet andFrench Governments. It would, however, be a condition of any agreement that any of the four Governments should retain&quot;discretion to disclose any documents over which they had rights ofdiscovery or custody to any other Allied Government that might ask for them, e.g., in connection with proceedings against its ownquislings.Finally, it would be necessary to reach agreement on a policy regarding the publication of these German documents. It was,however, desirable that before deciding the question of generalpublication we should wait until we had fuller knowledge of the contents of the documents; and on this point a final decision couldbe deferred.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals of the Foreign Secretary as setout above.5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theCouncil of Foreign Ministers, at their first meeting early in Septem-ber, would discuss the treatment of Japan after her defeat. It was urgently necessary that His Majesty&apos;s Government should definetheir policy in this matter. Various problems were involved which required detailed study; and it would be convenient if these couldbe remitted to a Committee of officials representing the various departments concerned. During the Coalition Government therehad been a Far Eastern Committee, composed of officials, with theParliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs inthe Chair. It would be helpful if this Committee could be reconstituted and invited to proceed at once with the considerationof the problems to which he had referred.The Cabinet-Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for theearly appointment of a Standing Committee on far eastern problems.6. The Home Secretary said that it was proposed to hold a world Youth Conference in London in the near future, and hehad been asked whether facilities could be granted to enable some300 delegates to come to this country from abroad for the purposeof attending this Conference. His predecessor had been unwilling to grant these facilities -mainly because the Conference was saidto be under Communist influence or control, but partly because the admission of so large a number of foreign visitors would place an unnecessary additional strain on food supplies in this country.
The Home Secretary said that the Ministry of Education hadbeen favourably disposed towards the objects of this Conference,and he would himself be glad if the Conference could be held inthis country rather than elsewhere. He did not think there was strong evidence in support of the suggestion that the conference was under Communist influence, and the number of foreign visitorswould not be so large as to constitute any serious addition to our food problems.The President of the Board of Trade said that he had beenpersonally interested in the arrangements for the holding of this conference, and he was satisfied that the Committee responsiblefor its organisation was not under Communist influence or control.The Lord President of the Council said that he would not havefavoured the holding of this Conference in this country while thewar in Europe was still continuing. In present circumstances,however, he saw no reason to maintain the earlier refusal of facilities.The Cabinet-Agreed that there should be no general refusal of facilities to enable persons to come to this country from abroad toattend the World Youth Conference in London.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,9th August, 1945.
