Future ofItalianColonies.(previous reference:CM. (45) 14thConclusions,Minute 3.)1. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the PrimeMinister (CP. (45) 144) setting out certain considerations withregard to the future of the Italian Colonies.In a preliminary discussion the following were the main points raised.Against the proposal that His Majesty&apos;s Government should assume trusteeship over Cyrenaica and a &apos;&apos; Greater Somalia &apos;&apos; thefollowing arguments were advanced-. 1(a) The arguments on which the Overseas reconstruction committee had reached their provisional conclusion that HisMajesty&apos;s Government should claim the trusteship of Cyrenaica anda Greater Somalia were very largely strategic. The developmentof air warfare and the advent of the atomic bomb threw doubt on the validity of the strategic grounds for retaining control of these territories.(b) In the post-war world it would be impossible for the BritishEmpire to stand alone and it would have to be defended primarily by its membership of the United Nations Organisation. Our proper course was, therefore, to seek to make the Organisation effectiverather than to try to strengthen our position by securing bases inthe Mediterranean and Middle East.(c) The mandates entrusted to us after the last war had been regarded as a mere expansion of the British Empire, and ourassumption of trusteeship over Cyrenaica and the Greater Somaliawould be looked on in the same light. In these circumstances, would it not be preferable to call on the United States or one of the scandinavian countries to undertake the burden of trusteeship inthese cases 1 Alternatively the experiment of an internationaladministration in Somalia might be tried. Although condominiaelsewhere had been failures, it did not follow that a condominiumwould not be successful in Somalia.(d) The assumption of trusteeship over Cyrenaica and GreaterSomalia wotdd impose a heavy burden on the British taxpayer.(e) His Majesty&apos;s Government would be involved in difficult questions arising out of claims for self-government from these territories.On the other hand, the following arguments were advanced : &apos;(/) The changes due to the advent of the atomic bomb and theestablishment of a United Nations Organisation would not be effective for some time and, so far as concerned the immediatefuture, the strategic arguments in favour of the retention of controlover the territories were strong.(g) The Chiefs of Staff considered that, from the military pointof view, it was essential that Great Britain should be the trusteefor Cyrenaica; and our bitter experience during the war, when wesuffered heavy losses and great inconvenience owing to the closing of the Mediterranean route, showed how important it was to retain control of the Mediterranean.(h) It was extremely doubtful whether it would be possible to persuade the United States Government to undertake responsibilities in the areas concerned and there would be enormous administrative difficulties in setting up any form of condominium. If we did not undertake the trusteeship ourselves the result might be that the territories would revert to Italy, which would create greatdissatisfaction in the Arab world. There was also the danger thatour failure to assume the trusteeship would open the way for russian penetration into the Middle East area.(i) The proposal for a greater Somalia had been put forwardvery largely on economic grounds, and if a single territory wereformed out of the existing separate units there would be a far better chance of the emergence of a self-supporting entity. &apos;(j) In discussion it was also suggested that Cyrenaica might bea suitable place for the Jewish settlement. It was pointed out,however, that this would be. muchresented by the. Senussi, and mighthave serious repercussions, throughout the Arab world.
2. At their meeting on the 30th August the Cabinet had invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to circulate the reportof the Soulbury Commission and the minutes of the meeting of theColonial Affairs Committee at which it had been considered, witha view to their resuming the discussion of the report by the colonial affairs Committee (CP. (45) 132) on the Ceylon Constitution.The Cabinet now had before them -(i) a memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies(CP. (45) 138) circulating copies of the Soulbury report and of the minutes of the relative meeting of the colonial affairs Committee (C. (45) 1st Meeting);(ii) a revised version of the report by the Colonial AffairsCommittee on the Ceylon Constitution (CP. (45) 132(Revise) ).It was explained that in 1943 a declaration had been made byHis Majesty&apos;s Government with regard to Constitutional Reform in ceylon in the terms of the Annex to CP. (45) 132 (Revise). this declaration had invited the Board of Ministers to formulate a constitutional scheme, on the understanding that acceptance of thescheme would depend on its being in full compliance with the termsof the declaration and on its subsequent approval by three-quarters of all the members of the State Council of Ceylon. The ministers had formulated a scheme, but, when the Soulbury Commission wasappointed, they had withdrawn their scheme and had refused togive evidence to the Commission. The Commission had, however,had private discussion with Mr. Senanayake, the Vice-Chairmanof the Ceylon Board of Ministers and Leader of the State Council,and had reached the conclusion that his co-operation would be essential in securing acceptance of their proposals for reform.Mr. Senanayake had accordingly been invited to come to this countryfor discussions on the Ceylon constitutional position, and had beenfurnished with a copy of the Soulbury Report. He had now been inthis country for over a month and it was desirable that thediscussions with him should now be undertaken. Advantage shouldalso be taken of the Viceroy&apos;s presence in this country to acquainthim with the general position in regard to the recommendations inthe Report and the action proposed on them.A special point arose in regard to the condition in the 1943declaration that the acceptance of any constitutional scheme would depend upon its subsequent approval by three-quarters of themembers of the State Council of Ceylon. This stipulation had beenmade because it was feared that the Ministers, in formulating their scheme, would ignore the views of minorities. What His Majesty&apos;sGovernment  now  had  before them,   however,  was   a  scheme[30725-1] b 2Ceylon.(previous reference:CM. (45) 26thConclusions,Minute 3.)The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, while he- 38himself was generally in favour of the conclusions reached at themeeting of the Overseas Reconstruction Committee on the30th August (O.R.C. (45) 4th Meeting), he desired to make it clearthat it had not been intended that these should be regarded as final.In the first place, it had been intended to obtain the views of theDominion Governments and the Government of India, while,concurrently, the Chancellor of the Exchequer would give considera-tion to the financial aspects of the proposals. He had also proposedto discuss the proposals with the British representatives in thevarious Middle Eastern countries, who had been recalled for consultation during the following week. Thereafter he had intendedto bring the matter before the Cabinet.The Cabinet Agreed that the issues raised in the discussion would befurther considered on a later occasion and took note thatthe Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary would consult asto the procedure to be adopted.
formulated by the Soulbury Commission after full consultation withthe minorities, and it was accordingly suggested in paragraph 10 of cp. (45) 132 (Revise) that, in the discussions with Mr. Senanayake,it should be open to the Secretary of State for the Colonies toindicate that His Majesty&apos;s Government would not necessarily insist on this condition.In discussion the question was raised whether, if the Secretaryof State for the Colonies undertook conversations withMr. Senanayake, the Government would be regarded as beingcommitted to the proposals in the Soulbury Report. It was pointedout that the Cabinet had not yet had a full opportunity of considering these proposals and that some of the recommendations fin particular the proposals for the selection of the Second Chamber seemed open to criticism.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that the recom-mendations with regard to the Second Chamber were similar tothose put forward in His Majesty&apos;s Governments statement ofpolicy with regard to Burma (Cmd. 6635), and that the second chamber was primarily designed in order to safeguard the positionof minorities. He would, however, make it clear, in his conversa-tions with Mr. Senanayake, that the Government were not committed to the conclusions in the Soulbury Report and that they were to beregarded merely as a basis for discussion.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Secretary of State for the Colonies to enterinto confidential discussions with Mr. Senanayake on thebasis of the Soulbury Report, on the understanding thatit would be made clear that His Majesty&apos;s. Governmentwere not committed to the proposals in the Report andthat, after the discussions had taken place, the Secretaryof State for the Colonies would again report to theCabinet.(2) Agreed that the Secretary of State for the Colonies shouldhave discretion to inform Mr. Senanayake that HisMajesty&apos;s Government would not necessarily insist onholding to the three-quarters majority in the Declara-tion of 1943.(3) Agreed that Lord Wavell should be acquainted with thegeneral position in regard to the recommendations of the Soulbury Commission and the action proposed on them.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies (CP. (45) 133) submitting proposals regarding the future policy of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin Malaya and Borneo.The Secretary of State for the Colonies recalled that, at their meeting on the 31st May, 1944 (W.M. (44) 70th Conclusions,Minute 3), the War Cabinet had provisionally approved for planning purposes proposals for the establishment of a Malayan Union witha central legislature. For this purpose it would be necessary to makefresh treaties with the rulers of the Malay States and it was nowproposed that Sir Harold MacMichael should go to Malaya in orderto conclude these treaties.With regard to Borneo, it had been proposed that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should assume direct responsibility for the administra-tion of North Borneo, which had hitherto been independentlyadministered by the British North Borneo (Chartered) Company;that the island of Labuan should be integrated with North Borneo,and that full jurisdiction in Brunei and Sarawak should be cededto His Majesty by their rulers. In the case of Sarawak it was recommended that the new treaty should secure the acceptance by theRajah of a Resident British Adviser. Negotiations with the british north Borneo (Chartered) Company were proceeding satisfactorily
and no difficulties seemed likely to arise with&apos; regard to Labuan andBrunei. The Rajah of Sarawak had shown great reluctance toenter into discussions, and the Secretary of State for the Coloniesfelt that he should now be authorised to tell him that, unless anagreement satisfactory to His Majesty&apos;s Government could bereached within a period of two months, His Majesty&apos;s government must consider what course they must take to ensure that they werein a position to have the necessary authority in the internal as wellas the external policies of the Sarawak administration to carry outthe responsibility for the territory which they bore to the british parliament and in the international field. He would also desire toinform the Rajah that neither he nor his Government would be permitted to return to Sarawak until arrangements satisfactory toHis Majesty&apos;s Government had been made.In discussion there was general approval for the proposal that sir Harold MacMichael should now take up the question of negotiating new treaties with the Malay rulers. With regard to theposition in Sarawak, the question was raised whether it would notbe desirable to take this opportunity,to bring to an end the rule ofthe Rajah of Sarawak, subject to the payment of compensation on an equitable basis. In any event it was felt that, during the period ofmilitary occupation, we should have no hesitation in sendingobservers into Sarawak.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he hoped that theTreasury would be kept in close touch with the negotiations both with regard to Malaya and with regard to Borneo. He understoodthat the negotiations carried out by Sir Harold MacMichael would&quot;be purely political, but he thought that consideration should also begiven to pooling the financial resources of the Malay States.The Cabinet-(1) Confirmed the policy as regards Malaya set out inparagraphs 2 and 3 of CP. (45) 133 and authorised theappointment of Sir Harold MacMichael and his visit to malaya to conclude new treaties with the rulers of theseveral States.(2) Approved the proposed changes in the administration ofLabuan and in the matter of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment&apos;s jurisdiction in Brunei.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to consider,in the light of the Agreements of 1880 and 1941, whetherit would not be possible to bring to an end the rule of theRajah of Sarawak.Manufacture 4.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theof Aircraft in Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Secretary of State for france. Air, the President of the Board of Trade and the Minister of Supply(Previous        and Aircraft Production (CP. (45) 134) making proposals for the reference:      grant of assistance to the French in rebuilding their aircraftCM. (45) 19th   industry.   Annexed to the memorandum was a list of the facilitiesConclusions,     which it was proposed to make available at once to the French.Minute 3.) It was explained that one of these proposals, viz., that theFrench should be allowed to manufacture Mosquito VI&apos;s, hadalready been before the Cabinet (CM. (45) 19th Conclusions,Minute 3), and that the question then raised with regard to Lend-Lease complications had now been satisfactorily cleared. TheFrench, however, were also interested in the later development, viz.,the de Havilland Hornet, and, in view of the longVdelay which had occurred since the Mosquito project was put forward, it was feltthat they should be allowed to negotiate with the de HavillandCompany for the follow-on manufacture of Hornets, subject to thesettlement of any residual Lend-Lease issues. A Mission wasarriving from France about the 10th September and it was desirablethat the necessary authority to make facilities available to the
French should be given at once. There would be no question of our having to finance these operations, which would be paid for by theFrench themselves.The Secretary of State for Air said that he hoped that inmaking facilities available, Departments should not be tied downstrictly to the terms of the Annex to CP. (45) 134.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the United States Government should beinformed that we intended to disclose information ofinterest to the French aircraft industry up to and including that graded &apos;&apos; Secret &apos;&apos; with certain specifiedexceptions to be notified- to them; and that the UnitedStates Government should be asked to agree that, whereequipment of interest to the French aircraft indusrty was of combined origin, release of information about itshould be on the same basis.(2) Approved the grant of the facilities listed in the annex to CP. (45) 134 to the French, on the understanding that departments should have a reasonable latitude to vary the facilities granted.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,3rd September, 1945.
