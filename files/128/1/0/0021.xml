Expiry ofEmergencypowers(Defence)Acts.1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (45) 201) regarding the expiry of the emergency powers (Defence) Acts.In discussion, the Minister of Labour and National Servicedrew attention to the proposal in paragraph 9 of the memorandum that the Restoration of Pre-war Trade Practices Act, 1942, shouldbe continued in force until 31st December, 1946. While he washimself disposed to agree with this proposal, he recalled that thisAct had been introduced after consultation with representatives ofemployers and workers; and he suggested that similar consultations should be held before any proposal was put before Parliamentregarding the date on which the Act should expire.After a short discussion, the Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Emergency Powers (Defence) Acts shouldbe allowed to expire on the 24th February, 1946.(2) Agreed that on the Committee stage of the Supplies and services (Transitional Powers) Bill an amendment should be moved on behalf of the Government to extendClause 1 of the Bill to cover demobilisation and resettle-ment and the disposal of surplus material.(3) Agreed in principle that an Emergency Laws (transitional provisions) Bill on the lines of the draft annexed to CP.(45) 201, should be introduced in order to continue inforce certain Defence Regulations which would berequired after the 26th February, 1946, and could notbe continued under the Supplies and Services (Transi-tional Powers) Bill. This measure would also providefor the continuance of certain war-time Acts whoseduration was at present linked with that of the Emer-gency Powers (Defence) Acts; and would make perma-nent a number of minor amendments of the general lawnow dependent on Defence Regulations.(4) Authorised the Home Secretary to announce the decisionsset out in (1) to (3) above in the course of the debate on the Second Reading of the Supplies and Services(Transitional Powers) Bill.(5) Invited the Minister of Labour and National Service to consult representatives of employers and workers regard-ing the proposal that the Restoration of Pre-war trade practices Act, 1942, should be continued in force untilthe 31st December, 1946.(6) Invited the Home Secretary to submit to the legislation committee for detailed examination the text of the Emer-gency Laws (Transitional Provisions) Bill and thereafter to arrange, subject to (5) above, for its early introduction into Parliament.war criminals.(previous reference:CM. (45) 1stConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Cabinet were informed that the Russian and UnitedStates representatives on the inter-Allied Commission for the prosecution of war crimes had proposed that the German GeneralStaff should be indicted as a criminal organisation so that, if thecase against the German General Staff as a whole were proved,individual members of that Staff could thereafter be dealt with as war criminals on proof only that they were members of that organisation.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the UnitedKingdom Government had been willing that Generals Keitel andJodl should be indicted individually as war criminals; but it wasa different matter to prefer an indictment against the GermanGeneral Staff as a whole. The defence was likely to be put forward that it was their duty to carry out the orders of their Government,and that any charge should rather be preferred against their political superiors.[30754-6] b 2
In discussion it was pointed out that under the terms of theWar Crimes Agreement a decision to prefer an indictment couldbe taken by a majority of the representatives on the inter-allied commission. If, as stated, the Russian and United States repre-sentatives were insisting on this course, and the French representa-tive was also disposed to favour it, there was nothing to be gained by instructing the British representative to oppose it.The Cabinet (1) Instructed the Attorney-General to offer no objection to theproposal to prefer an indictment against the GermanGeneral Staff as a whole.The Foreign Secretary said that in the preparation of theindictments for the war crimes trials at Nuremberg a further pointhad arisen which he wished to bring to the notice of the Cabinet.The indictments prepared against individuals specified the place at which the crime was alleged to have been committed; and, in thecase of crimes alleged to have been committed in the Baltic States,the Russian representative on the Commission was insisting onusing in the indictment a description which implied that the baltic states formed part of the Soviet Union. The Foreign Secretaryrecalled that, in recent discussions at the Council of foreign ministers about the repatriation of Soviet nationals, the Britishand United States Delegations had resisted the claim of the soviet delegation that all persons formerly resident in territories claimed by the Soviet Union should be regarded as having acquired auto-matically Soviet citizenship. A resolution proposed by the soviet delegation had been withdrawn on the basis that these questionsof national status were left over for discussion through the diplo-matic channel. It would be unfortunate, therefore, if in the description of these territories in the war crimes indictments weused language implying acceptance of the Soviet claim that theBaltic States had been included within the Soviet Union.In discussion it was pointed out that the Soviet representative on the Commission had no authority to vary this description withoutfurther reference to Moscow; and that, if he were compelled to refer to Moscow, it would be impossible to complete the preparation of theindictments in time to enable the trials to open at Nuremberg onthe date already arranged.In these circumstances, the Cabinet *(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform the Soviet Govern-ment through the diplomatic channel that our acqui-escence in the description of these places proposed by theRussian representative on the inter-Allied commission for the prosecution of war crimes was not to be regardedas implying that His Majesty&apos;s Government recognised the inclusion of these territories within the Soviet Union;and invited the Attorney-General to make this position clear to the Russian representative on the inter-allied commission.IndianMinister atWashington.(previous reference:&quot;W.M. (44) 100thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for India (CP. (45) 147) recommending that theCabinet should reconsider the decision taken by the coalition government on the 3rd August, 1944, that no change should be madein the status of the Indian Agency-General in Washington.The Secretary of State for India said that, since this decision was taken, the position had been changed by the offer made to india on the 14th June, 1945, which included the proposal that the Agency-General in Washington should be elevated to the status of aLegation. Although the offer as a whole had been rejected, he feltthat it would be right to proceed at once with the proposal that the
Iridian Agent-General in Washington should be given the status of a fully accredited Minister. Both the Viceroy and His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Washington favoured this proposal.If this were approved, similar action should be taken in respectof the Indian Agency-General at Chungking.The Cabinet-Approved the proposal put forward in CP. (45) 147; and invited the Foreign Secretary to approach the Govern-ments of the United States and China with a view to securing their consent to the proposal that the IndianAgents-General in Washington and Chungking should be. given the status of fully accredited Ministers.Parliament. 4.   The  Cabinet  considered  a  memorandum  by  the  LordSecret President of the Council (CP. (45) 195) proposing that authoritySessions. should be sought for the general publication of the Journals of theHouse of Commons for the war sessions 1939-1945, notwith-standing that they recorded proceedings held in secret session.The Lord President of the Council said that, for the reasonsstated in his memorandum, he favoured, not only the publication ofthe Journals, but also the revocation of Defence Regulation 3 (2),which made it a criminal offence to publish any report or description of proceedings in secret session. He added that, as the Journalswould refer to a privilege case involving an alleged breach of secrecy by a particular Member of Parliament, it would be necessary,in fairness to that Member, to publish also the report of theCommittee of Privileges which had exonerated him.In discussion it was pointed out that, even though defence regulation 3 (2) was revoked, the disclosure of what had passed in secret session would still be governed by Parliamentary privilege.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that he had considered the proposals made in CP. (45) 195, and recommendedthat similar authority should be sought for the publication of theJournals of the House of Lords.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals in CP. (45) 195; and invited theLord President of the Council to arrange for authorityto be sought for the publication of the Journals of theHouse of Commons for the war sessions 1939-1945, forthe publication of the Report of the Committee of privileges on the particular case mentioned in CP. (45)195, and for the revocation of Defence Regulation 3 (2).(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to seek similar authority for the publication of the Journalsof the House of Lords for the war sessions 1939-1945.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of State (CP. (45) 171) on the location of the headquarters of the United Nations Organisation.The Minister of State said that, since his memorandum wasHeadquarters. circulated, the executive committee of the Preparatory commission had approved by a majority a proposal that the permanent head-quarters of the Organisation should be situated in the United States.He had not been aware, before the meeting, that the executivecommittee were to formulate a definite recommendation on thisquestion; and at the end of the meeting he had made it clear that he did not regard the matter as closed. For the reasons stated in his memorandum, there was a strong case for establishing the head-quarters of the Organisation in Europe; and he asked for authorityto continue to press that case, both in public statements and in[30754-6] b 3UnitedNationsOrganisation.Location of
private conversations with delegates to the Preparatory Corn-mission. It was unreasonable that a final decision should betaken on this question at the present time, when the Euro-pean States were inadequately represented on the PreparatoryCommission and some of the countries which had supported theproposal approved by the executive committee were not free toexpress an independent view since their territory was still occupiedby Russian armies.The Chancellor of, the Exchequer said that, if this matter hadbeen brought to the Cabinet before the discussion at the executivecommittee, he would have argued in favour of locating the head-quarters of the Organisation in the United States, on the groundthat this would afford the best means of ensuring the continuedsupport and interest of the United States in the United nations organisation. And, if it were decided that the headquartersshould be in Europe, he would wish to argue the case for a site inEurope other than Geneva. As matters had gone, however, it wouldbe unnecessary for him to elaborate these arguments at the present stage unless the Cabinet desired to authorise the Minister of state to continue to press the views outlined in his memorandum.The Foreign Secretary pointed out that the decision of theexecutive committee was only a recommendation which would come up in due course for consideration by the Preparatory Commissionitself. Meanwhile, he would deprecate any public statement ofthe views outlined in CP. (45) 171, or any attempt to convass thoseviews among delegates to the Preparatory Commission. In view ofthe difficulties which had arisen on procedural questions at therecent Conference of the Council of Foreign Ministers, he thoughtit undesirable that His Majesty&apos;s Government should take theinitiative at this stage in raising further controversy on such issues.The matter would come before the Preparatory Commission in amonth or so, and it was possible that during that time the UnitedStates Government might decide to take a more positive attitude on this question.There was general support for the views advanced by theForeign Secretary.The First Lord of the Admiralty suggested that meanwhile the Chiefs of Staff might consider whether the prospects of con-tinuing the Combined Chiefs of Staff organisation in Washingtonmight be prejudiced by a decision which would have the consequencethat the Military Committee of the Security Council of the united nations Organisation would also be located in the United States.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the issues raised in CP. (45) 171 should bethe subject of further discussion by the Cabinet beforethe Preparatory Commission considered the rcommenda-tiou of the executive committee that the permanentheadquarters of the United Nations Organisation shouldbe established in the United States.(2) Agreed that meanwhile the Minister of State should take no steps to challenge the decision of the executivecommittee.6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (45) 174) submitting recommendations on middle east policy based on the discussions at the Conference held inSeptember with British Representatives in the Middle East.The Foreign Secretary said that, in his view, it was essentialto broaden the basis of British influence in the Middle East by developing an economic and social policy which would make forproperity and contentment in the area as a whole. It would bethe object of  this  policy to  remedy  the mal-distribution  of middle Bast.Future Policy.(previous reference:CM. (45)26thConclusions,Minute 2.)
purchasing power in the Middle East communities and to raise thestandard of living of the masses of the people. The Middle EastSupply Centre had, during the war, pursued a policy of economic co-ordination throughout the Middle East and the good work whichit had started should not be lost. We had to face a threatening-situation in Palestine, an agitation in Egypt for the withdrawalof our forces, and the difficulties with France in the Levant. If,however, we could promote economic development and social reform in the area these military and political problems would be more easily solved.So far as concerned defence, the Chiefs of Staff were consider-ing the possibility of basing in British territory, rather than inEgypt, the forces required for the protection of the Middle East.If this could be arranged, responsibility for the defence of Egyptcould be shared by a common agreement which would leave with us the responsibility for the defence of the Suez Canal area.With regard to the Levant his aim was to arrive at a clear-cut agreement which would finally remove French suspicions about our intentions in this area; and he had made some progress in discussions which he had held with M. Bidault during the Confer-ence of the Council of Foreign Ministers. He proposed to pursue the matter further with the French Government alone beforesummoning a conference on the lines suggested in paragraph5 (c) (iv) of CP. (45) 174. M. Bidault had asked for our support for the proposal that France should obtain from the United nations organisation authority for a base in the Levant. He did not rule out the possibility of France&apos;s obtaining such a base when the time came for a settlement of the question of bases, but he had avoidedgiving in advance any pledge of British support for such a claim.With regard to Persia, he had had an exchange of letters withM. Molotov in which undertakings had been given that both theRussian and the British troops would be withdrawn from Persia, inaccordance with the Treaty, before the 2nd March, 1946.The following were the main points raised in discussion : (a) The Minister of Fuel and Power drew attention to therecommendation in paragraph 5 (b) (iii) of CP. (45) 174 that weshould not make any concession that would assist Americancommercial penetration into the Middle East. He hoped that theline which had been taken in the recent Anglo-American oildiscussions would not be regarded as inconsistent with thisrecommendation.It was generally agreed that there would be advantages in getting the United States to accept greater political responsibility in this area; and that on this account we should not resist theirseeking further expansion of their oil concessions as contemplated in the recent discussions. The Foreign Secretary undertook to keepthis point in mind.(b) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that theChiefs of Staff were continuing to examine the problems of defence in the Middle East. While the Mombasa area was in many wayssuitable as a base, there were difficulties with regard to road and rail communications and port facilities. A joint arrangement withthe Government of Egypt on the lines indicated by the foreign secretary would be desirable from the point of view of the defenceof the Suez Canal.(c) The Secretary of State for the Colonies asked that theChiefs of Staff should, in due course, submit a fresh appreciation of the strategic importance of Cyprus in the light of the review which they were making of the general problem of defence in theMiddle East.(d) The Secretary of State for India asked whether thePolitical Resident in the Persian Gulf would be a member of theBritish Middle East Conference recommended in paragraph 5 (a) (ii)of CP. (45) 174. WM &apos;
The Foreign Secretary said that the inclusion of the political resident in the Persian Gulf as a member of the Conference mightraise suspicions in Russia and that he would prefer that theinterests of the Government of India in this area should be repre-sented by that Government or by the India Office. He would,however, look into this point in consultation with the Secretaryof State for India.(e) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that ifthe proposals were approved he would wish to convey them to theDominions for their information.(/) The question was raised whether the proposals in para-graph 5 (h) of OP. (45) 174 would not unduly encourage a development of the Arab League which might prove a source of embarrassment to us. The Foreign Secretary said that he would see to it that relations with the League were kept on an informalbasis.(g) The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he v/asanxious to offer any assistance in his power, although it was doubtful whether the Colonies could make much of a contribution in the way of technical experts.(h) The Minister of Labour and National Service askedwhether it was desirable that His Majesty&apos;s Government should support the view that the proposed International Labour OfficeMiddle East Regional Conference should be held at an early date.The Foreign Secretary said that it would be preferable to deferany such conference until further progress had been made withthe proposals which he had made.(i) The Foreign Secretary said that in constituting the BritishMiddle East Conference proposed in Section K of the report annexed to CP. (45) 174 he would propose to defer including HisMajesty&apos;s Minister at Beirut until such time as French suspicionsabout British intentions in the Levant States had been allayed.The Cabinet -Approved, subject to the points noted above, the recom-mendations on Middle East policy, and on the machinery required to give effect to that policy, which were putforward by the Foreign Secretary in CP. (45) 174.7.   The Cabinet had before them (i) a memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies(CP. (45) 196) submitting recommendations on thequestions relating to the policy of His Maj esty&apos;s Govern-ment with regard to Palestine, which had been raised at the meeting of the Cabinet on the 11th September;and(ii) a note by the Chiefs of Staff (CP. (45) 200) with regardto the timing of any announcement of the policy of HisMajesty&apos;s Government.The Prime Minister said that since these memoranda werecirculated there had been a marked increase in the agitation on thisquestion in the United States, where our difficulties with regard tothe immediate problem of immigration into Palestine were not clearly understood. He had just received a telegram (No. 6593) from lord Halifax, which he would ask the Secretary to read to theCabinet, giving an appreciation of United States opinion, discussing the various possible courses of action which His Majesty&apos;s Govern -ment might take, and stressing the importance of the form and presentation of any announcement of policy by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.As soon as Parliament reassembled the Government would be pressed to make a statement and to give facilities for a debate. Itwas no longer possible to defer an announcement until the end ofOctober, and it would be difficult to postpone it beyond the week beginning the 15th October.Palestine.(Previous-Reference:CM. (45)30thConclusions,Minute 7.)
In discussion stress was laid on the importance of making afull statement of the facts of the situation. The admission of100,000 Jews to Palestine, while it would lead to an explosion inthe Middle East, would not solve the problem of the Jews in Europe.The same opportunity should be taken of correcting the impression that all the Jews in Europe were still living in intolerable conditions.On the other hand, it was urged that no announcement by HisMajesty&apos;s Government could afford to ignore the present situationin Europe, where Jews were living in conditions of great hardshipand were still subject, in some areas, to persecution. In the british zone of Germany everything possible was being done to amelioratethe conditions under which the Jews were living. Conditions were,however, less satisfactory in the American zone and in the eastern european States Jews were still suffering persecution and were,in some areas, being driven from their homes. Could not a Commis-sion be sent to Europe forthwith to establish the facts with regardto the present plight of the Jews ?Other points in discussion were : (a) How far would German Jews be unwilling to remain inGermany now that the Nazi regime had been abolished ?Many German Jews had lost their homes and employmentduring the Nazi regime and were unwilling to settle down in thescenes of their persecution. Moreover, there were large, numbers ofstateless Jews among the displaced persons. The problem wasaggravated by the fact that German Jews were being treated asstateless by the United States authorities.(b) It would be desirable that the Prime Minister or theForeign Secretary should see Dr. Weizmann.The Foreign Secretary explained that he bad already arranged to meet Dr. Weizmann.(c) The Home Secretary said that he had received representa-tions from the Chief Rabbi in favour of the admission to thiscountry of Jews who did not desire to settle in Germany. Therewould no doubt be further pressure on us to receive Jews into theUnited Kingdom.(cl) The importance of dissociating any future statement ofpolicy from the White Paper of 1939 was strongly urged.The Foreign Secretary said that, in the light of the views expressed by his colleagues in the discussion and of the telegram from lord Halifax, he would like to have an opportunity to consider afresh approach to the problem; and, if the Cabinet agreed, he would propose to discuss the matter further with the Colonial secretary and submit revised proposals. The long-term problem should, ofcourse, be referred to the United Nations Organisation, but HisMajesty&apos;s Government must do more than suggest a reference to theUnited Nations Organisation if they were to avoid the criticism that they were evading the urgent issues. What he had in mind was a solution based on the immediate establishment of an Anglo-American Commission, which would be given the following tasks : (i) To examine what could be done immediately to amelioratethe position of the Jews now in Europe;(ii) To consider how much immigration into Palestine could resonably be allowed in the immediate future; and(iii) To examine the possibility of relieving the position inEurope by immigration into other countries, includingthe United States and the Dominions. In this connection the possibility of using as temporary quarters the campsin North Africa under the control of U.N.R.R.A. shouldbe considered.The Commission would be instructed to consult the Arabs andthe Jews jointly, both with regard to the proposals for immigration into Palestine in the immediate future, with a view to the submission of recommendations to the Governments concerned, and with regardto the problem of a long-term policy, with a view to making recommendations to the United Nations Organisation.
It was for consideration whether Field-Marshal Smuts mightbe asked to preside over such a Commission, and also whether there might be advantage in adding a representative of Australia to theCommission.The revised proposals should be formulated as a matter of urgency, and it would be desirable to give Lord Halifax anopportunity of commenting on the form and presentation of any announcement before it was made.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary and the Colonial Secretaryto submit proposals on the lines suggested by the foreign secretary, for consideration by the Palestine Committee ata meeting on Monday, with a view to the submission of areport to the Cabinet early in the following week.Selling Priceof Houses.(previous reference:CM. (45) 29thConclusions,Minute 6.)8. The Cabinet took note, with approval, of a memorandumby the Minister of Health (CP. (45) 183) outlining the reasons whichhad led him to the conclusion that it would not be possible tointroduce during the current Session legislation to give effect to theMorris Report on the selling price of houses.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,4th October, 1945.
