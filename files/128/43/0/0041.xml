Oversea affairs rhodesia(previous reference:CC (68) 40thConclusions,Minute 1)SECRET* 1.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Prime Minister9496and the Commonwealth Secretary (C (68) 107), to which were attachedcopies of the joint Press Statement issued on Sunday, 13th October,1968, at the end of the talks in HMS Fearless at Gibraltar, and of theStatement of British Proposals for a Rhodesia IndependenceSettlement.The Prime Minister said that the talks which had taken place inHMS Fearless at Gibraltar with Mr. Smith, the leader of the illegal regime in Rhodesia, and two of his colleagues, had ended late on sunday evening, 13th October, with the issue of a joint communique.Earlier in the same day he had handed to Mr. Smith a documentsetting out the basis on which, subject to the approval of the Cabinet,a Rhodesia Independence Settlement would be introduced toParliament. Mr. Smith and his colleagues had taken this documentto Salisbury for consideration with their colleagues, on theunderstanding that adequate time would be allowed for this consideration and that the Commonwealth Secretary would fly out to Salisbury if this would be of assistance.The talks in HMS Fearless, though hard-hitting, had been more constructive and less repetitive than those in HMS Tiger in December1966. Some progress had been made towards agreement on the lessfundamental points of difference and, in addition, Mr. Smith hadshowed himself willing to accept the new proposal which we had made that there should be an accelerated joint educational programme for Africans in Rhodesia, to which the Chancellor of the exchequer had agreed that we would be prepared to contribute up to  5 million annually for 10 years on a pound-for-pound basis. Mr. Smith had also been willing to accept that the Royal Commission, which wouldhave the responsibility for supervising the test of acceptability in rhodesia of any constitutional settlement, should also investigate the registration system for voters. It was important that this shouldbe done since it had become clear during the talks that the complexity of the system was a deterrent to registration.The fundamental difference between the two sides lay in theirdifferent attitudes to unimpeded progress towards majority rule. Inour Statement we had maintained our requirement for absolutelyfirm guarantees in the form of a &quot; blocking quarter &quot; of directly elected Africans and of a right of appeal to the Privy Council. the talks had indicated that, as a price for a settlement, Mr. Smith mightbe willing to accept a blocking quarter, which he had not done in discussions earlier in the year with Sir Alec Douglas-Home, and toaccept cross-voting between the &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B &quot; Rolls (though noton the basis which we required). But neither he nor his colleagues would accept that there should also be a system of appeal to the privy Council on matters affecting progress towards majority rule,though they would accept this on matters of law in civil and criminal* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.A 2
cases. They regarded any such appeal arrangements as unnecessary,as unprecedented for an independent country, and as an unacceptablederogation from Parliamentary sovereignty. The Rhodesians hadadmitted that these objections applied not merely to the privy council but to any judicial or other authority that might be proposed for this purpose inside or outside Rhodesia. We had statedcategorically that an effective blocking quarter and an externalguarantee were essential features of any settlement that we could accept. It had also been made plain to him that further executionsof men sentenced for terrorist offences or who had been under sentence of death for long periods would severely prejudice the prospects forany settlement and that public opinion in this country was strongly opposed to the continued presence in Rhodesia of members of theSouth African armed forces or police. Mr. Smith had said that theinternal security situation in Rhodesia did not require South Africanassistance.The next move lay with Mr. Smith and his colleagues; and, in contrast with what had happened after the talks in HMS Tiger, no time limit had been set for a response by the illegal regime to our proposals. We had stood firm on our six principles and, in so doing,had gained credit and minimised the risks that we had taken in havingtalks with Mr. Smith. There had been no sharp reactions to thesetalks from Afro-Asian States; and the Governor of Rhodesia had welcomed our stand on the blocking quarter and the fact that wehad not slammed the door on further talks. It was impossible to predict what Mr. Smith would now do. It did not seem likely thatthe regime would accept the settlement that we had proposed, eventhough the Governor considered that if Mr. Smith were to recommend the settlement to the existing Rhodesian electorate it would beaccepted by a substantial majority.The Commonwealth Secretary said that in the talks we had achieved a defensible position in relation to our trusteeship for the african majority in Rhodesia while showing ourselves to be flexible,and indeed generous, towards the illegal regime on matters which did not affect this trusteeship. We had also succeeded in pressingMr. Smith to move nearer to our position than he had been willingto do in discussions with Sir Alec Douglas-Home. Mr. Smith was willing to accept our plans for African education, an enquiry intothe system for registering voters, safeguards for detainees and theinclusion of Africans in his Government. We could therefore claim that substantial changes had taken place in the Rhodesian situationsuch as would justify our not insisting on no independence before majority rule (n.i.b.m.r.). Moreover, we could show that we had made a great effort to secure a settlement on an honourable basis.The Attorney-General said that, in seeking to secure agreement that there should be an external guarantee for unimpeded progress towards majority rule in Rhodesia, we had been willing to concedethat a right of appeal to the Privy Council should be provided onlyduring the first 15 years after independence in Rhodesia and toreduce this if necessary to 10 years. We had also suggested, as analternative, that there should be a treaty of guarantee on the lines of
the Cyprus treaty even though this would leave us with a continuingobligation to intervene militarily. But this suggestion had been rejected. Moreover, it was not certain that Mr. Smith would infact accept other elements in the proposed settlement that we regardedas essential. He had not formally accepted the blocking quarter, orour proposals for cross-voting, and his colleague, Mr. Lardner-Burke,had made it clear that he would wish to see the Declaration of rights in the independence constitution drafted so as to allow of legislationpermitting permanent preventive detention. Satisfactory clarification of these points would be essential before any settlement would bepossible.In discussion, there was general agreement that the outcome ofthe talks with Mr. Smith had been as satisfactory as could have been expected. There was value for us in the emphasis that had beenplaced on the six principles rather than on the n.i.b.m.r. pledge;and in our having left the way open for further talks to take placeon the basis of the statement of our position which had been givento Mr. Smith. Mr. Smith had been left in no doubt that his declared policy of no majority rule in Rhodesia in his lifetime was unacceptable to us. This was likely to remain true even if the conservative opposition were to come to power in this country. It might bethat Mr. Smith had never seriously intended to reach a settlement,and that he would choose the right of appeal to the Privy Council,rather than the blocking quarter, as the issue on which to break offnegotiations, since he might consider that our position would thenbe less easily understood publicly. We had, however, safeguardedourselves against this by establishing that the regime were notobjecting to appeals to the Privy Council as such but to any effectiveexternal guarantee for human rights and for the first principle ofunimpeded progress to majority rule in Rhodesia. It was in fact thefirst principle which was the real sticking point for him and hiscolleagues : and we should bring this out.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the Statement which had been handed to Mr. Smithof our proposals for a Rhodesia Independence Settlement. they also approved its publication in a White Paper. This wouldincorporate a statement which he would make in the House ofCommons later that day outlining recent developments in the rhodesian situation, and explaining our proposals. Both Houses ofParliament would wish to hold Debates on Rhodesia, which were likely to take place in the following week on the Order in Councilto renew the Southern Rhodesia Act, 1965. It was not the present intention to publish detailed records of the talks in HMS Fearless,as had been done after those in HMS Tiger. Agreement had beenreached with Mr. Smith that neither side would publish such recordswithout consulting the other, even if there were a breakdown in negotiations. For the present at any rate, publication of them wouldin any event not be helpful. It seemed unlikely that Mr. Smith would accept our proposals, but further consideration of the Rhodesiansituation should await his response to them.
The Prime Minister in conclusion said that he wished to paytribute to the Royal Navy for the excellence of the arrangements that had been made for the talks with Mr. Smith at Gibraltar.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.CONFIDENTIALTransport 2.   The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister ofPolicy Transport (C (68) 103) and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C (68)(previous reference- about the reorganisation of London Transport.CC (68) 33rd jjie Minister of Transport said that the Government wereMinuteS40)nS&apos; Publicly committed to the transfer to the Greater London CouncilLondon (GLC) of responsibility for the London Transport Board (tons) andTransport tbe Transport (London) Bill was being drafted for early introductionReorganisation in the coming session of Parliament to effect this transfer. Aprerequisite of the transfer, agreed between his predecessor and the glc, was that the tons should be commercially viable when the glc took it over. Although the National Board for Prices and incomes (NBPI) had accepted earlier this year the tons&apos;s case for fareincreases of about  8 million this year the Transport Tribunal had subsequently sanctioned increases amounting only to about  4 million.In consequence it would be necessary to raise fares by some  8 million(instead of  4 million) in 1969 in order to achieve viability. This verylarge increase, effected by the Government after it had abolished theTransport Tribunal, would be made in the autumn of 1969 towardsthe end of the life of the present GLC and he would have to announce it in November of this year during the passage of theTransport (London) Bill through Parliament. The size of the increaseexpected to be needed in order to achieve viability was known to the glc and would therefore be known to the Opposition; and hecould not refuse to reveal the Governmenfs intentions on fares, whichwere central to the purposes of the Bill. Sir Reginald Goodwin, the leader of the GLC Labour Group, had expressed to him the greatestconcern about the size of the proposed increase: the Labour Groupdid not in any event accept the view of the GLC that the tons shouldbe expected to cover its costs entirely from fares, Mr. Aubrey Jones,the chairman of the NBPI, had said that if tons fares were referredagain to the Board the latter would be as helpful as possible but hethought an increase of more than  8 million might be required forviability. The social and other consequences, including those for prices and incomes policy, of an increase of  8 million or more in1969 were unacceptable. The Government should therefore eitherabandon the Transport (London) Bill a course which he did not recommend or limit next years fares increase to  4 million and make up the difference required for viability by a capital payment tothe GLC of about  50 million.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while he did notunderestimate the difficulties to which the Minister of transport had drawn attention, he found neither of the proposed alternatives
acceptable. Abandonment of the Bill would mean abandoning thepolicy, to which the Government were firmly and publicly committed,that urban transport should be a responsibility of local rather thancentral Government. It would also have serious consequences for public expenditure. Even after allowing for the proposed writing-off of 90 per cent of tons&apos;s existing capital debt and for a fares increasenext year of  8 million, an annual deficit of  7 million was forecast for 1970-71 and could be expected to grow thereafter. A capitalpayment of  50 million to the GLC was equally unacceptable. Itwould add substantially to Supply Votes and would bring the sameadverse reactions at home and abroad as had followed the Vote onAccount in February. More seriously, it would involve a very substantial increase in public expenditure and in the Governmentsborrowing requirement and could be expected to lead to consequentialdemands for Government subsidies to public transport elsewhere.The additional expenditure could not be afforded unless it wereaccommodated by offsetting savings elsewhere which would lead to adistortion of priorities. The Chairman of the NBPI had respondedhelpfully to the approach from the Minister of Transport. he proposed therefore that the Transport (London) Bill should beintroduced as planned; that the Government should agree now thatthe fares increase necessary to achieve viability would be made inorder to effect the transfer of responsibility to the GLC; and that the nbpi should now be asked to make recommendations on the faresincrease required to achieve this viability.In discussion, although some urged that the fares increaserequired in 1969 to achieve viability was unacceptably large, therewas wide support for the Chancellor^ proposals and against anyfurther subvention, for example by writing off 100 per cent insteadof 90 per cent of the existing capital debt of the tons. While it wasthe case that the Passenger Transport Authorities to be set up inother conurbations would receive tapering annual subsidies, a verylarge number of municipal transport undertakings operated withoutsubsidy. A dangerous precedent would be created by any furthersubvention and the GLC did not in any event want one.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that despite the serious difficulties involved in raisingfares to the extent that would be required in 1969, the Transport(London) Bill should be introduced next session as planned and the nbpi should be asked to make recommendations on the fares increaserequired to enable the tons to achieve commercial viability. TheMinister of Transport could explain, during the passage of the bill through Parliament, that the NBPI was investigating the scale of fareincreases required to enable the tons to achieve viability, which was an agreed prerequisite for transfer of responsibility to the GLC. TheMinister of Transport would no doubt consider whether or not tomake the point that the GLC could, if they chose, limit the faresincrease below what would otherwise be required by providingassistance to the tons from the rates.
The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Transport (London) Bill should be introduced as planned in the 1968-69 session.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport, in consultation with theFirst Secretary of State, to request the NBPI to make recommendations on the fare increases required in orderto make the London Transport Board commerciallyviable when responsibility for the Board was transferredto the GLC.LegislativeProgramme1968-69(previous reference:CC (68) 31stConclusions,Minute 4)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord privy seal (C (68) 102) about the legislative programme for 1968-69.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Cabinet would wish to review the legislative programme for 1968-69 in the light of developments since the decisions taken at their meeting on 20th June before considering the proposals to be mentioned in The Queen&apos;s Speech onthe Opening of Parliament. The main programme approved by theCabinet had been estimated to require as much Parliamentary time as could be expected to be available for legislation during an ordinarysession; and he had therefore had to question closely any proposalsfor adding to it. He had, however, felt bound to recommend theinclusion in the programme of a New Towns Bill to raise the limit on advances to Development Corporations and the Commission forthe New Towns, and of the Local Government (Amendment) Bill,which was necessary to enable the urban programme to be launched.In addition, he proposed to add to the Contingent List a shipbuilding industry (Amendment) Bill which might be necessary to increasethe guarantee limit for British shipyard orders. These additions wouldmake it even more necessary to resist pressure for further Bills ifserious overloading of the legislative programme was to be avoided;of the Bills included provisionally in June, only Atomic energy authority (Amendment) had dropped out. He would continue tokeep the programme under review in the light of the progress of bills in Parliament and, in particular, of the decision expected at theend of the year on whether to introduce Industrial Relations this session.In discussion of the contents of the legislative programme thefollowing points were made:(a) The Ministerial Steering Committee on Economic Policy had decided that there was urgent need for a Redundancy Payments Billto withdraw the rebate to employers on the &quot; age-weighted &quot; element of redundancy payments; without it, employers&apos; contributions would almost certainly need to be raised again during the session.(b) The Gas Bill now in the Reserve List was badly needed tostrengthen the Gas Council and facilitate the exploitation of natural gas; it had received policy approval in May and the then Minister of power had announced the intention to introduce it. It now seemed
The Queen&apos;sSpeech on the prorogation ofParliamentSECRET4. The Cabinet considered a note by the Lord Privy Seal (C (68)104) covering a draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the prorogation of Parliament.The Lord Privy Seal said that the draft had been examined by the ministerial Committee on The Queen&apos;s Speeches and that so far ashe knew there were no points of substance outstanding except that theterms of the reference to Rhodesia had still to be decided.In discussion it was suggested that if it were decided to ratify the Non-Proliferation Treaty it might be appropriate to insert a reference to the decision, but the general feeling was that if any reference were to be made, the Opening Speech would be the betterplace for it.unlikely that Petroleum Exploration (Safety), which had been includedin the list of Second Reading Committee Bills, would be required,and this might help to free drafting resources.(c) Air Corporations was required to reconstitute british european Airways&apos; capital structure and implement the Governmenfsundertaking to enable the Corporation to operate in a fullycommercial manner. It ought to have a firm place in the programme.(d) There now seemed less prospect of legislation to implement the recommendations of the Committee on Intermediate Areas (theHunt Committee); the Industrial Development (Amendment) Bill,which had been included in the programme for introduction if time was available, might not therefore be required.(e) The desirability of a Cigarette Advertising Bill had been referred to the Home Affairs Committee for consideration; little progress had been made in finding effective means of controllingadvertising.(/) If time could be found there was a strong case for aProductivity Consultants Bill to improve industrial efficiency.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet recognised that a case could be made for legislation on severaltopics not included in the programme; but approval of policy by the relevant Ministerial Committee did not carry with it a place in theprogramme. It was for the Lord Privy Seal, as Chairman of theFuture Legislation Committee, to control demand on parliamentary time and drafting resources. The Cabinet approved the additionswhich the Lord Privy Seal suggested should be made to theprogramme. The Lord Privy Seal should keep the programmeunder review, giving due weight to the points made in discussion.The Cabinet (1) Approved the additions proposed in C (68) 102 to theprovisional legislative programme approved in June.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal, in keeping the programme underreview, to take note of the points made at (a) to (/) of their discussion.
The Cabinet (1) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation withthe Lord Privy Seal, to submit to the Prime Minister asuitable passage on Rhodesia for inclusion in the opening speech.(2) Subject to (1) approved the draft of the Prorogation Speechannexed to C (68) 104.secret. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord privy seal (C (68) 105) to which was attached a draft of The Queen&apos;s speech on the Opening of Parliament.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Ministerial Committee on the queen&apos;s Speeches had made a special effort to produce a draft whichwould be easier to read than the Speeches in previous years. Thedraft at present ran to about 920 words, compared with the usual1,000 words, but a passage on Rhodesia had still to be added.In discussion a number of amendments were made to the draft and the following main points were made:(a) The draft contained no reference to agriculture; the omissionmight give offence to the industry, which had grown accustomed toa regular reference, and there might be advantage in inserting a shortparagraph.(b) The reference to the extension of nursery schools in deprivedareas should be associated with the reference to the urban programme,since there had been no decision to provide more schools outsidethat programme.(c) It would be better to make no reference to giving teachersgreater control over their professional affairs, since policy on this had not been settled.(d) There might be advantage in announcing in the Speech the setting up of a constitutional inquiry into the relationship between thevarious parts of the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands and the isle of Man. But this could not be judged until decisions had beentaken on policy on devolution.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation withthe Lord Privy Seal, to submit to the Prime Minister asuitable passage on Rhodesia.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to consider the points made at(a), (b) and (d), in consultation with the ministers concerned.(3) Subject to (1) and (2) and to the amendments agreed in discussion, approved the draft Speech annexed toC(68) 105.Cabinet Office, SWl,15th October, 1968.The Queen&apos;sSpeech on theOpening ofParliament
