OverseaAffairsApproach to europe(previous reference:CC (67) 73rdConclusions,Minute 3)public expenditure:Post-DevaluationMeasuresProcedureThe Cabinet-Took note,statement.with approval, of the Foreign Secretary&apos;sSECRET2. The Prime Minister said that the memoranda on post-devaluation measures to restrain public expenditure (C (68) 1, 2, 4, 5,6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11) which had been circulated to members of theCabinet and to the other Ministers present were for their personaluse only and should not be disclosed more widely, save for the limited number of senior officials who might need to be brought into consultation. It was essential that the strictest security should be observed about the Cabinet discussions on this subject. The foreign secretary and the Commonwealth Secretary would shortly beundertaking difficult consultations overseas with a number of countries who would be markedly affected by the measures underconsideration, and any premature disclosure of information aboutthe Cabinefs consideration of these measures would make their taskthe more difficult and perhaps prejudice its success. Moreover, itwas essential that the measures to be announced by the Governmentshould be justifiable not only on their individual merits but alsocollectively as constituting a well balanced policy to take advantageof the opportunity afforded by devaluation to achieve economic recovery; and this objective would be prejudiced if there wereleakages of information about individual measures before the groupcould be announced as a whole.It was unlikely that it would be possible for the Cabinet tocomplete their consideration of the measures at a single meeting.He therefore proposed that the Cabinet should meet again on thefollowing day to bring to a conclusion their initial consideration of the broad scope and balance of the proposals. He had also, togetherwith the Foreign Secretary, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the leader of the House of Commons, given some consideration to theParliamentary procedure to be followed in respect of theannouncement and discussion of the measures. As matters stood,the first substantive business of the House of Commons onWednesday, 17th January, after the Recess, would be a two-daydebate on foreign affairs; and this would inevitably pre-emptdiscussion of the overseas aspects of the Government^ measures in isolation from their domestic aspects. The best course would,therefore, appear to be to recall Parliament a day early, on Tuesday,16th January; to announce the Governmenfs measures on that day;3723CC 1 (68)secret. The Foreign Secretary said that he was pursuing the consultations with the five member countries of the european economic Community (e.c.) other than France on the lines approvedby the Cabinet following their consideration of his memorandum c (67) 187 on 20th December. He would report further to theCabinet when the consultations had proceeded sufficiently far to warrant this.
public expenditure:Post-DevaluationMeasures(previous reference:CC (67) 73Conclusions,Minute 2)Review and balance ofPaymentsand to arrange for a debate on them on the two following days,postponing the foreign affairs debate until the following week.In discussion there was general agreement that the PrimeMinister^ proposals represented the best solution of the proceduralproblems. Although the Foreign Secretary and the commonwealth secretary would not have returned from their consultations overseasuntil 14th and 15th January and would need to be in a position to tell the Governments whom they would be consulting that their viewswould be reported to the Cabinet, it would not be practicable or desirable to announce the Governmenfs measures to Parliament anylater than was now proposed. If the Cabinet reached broadagreement that day and the following day on the scope and balanceof the measures to be announced, it would be possible to keep theForeign Secretary and the Commonwealth Secretary informed of any significant developments whilst they were overseas and to take account of the views of the Governments whom they would beconsulting on the basis of telegraphed reports. It would also benecessary to arrange a meeting of the Cabinet after the foreign secretary and the Commonwealth Secretary had returned and beforethe Governmenfs measures were announced.The Prime Minister, summing up the Cabinefs discussion on procedure, said that the Cabinet were agreed that they should meetthe following day to complete their consideration of the scope and balance of the post-devaluation measures. They were also agreed inprinciple that Parliament should be recalled a day early, i.e., to meeton Tuesday, 16th January, and that the Governments measures should be announced on that date and should be followed by a debate on Wednesday and Thursday, 17th and 18th January. It would not,however, be necessary to give effect to this decision until the following week, and this would afford an opportunity for further consideration should developments so require.The Foreign Secretary and the Commonwealth Secretary shouldexpedite so far as possible their consultations with other countries inorder to be present at the Cabinet&apos;s final meetings before the measures ,were announced.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.- secret. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum and a note bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer on public expenditure (C (68) 5and 6).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the covering note tohis memorandum (C (68) 5) demonstrated that, in order to make a success of devaluation by establishing our balance of paymentsbeyond doubt, the Government should now take further action toreduce demand by an annual rate of something of the order of  1,000million in terms of increases in taxes or reductions in public expenditure and to achieve as much as possible of this shift of resources by means of reductions in public expenditure programmes.Three main reasons for this were as follows.
CC1 (68)First, our external financial position made it essential for us totransform a substantial deficit on our external payments in 1967 toa large surplus in 1969. 1967 would be the fifth successive year inwhich our external payments had been adverse. The accumulated deficit of that period would amount to some  2,000 million and would bring us nearly to the end of the borrowing rights available ontolerable terms. Because the disadvantages of devaluation took effect earlier than the advantages, 1968 would be a neutral year fromthe point of view of the balance of payments, with a continuing deficit in the first half and a compensating improvement in the second. In1969, however, the competitive advantages afforded by devaluationshould be at their peak. If, therefore, we were to restore our balanceof payments position over the next two financial years, it would benecessary to aim at an external surplus of some  500 million in thesecond year. This was not an excessive target: it amounted to onlya quarter of the accumulated deficit of the last five years, and improvement in the balance of payments of the order proposed from a deficit of  300 million in the current year to a surplus of  500million in 1969 was not an unreasonable aim either in itself or in thelight of the recent success of Federal Germany and of Italy in thisrespect. But in order to achieve this target it would be necessary tomake room for a shift in resources to exports and to import-savingat an annual rate of the order of  1,000 million.Second, it would clearly be impossible to achieve so large a shiftin demand and resources by means of taxation alone. To attemptthis would involve such substantial increases in taxation, both direct and indirect, that a consequential and counter-productive spiral effecton wages and prices would be unavoidable. Moreover, withemployment increasing, such a course would involve a significant fallin the standard of living in 1968, and no increase in that standard in1969. It was therefore essential that as much as possible of thenecessary shift of resources should be achieved by means of reductions in public expenditure programmes.Third, the factor of confidence in sterling would be of the utmost importance during the first half of 1968 when, for the reasons whichhe had stated, our external trade balance was likely to continue tobe adverse. There was substantial expectation in countries overseas,on whose confidence we were dependent, that our public expenditure would be restrained, if not indeed reduced; and the rise in public expenditure foreshadowed in the current departmental estimateswould, if it were not sharply held back, have a very damaging&apos;effecton external confidence.For these reasons it was imperative that the measures to restrainpublic expenditure should be, and should be seen to be, both adequatein the aggregate to achieve their purpose and properly balanced intheir composition, embodying substantial reductions in ourprogrammes of expenditure both at home and overseas, includingdefence expenditure. He could not accept the argument that, becausepublic expenditure for civil purposes had greatly increased in the last few years whilst defence expenditure had been held relatively steady,
the later should not also make a substantial contribution to thenecessary economies. It had been a major part of the mandate uponwhich the Government were elected that they would take steps to remedy the disproportion between spending on defence and on civil purposes. It had to be recognised, however, that it would not bepossible to make significant defence savings in the financial year1968-69 and that there were limits to the economies which could beachieved in 1969-70. It was therefore the more important, if defence expenditure was to make a contribution sufficient to give an appropriate balance to the Government^ economy measures as awhole, that the exigencies of our present economic situation, and thepublic realisation of them, should be made the occasion for firmlong-term decisions on defence policy of such a character as to demonstrate clearly that we were now prepared in this respect to cutour coat according to our cloth. He therefore proposed that theGovernment should now decide and announce to Parliament on 16thJanuary two groups of measures to these ends. First, that theGovernment had decided that the United Kingdom should nowwithdraw from its political and defence responsibilities in the area east of Suez by the end of the financial year 1970-71, instead of bythe mid-70&apos;s as provided for by previous policy decisions in this field.On this proposal he differed from the Ministers responsible for external policy and defence, who accepted the proposed withdrawalin principle but felt that it should not be completed until the end ofthe financial year 1971-72. In his view the difference of date was a significant one, since the earlier date would mean that the withdrawalcould be completed within the lifetime of the present Parliament, and almost within the present decade, whereas the latter date would forthese reasons achieve less impact as a decisive change from present policy. The earlier date would afford some 3  years in which theGovernments affected by our withdrawal could rearrange their affairs; and in his view deferment of our withdrawal for a further year would not significantly assist them in this respect. Second, itwas essential that these reductions in our commitments should beseen to be reflected in corresponding reductions in our expenditureon defence equipment and personnel and consequential structuralreadjustments in our forces. In particular, it was important thatthere should be a significant reduction in our very substantialpurchases of foreign aircraft. The argument that the cost of these was largely neutralised by offset arrangements was not valid,especially in present circumstances when the resources used for production and sales for offset purposes were needed to reinforce the drive for more exports and for import-saving. In our changednational circumstances these proposals were right in themselves andshould be given priority among the measures which the government must take in the present situation.Only on that basis could adequate reductions be made in thegrowth of civil expenditure. The scope of the reductions proposedin his memorandum was such that he could now comment only upon those which, for political, economic, or social reasons were ofparticular importance. In the savings in civil expenditure thereshould be a balance between those achieved by additional charges
and those achieved by reductions in services. Under the former head,he proposed to re-impose charges for prescriptions made under theNational Health Service. Such charges were essential to any realisticset of economies in expenditure and would be less harmful to theNational Health Service than any of the alternative means of economy which had been suggested, including an increase in contributions.  He proposed that there should also be increases inthe charges for dental services and for school meals and thateconomies should be made in local health and welfare services.  Asregards education, he proposed a three-year deferment of the raising of the school-leaving age.  This would be an unpalatable decision;but its effects would be mitigated by important concessions to avoidundue delay in the implementation of the Governments policies forthe formation of comprehensive schools and for the elimination ofthe worst school buildings.   The improvement in the housingsituation justified the savings on the housing programme which hehad put forward in his memorandum.   Family allowances hadpresented an important but very difficult problem.   The 7s. Od.increase in allowances planned for April 1968 could not be increased;and he was considering whether it could be made more selectivewithout resort to an individual means test. Administrative difficulties and tax consideration prevented him at this stage from putting forward more definite proposals; but he was considering with great urgency how far it might be possible to introduce the principle ofselectivity immediately; and he hoped that before 1969 it would bepossible to apply this principle comprehensively on an acceptablebasis. He proposed that civil defence should now in effect be put ona &quot; care and maintenance &quot; basis, so as to achieve a saving of some two-thirds of present expenditure by 1969-70.  The increase in thenumbers of employees of central and local government was giving rise to much public criticism; and he proposed that every effort shouldbe made to avoid any increase in such employment in 1968-69.Expenditure on road construction, improvement and maintenancewas growing so quickly that it was essential that economies shouldbe made, the main burden of which should fall upon minor roads,with particular application to road maintenance by local authorities.It was similarly essential that expenditure by local authorities shouldmake an adequate contribution to the economy programme.  Muchof this expenditure arose in respect of the implementation by localauthorities of central government policies, and the main means ofcontrol of the remainder was the Exchequer rate support grant. Thisgrant was fixed for two years at a time, i.e., currently until the end of1968, with provision for interim increases as justified by rising prices.It would therefore be difficult to change the rate of grants before theend of 1968. But he proposed to serve notice as part of the currentmeasures that he would not be able to approve any increases in the,grant in respect of 1968 and that for the next two-year period, 1969and 1970, he would not be prepared to allow any increase in the rateof grant in excess of three per cent in real terms. In so far as his other proposals for economies  in local  authority  expenditure were
defence commitments(previous reference:CC (67) 67thConclusions,Minute 4)unacceptable, e.g., in respect of education it would be necessary tomake the three per cent restriction more severe.The Cabinet would understand that, while the proposals in his memorandum represented a formidable and unpalatable programmeof economies, it was essential for the economy and for the financialstanding of the country that effect should be given to it; whencircumstances improved, mitigations could be introduced accordingly.But the Cabinet should be clear that it was his view that the proposals as they stood could not be regarded as too severe but indeed that,having regard to the proportion of the necessary shift in resourcesstill remaining to be made by increases in taxation, a considerablecase could be made for restrictions on public expenditure of still greater severity.The Cabinet then turned to consider a memorandum by theForeign Secretary and the Commonwealth Secretary (C (68) 7) onreductions in defence commitments.The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that there had been some preliminary discussion of cuts in the defence programme by a smaller group of Ministers earlier that day. The discussion hadcentred on two main issues our future defence commitments andthe equipment of the forces. These issues might be considered separately. As regards commitments opinion had been divided on two points: first, whether our final withdrawal from Singapore and malaysia should be completed by 31st March, 1971 or by 31st March,1972; and secondly, given that we could not remain in the persian gulf after we had withdrawn from the Far East, whether we should aim to withdraw from the Gulf earlier and whether we should announce our decision publicly.The Foreign Secretary said that it would be wrong to suppose that any new major change of policy was now in question. Thatchange had been made as a result of the last Defence Review in July1967 when the decision had been taken to withdraw our forces from east of Suez and, although it had not been announced at the time from the Persian Gulf. We had secured the acquiescence of our allies in the decision to withdraw from the Far East by not giving a precise date for our withdrawal but by stating that it would be inthe &quot; middle 1970s &quot; and by promising a continued military capabilityfor use in the .&apos;-.rea after our withdrawal. The issue was now whether our withdrawal should be accelerated. Given the cuts which wouldbe necessary in domestic expenditure, the overseas departments didnot oppose an accelerated withdrawal. But it must be recognisedthat it would entail serious risks for the stability of the area. He andthe Commonwealth Secretary were firmly of the view, and it was alsothe unanimous opinion of their advisers, that the earliest date whichwould be tolerable for the completion of the rundown would be31st March, 1972. In Singapore we should be throwing on the labour market about 60,000 people now directly deriving their employmentfrom the British forces. This could provoke widespread labourunrest, possibly leading to the overthrow of Mr. Lee Kuan Yew&apos;sGovernment and the assumption of power by a Communist regime.These risks would be greatly increased if we had to complete our
bwithdrawal by 31st March, 1971. One year&apos;s delay could make avery considerable difference. Our withdrawal would in any case leadto a serious diminution of British influence in an area where weshould still retain important economic and other interests even afterwithdrawal. Once our forces had gone we should depend more than ever for the protection of those interests on the good will of the localadministrations. If we aroused their distrust they had it in their power to organise against us. Even if we ceased to be a world power,we should continue to retain world interests and to need friends andallies to defend them. We could not afford to flout internationalopinion in the way the French did.In the Persian Gulf direct British interests were involved. Fortyper cent of our oil supplies (and over 50 per cent of Western Europe&apos;s)came from the Gulf; and the 40 per cent of Gulf oil which was in^British ownership made a significant contribution to our foreign exchange earnings. He recognised that our forces could not defendour oil supplies and that the oil producing states needed us ascustomers for their oil. But there was a real risk of intervention byother Powers; and this risk would increase with the speed of our withdrawal. The Soviet Union was already buying Iraq oil which she did not need, in order to establish her political influence in thearea. If there were disorders in the Gulf States, our oil installationswould be in danger. The Middle East crisis in the summer of 1967had shown that no Arab State could stand out against populardemand not to supply us with oil. For these reasons he would prefer to make no announcement of our plans for withdrawal from the Gulf.Once it was known we were going, we might well be faced with thesame situation as we had faced in Aden and be forced to leave soonerthan we intended.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the decision to withdraw from the Far East had already been taken. The issue now was thedate of withdrawal. To advance withdrawal to 1970-71 from1971-72 would produce no savings in 1968-69 and only  5 million in1969-70. The difference of a year might not be important for us;,but it could be vital for our Far Eastern allies and especially for singapore. Our withdrawal would create widespread unemploymentin Singapore; and it would make a very great difference if this werephased over three years instead of four. There was a real dangerof this unemployment leading to the overthrow of the regime. the extra year would also be important for our relations with Malaysia,Australia and New Zealand. Fie was leaving for the Far East onthe 5th January and would have to explain to our Commonwealthallies why we had been obliged to change our minds about the rateof our withdrawal only a few months after we had assured them thatthe Defence Review of July, 1967 would be the last in the life of this parliament. He needed guidance from his colleagues on what to say.He would like to tell the Governments concerned that we should notwithdraw before 1971-72; that this earlier date would involve anincrease in mitigatory aid; and that he was ready to listen to theirviews and to report back to his colleagues.
In the course of discussion on the date of our withdrawal fromthe Far East it was argued in favour of withdrawal by 1971-72 that,given that the principle of withdrawal had already been decided and-that the only issue was its timing, the extra year proposed by theForeign Secretary and the Commonwealth Secretary was important for the countries concerned, especially Singapore, and would extendby one-third the time available for them to adjust themselves to the impact of our withdrawal. We had to set the minimal savings whichwould result from bringing forward our withdrawal to 1970-71against the political and economic risks involved in the area. It wasin our own interests to withdraw in circumstances which wouldenable us to maintain the maximum of good will in the countries concerned, with whom we should still need to trade and do businessafter our withdrawal. We should also still retain our moralobligations to Australia and New Zealand. Another considerationpointing to a later rather than an earlier withdrawal was the fact thatwe had 35,000 servicemen and 12,000 dependants in Singapore and malaysia: and, if there were disorders, their withdrawal might become dangerous and expensive. The later date would also reducethe formidable administrative problems of organising their returnto this country.In favour of the earlier date of 1970-71 it was argued that itwould still allow 3  years for the rundown; and that an extra year was unlikely in practice to make a critical difference or appreciablyto reduce the dangers of disorder in the area. We must expect thatour decision would be unwelcome to the United States, Australiaand New Zealand; but their reaction would not be materiallyinfluenced by the margin of a year. Even in Singapore it was farfrom certain that unemployment would be as massive as was fearedor would necessarily lead to disorder. The Prime Minister of singapore had not appeared to be greatly concerned with thepossibility of an accelerated withdrawal when the Prime Minister had met him in Melbourne in December 1967. He had been morepreoccupied&apos; with the political situation in Malaysia and with the anticipated economic boom in Singapore.Moreover, the question at issue was more than one of meretiming; our credibility as a nation was involved. So far ourreductions in defence expenditure had always been too little andcome too late. This was our opportunity to make radical final decisions and to make clear that our future defence role would be concentrated in Europe. Our experience in Aden had proved theadvantages of fixing an early date for withdrawal and adhering to it.Our standing in the world depended on the soundness of our economy and not on a world-wide military presence. We must get our commitments and resources into a sensible long-term balance as soonas possible. We should be increasingly on our own in the world forthe next few years; and we must therefore concentrate onsafeguarding our own interests. Against the background of ourpresent economic situation there was a strong case for a withdrawal by 1970-71.In discussion of our withdrawal from the Persian Gulf it waspointed out that it would be essential to announce a date for
8723cwithdrawal soon. Unless this was done, it would not be possible to announce or plan the phasing out of our aircraft carriers (whichwould yield substantial savings in expenditure), since the carrierswould be needed to cover withdrawal from the Gulf. An early announcement was also necessary to remove uncertainty in the area.Some concern was expressed at the consequences of withdrawal forthe security of oil supplies which were vital for our industry and also for Western Europe. On the other hand it was argued that we couldnot stay in the Gulf after we had withdrawn from the Far East.Indeed, once it was known that we were withdrawing from the far east earlier than planned, our position in the Gulf was likely tobecome more and more difficult. The area would become increasingly unstable and we could not expect to maintain stabilityby the presence of our forces. As regards oil, our primary interest was in the oil installations with their considerable earnings of foreign exchange. But it had been noticeable that during the Nigerian civil war and the Middle East crisis in the summer of 1967 action had beentaken by the local administrations concerned to protect foreign oil installations. They might not therefore be in such danger as was feared. The risk to oil supplies might also not be so serious: theSoviet Government could not afford to buy unlimited quantities of oil from the Middle East for purely political reasons.In subsequent discussion there was general agreement that theproposed statement on defence reductions should contain no reference to Hong Kong; that we should plan to withdraw very soonsome of our aircraft from Cyprus; but that it would not be practicable to withdraw from the sovereign base areas in 1968 or 1969. In anycase Cyprus would be required as a staging post until the withdrawal from the Far East was complete.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the decision of the Cabinet was that our withdrawal from theFar East should be completed by the end of the financial year1970-71 and that we should withdraw from the Persian Gulf by thesame time. Both decisions should be announced, the reference tothe Gulf being so expressed as to imply that withdrawal wouldcertainly not be later, and might be sooner, than withdrawal fromthe Far East. The Foreign Secretary should inform the UnitedStates Secretary of State, Mr. Dean Rusk, of our decision when hemet him in San Francisco on 13th January; and the commonwealth secretary should inform the Governments of Australia, NewZealand, Malaysia and Singapore during his forthcoming visit to theFar East. If, in their consultations with these/Governments, theForeign Secretary or the Commonwealth Secretary encountered astrong reaction, they would be free to undertake to invite the Cabineton their return to consider these representations. The possibility ofincreasing our offer of mitigatory aid to Malaysia and Singapore inthe light of the decision to accelerate our withdrawal should beconsidered separately; and no commitment in this respect should be incurred meanwhile. But there would be no objection to theCommonwealth Secretary&apos;s informing the Malaysian and Singapore
Equipment ofthe ForcesF-lll aircraftGovernments that we should be willing to discuss with them, at a later stage, the aid implications of our accelerated withdrawal. TheCabinet agreed that we should not abrogate unilaterally the Anglo/Malaysian Defence Agreement; but we should need to negotiate withthe Malaysian Government a re-interpretation of it, in order to bring it into conformity with our new policy. We should not retain aspecial capability for use in the Far East after our withdrawal. Butthe general capability which we retained in Europe would beavailable to be deployed overseas; and we could assure our commonwealth partners and allies that in this way we should retain the ability to help them if circumstances in our own judgmentdemanded it. It must be clearly understood, however, that we couldnot give any advance undertaking to implement that capability. Asregards our membership of the South East Asia Treaty organisation the view of the Cabinet was that, since our only Treaty commitmentwas to consult and there was no obligation to provide forces, we neednot necessarily withdraw from the Treaty, provided that there wasno question of additional military equipment specifically related tothis commitment (e.g., transport aircraft). The Foreign secretary should, if he thought advisable, arrange for a Minister to visit thoseStates whose interests were involved in our withdrawal from thePersian Gulf, in order to give them advance warning of theannouncement we proposed to make. It would also be necessaryfor the forthcoming statement of the Governmenfs economic measures to include some reference to the offset arrangement for financing the costs of our forces in Germany; and furtherconsideration should be given to this question.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the process of withdrawing our forces fromMalaysia and Singapore should be completed by the endof the financial year 1970-71.(2) Agreed that we should withdraw our forces from the persian gulf not later than the same time.(3) Agreed that their decisions under Conclusions (1) and (2)above should be announced in due course, subject to anyfurther discussion which might be required in the lightof the results of the forthcoming visits by the foreign secretary to the United States and the commonwealth secretary to the Far East.(4) Invited the Foreign Secretary, the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Secretary of State for Defence toconsider what reference should be made, in theforthcoming statement on reductions in expenditure, tothe arrangements for financing the costs of British troopsin Germany.The Defence Secretary said that public comment hadconcentrated on cancellation of the order for F-lll aircraft as a prime candidate for inclusion in the Governmenfs measures toreduce public expenditure.   This was perhaps understandable; but
in his view cancellation of this order was the last step which theGovernment should contemplate if they were to pay proper regardto defence needs. The decision in this matter should turn on whether we needed the capability which the F-lll would provide since, if we did, there was no doubt that the F-lll was the cheapest, most efficient and most expeditious way of providing it. The requirement for this capability had been accepted by his colleagues on a numberof occasions in the past; and they had continued to accept it despite the decision to withdraw from our commitments in the Far East bythe mid-1970s. In addition to its strike capability, the aircraft was important for reconnaissance purposes; and there was no other aircraft available which could take its place in this respect. the requirement for an aircraft of this type in the European theatre was now greater than in the past, since NATO had recently revised itsstrategy in a direction which Her Majesty&apos;s Government hadadvocated consistently over recent years. NATO strategy had previously been based on the concept of response by massiveconventional forces to any conventional attack; there had, however,never been a prospect of the NATO partners being able to provideconventional forces on the scale required, so that effectively theprevious strategy had implied an immediate nuclear response to any major attack and all available strike aircraft had been accordinglyallocated to the nuclear role. A more realistic strategy had now beenaccepted, based on the concept of providing sufficient conventional forces to hold any attack for at least long enough to allow time for arational decision to be taken on the employment of nuclear weapons.As a result of this change of strategy, 90 per cent of strike aircraft had now been released for the support of conventional forces. recent events in the Middle East had confirmed that in modern conditions it was impossible to win battles without air superiority. Largenumbers of tactical, aircraft were now deployed in Eastern Europewith the role of supporting ground forces; and, in the event of a war,it would be crucial to destroy these aircraft on the ground. To do so,however, would require an attacking aircraft which could penetratesophisticated air defences and could operate at low level, in allweathers and at night. Only the F-lll could meet these requirements. The Phantom aircraft was too limited in range; andto equip the Buccaneer for this role would take seven years and costas much on development as would purchase of the F-lll.It might be asked why the United Kingdom should be the onlyEuropean partner to provide this capability. First, only Britishairfields were out of range of a surprise attack. Second, withoutthe F-lll, our contribution to NATO would be wholly inadequate.Even with the F-lll, our defence budget in the early 1970s would still be less than that of France and Germany. We were at presentproviding only one-fifth of the number of ground troOps thatGermany provided and only one-quarter of the number of supportaircraft and fighters. This disproportion would be made good byprovision of F-llls, though we would be providing only 50 of these in place of the present 150 Canberra bombers.   An important
advantage of making our NATO contribution in this form was that it did not involve us in overseas stationing costs.The United States were planning to maintain F-lll aircraft inEurope; but our own contribution of F-llls would constitute a significant increase in the total strike capability. If we were to cancel the F-lll, our troops would be entirely dependent for air cover on american or French aircraft. It was not acceptable that these powers should be the only ones with an advanced air strike capability,bearing in mind that it was always possible that the United states might decide to reduce their capability in Europe, particularly at atime when our own military presence in the Far East was being withdrawn.While the decision on whether to cancel the order should turnon our need for the capability which the F-lll would provide, thedamaging consequences of losing the offset agreement should not be ignored. If we were to lose the prospect of sales under the offset agreement, the whole future of some important firms, notablyHandley Page and Fairfields, would be put at risk.If his colleagues were to take the view that it was imperative tosecure further defence savings equivalent to those which would beproduced by cancelling the order for F-llls, it would be preferable to look for them elsewhere in the defence field. If we cancelled theF-lll order, we should be putting at risk the lives of British troopsin any future conflict; and there should be no question of the government&apos;s accepting this risk simply in order to meet publicpressure for a symbolic gesture.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the total cost of theF-lll aircraft over the period up to April 1976 would be  400million. If the order were cancelled, we should incur nugatoryexpenditure of some  54 million, mostly in dollars though part wouldbe covered by the offset agreement. We should, however, secure atotal saving over a ten-year period of  350 million. The saving in1969-70 would be  10 million, and in 1970-71 would be  20 million,with larger savings in later years. Thus, the ratio of cancellationcosts to savings was much more favourable in respect of the F-lllthan it would be if we were to cancel the order for Phantom aircraft or to withdraw from the Concorde project. We had embarked ona very large programme of purchase of American aircraft, whichwould cost us  800 million in total. This was more than we could afford; but the F-lll was the only item which it would pay us to cancel. The offset agreement had recently been extended to coverfurther sales to the value of $100 million, making a total of$825 million. If we cancelled the F-lll, we should certainly lose the$100 million additional sales. The credit for the third-party sale toSaudi Arabia of $265 million would not be affected. We had already secured offset sales of $180 million. In all, cancellation would mean that total sales under the offset agreement might be reduced to some$200-260 million. But the advantages of the offset agreement should,be kept in perspective. Export earnings under the agreement did not bring any net benefit to the balance of payments; they simplyprevented the deterioration which would otherwise result from
purchase of the aircraft. It was also claimed that the offsetarrangements were valuable in that they enabled British firms to gaina foothold in the United States market; but this was of limitedadvantage, since it was certain that, once the target for offset saleshad been reached, the barriers to sales in the United States would immediately reappear.When the Government had originally agreed to the purchaseof F-llls, the case for this had been presented primarily in terms ofour role in the Far East; but, in the light of the decision which theCabinet had just taken about the contraction of our commitments in this area the purchase could no longer be justified on that ground.In Europe, the British F-llls would simply be an extension to themain United States force. None of our European partners had thought it necessary to provide such aircraft themselves; and it was unacceptable for us, in a weaker economic position, to do so. while there was no ideal substitute for the F-lll, it should be possible touse Phantom aircraft in the same role; they would be less effectivebut would represent a standard of equipment comparable with thatof our European partners.  The order should therefore be cancelled.In discussion there was considerable support for proceeding with the purchase of F-llls. It was urged that, if the order were cancelled, we should then have no means under our own control of ensuring air superiority over the battlefield in any conflict in which british troops might be involved. It would be unwise to rely on theUnited States for this; we could not safely assume that they wouldbe prepared to maintain a force of F-llls indefinitely in Europe. Thenature of the NATO Alliance might change over time; and theUnited States might not always be ready to use their aircraft to meet our commitments. Our own force of F-llls would in no sense be aduplication of the United States capability; it would represent a significant extension of that capability.While one of the objects in acquiring the F-lll had been tosupport our role in the Far East, it had always been intended thatthe aircraft should also play a vital part in the European theatre;and we had never planned to deploy many of them in the Far East.When the purchase was originally agreed, it had been envisaged thatwe should buy 150 aircraft: the reduction to 50, reflected the present intention that they should be used primarily in a European role. Itwas possible, however, that they might also need to be used in theFar East in the period before we withdrew from that area. even after that time, the Cabinet had agreed on assurances to our allies in the Far East that we would be ready to use our general capabilityin Europe to assist them if need arose. This would be an emptyassurance if we did not retain the means of helping them; and the-F-lll was the only aircraft which could be deployed from Europe-to the Far East with the necessary speed.Without the F-lll, our contribution to NATO would beregarded as completely inadequate by our partners in the alliance,since we contributed proportionately far less than they did in other,types of aircraft and in ground troops. It was to our advantage to
make our contribution in the form of an advanced aircraft: this wasa field where we had a natural lead because of our long and continuous experience; and an increase in our contribution in groundtroops, which we should probably be pressed to provide if the F-lllwere cancelled, would be far more expensive.The benefits of the offset agreement could not be ignored. they represented actual export earnings, while the earnings which thesame resources might secure elsewhere must necessarily behypothetical. Moreover, the immediate effect of cancellation wouldbe that in the critical year 1968-69 we should have to pay out 38 million in cancellation charges, mostly in the form of dollars.It could not be argued that the defence budget would be excessive if we proceeded with purchase of the F-lll. On this basis,it would still fall to some  1,650 million by 1972. This would represent a level of defence expenditure lower than that of Franceand Germany, while in terms of manpower we should by that time be only a little stronger than Holland. This was the lowest level ofdefence spending consistent with our retaining any worthwhileinfluence in Europe and in the world. If, however, the viewwere taken that it was imperative in our present economic circumstances to secure savings of the order of those that wouldresult from cancelling the F-lll, it would be preferable to seek themin other parts of the defence budget; and in that event cancellation ofthe Harrier aircraft would be one possibility that should be considered.On the other hand it was strongly urged that cancellation of theF-lll order was justified. It was inevitable that we should rely onthe United States force of F-llls as the main instrument for fulfillingthe strike role in Europe: and, if circumstances ever arose wherethat force were not available, a force of 50 British F-llls would be inadequate. Our NATO partners were content to rely on the UnitedStates capability; and we should do likewise. The originaljustification for purchase of the F-llls was primarily to support ourrole in the Far East; and it was unlikely that the Government wouldhave agreed to the purchase solely for the European role. If we wereto liquidate our commitments in the Far East, it was essential thatthe implications of this should be followed through, and be seen to befollowed through, in the field of weapons and equipment. While weshould be giving assurances to our allies in the Far East that we wouldbe prepared, if necessary, to use our general capability to assist them,there could be no question of our maintaining a special capabilityfor this purpose.. In assessing the relative size of our contribution to NATO, itwas necessary to bring the Polaris missile into the balance: we couldnot afford to provide both Polaris and the F-lll for NATO when our partners were providing neither of these. If it was thought desirable that our NATO contribution should primarily take the formof advanced equipment, it should be equipment made in this countryand not bought abroad.The economic case for cancellation was also very strong. the cancellation charges would be inconsiderable in relation to futuresavings. There was a good prospect that the industrial resources now
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,6th January, 1968.devoted to securing sales under the offset agreement could be diverted to exports which would bring a positive balance of payments benefit;and this was more true of these resources than of those which wouldbe released by the reductions in the social services which were underconsideration.It was difficult to see how defence savings equivalent to thosewhich would flow from cancelling the F-lll could be secured by any alternative means. Any attempt to secure them by a series of minoreconomies would carry no conviction and have no impact on confidence. It would be a serious matter to contemplate cancellation of the Harrier aircraft as a substitute for cancelling the F-lll. TheHarrier had reasonable export prospects; and to abandon it would gravely damage the military capacity of the British aircraft industry.The Defence Secretary said that if, despite the considerations hehad advanced, the Cabinet were to favour cancellation of the F-lll,he would like the opportunity to put before them proposals for alternative measures to secure equivalent savings on defence. Hewould have to take account of the effect of cancellation of the F-lllon the cost of the defence programme generally. The balance ofthe Forces must be preserved, and cancellation of the F-lll would inevitably entail some increased expenditure in other parts of theprogramme.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that, while the Cabinet recognised the force of the arguments infavour of the F-lll, they were no less impressed by the ease forcancelling the order and were disposed, on balance, to feel that itshould be cancelled. But it would be open to the Defence Secretary,if he wished to press for reconsideration of this issue, to bring beforethe Cabinet in the following week proposals for alternative measuresto secure equivalent savings in the defence field.The Cabinet (5) Invited the Defence Secretary, if he so wished, to proposealternative economies with a view to securing defencesavings no less than would be secured by cancelling theorder for F-lll aircraft.(6) Subject to further consideration of the alternative proposals under Conclusion (5) above, favoured cancellation ofthe order.
