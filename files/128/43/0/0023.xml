The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Oversea affairs middle East(previous reference:CC (68) 13thConclusions,Minute 3)People&apos;republic of theSouthernYemen(Previous.ReferenceCC (68) 16thConclusions,Minute 2)The Budget(previous reference:CC (68) 22ndConclusions,Minute 2)Rhodesia(previous reference:CC (68) 20thConclusions,Minute 3)secret. The Foreign Secretary said that an Israeli attack on Jordanthe previous night appeared to be an isolated raid and not anattempt to occupy fresh territory. It had been prompted by Israeliindignation resulting from the incident in which a bus carryingIsraeli children had been blown up by a mine on 18th March. his information was that it did not necessarily mean the end of theconciliation mission of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Gunnar Jarring. It was possiblethat the Security Council would meet to discuss the attack; and inthat case the United Kingdom Representative would say that wedeplored all breaches of the cease-fire whichever side was responsible for them.The Foreign Secretary said that recent events in the southern yemen were obscure. The Government of the Southern Yemen,with the support of the armed forces, remained in control. But it seemed possible that there had been an attempted coup by someextremist elements which had now been removed from power.There had been no suggestion that we were involved and no threat to the British community. He would be discussing the generalsituation in the Southern Yemen with our Ambassador who wasin this country; and he would shortly make recommendations withregard to our future aid to the Southern Yemen.The Foreign Secretary said that reaction overseas to the Budgethad, with few exceptions, been very favourable.The Foreign Secretary said that the debate on Rhodesia in theSecurity Council had so far been relatively restrained. There was ademand to intensify sanctions: and the Indian Representative hadnot excluded the use of force. The Afro-Asian group were draftinga resolution; but they were also considering entering into private discussion with us on the basis of our own draft. The previous day the Ministers principally concerned had considered the termsof a draft resolution which we might table as an alternative to amore extreme resolution. They had taken the view that we shouldbe prepared to agree to the introduction of comprehensivemandatory sanctions on all trade with Rhodesia, while avoidinganything which might lead to action against Portugal or SouthAfrica. The draft also provided for certain measures, such as a banon the supply of radio and television material and a ban on travelby active supporters of the regime, which were designed to outlawRhodesia  from   the  civilised   world.    The   United   Kingdom8897
Representative at the United Nations, Lord Caradon, had now been authorised to show the draft resolution, as approved by Ministers,to our Western allies and to discuss its form and content with the afro-Asian group in New York. It had been agreed that beforetabling any such resolution we should inform the South african government of our intentions and make clear that in no circumstances would we contemplate the use of force or economicconfrontation with them. Ministers had also called for furtherurgent study of possible action to prevent the supply of oil throughMozambique; and for an examination of the possibility of a much wider ban on travel to and from Rhodesia, perhaps by requiringRhodesians to obtain visas from our Residual Mission in Salisburyand by taking powers to prohibit the travel of persons between britain and Rhodesia without special permission.In discussion it was pointed out that, with Beira closed to oilshipments, Rhodesia was now being supplied with oil importedthrough the Port of Lourenco Marques. It was difficult to identify the oil which was going to Rhodesia since Rhodesia&apos;s requirements were relatively small and other countries were supplied with oil through Lourenco Marques. An attempt to persuadePortugal to agree to a scheme of oil rationing for Mozambique,which would have cut off or seriously reduced Rhodesia&apos;s oil supplies had failed because of the refusal of the Portuguese andFrench Governments to co-operate: a French oil company was themain supplier of crude oil to the Lourenco Marques refinery. Therewas some hope that in the present highly charged situation in theUnited Nations the Portuguese Government might now be moreprepared to accept a rationing scheme.In further discussion reference was made to the proposals for a constitutional settlement, dealing principally with cross-voting andthe &quot; blocking quarter &quot; for amendments to the Constitution, which sir Alec Douglas-Home had brought back recently from Salisbury.The proposals, which had been conveyed to the Government on abasis of secrecy, were unacceptable since they still did not conform with the second of our six principles, i.e., unimpeded progress towardsmajority rule. But the Opposition were suggesting publicly that theymight be a basis for an acceptable settlement, and were likely to take this line in the House of Commons debate on Rhodesia on27th March. It would therefore be difficult to continue to maintainsecrecy about their nature; and the Commonwealth Secretary would accordingly seek Sir Alec Douglas-Home&apos;s agreement that referencecould if necessary be made to the proposals in the course of the debate. It would be possible to have the debate on the government motion condemning the recent executions which was already on theOrder paper; but there was general agreement that on balance itwould be preferable for the debate to take place on the Adjournmentso that the Opposition would be obliged to state their case from the outset. In either case, it would be necessary for the Governmentto make clear in the course of the debate their attitude with regardto comprehensive mandatory sanctions. By then a resolution mighthave been tabled in the Security Council.
Guyana(previous reference:CC (68) 20thConclusions,Minute 3)In further discussion the following points were made:(a) Not too much importance should be attached to the recentindications of a break in the solidarity of the Rhodesian Front. Nomembers of the Rhodesian Parliament were involved. They werenevertheless a sign of the stresses and strains in the Front whichmight in the long term lead to changes.(b) The recent report of guerilla activity in Rhodesia in which more than 100 infiltrators might have been involved, was probablyconnected with the recent executions and the current debate in theSecurity Council. It was inconceivable that such guerilla activitycould make any significant impression on the Rhodesian regime forsome considerable time to come.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the parliamentary under-Secretary of State for Commonwealth Affairs, Mr. Whitlock,was now in Guyana trying to persuade the Prime Minister of Guyana,Mr. Burnham, to refrain from any precipitate action in the dispute between Guyana and Surinam. As a result, Mr. Burnham had now agreed to delay any action at least until 1st April.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Foreign Secretary andthe Commonwealth Secretary and of the points made in discussion.Prices andincomesLow-paid workers(previous reference:CC (68) 22ndConclusions,Minute 4)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Economic Affairs and the Minister of Labour (C (68) 62)about the treatment of low-paid workers under the governments incomes policy.The Secretary of State for Economic Affairs recalled that at their discussion on 18th March the Cabinet had invited him, with theMinister of Labour, to consider whether any steps could be taken,consistently with the decisions on prices and incomes policy generallywhich the Cabinet had agreed in principle, to make the policy more acceptable as regards low-paid workers in relation to the ceiling of&quot;i\ per cent on wage increases. There were two main problems: first,the difficulty of defining which workers should be regarded as low paid; second, even if the problem of definition could be overcome,there was the difficulty of ensuring that more liberal wage increases would in practice be confined to the low paid. Investigations bythe National Board for Prices and Incomes had shown that evenin those sectors of employment, such as Wages Councils industries,where low-paid workers might be expected to predominate, therewere in fact considerable numbers paid at well above the minimum rates; it would be difficult to devise any practicable means of treatingsuch workers separately from the other workers in the same sectorswho were genuinely low paid. There would, moreover, be greatdifficulty  in  resisting  pressure for  the  maintenance  of wage8897a 3
differentials if specially favourable treatment were given to the low paid; the Trades Union Congress (TUC) in their Economic review for 1968 had frankly recognised that this was an intractable problem.In face of these difficulties, he had reluctantly concluded that it wasnot feasible to provide for increases above the figure of 34 per cent for low-paid workers..There was, however, some scope for discrimination in favourof these workers within the framework of the policy in its present form. In particular, in those industries where the low paidrepresented only a part of the total labour force, it would be possibleto approve settlements which would give increases above 34 per cent for the low paid, provided the increase in the aggregate wage billfor the industry did not exceed that figure. In addition, the low-paid workers in greatest need would be helped by the increases in family allowances. But there was still a real problem in respectof low-paid workers in industries where the general level of wageswas low and where there was consequently little scope fordiscrimination within the limit of 34 per cent. An interdepartmental committee of officials was already studying the problems of a national minimum wage; this work should be continued and if this issuewere raised by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) or bythe TUC, the Government should be prepared to discuss it with them.The Minister of Labour said that he agreed that it was not practicable to provide for increases above the ceiling figure forthe low paid. The greatest difficulty was the resistance by higher paid workers to any erosion of wage differentials. It was not publiclyknown that a study of a national minimum wage was proceedingwithin the Government. It would be some time before it was completed, but it was clear that a national minimum wage wouldbe costly: it was estimated that a minimum of  15 a week, the figuresupported by the TUC, would add  1,700 million to the nationalwage bill, and the consequential effects on higher wage levels would further increase the cost. Thus the economic implications of any move towards a national minimum wage were far-reaching, and itwould therefore be dangerous to broach this issue with the TUC.In discussion there was general agreement that the cabinet should confirm their earlier decision that the incomes policy shouldnot provide for increases above the ceiling figure for low-paid workers. The position of these workers did, however, present a continuing and intractable problem. Many of them because of thenature of their employment could not hope to benefit from higherpay as a result of increased productivity, and their opportunities for higher earnings through increased overtime might well be reducedbecause of the effects of the Budget on the level of economic activity.It was argued that neither prices and incomes policy norincreases in the social wage had in practice secured a fairerdistribution of incomes or improved the relative position of the lowest paid, and that the Government should carry out a fundamentalreappraisal of the problem before committing themselves to a
continuance of present policies for the longer term. There were serious objections to recurrent increases in family allowances as a means of helping low-paid workers. If such increases were offset by adjustments in tax allowances, this would have the undesirableeffect of bringing more people within the scope of income tax.Family allowances gave no help to the childless couple or the familywith only one child. They were, moreover, unpopular with wage earners generally.On the other hand it was argued that the prices and incomes policy in the past had been of real benefit to low-paid workers.Without it, those in the strongest bargaining position would have pressed their advantage at the expense of the rest. The policy could continue to benefit the lowest paid during its next phase if the tradeunions were encouraged to discriminate in favour of these workerswithin the limit of 3-J per cent. But it could not in itself solve the problem of the low-paid worker, since it could not take accountof the size of family. The right course for the future was to tacklethis problem both through the prices and incomes policy and throughincreases in the social wage. The Government should not be deterred from increasing family allowances by their alleged unpopularity,since they were a principal instrument for safeguarding the welfare of children in poor families. The TUC had welcomed the increasein the allowances announced in the Budget and it could fairly be represented that this increase, together with the raising ofsupplementary benefits in the autumn, fulfilled the Governmenfspledge to protect the most vulnerable sections of the communityfrom the full effects of devaluation.There was general agreement that the study of a national minimum wage should be pressed forward, but that there should beno public reference to it.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet reaffirmed their previous decision that the incomes policy should not provide for an exception to the ceiling on wage increases in respect of low-paid workers. The study of a national minimum wage should be pressed forward, but there should be no publicdisclosure of the fact that this study was in progress nor should thequestion of a national minimum wage be raised in the currentconsultations with the CBI and TUC. If either of these bodiesthemselves made proposals affecting low-paid workers, the Secretaryof State for Economic Affairs and the Minister of Labour shouldlisten to what they had to say and should report further to theCabinet if they judged that to be desirable.The Cabinet-(1) Reaffirmed their previous decision that the incomes policy should not provide for an exception to the ceiling onwage increases in respect of low-paid workers.
(2) Invited the Minister of Labour to ensure that the study by officials of a national minimum wage was pressed forward.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs and theMinister of Labour to be guided by the Prime minister&apos;s summing up in their further consultations with the CBIand TUC.Post Office(previous reference:CC (68) 20thConclusions,Minute 5)InlandTelegramServiceCONFIDENTIAL4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Economic Affairs about the discontinuance of the inlandtelegram service (C (68) 61).The Postmaster-General said that although the inland telegramservice was dying it was not, unfortunately, dying fast enough. Theannual total of 65 million messages immediately after the 1939-45War had now fallen to 9 million and the rate was still declining at per cent per annum. On this trend the annual total would havefallen to about 7 million by 1973 when it was proposed to abolish the service. Between now and 1973 the loss on the service would exceed  15 million. Only 1 per cent of the telegrams now sent were on life and death matters : and he could see no justification whateverfor a subsidy in aid of 80 per cent of the remainder. He had already arranged with the Minister of Transport for the abolition of the freerailway telegram service from the beginning of 1968. The SelectCommittee on the Nationalised Industries had reached the conclusionlast year that if the service were to be continued it should be directlysubsidised as a social service. The National Board for Prices and incomes (NBPI) in their recent report had recommended that theservice should either be discontinued with the provision of anemergency service or subsidised by Exchequer grant. He had proposed, and the Ministerial Committee on Industrial Policy had agreed, that the service should be withdrawn not later than 1973 withcontinuing provision for emergency messages (which would includeinter alia emergency call-up for the Services) and a postagram service for greetings if public demand warranted it which would be delivered through the ordinary post. He estimated that by 1973nearly half the homes in the country would have telephones and thetelex and datel (computer link) services would have been greatlyexpanded for business users. He expected too that the Post office would have some success in their campaign to encourage the installation of public telephones in shops. If arrangements fordiscontinuing the service were made over the next five years thiswould avoid any redundancies of Post Office staff and provideample time for consultation with the unions concerned and the PostOffice Users&apos; Council. The Post Office was at present losing 17 million annually on the provision of unremunerative services;with a higher financial target and a huge investment programmebefore them they could not afford to continue to carry such losses.
The Secretary of State for Economic Affairs said that the ministerial Committee on Industrial Policy had thoroughly examined the issues involved and had taken into account the social implications of withdrawing the telegram service. They had reached theconclusion that, provided an emergency service were introduced onthe lines proposed by the Postmaster-General, it would be right towithdraw the present telegram service not later than 1973.In discussion it was suggested that the social implications of theproposal had not been adequately considered. More than half thehomes in the country would be without telephones in 1973 and agreat many people would be shocked by withdrawal of a service onwhich they relied. Those living in remote rural areas could beexpected to be particularly affected. It might be wise to delay a finaldecision until an investigation by, for example, the GovernmentSocial Survey had been completed. Even if it were decided to discontinue the service, an immediate announcement to this effectseemed unnecessary, given that the service would not in fact be withdrawn for another five years, and would be ill-received at a timewhen increases in postal charges were being announced.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the NBPI had alreadypublished recommendations relating to the telegram service as wellas to postal charges. It would be difficult therefore for thePostmaster-General to announce increased charges without at thesame time announcing the Governments decision about the future ofthe telegram service. The case for abolishing the service andreplacing it by an emergency service, which had been developed bythe Postmaster-General and in C (68) 61, was a very cogent one. Ifthe decision were taken to make these changes it would be necessaryshortly to consult the unions involved and once these consultationsbegan the Governments decision could be expected to become public.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas agreement that the inland telegram service should be withdrawn and replaced by an emergency service by 1973. But this decision should not be announced for the present; and preparations to implement it should go ahead only to the extent that this could bedone without risk of public disclosure. Details of the proposed increases in charges by the Post Office should not be announced until after the end of March.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed, subject to (2) below, that the inland telegram service should be discontinued by 1973 and replaced by anemergency service and subject to public demand by apostagram service as proposed in C (68) 61.(2) Invited the Postmaster-General, for the time being, to postpone an announcement of the decision at (1) and to limit preparations to implement it to those which couldbe made without risk of public disclosure of the decision.
(3) Invited the Postmaster-General to delay announcement ofthe detailed increases in charges by the Post Office until after the end of March.CONFIDENTIALEconomicSituationBank Rate(PieviousReference:CC (67) 64thConclusions,Minute 6)5. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet thatBank Rate would be reduced that day from 8 per cent to 1\ per cent.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,21st March, 1968.
