Oversea AffairsT.Mr. J. R. A. Bottomley to Salisbury where he had had talks withMr. Smith, the leader of the illegal regime in Rhodesia, an informalgroup of the Ministers most closely concerned had considered what action we should now take on the Rhodesian problem. Mr.Bottomley&apos;s visit had been a probing operation to establish whethera further meeting between British Ministers and Mr. Smith was likelyto offer any prospect of an honourable settlement of the Rhodesianproblem and to make sure that, if any such meeting were to takeplace, Mr. Smith accepted in advance that any settlement must be inaccordance with our six principles and in particular that for us the&quot; blocking quarter &quot; of elected Africans, the right of appeal to the privy Council on the entrenched provisions of a constitution forRhodesia and the establishment of a broad-based Government to supervise the move of Rhodesia to independence were not negotiablepoints. This had been ensured, although Mr. Smith had stated hisreservations also and had given no indication that he was preparedto make the concessions necessary if we were to achieve an honourablesettlement. A further probing operation had therefore been necessaryto seek to clarify certain ambiguities in Mr. SmiuYs response toMr. Bottomley and to ensure that Mr. Smith was in no doubt of theBritish Governmenfs attitude on the above mentioned points. Butthis having been done it was recognised that Mr. Smith could not beexpected to show his hand except at a meeting at the highest level.A wide variety of possible sites for a meeting with Mr. Smith hadbeen considered against the background of his desire for a neutralsite, but he had now accepted that a meeting might take place in twoof Her Majesty&apos;s Ships at Gibraltar.Although there would be objections among government supporters in Parliament and in the country, and also in manyCommonwealth countries, to a further attempt to reach a settlement with the illegal regime, there were strong grounds for doing so now.We had always said that we were willing to seek an honourablesettlement and we should be open to criticism if we failed to establishwhether a satisfactory basis for this now existed. Mandatorysanctions against the illegal regime were now at their strongest,Mr. Smith had shown signs of an ability to over-ride the extremistsin his regime and it was likely that, if we were not willing to seek asettlement now, the regime in Rhodesia would become more extremeand that South Africa would increasingly support it with very serious consequences for Southern Africa as a whole. We might then facepressure to take the lead in imposing and enforcing sanctions againstSouth Africa, although we had always made it clear that we couldnot contemplate a confrontation with her.It was unlikely that we should succeed in reaching a settlement with Mr. Smith that was acceptable to us. If we were to succeed,there would be broad support in the Labour Party and the country for9495SECRETThe Prime Minister said that, following the visit ofa 2
a settlement provided that it was clearly in accordance with the sixprinciples, even though there would be some who would object toany settlement short of no independence before majority rule(n.i.b.m.r.). Some African Commonwealth countries could beexpected to support such a settlement openly and others, whileobjecting publicly, would privately support it. But it was clear thatwe must expect a very sharp reaction from a number of commonwealth countries. The South African Government, whowere fully aware of the points of difference between ourselves andthe illegal regime, were known to be anxious to see an agreement reached and were believed to be exerting pressure on Mr. Smith tothis end. If we were to fail to reach agreement, we should not have lost anything politically and there would be advantages for us in having demonstrated our willingness to continue to seek a settlementprovided that this did not involve any departure from the sixprinciples. In these circumstances, the balance of advantage lay inhis meeting Mr. Smith in an attempt to reach an honourablesettlement. If the proposed talks were to take place, he would be accompanied at them by the Commonwealth Secretary and the attorney-General.The Commonwealth Secretary said that it would be difficultpolitically and as a matter of duty for us to refuse to hold furthertalks with Mr. Smith. Our attitude had always been that we were willing to reach a settlement with the regime on an acceptable basis and we could only establish whether this now existed by having talks with Mr. Smith himself. There were new elements in the Rhodesiansituation. There was increasing awareness that another opportunityto seek a settlement was unlikely to arise for a long time and that, ifnone was reached, the situation in Rhodesia would deteriorate.There had been political changes in the regime and the mandatorydeath penalty for freedom fighters had been removed. although there would be difficulties with Afro-Asian Commonwealth countries \if we were to have fresh talks with the regime, there had been recentindications that a number of them now accepted the political necessity jfor further exploratory talks.In discussion, the view was expressed that no further talks withMr. Smith should take place and that in any event we should not Iinflate his position by arranging a further meeting between him andthe Prime Minister. Any settlement of the Rhodesian problem thatfell short of n.i.b.m.r. would be seen as a betrayal of the Africans in 1Rhodesia which we had been forced to make out of weakness. It I might have serious economic consequences for us and lead Africans 1in Rhodesia to turn to terrorism. No confidence could be placed in jMr. Smith. He had made it abundantly clear that he was not Iprepared to allow majority rule in Rhodesia in any measurable Iperiod of time and, by negotiating with him, we should further weaken jour position in respect of human rights and race relations which had Jalready been damaged by our actions on Commonwealth immigration. if we were to make a stand against white imperialism, we should have 1a position of principle which would command wide support, as had been clearly shown during the Labour Party Conference.   No 1
settlement with the regime would be acceptable which did notreinforce the six principles by a large, jointly sponsored education programme for Africans there, so that they could rapidly qualify to vote. This should be made a breaking point in any talks. Theremust be provision also for the release of all detainees and for a fulland free election campaign to take place in Rhodesia after their release.On the other hand, it was argued that, although the prospects of achieving an honourable settlement were not good, it would be wrong to refuse talks with Mr. Smith and useless to arrange them unlessthe Prime Minister himself took part. It would be difficult in presentcircumstances to defend publicly the refusal to establish whether asettlement was possible, and this could only be done in talks at thehighest level. If we could achieve a settlement consistent with the six principles, this would command general public acceptance in thiscountry; it had been made clear on a number of occasions that, ifa substantial change of circumstances took place in Rhodesia, wewould be prepared to reconsider our commitment to n.i.b.m.r.There was increasing recognition among African commonwealth countries that the alternative to a settlement was likely to beapartheid, which would be far worse for Africans in Rhodesia, andsome African leaders thought that we should not be serving the best interests of Africans in Rhodesia if we refused to accept a settlement,even if this fell somewhat short of that which had almost been achieved in the talks on HMS Tiger in December 1966. The fact thatwe had ruled out the use of force against the regime and the likelihood that the effectiveness of mandatory sanctions could not long bemaintained left no real alternative for us but to make a further attemptto secure a settlement. Any settlement must, however, be fullyconsistent with the six principles and any derogation from these, forexample, by allowing Chiefs to count in the &quot; blocking quarter &quot; of elected Africans or which made this device in any way less than fully effective, would be unacceptable to us. A settlement would also besubject to a satisfactory test of acceptability in Rhodesia, and, until this had been carried out, sanctions would remain in force. If asettlement on this basis could be reached with Mr. Smith, the PrimeMinister should have authority to accept it on behalf of theGovernment provided that it was fully accepted also by Mr. Smith.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, in seeking to bring down the illegal regime in Rhodesia and to insist onmajority rule there before independence, we had been faced with three major difficulties : the facts of geography had stood in the wayof a successful economic blockade; the accident of history had enabled Rhodesia to enjoy virtual independence for 40 years with a police force and armed services under local control; and, as a resultof a denial of opportunities for education, employment and political activity, responsible African leadership was almost wholly lacking.Nevertheless there was general agreement that if we did not make afurther attempt now to seek an honourable agreement with the illegal
regime no opportunity to do so was likely to arise for at least anotheryear or two, and that in the meantime the regime would at bestconsolidate itself and at worst move rapidly nearer to South africa and to a policy of apartheid. Such a development would not be tothe advantage of the 4 million Africans in the country. On a balanceof the considerations, therefore, the Cabinet endorsed the action that had been taken to resume discussions. They were agreed on the paramount necessity of standing firm on the six principles and ofopposing the perpetuation of white supremacy. They authorised theCommonwealth Secretary, the Attorney-General and himself toinitial an agreement consonant with these principles if Mr. Smithhimself was prepared to do so. If, however, Mr. Smith insisted onreferring any agreement to his colleagues in Salisbury, therepresentatives of the United Kingdom would similarly insist onreferring back to the Cabinet. Every effort would be made to ensurethat, in elaboration of the six principles, agreement was reached atthe talks with Mr. Smith on a programme of African education in rhodesia aimed at ensuring progress towards majority rule, althoughwhether this should be a breaking point in the talks would depend onthe assessment by the three Ministers of the position as a whole. the paramount consideration in the talks from our point of view wouldbe that, whether they resulted in a settlement or not, we must be seen to have maintained our basic policy of refusing to accept the perpetuation of white minority rule in Rhodesia in the long term.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.Vietnam(previous reference:CC (68) 30thConclusions,Minute 5)The Minister of Technology drew attention to the indicationsgiven recently by the Vice-President of the United States, Mr. HubertHumphrey, that in the event of his being successful in the forthcomingPresidential Election he would be prepared to discontinue theAmerican bombing of North Vietnam. It would be desirable for theCabinet to consider what attitude the United Kingdom might adoptif such a change of policy were to occur, and possibly to indicateinformally in advance that the change would have our support.The Prime Minister said that it would not be appropriate for theCabinet to discuss the matter in the absence of the Foreign Secretary,and it would be useful before they did so to know what view theUnited States Secretary of State, Mr. Dean Rusk, held of the progressof the current negotiations in Paris between the representatives of theUnited States Government and of North Vietnam. He would accordingly arrange for the Foreign Secretary to be informed that thematter would be discussed at a meeting of the Cabinet after his return.The Cabinet Agreed to defer to a later meeting discussion of our attitude in the event of a change of United States policy on bombingNorth Vietnam.
CC40(68)confidential parliamentary        2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the affairs House of Commons in the second week after the summer recess. ItFuture Business ,   , , , , . ,    ,. , .Machinery of   was noted that it would be necessary to provide for a debateGovernment    on Rhodesia before the end of the Session and that it would be convenient so to arrange the business that the Southern RhodesiaOrder could be taken on the same occasion.The Prime Minister said that he proposed to make a statement on16th October about the merger already announced between the ministries of Health and Social Security, and about the establishmentof the new Civil Service Department to take over the Civil Servicemanagement functions of the Treasury. He would also mention the merger of the Foreign and Commonwealth Offices, but proposedthat, since the House would wish to be informed on a number of questions of detail flowing from the merger, a fuller statement shouldbe made by the Foreign Secretary on the same day. The statementswould coincide v/ith the laying of the relevant Orders. The Ordergiving effect to the merger of the Ministries of Health and social security would need to be approved by affirmative resolution whichwould be debated on 22nd October, and, if approved, would comeinto effect on 1st November.IndustrialAffairsEngineeringManualWorkers(previous reference:CC (68) 39thConclusions,Minute 3)confidential. The First Secretary of State said that on 24th September theCabinet had agreed that she should not intervene in the dispute inthe engineering industry before the result of the ballot arranged bythe Electrical Trades Union (etu) was known. The voting figures would be available later in the day and were expected to show a large majority against the strike. The result of the ballot arranged by theNational Union of General and Municipal Workers, which was alsoexpected to show a majority against the strike, would be available on11th October. Informal discussions which she had had in the past week with leading personalities in the industry, indicated that,although neither side would formally request it, both the trade unions and the employers were in favour of early intervention by theGovernment. Intervention was, in her view, now unavoidable; herDepartment could not any longer refuse to play its traditional role of conciliator in a dispute of such importance. She considered thatthe right course would be for her to invite the parties to take part inintensive joint discussions under her chairmanship, beginning onMonday, 14th October. It would of course be necessary to pay full regard in these discussions to the implications of any settlement forthe prices and incomes policy and there was no guarantee that astrike could in fact be avoided. But the soundings she had taken inthe industry suggested that there was still some room for manoeuvre,provided care were taken to avoid humiliating the union leaders whohad instigated the strike proposals.
The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the course of action proposed by the First Secretaryof State who should keep the Chancellor of the Exchequer and himself in close touch with the progress of the discussions.The Cabinet-Invited the First Secretary of State to hold joint discussions with representatives of the employers and trade unions inthe engineering industry on the lines indicated in the PrimeMinisters summing up.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,8th October, 1968.
