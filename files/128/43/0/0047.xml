The Minister of Technology sought authority to announce that day, by way of a written Answer to a Parliamentary Question,that he was to meet Dutch and German Ministers in The Hague on25th November in order to discuss the possibility of collaboration between the three countries in the production of fissile materialby the gas centrifuge method. This method would enable fissile material to be produced more cheaply than by the gas diffusionmethod; but, although its theoretical feasibility had been known formany years, it was only relatively recently that it had become apparent to us that it should be technically possible to use theprocess economically on an industrial scale. Once Dutch andGerman scientists had acquired the corresponding technicalexpertise and this was only a matter of time there would be clearadvantage in our joining in a collaborative undertaking with them.Preliminary discussions for this purpose had taken place in recent months, the meeting on 25th November being a further occasion of this kind; and we had kept the United States informed of developments. It had now become necessary, however, to make apublic announcement on the subject at short notice becauseHerr Stoltenberg, the German Minister for Scientific Research, had felt obliged, in view of the German commitment to the EuropeanAtomic Pool (EURATOM), to inform the other members ofEURATOM on the previous day of the proposed meeting on25th November; and, in order that this news should not first reachParliament and the public in this country by way of reports fromthe Continent, the Parliamentary Committee had considered, at anemergency discussion of the subject on the previous day, that,subject to assurances that an announcement would not havean adverse effect on our relations with the United states administration, a brief announcement should be made by way of a written Answer to a Question in Parliament that day. He proposedalso to give the scientific Press some supplementary non-technical information during the afternoon.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the UnitedStates Government had been informed of our intentions and hadnot reacted unfavourably, subject to further discussion of the implications of any wider dissemination of the technical informationinvolved, which was at present classified by agreement between themselves and the Governments of the United Kingdom, Holland9663CC 47 (68)secret.

and Germany. Since it would have been open to the GermanGovernment to develop the centrifuge method on their own andthere was reason to believe that they had already made significantprogress in this direction, there was an advantage in a collaborativescheme which should both promote a more economic method of producing fissile material for peaceful uses and help us to containGerman nuclear aspirations within legitimate channels.In discussion, it was suggested that, even so, the proposedcollaboration could be misrepresented as a means of enabling theGerman Government to manufacture, cheaply, the nuclear weapons which they were at present denied and that we should therefore not proceed further in the matter until they had signed theNon-Proliferation Treaty. Moreover, it was important not to prejudice our relations with the United States Government in othernuclear matters; but it was not certain how far the intentions ofthe German and Dutch Governments, as evidenced by their statement to EUR ATOM could be reconciled with the apparentAmerican stipulation that collaboration should not prejudice the classification agreement governing the exchange of information relating to the centrifuge technique. The Cabinet might thereforebe wise to discuss the matter at greater length before any announcement was made in this country. On the other hand, since a statement had already been made to EURATOM, there was no prospect of keeping the matter secret until there had been further discussions. The disclosure that we proposed to collaborate withGermany in a process which would result in the relatively easyproduction of fissile material might admittedly come as something of a shock to public opinion. Nevertheless, the balance of advantage lay in an unobtrusive announcement by way of a written Answer toa Parliamentary Question, provided that this was given the minimum of publicity and that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office andthe Ministry of Technology confined themselves to dealing as breifly as possible with any. questions which might reach them from thePress. Ministers should similarly refrain from comment in theirpublic speeches at this stage.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that consideration of the issues involved had necessarily had to be confined initially to a small group of the Ministers directly concerned, because it had seemed possible at that juncture that thisteountry was ahead of others in the technical developmentsconcerned and it had been essential to preserve this lead, if possible.But now that it had become apparent that Dutch and Germanscientists might well be abreast of us in this respect, the necessityfor extreme secrecy was removed; and the Cabinet might well wishto consider the whole matter in greater detail. It was unfortunate that, meanwhile, the Governments hand had been forced by theGerman Governments statement to EURATOM. It was clear,however, that the choice lay between German development of thenew process, whether alone or in collaboration with the Dutch, andsome form of tripartite collaboration. In these circumstances, itwas agreed that the Minister of Technology should give a written
Non-ProliferationTreaty(previous reference:CC (68) 34thConclusions,Minute 2)Answer to a Parliamentary Question that day on the lines which he proposed. But no further information should be volunteered atthis stage; and our spokesmen at the forthcoming meeting at TheHague should refrain from committing us to further trypartite discussions involving the disclosure of technical details untilMinisters had had an opportunity to consider the matter further,particularly as regards both the German attitude towards theNon-Proliferation Treaty and our nuclear relationship with theUnited States Government, which the Foreign and commonwealth secretary would no doubt consider carefully. The German and dutch authorities should be asked to agree with us in future the timing and form of any public announcement affecting the proposedcollaboration in order that the Cabinet should not again be compelled to take decisions of great potential importance withoutsufficient time for consideration.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that when theDefence and Oversea Policy Committee had discussed the timing of our ratification of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, the majorityview had been in favour of early ratification. There had, however,been a minority view that we should delay ratification until other european countries signed the Treaty and that, in any event, weshould not ratify the Treaty in advance of the United States andthe Soviet Union. He saw no political disadvantages for us if wewere to be the first to ratify the Treaty. It was likely that theUnited States Senate would agree to ratification early in the NewYear and the Soviet Union wished to do so at the same time asthe United States, although she might delay until West germany had signed. Although a number of European countries were not satisfied with the Treaty, none of them had expressed any wish thatwe should not ratify it. He proposed that we should ratify theTreaty in the following week and that a statement should be madein Parliament on 27th November.In discussion it was agreed that, particularly in view of thedecision that had been taken under the previous item on the agendato.announce that we were discussing with Holland and germany the possibility of collaboration in the gas centrifuge method of producing fissile material, we should ratify the Treaty as proposedby the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.The Cabinet-(2) Agreed that we should deposit our instrument of ratification of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in the following week.(3) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary toarrange for a statement to be made in Parliament on27th November about our ratification of the Treaty.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that therehad been no major developments in the Paris talks, though therewere certain minor indications that things were moving in the right direction, for example, the falling-off in North Vietnamese andViet Cong military activity in the Demilitarised Zone.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that in italy the outlook was uncertain following the fall of the Government.Whether there would be a continued coalition or a caretakergovernment would depend on the attitude of the Socialists, who had failed to solve the major problems facing them at their recentparty conference. Meanwhile, the voice of Italy in international affairs was bound to be weakened.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that duringthe past week a low-grade intelligence report had been received that the Soviet Union was about to invade Rumania. The UnitedStates had received reports of an impending Soviet ultimatum toRumania. Over the last few days, there had been further evidence which would be consistent either with an intention to invade or tohold the military exercises in Rumania which had been underdiscussion between the two Governments for some time, although no date for them had been fixed. In these circumstances, he had thought it wise to draw the attention of the Soviet Ambassador tothe rumours which were circulating, to remind him of our attitude and to ask him whether he could reassure us about Soviet intentions.The Soviet Ambassador^ reply had been that he was not aware ofany such rumours. We should not make too much of the reportshe had mentioned, and there should be no public reference to them.However, if there were any serious possibility of an invasion hewould have to cancel his forthcoming visit to Pakistan and we shouldhave to consult our North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)allies.If the Soviet Union were to attack a NATO country, the issues were clear-cut. If they attacked Rumania or another Warsaw Pactcountry, there was nothing we could do about it, though we should clearly have to hold consultations in NATO. These however would inevitably lead to a discussion of our attitude in the event of a soviet move against Yugoslavia; and the Alliance might have to formulate its position more precisely. The Yugoslavs had not sofar suggested that the situation should be discussed with them, andhe had not been in touch with them about the rumours which werecurrent. They appeared to be well content with the warningconveyed to the Soviet bloc in the communique of the recent north atlantic Council meeting, which however in no way added to NATO&apos;s formal commitments. The Yugoslavs would certainlyresist any Soviet move against them. The attitude of the Rumanianswas less clear, but there were reports that they would resist.In discussion, the point was made that a Soviet move intoRumania could very easily be combined with, and might therefore
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,22nd November, 1968.CC 47 (68)be quickly followed by, an onward thrust into Yugoslavia. Afterthe Czechoslovak crisis, there had been some criticism in the north atlantic Council that those members who had information aboutSoviet moves had been slow to pass it on to their colleagues and consult with them. It was important to avoid any recurrence of thisby keeping our NATO allies informed and consulting them at anearly stage. If the Soviet Union knew what our reaction to a Sovietinvasion would be, this might deter an invasion. At some stage,it might be necessary to discuss the current situation with the yugoslavs, though we should not enter into any commitmentstowards them without careful consideration and full consultationwith our NATO allies.The Cabinet-Took  note   of  the  statements  by  the  Foreign  and commonwealth Secretary.
