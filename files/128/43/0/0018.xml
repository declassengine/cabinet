secret. The Commonwealth Secretary said that the crisis resultingfrom the execution for murder, on 6th March, of three RhodesianAfricans in defiance of a reprieve by The Queen had been precipitatedby a change in the position of the Rhodesian Chief Justice,Sir Hugh Beadle. In a judgment of 1st March the Appellate Divisionof the Rhodesian High Court, presided over by the Chief Justice,had refused to grant a stay of execution to allow application to bemade direct to the Privy Council for special leave to appeal. Thesolicitors of two of the three condemned men had thereupon lodged a petition to The Queen, who retained the Prerogative of Mercy in any british territory. On the grounds that the men had already beenunder sentence of death for more than two years and had been deprived of their right of appeal to the Privy Council, he had on 3rd March advised Her Majesty to exercise the Royal Prerogativein their favour and to commute their sentences to life imprisonment.The Rhodesian Cabinet had met on 5th March and evidently decidedto proceed with the executions. Their action had outraged opinionnot only in Parliament and in the country, but also in the world at large, especially at the United Nations; and as a result we faced avery difficult situation. The Defence and Oversea Policy Committeewould consider on the following day how the Government shouldreact to this situation and it would be valuable to have the views ofthe Cabinet beforehand. There were three main fields in whichaction was possible: in the United Nations, in regard to the positionof the Rhodesian judges and of those who had been responsible forthe executions this was being examined by the Lord chancellor and the Attorney-General and in connection with the ideas for apossible political settlement which had recently been brought back from Rhodesia by Sir Alec Douglas-Home. On the last point he believed that it was out of the question to have any further discussions with the Rhodesian regime in present circumstances; but before apublic statement was made to this effect he wished to have theapproval of the Cabinet. Throughout the crisis the Governor of rhodesia, Sir Humphrey Gibbs, had shown extraordinary courageand staunchness of character. The Governor thought that the petition to The Queen had been the only hope of saving the lives ofthe condemned men; but he had been powerless to act himself. TheGovernor had advised that the dormant commission empowering the Chief Justice to discharge the duties of the Governor in the eventof the latter&apos;s disability should be revoked; and had now ordered theChief Justice to leave Government House where he had been livingfor the last two years.8810CONFIDENTIAL1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
In discussion there was general agreement with the action of theCommonwealth Secretary in advising The Queen to exercise theRoyal Prerogative in favour of the condemned Africans. It wasalso generally agreed that we should be careful not to reactemotionally to the executions and take hasty decisions which wewould be impotent to carry out in practice. Our reaction should beconsidered in the light of our longer-term policy towards Rhodesia,which was the subject of a paper by the Lord Chancellor to beconsidered by the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee on thefollowing day. The executions had roused indignation throughoutthe world, and we would almost certainly be faced with a meeting ofthe Security Council of the United Nations at which our policy would come under attack. The Committee of Twenty-four and the human rights Commission had before them draft resolutions on the subject and one of these would probably come to the Security Council. Inthe new circumstances created by the executions there was a strong case for intensifying sanctions; and it would not be possible for usto resist a move for comprehensive mandatory sanctions. It mighthowever be necessary for us to make clear in an explanation of votethat we were not prepared to take action which would involve us inan economic confrontation with South Africa. It was also important that we should try to engage the United Nations in a greater degreeof responsibility for policy towards Rhodesia and for the policing of sanctions.There was general agreement that in present circumstances there could be no question of further discussions with the rhodesian regime on the basis of the proposals brought back bySir Alec Douglas-Home. The proposals themselves were less favourable to the Africans than those agreed in HMS Tiger; andMr. Smith would not have the power to enforce their acceptance by his Cabinet even if he himself accepted them. We should not however exclude the possibility of negotiating a settlement in due course with a successor regime of more liberal tendencies. It wassuggested that the time had come when we might call upon public servants in Rhodesia, who had so far been encouraged to stay attheir posts, to abandon the regime. It was pointed out, however,that we must be careful to avoid putting ourselves in a position where we could be held responsible for the breakdown of law and order in rhodesia. Great caution would also be necessary in dealing withsuggestions that those who had been responsible for the executionsshould be charged with murder. The fact that the High Court of rhodesia had authorised the executions gave these people ground forarguing that they had acted legally. We could in any case only take action against them if they were United Kingdom subjects and came within our jurisdiction.In further discussion it was suggested that, in the light of thepublic indignation roused by the executions, we should re-examinethe possibility of taking military action against the Rhodesian regime.It was pointed out however that such an operation would still beopen to the objections that it would require all our available forces
and a six months&apos; build-up; and would now be more difficult to mountthan when it was previously considered since Aden could no longer be used as a base. There would be a grave risk of the operationbeing prolonged indefinitely, and of our becoming inextricablycommitted; even if we were successful, we should be obliged to resume full responsibility for the government of the territory withall the international consequences. On the other hand, the view was expressed that we should consider the possibility of more limitedmilitary operations, such as the bombing of strategic points onRhodesian supply routes and Rhodesian stocks of oil.The suggestion was also made that Parliament should make its attitude towards the executions unequivocally clear by means of aresolution supported by the leaders of all parties on the analogy ofthose passed during the war condemning Nazi atrocities. It wasagreed that such a resolution would need careful drafting and thatthe emphasis should be less on the executions themselves than on the regime&apos;s breach of legality and its refusal to allow an appeal to the privy Council.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the action of the Commonwealth Secretary inadvising The Queen to exercise the Royal Prerogative of Mercy.In reacting to the executions we should be careful to avoidmeaningless gestures. The Defence and Oversea Policy Committeewould consider on the following day the various suggestions whichhad been made in the course of the discussion and in particular thevarious possibilities of intensifying sanctions. The Attorney-general should examine whether those responsible for the executions shouldbe charged with murder; but we must avoid hasty decisions. Thegeneral view of the Cabinet was that any further discussion withthe regime on a possible political settlement was out of the question at present; but the possibility of discussions in the future with a successor regime should not be excluded. The Lord Chancellor andthe Commonwealth Secretary should draft a Motion condemningthe executions which he would invite the Leaders of the opposition parties to sign the Motion should if possible be put down that evening; whether there should be a debate in Parliament would be for later decision.The Cabinet (1) Took note with approval of the Prime Ministers summing up.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor and the commonwealth secretary to draft a Motion on the lines suggested by thePrime Minister in his summing up.The Commonwealth Secretary said that Mauritius was due tobecome independent on 12th March. The internal security situation there was at present extremely precarious. He had therefore been obliged to advise Her Royal Highness Princess Alexandra of Kentto cancel her visit to attend the independence celebrations.   The
Minister of Housing would, however, represent the Government.Although the Mauritius Independence Act contained standardprovisions concerning citizenship, there was no considerable classof persons living in Mauritius, as there had been in Kenya, who wouldunder the Act retain citizenship of the United Kingdom and colonies as their sole citizenship.The Cabinet Took note of the Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s statement.Space PolicyBlack Arrow(previous reference:CC (68) 5thConclusions)confidential. The First Secretary of State said that following the cabinet decisions on public expenditure on the 12th January, he had, as theninvited, arranged for an early review of the Black Arrow project.The existing contracts for Black Arrow would expire on the31st March, 1968, and, if the programme were to continue, new contracts would need to be placed well before that date. The black arrow programme had therefore been re-examined by officials inthe context of our general policy in the field of science and technology and of the continuing need to economise in public expenditure and make the best use of the available resources. Aninterdepartmentally agreed report on the project had been considered at a meeting of the Ministerial Committee on Science and Technologyon 28th February. The Committee had reached a unanimous agreement that the Black Arrow programme should be continued fora further year from the 1st April, 1968, on the basis that the Ministryof Technology would find compensating savings for additional provision required in 1968-69 within Part (1) of the Civil Technologypublic expenditure block and their Civil Estimates for 1968-69;that the continuation of the programme in 1969-70 would be for subsequent decision in the light of further consideration of the project and of the method of making financial provision for it; and that the justification for the retention in the programme of the developmentof a launcher would be reviewed at official level within the next sixmonths. These decisions were satisfactory in that they would enable us in 1968-69, without any net increase in public expenditure, toretain some capability in the space field while the issues of policy to which he had referred were being fully examined.In discussion there was general support for the conclusion of the ministerial Committee on Science and Technology. The Chancellorof the Exchequer said that when the programme for 1969-70 came to be considered he would propose that for 1969-70 and subsequent years expenditure of the Ministry of Technology on Black Arrowand other space programmes should be consolidated with theDepartments total programme of civil research and thus be includedin the Civil Technology block of public expenditure.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said it wasagreed that the Black Arrow programme should be continued for afurther year from the 1st April, 1968, on the conditions outlined by
SECRET*4. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of future policy on productivity, prices and incomes on the basis of memoranda by theSecretary of State for Economic Affairs (C (68) 45) and the Presidentof the Board of Trade (C (68) 46). The Cabinet also had before thema further memorandum by the Secretary of State for economic affairs (C (68) 54) on the enforcement of statutory powers over prices and incomes, together with a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet,which was circulated at the meeting, summarising the existing and proposed statutory powers.  A copy of this note is annexed.The Prime Minister recalled that there had been generalagreement at the Cabinefs previous discussion that, as a means ofeasing the position of the low-paid worker, family allowances shouldbe increased, the cost being offset by tax adjustments and savings inthe field of social security. They had also invited the Prices and incomes Committee to examine the alternative possible means of controlling price increases; but the Committee had not yet completed their consideration of this question. The Cabinet had further agreed in principle that any new legislation should incorporate powers tocontrol rent increases; and the Housing Committee had nowexamined in sufficient detail the statutory powers which could betaken in this respect to make it possible for a passage on rent control to be included in any general announcement on prices and incomes policy.There remained the question of incomes. In their previousdiscussions, the majority of the Cabinet had appeared to be moving towards agreement that it would be necessary to introduce fresh legislation extending the existing powers. The extent to which theGovernment should adopt a more stringent policy depended,however, in part on how far such a policy would in practice beworkable; and since the National Board for Prices and Incomes(NBPI) would have an important role to play in this respect,and the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs had discussedconfidentially with the Chairman of the Board the kind of approach which was now under consideration. The Chairman had undertaken to consider the issues involved; and it might be necessary to discuss them further with him before final decisions were taken. TheCabinet would also need to bear in mind that in the near future a* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.secret the First Secretary of State. The question of continuing theprogramme in 1969-70 would be referred to the Cabinet in due course.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the report by the first secretary of State and of the points made in discussion.
number of announcements would have to be made, following reports by the NBPI, of increases in prices and charges in the nationalised industries.The Secretary of State for Economic Affairs said that he was not proposing any changes in the enforcement machinery provided under existing statutory powers; and the problems of enforcement would thus be the same in kind as those already encountered under theexisting policy. If, however, a stricter policy were introduced,including an extension of the maximum period of standstill on wage and price increases from seven months to twelve, and a prohibition on retrospective wage payments following the imposition of a standstill, a more frequent use of statutory powers would clearly benecessary and there would be more cases to be dealt with over a widerarea of enforcement. So far as incomes were concerned, enforcementwould be directed in the first place against the employer by requiringhim to defer implementation of a wage increase. If the employercomplied but pressure were exerted upon him by his employees togrant the increase, the trade unions or workers concerned might come within the scope of statutory sanctions and it would be for the attorney-General to decide in any particular case whetherproceedings should be instituted. The sanctions would, as at present,take the form of fines; but there would remain, in addition, thepossibility of imprisonment for non-payment of fines. The criminla justice Act, 1967, had reduced this possibility by providing for other means, notably attachment of earnings, for securing payment of fines;but it would still be possible for an individual who was determined to go to prison to do so. This, however, was already the position inrelation to the existing statutory powers, including relativelyuncontroversial provisions such as the requirement under the prices and Incomes Act, 1966, to give evidence to the NBPI. If workersattempted to force an employer to contravene a statutory Order by various forms of industrial action short of strikes, the Governmentcould face great difficulties in instituting a successful prosecution.Nevertheless, the primary object of the statutory powers was toprevent wages increases in contravention of the policy; and theyshould be made effective for their purpose.The Attorney-General said that the difficulties of bringing legal proceedings under the proposed extended statutory powers would beincreased if these powers were to be exercised by the government themselves without, reference to the NBPI. The courts would bemore sympathetic towards prosecutions if the relevant Order hadbeen made in pursuance of a recommendation by an independent body such as the NBPI. The courts were traditionally reluctant to intervene in contractual arrangements between employers and employees; and they would be particularly hesitant where the employer was a statutory board or local authority. His colleagues should be fully aware of these difficulties in considering the case fora more stringent policy.In discussion it was argued that the extended statutory powersproposed in C (68) 45 would be more drastic than those in Part IV
SECRE19of the Prices and Incomes Act, 1966, which had only been accepted as a crisis measure for a short period. There must be considerable doubt whether it would be possible to secure the enactment oflegislation on these lines; the attitude of the Governments supporters,following a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party on theprevious day, was still uncertain. Moreover, it should not beassumed that, by taking more rigorous statutory powers, theGovernment would automatically secure a correspondingly greatereffect in terms of wage restraint. It was doubtful if the marginaleffect on wage movements, which was probably all that could beexpected of any incomes policy, warranted incurring the risksattendant on new legislation. The Government should not, out ofdeference to public expectations at home and abroad, seek tointroduce a more stringent policy than they could in fact enforce.While the presentational impact of such measures might reinforceconfidence in sterling in the short run, these benefits would be morethan offset in the longer term when it was seen that the policy couldnot be implemented. In particular, it would not be possible to gainacceptance for a policy which bore more heavily on wages than on other incomes and prices. But prices were bound to rise indeed,they must be allowed to rise in the post-devaluation period, since itwould otherwise be necessary to increase taxation disproportionatelyin order to regulate demand. Similarly, it would be unwise to attemptto restrict profits, because this would prejudice the increased industrial investment which was vital to our economic recovery. In view ofthese inhibitions on the control over other forms of income, thecontrol over wages should be correspondingly limited.Moreover, even if extended statutory powers were secured,situations were likely to arise in which they could not in practice be used. It might be possible for the policy to survive challenge inthe less essential sectors of the economy; but, if it led to major strikes in key sectors such as fuel and transport, it would not be practicable to deal with these by enforcing the statutory powers. The seamen&apos;strike of 1966 had illustrated that to stand up to a major strikedid not always benefit the economy or reinforce confidence in sterling.The Governments firmness in handling that strike had inevitablycontributed to the economic crisis which had required the deflationarymeasures of July 1966. For these reasons the Government should avoid fresh legislation and should confine themselves to putting intoeffect the existing powers in Part II of the Act of 1966, which included the power to require statutory notification of price and wage increases but had not yet been used. The maximum period of deferment of price and wage increases would, admittedly, be reducedto three months; but it might be worth accepting this in order toavoid the dangers of fresh legislation and of major confrontationswith the trade unions.Even if it were thought to be insufficient to activate Part II ofthe Act of 1966, it should still be unnecessary to go as far as was proposed in C (68) 45.  Legislation could be introduced to maintain
in force the powers in the Prices and Incomes Act, 1967; and these might be made renewable annually by Order subject to affirmative resolution. It might also be acceptable to extend the maximum period of deferment for wage and price increases from seven to twelve months; but it would be wise to stop short of prohibitingretrospective wage payments and to abandon the proposal that theGovernment themselves should exercise the delaying powers without reference to the NBPI. Further consideration should also be givento the administrative practicability of the proposals in C (68) 45, inview of the uncertainty about the extent of the burden of case-work involved for Departments and for the NBPI.Against this, it was argued that unless the Government nowintroduced a policy which was, and was seen to be, stricter thanthe existing policy, the effects on international confidence in sterling would be liable to be very serious. Ever since they took office theGovernment, rightly or wrongly, had made the prices and incomes policy central to their whole economic strategy; and they could not now retreat from this position. In the eyes of our creditors overseasthe effects of a severe Budget would be nullified if it were notaccompanied by a more stringent prices and incomes policy. Thepresent policy had resulted in an increase of some 6 per cent in average hourly wage rates in 1967, while prices had risen by only  per cent. In effect, therefore, there had been an increase of4 per cent in real wages, which had not been earned by higher productivity. In January 1968 the average hourly wage rate had increased by a further 2 per cent. Unless the Government introduced a policy which was judged to offer a real prospect of improving onthese results, the impact on foreign opinion would be such that thenew parity of sterling, which was not yet assured despite the recentdevaluation, would be put once again at risk. Already that morning the exchange rate of sterling in the market had fallen below the newparity.The dangers to the sterling parity, however, had to be considered in relation to the present international monetary situation. As aresult of our own devaluation the dollar, as the other reserve currency,had come under pressure; and there was currently considerablespeculation in the market, based on fears that the United states administration would eventually be compelled to increase the dollarprice of gold. These fears were not necessarily without foundation;indeed, unless the war in Vietnam were brought to a swift conclusion,the United States might be faced eventually with the need either toincrease the price of gold or to demonetise it. Sterling would inevitably have to follow any change in the exchange value of the dollar; and it followed that, so long as the present tension continued in the international monetary situation, it would not be possible toput the present parity of sterling beyond challenge, either by a strictprices and incomes policy or by any other means. We should not allow ourselves, therefore, to be compelled by concern for the sterlingparity to adopt a more drastic policy on prices and incomes than we could hope to implement in terms of political realism.  On the
other hand this in no way relieved us of the obligation to take allpossible action to strengthen our economy. Otherwise we mightbe forced into a second devaluation, while the dollar still maintainedits position. And, even if the dollar were subsequently driven tofollow the downward adjustment of sterling, the political andeconomic consequences of the latter would be disastrous for us. Inparticular we should face the prospect of a competitive readjustmentof all the other major currencies; and in that event we should notonly forfeit the benefits of our own devaluation but also riskprecipitating a period of international monetary disorder, coupled with a developing shortage of international financial liquidity, whichcould generate a contracting spiral of international trade and are currence of the conditions of the early 1930s. The fact that theUnited States Administration were known to be acutely aware ofthese dangers did not relieve the Government of the responsibilityof adopting the type of prices and incomes policy which would be most likely to avert a major loss of international confidence in sterling.In further discussion it was agreed that there was great forcein these arguments, provided that, in deciding their policy on prices and incomes, the Government distinguished sufficiently betweenstrength and a mere show of strength. In this connection there were two features of the proposals in C (68) 45 which presented particular difficulty. First, it was intended that the ceiling on wage increases should apply to all increases, including those arising from negotiations at plant level as well as at national level. But, if we could succeed in holding nationally negotiated increases to an average of 3J percent, could we not then afford to ignore local wage drift and stillensure that the overall increase in incomes per head did not exceedsome 6 per cent over the next 12 months? On the other hand thewhole concept of the ceiling would be put at risk if control did not extend to locally negotiated increases, particularly in industries suchas engineering and construction, where local wage drift was mor significant than nationally negotiated increases. But, given that itwas desirable to control local increases, was it in fact practicable to scrutinise all plant bargains? Further information was needed onthe number of locally negotiated increases, the proportion of thesewhich would be subject to statutory notification, the dimensions ofthe task of vetting such increases and the staff resources which wouldbe needed. It might be necessary to consider the scope for limiting the range of statutory notification (for example by confining it toestablishments above a certain size) and the extent to which thevetting of increases could be made selective in order to reduce thetask to manageable proportions.Second, the proposal that the Government themselves should exercise the proposed powers without reference to the NBPI was open to grave objection. To proceed in this way would put theGovernment in the position of directly fixing wage levels, locally aswell as nationally.   It was not clear whether the Departments
concerned could deal effectively with such a task; and it would bedifficult to persuade industry and the public that they had theresources or the expertise to do so with thoroughness and fairness.Further thought should be given to the feasibility of making theexercise of statutory powers dependent on reference to the NBPI.The following additional points were made:(a) If the Governments object was to secure a significant reduction in real wages over the next 12 months, the public shouldbe told this plainly. Only if this were done and other measures were taken to ensure equality of sacrifice as between wage and non-wageincomes would there be any prospect of making the policy effective and preventing unjustified expectations of higher living standards.On the other hand the Government were not trying to achieve morethan a slight reduction in reel wages over the next 12 months,although the reduction would admittedly be more significant for thosegroups which could not benefit from increased earning opportunitiessuch as additional overtime.(b) A ceiling of per cent was too low; 4 per cent would bemore realistic. Moreover, whatever figure was fixed, it was a disadvantage of the present arrangements that individual wage settlements were considered in isolation. In fact, however, only alimited increase was permissible for the economy as a whole; and,if one section of workers received a relatively generous increase,others would have to be content with less. There was much to besaid for the concept of a national dividend (i.e., a global sum availablefor wage increases, to be shared out between the different claimants)as distinct from a uniform permissible percentage increase.(c) The proposal to prohibit retrospective wage payments inrespect of periods during which an increase had been deferred underthe statutory powers would be bitterly opposed by the trade unions and would present considerable difficulties of enforcement. Sometrade unions were already beginning to press for such retrospectivepayments; and this tendency could be expected to increase under astricter incomes policy. The shorter the maximum period of deferment of increases, the more important it would be to prohibitretrospection.(d) It was proposed in C (68) 45 that the statutory powers of deferment should be directed at increases in the pay of workersin particular establishments instead of being related to the implementation of wage agreements as under the existing statutory powers. This proposal was directed solely to making theadministration of the statutory powers more effective. The presentsystem suffered from the weakness that, if the implementation of aparticular agreement were deferred, there was nothing to preventthe parties from reaching a different agreement for substantially thesame increase.(e) If the Cabinet were to decide against fresh legislation, itwould not then be possible to introduce control of rent increasesunless this were embodied in a separate Bill.
The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that themajority view of the Cabinet favoured the introduction of legislationincorporating extended statutory powers but that there was a difference of view on whether these powers should be as proposed inC (68) 45 or should be more limited. There were doubts in particular on two major points. First, Ministers were not clear whether it wasfeasible to extend the system of notification and vetting to coverall wage increases at plant level as well as national increases. TheCabinet needed further information on the dimensions of such a task and the resources which would be necessary to carry it out. Second,there were considerable misgivings about the proposal that theGovernment should themselves be empowered to exercise theproposed statutory powers without reference to the NBPI. TheSecretary of State for Economic Affairs, in consultation with theMinister of Labour, should circulate a memorandum exploring these problems further and examining the respective merits of the proposalsfor statutory powers in their present form and a modified versionwhich would meet the difficulties which the Cabinet felt on the two major points which he had mentioned. This would not preclude adecision, if that were the Cabinefs wish, either against fresh legislation in any form or in favour of less extensive statutory powers,on the lines of those available in Part II of the Act of 1966 asreinforced by the Act of 1967. These issues, together withoutstanding questions on the content of future prices and incomes policy, would be for further consideration by the Cabinet on12th March, with a view to ratification of the final decision at theBudget Cabinet on 18th March. The Secretary of State for economic affairs, together with the Minister of Labour, should also arrange todiscuss further with the Chairman of the NBPI the practical problemsof administering a more stringent prices and incomes policy and the role which the Board might play in this regard. Meanwhile, authoritycould now be given for the drafting of at least the heads of a prices and Incomes Bill, although due regard would have to be paid at this stage to other and more immediately urgent calls on parliamentary Counsel. The Secretary of State for Economic affairs should also arrange for the drafting of a White Paper on futureproductivity, prices and incomes policy to be put in hand, in orderthat the Cabinet might be able to consider a provisional draft atthe meeting on 18th March.It was essential that the matters which had been coyered in the cabinet&apos;s discussion should not be the subject of any premature disclosure. Ministers should therefore take particular care to preserve complete secrecy about their discussion and should refrain from any briefing of either junior colleagues or the Press. Theyshould also avoid, in any public utterances, expressing pessimistic oralarmist views about our economic position, since this could onlyserve to make that position even more serious.
The Cabinet-ll) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, inconsultation with the Minister of Labour (i) to circulate to the Cabinet in time for their discussion on 12th March a further memorandum on futureprices and incomes policy;(ii) to hold further discussions with the Chairman ofthe NBPI, as indicated in the Prime Minister^summing up;(iii) to arrange for the preparation of a draft White paper on future productivity, prices and incomes policy,to be available for consideration at their meetingon 18th March.(3) Authorised the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs toarrange for the drafting of a Prices and Incomes Bill,with due regard at this stage to other urgent calls on parliamentary Counsel.(4) Agreed to resume their discussion on Tuesday, 12th March.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,7 th March, 1968.SECRETAnnexSUMMARY OF EXISTING AND PROPOSEDSTATUTORY POWERSA.
