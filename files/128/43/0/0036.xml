parliament house ofLordsTimetable(previous reference:CC (68) 35thConclusions,Minute 2)CC 36 (68)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Lord Privy Seal reported that, after consultation with theMinisters concerned, he had concluded that there would be no occasion to arrange for the House of Commons to sit formally in theweek beginning 28th July to receive notification of the Royal assent to Bills.The Paymaster General said that the House of Lords would risefor the Summer Recess on 1st or 2nd August, but would need more time to complete Government business than would be provided bythe proposed two weeks&apos; sitting in October. He had secured theagreement of the Opposition to the House sitting on 7th and8th October, but it was desirable that in addition an extra day shouldbe available at the end of the Session for the resolution of possibledifferences between the two Houses on amendments to the transport bill. This would mean postponing the Prorogation to 28th october and the State Opening of Parliament to 30th October; but willingnesson the part of the House of Commons to alter their programme tothis extent would make it easier to secure the co-operation of theHouse of Lords in a timetable which would still be somewhatcrowded. Consultations were in progress through the usual channelswith a view to the reduction of the time devoted to the Debate onthe Address from six days to five. The proposed timetable wouldnot enable the Divorce Bill to be passed, but the sponsors were nowwilling to reintroduce it in the coming Session.The Cabinet Agreed that, in order to accommodate the timetableproposed by the Paymaster General, the Opening of the) - 1968-69 Session should be deferred until 30th October andthe Prorogation of the current Session, if necessary, to28th October.CONFIDENTIALOverseaAffairsActionCommitteefor the UnitedStates ofEurope2. The Foreign Secretary said that he had received a visit on16th July from M. Monnet, the Chairman of the Action Committeefor the United States of Europe. M. Monnet had also called on thePrime Minister. The Action Committee was an independent bodywhose objectives were to facilitate our entry into the european economic Community (e.c.), to promote co-operation between an enlarged e.c. and Eastern Europe and to develop relations, asbetween equals, between Europe and the United States. It was atpresent composed of Parliamentary groups and employees&apos;organisations in the six countries of the e.c.. The only political parties which were not represented were the Communists and theGaullists.  It was the unanimous wish of the Action Committee that
the Labour, Conservative and Liberal Parties and the Trades UnionCongress (TUC) should be invited to become members of theCommittee. M. Monnet had enquired whether the Labour party would be prepared to accept such an invitation and said he proposedto make a similar approach to the Leaders of the Conservative and liberal Parties. An approach had already been made to the TUCdirect by Herr Rosenberg, the German Trade Union leader, andMr. George Woodcock, the Secretary-General of the TUC, had replied that although he could not commit his colleagues, he foresawno difficulty in obtaining the tuc&apos;s acceptance of the proposedinvitation. Labour Party membership of the Committee would bein line with the Governments policy of seeking membership of the eec. It would be valuable not so much for its formal benefits as for the opportunities it would offer for contacts with leadingEuropean Parliamentarians. The Conservative and Liberal parties and the TUC were likely to accept the invitation. It would be verydifficult for the Labour Party to refuse. The right course might therefore be for him to reply that the question would, of course, haveto be referred to the Labour Party, but that if a formal invitationwere received, he expected it would be accepted.In discussion it was suggested that although there might be considerable advantages in joining the Action Committee, more information was required on the composition and functions of theCommittee before an invitation was accepted. In particular, it was desirable to know whether similar invitations were being extendedto Parliamentary groups in other member countries of the european free Trade Area, and whether there were any special reasons toexplain why the invitation had been given now and why some members of the Committee appeared to represent Parliamentaryparties and others national parties. When more information was available, it would be necessary to consult the Parliamentary LabourParty. The present time of the Parliamentary year was not appropriate for this.The Cabinet (1) Invited the  Foreign  Secretary to  be guided by their discussion in replying to M. Monnet.Czechoslovakia       The Foreign Secretary said that the full text was not yet available(Previous       of the letter which had been sent to the Czechoslovak CommunistCC(65&quot;C26th    PaTty by the Communist leaders of Bulgaria, East Germany, Poland,Conclusions,    Hungary and the Soviet Union after their meeting in Warsaw on minute 2)       14th-15th July.  But from summaries it was clear that it called onthe Czechoslovak Communist Party to curb liberal forces and toimpose   censorship.    It   described   the   present   situation   in czechoslovakia as completely unacceptable.   Meanwhile, althoughthe withdrawal of Soviet troops had been resumed, their presencestill created a background of uncertainty. It seemed that the Sovietaim was to strengthen the position of the conservative elementsagainst the liberals in the Czechoslovak Communist Party before the extraordinary Party Congress which had been called in September.The Yugoslav and Rumanian Communist Parties had made plain
Iraq(previous reference:CC (67) 5thConclusions,Minute 3)Nigeria(previous reference:CC (68) 34thConclusions,Minute 2)CC 36 (68)their sympathy with Czechoslovakia; and the French CommunistParty had called for a meeting of European Communist Parties todiscuss the Czechoslovak problem. It was possible that such ameeting would be held. It appeared that the Russians had not yetdecided whether or not they would try to coerce Czechoslovakia if their policy of political pressure and sabre-rattling failed to achieve its purpose. But it was clear that the new leaders in Czechoslovakiawould need to proceed cautiously if they wished to make progress with their policy of liberalisation. There would be obvious dangersif any member of the Government were publicly to express sympathy with the Czechoslovak leaders; and any Government statementswould need to be very carefully considered. One of the lessonswhich could be drawn from the implied threat that armed force mightbe used against Czechoslovakia was the importance of maintaining the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.In discussion there was general agreement that although thesituation in Czechoslovakia was dangerous, there was no action whichwe could usefully take. The Czechoslovak Government had notasked for help, nor, as far as we knew, sought to contact any western powers. Any attempt to intervene on their behalf with the soviet union would be counter-productive. The violent tone whichcharacterised the letter to the Czechoslovak Communist Party wasnot unusual in Communist communications. The Soviet Union was clearly hoping to intimidate the present Czechoslovak government or to promote its overthrow. Only if these tactics failed might they feel obliged to resort to armed force. In that event there could beno question of military intervention by the Western Powers; and thecase would probably be taken to the United Nations.The Foreign Secretary said that it was too early to assess theconsequences of the coup which had taken place in Iraq on 17th july and had resulted in the overthrow of President Arif. There was noreason to suppose that the new Government would be any moreanti-British than its predecessor. It was not yet possible to say whether it would adopt a more friendly attitude towards Jordan.President Arif was now in London where his wife was in hospital.The Cabinet (2) Took note of the statements by the Foreign Secretary.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the report in the Sun of18th July that 20 British Army Saracen armoured cars were on their way to Nigeria was, as far as he knew, correct. They formed partof the normal arms supplies which it was our policy to send to theFederal Government. This was not the first time that arms of thiskind had been supplied to the Federal Government since the civil war began. The armoured cars had been despatched by ship; andit would be some considerable time before they could have any effecton the military situation in Nigeria. The Sun had recently adoptedan extreme pro-Biafran position in the Nigerian dispute. Lord Huntwould be returning on the following day from his relief mission toNigeria; and it would be easier to assess the present situation whenhe had reported.
The Cabinet (3) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to bring the situationin Nigeria before the Cabinet in the following week, inthe light of Lord Hunt&apos;s report.CONFIDENTIALSocialServicesReport ofthe Inter-departmentalCommitteeon LocalAuthorityand AlliedPersonalSocialServices3. The Cabinet had before them a joint memorandum by theHome Secretary, the Secretary of State for Education and Science,the Minister of Housing and Local Government and the Minister ofHealth (C (68) 88) to which was annexed a summary of the Reportof the Interdepartmental Committee on Local Authority and AlliedPersonal Social Services (the Seebohm Committee) and the draft ofa Written Answer to a Parliamentary Question announcing thepublication of the Report.The Prime Minister said that the memorandum by the ministers to whom the Seebohm Committee had reported had been brought before the Cabinet not with a view to discussion of the substance ofthe Report, which was not yet available to Ministers generally, butsolely in order that the Cabinet might consider what should be said on the publication of the Report and which Minister should say it.The proposed Answer gave no indication of the Governmenfs viewson the substance of the Report, still less on the related problems ofthe machinery of Central Government; but there was concern lest the public might draw from the identity of the Minister giving the answer unwarranted conclusions about the decisions likely to bereached on Ministerial responsibility for the proposed local social work departments. In these circumstances it might be appropriate for the Lord President to give the proposed Answer, not in his capacity as Minister-designate of the merged Departments of health and Social Security, but as co-coordinator of the social services.In discussion it was suggested that, since the appointment ofthe Seebohm Committee had been announced by the then HomeSecretary, it would be appropriate that the present Home secretary should announce the publication of their Report. Announcement bythe Lord President would be taken by the interests concerned as an indication of the way in which the issue of Ministerial responsibilitywas likely to be determined. It would therefore be preferable thatthe Answer should be given by the Prime Minister. It should,however, be clear that responsibility for arranging for outside interests to be consulted on the Report and for co-ordinating interdepartmentalconsideration of their views should rest with the Lord President as chairman of the Social Services Committee.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that hewould give the proposed Answer announcing the publication of theSeebohm Report, but thereafter it would be for the Lord President,as co-coordinator of the social services and Chairman of the social services Committee, to co-ordinate both the arrangements for consultation with local authorities and other interests concerned, and
confidential. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary ofState for Education and Science (C (68) 86) to which was annexed asummary of the conclusions and recommendations of the first report of the Public Schools Commission.The Secretary of State for Education and Science said that theprincipal recommendation of a somewhat unhelpful Report was thatsuitable independent boarding schools should make half their placesavailable to pupils from maintained schools. The Commissionestimated a requirement of 80,000 boarding places by 1980, of which47,000 should be sought in independent schools: the cost of thescheme when in full operation would be  18-4 million. They also recommended that independent schools which were charities shouldbe deprived of the relief which they enjoyed from income tax,selective employment tax and rates. He proposed that the report should be published without any Government announcement on22nd July. He had also submitted to the Social Services Committeethe lines of a statement which he proposed to make after the summer recess, but the Committee had deferred consideration of this and ofthe recommendation about the privileges of charitable schools until they had had an opportunity to consider the full Report.The Cabinet Agreed that, subject to further consultation with the lord president and the Lord Privy Seal on timing, the Report ofthe Public Schools Commission should be published on22nd July without any Government announcement.the consideration, in the light of those consultations, of the SeebohmCommittee&apos;s recommendations. Decisions on the Report would ultimately be taken by the Cabinet in the light of the Report of theRoyal Commission on Local Government in England.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would announce thepublication of the Report of the Seebohm Committee ina Written Answer on the lines of the draft annexed toC (68) 88.(2) Invited the Lord President, as Chairman of the social services Committee, to co-ordinate the arrangements for consultation with local authorities and other interests concerned on the Report of the Seebohm Committee andthe interdepartmental consideration of the Report in thelight of those consultations; and to report to the Cabinetin due course.
parliament house ofLordsReform(previous reference:CC (68) 31stConclusions,Minute 2)*5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the LordChancellor (C (68) 87) on the Reform of the House of Lords, to whichwas annexed the draft White Paper on the proposed reforms whichhad been prepared for the consideration of the Inter-party conference.The Lord Chancellor said that the Ministerial Committee on theHouse of Lords, under his chairmanship, had come to the conclusionthat the Government had to choose between implementing theproposals in the draft White Paper, which had been broadly agreed by the Inter-Party Conference, and some more radical solution whichhad yet to be devised and would have to be forced through byuse of the Parliament Act procedure.  They could not do nothingbecause they had announced their intention to legislate in the queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of the present session of parliament and the Prime Minister in his statement on 20th June had referredto the Governmenfs intention to introduce comprehensive andradical legislation at an early date. The proposals in the draft white paper might not appear attractive presentationally, but were in factradical in substance; they would abolish the built-in Conservativemajority in the House of Lords and the power of the hereditary peers; they would end the Lords&apos; power to veto subordinate legislation; and they would provide a simpler procedure foroverriding the House of Lords than that available under the parliament Acts. In the view of his Committee the choice before theGovernment was a matter of tactics.  If they sought to implement the proposals outlined in the White Paper, all three parties wouldencounter some opposition from their  backbenchers, but theproposals could be expected to go through as a broadly agreedmeasure.   If, however, the Government chose a radical unilateralsolution they would have to force the Bill through under the parliament Act procedure, and in view of the feeling among theConservative peers in favour of forcing a General Election theywould have to pay a heavy price in terms of the dislocation of theirlegislative programme.  In the circumstances a substantial majorityof the Ministerial Committee were in favour of going ahead with thepreparation of a Bill to give effect to the White Paper proposals.In discussion there was general agreement that at this stage thedecision to be taken was essentially tactical in character. It wassuggested that the Governmenfs best course might be to abandon the idea of legislation during the present Parliament and to concentrate on working out a truly radical solution for futureenactment. But against this it was argued that the Government were bound to act during the present Parliament, given the terms ofThe Queen&apos;s Speech and of the Prime Ministers statement of20th June and the damage which an unreformed House of Lordscould inflict on the legislative programme for the next two sessions;and that in this situation the agreed proposals although unpalatablein some of their details were to be preferred to an attempt to force (a) different measure through under the Parliament Act.* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
oat&quot;secret . The First Secretary of State said that she and the Ministerof Transport had had extended discussions with both sides of theNational Joint Industrial Council for the bus industry about the pay negotiations for municipal busmen but that they had been unableto reach agreement with them. A special delegate meeting of theTransport and General Workers&apos; Union had now called for anational strike; a final decision on this would be taken by the union&apos; executive council on 25th July, the day before the Order extending the standstill on the municipal busmen&apos;s settlement was due tocome into effect. The employers had, under pressure from the union,agreed to a settlement which would provide an extra 10s. a week,backdated to December 1967, and a further 10s. a week, payablefrom June 1968, both on the basic rate. This was substantiallyworse from the standpoint of incomes policy than the settlement which the Cabinet, when they had last considered the matter, had authorised her to approve. It was also much less satisfactory thanthe settlement which the union officials had at one time been willingCC 36 (68)There was no doubt that the draft White Paper proposals, andin particular the retention of the hereditary peerage, would be unwelcome to many of the Governments supporters, who might notappreciate how radical the proposals in fact were. A recent meetingof the Parliamentary Labour Party had shown support for the idea ofa reformed Second Chamber, perhaps on an elected or regional basis.But it was not generally understood how damaging to theGovernments legislative plans use of the Parliament Act procedure would be and this, once understood, would carry weight with thosewho were anxious to see particular measures passed into law.Moreover the proposals and the way in which they were presented inthe draft White Paper might be capable of some amendment, thoughit would be difficult to make any significant change in the substance of the proposals while preserving agreement. A final decision shouldbe taken in the autumn in the light of the then state of party feeling,but for the moment the draft White Paper proposals seemed the best available solution and work should go forward on this basis.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that themajority of the Cabinet were of the opinion that, so far as could be judged at the moment, the best course open to the Government wasto seek to implement the proposals in the draft White Paper and work should go forward on the preparation of the necessary Bill. Theposition should be reviewed in the autumn and a decision taken inthe light of feeling among the Governments supporters and in thecountry generally. Publication of the proposals could play a usefulpart in crystallising opinion and talks were in progress to see whetheragreement could be reached on this between the parties.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the Prime Ministets summing up.
to try to secure namely an increase of 10s. a week on the basic ratepayable from December 1967 and a bonus of 10s. a week for one-manoperation, payable from June 1968. She considered that it would bea mistake for the Government to take any new initiative in the matteruntil the following week and that steps should be taken in themeantime to brief the Press on the issues involved. They could thenattempt, in the following week, to persuade the parties to modify thesettlement so as to provide an increase of 10s. a week on the basic rate backdated to December 1967 and a bonus of 10s. for one-manoperation payable from June 1968. If this proved impossible, theGovernment would have no alternative but to extend the standstill,even though this might well provoke a national bus strike.After a brief discussion, the Prime Minister, summing up, saidthat the Cabinet agreed that the Government should not take any initiative in relation to the municipal bus industry until the following week; that steps should be taken in the meantime to inform the press of the issues involved; and that further action should be left to theChancellor of the Exchequer, the First Secretary of State, the Ministerof Transport and himself to decide.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the Prime Ministers summing up.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,18th July, 1968.
