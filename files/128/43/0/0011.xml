SECRETOverseaAffairsSeizure ofUnited StatesShip by theNorth Koreans(previous reference:CC(68) 10thConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Foreign Secretary said that there were some hopefulsigns that the incident of the seizure by North Korea of the UnitedStates Ship Pueblo might be on the way to solution. The security council of the United Nations had adjourned their debate and wouldprobably not meet again. But there was considerable diplomaticactivity behind the scenes in which the United kingdom representative at the United Nations, Lord Caradon, was playing a leading and valuable role. The United States were acting withcaution and restraint; and the North Koreans appeared to be disposed to enter discussions.8774CONFIDENTIALParliament 1-   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Lord President said that the Select Committee on the workof the Parliamentary Commissioner had taken exception to theproposal to debate the Commissioner^ report on the SachsenhausenPrison Camp before the Select Committee had themselves considered and reported upon it. The Parliamentary Commissioner^ report was, however, a report to the House of Commons as a whole, and itwould be unfortunate if the Select Committee considered it necessaryto hold a further investigation and to produce a second report in afew months&apos; time which would revive criticism and controversy.Since the Foreign Secretary had agreed that compensation shouldbe paid to the officers from whom it had hitherto been withheld, itwould in any event be necessary at least to make a statement, as thepayments would appear in the Estimates.The Prime Minister said that the Select Committee might be seeking to follow the procedure of the Public Accounts Committeewhich considered the Annual Report of the Comptroller and auditor-General and reported to the House upon it. The adoptionof this type of procedure would mean, however, that theParliamentary Commissioner^ report on the grievance of a privatecitizen could not be debated in the House of Commons until several months after the report had been made. This would be unsatisfactory, and the Lord President would be justified in drawingthis distinction between the procedure of the Public accounts committee and that appropriate to the Select Committee concernedwith the work of the Parliamentary Commissioner and in maintaining the right of the House of Commons to debate the Commissionersreports without undue delay.The Cabinet Invited the Lord President, in dealing with the matter, toadopt the line indicated by the Prime Minister.
Vietnam(previous reference:CC (68) 10thConclusions,Minute 2)Middle East(previous reference:CC (68) 10thConclusions,Minute 2)approach to Europe(previous reference:CC (68) 10thConclusions,Minute 2)The Foreign Secretary said that the situation in Vietnam wasnot encouraging. It was too early to assess the full significance ofthe Communist offensive which had broken out all over SouthVietnam within the last few days. It had been suggested that itmight be a last desperate throw by North Vietnam before a decisionto open negotiations, or an all-out effort to win the war. But it wasnot yet possible to say what was the real explanation or to forecastfuture developments.The Foreign Secretary said that as a result of the recent incidentin which Israeli forces had fired on Egyptian survey ships in the suez Canal, work on the reopening of the southern end of the Canalhad come to a halt. It did not appear that the Israelis were deliberately trying to sabotage the work. The ships appeared to havebeen fired on because they were sailing northwards, thus giving theimpression that the intention was to reopen the northern section ofthe Canal. Although the Israelis had agreed to the clearance of thesouthern section, they had always opposed the clearance of thenorthern section of the Canal as well, since this would in effectconstitute a reopening of the whole Canal, which they could not accept without prior agreement on the right of passage for Israeliships. The situation was complicated by the fact that the special representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations,Mr. Jarring, was making only slow progress in his conciliationmission.The Foreign Secretary said that the outcome of the meeting of western European Union (WEU) on 30th January, at which the benelux proposals for continuing consultation and practicalco-operation between the member States of the European economic community (e.c.) and the United Kingdom and other western european States had been discussed, had been a good deal betterthan we might have feared and indeed than we could reasonably have hoped. He had had good informal discussions with theMinisters present and with Sr. Martino, member of the commission for external relations; in view of the apprehension that theCommission might view the Benelux initiative as a threat to the solidarity of the Communities and to its own prerogatives, he had explained the United Kingdom attitude and intentions fully toSr. Martino, and the latter had in WEU welcomed the benelux proposals &quot; with prudent sympathy&quot;, Herr Brandt, the federal german Foreign Minister, had made clear from the outset his personal support for our attitude since the veto and in particulartowards the Benelux proposals, but it was evident that there were considerable divergences of opinion, and resultant stresses, withinthe German Government on this and other issues. In the WEUdiscussion Herr Brandt had welcomed the basic principles on whichthe Benelux proposals were based, but had not of course been able toaccept them in advance of the forthcoming meeting in Paris betweenthe Federal German Chancellor, Dr. Kiesinger, and president de Gaulle. Sr. Fanfani, the Italian Foreign Minister, had also givenfirm support to the need for consultation and practical co-operationbetween the Community States and the United Kingdom and had
deferred a pronouncement on the Benelux proposals only until the outcome was known of the forthcoming talks between Dr. Kiesingerand President de Gaulle. Mr. Luns, the Dutch Foreign Minister,was as always firm in our support, indeed on this occasion a little toofirm for Herr Brandt; however the differences which had arisen atthe breakfast meeting of the Five on 30th January had been resolvedbefore the formal discussion took place in WEU. The onlydisappointment was the attitude of M. Gregoire, the LuxembourgForeign Minister, whose Government appeared to have been subjected to considerable pressure by the French. Surprisinglyhowever M. Bettencourt. the French Minister of State for ForeignAffairs, had made a quiet, reserved and defensive intervention, tothe effect that the French Government required more time in which to study the Benelux proposals.The Five had decided that they would hold a further meeting between themselves immediately after Dr. Kiesinger&apos;s visit to Parisin February. It had also been decided that either one or more of the benelux Governments, or the Italian Government, would call ameeting of officials from the 10 e.c. and applicant States in orderto prepare the ground for a meeting of the 10 or such of them aswished to be present by considering in more detail possible fieldsfor consultation and co-operative action outside, or on the fringe of,the activities pursued by member States under the Treatiesestablishing the Communities. Thus considerable progress had beenmade towards the twin objectives of Her Majesty&apos;s Government of having a continuing opportunity in consultations with members of the eec to influence its future development and of participating inco-operative action of various kinds with the member States in ways which would maintain interest in, the momentum towards, our owneventual membership. Technological co-operation appeared to bethe most promising field. After the WEU meeting Sr. Fanfani hadparticularly impressed upon him that the British Government should bring the greatest possible pressure to bear on the Federal GermanGovernment to ensure that the discussions between Dr. Kiesingerand President de Gaulle were not permitted to lead to long-drawn-outexchanges which would delay decisions on the Benelux proposals.In discussion it was suggested that it was becoming particularlyurgent to decide whether or not the United Kingdom was preparedto develop full technological collaboration on the lines indicatedin the Prime Ministers speech at the Guildhall in November withEEC and other States in advance of negotiations for United kingdom membership, which had been set as the essential pre-condition last november. It would be necessary to resume in the near future thediscussions with the Confederation of British Industries (CBI),without commitment, on the future of the proposal to establish a european Institute of Technology, in accordance with the Cabinefsconclusions when they had.last discussed this subject; and the CBIwould certainly wish to know shortly whether the government intended that the CBI should pursue this initiative at this time with
their counterparts in other European countries. The foreign secretary&apos;s speech to WEU had drawn a useful distinction betweenwhat the United Kingdom might do as a member of an enlarged community and what it might be able to do while we remainedoutside the Community, and as had been agreed at the Cabinet&apos;s previous discussion, the future of the technological initiative wouldbe further considered as part of the comprehensive review of foreignpolicy which the Cabinet had decided to hold later in the month.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet would consider future policy in relation to Europe, includingpolicy on future technological collaboration, in the course of theircomprehensive review in February of foreign policy. Meanwhile, aspart of the preparations for that review, the Ministerial and OfficialCommittees on the Approach to Europe should consider the positionwe might take up at the proposed meetings of the 10, and inparticular advise on the issues arising in respect of future british policy on technological collaboration with other Western european states. Meantime it would be helpful if the Foreign Secretary would circulate to the Cabinet the text of his speech to WEU on30th January.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary(i) to arrange for the Ministerial and Official committees on the Approach to Europe to consider and reporton the position we might take up in the preparatoryand Ministerial meetings of the 10 which hadbeen proposed at the meeting of WEU on29th and 30th January;(ii) to circulate to the Cabinet the text of his speech on30th January to the WEU on the United Kingdomattitude towards the Benelux proposals forco-operation and collaboration.parliament house ofLordsReform(previous reference:CC (67) 59thConclusions,Minute 1)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the LordChancellor on the reform of the House of Lords (C (68) 26).The Lord Chancellor said that his memorandum outlined thecourse of the inter-party negotiations on the reform of the House ofLords and the main features of a plan of reform which the membersof the Inter-Party Conference had agreed to commend to theirrespective parties as a basis for further discussion and elaborationwith a view to the publication of an agreed White Paper. Theproposals for reforming the composition of the House of Lordsfollowed the lines of the &quot; two-tier &quot; scheme previously outlined tothe Cabinet as representing the limits to which the Government
representatives should be prepared to go in order to achieveagreement with the Conservative Opposition. As now proposed, the reformed House would comprise a working nucleus of upwards of200 peers of first creation with voting rights which would be conditional on regular attendance. Among these the Governmentof the day would have a majority over all Opposition parties, though not an overall majority. Additionally the House would includepeers who had a right to speak but not to vote, including theremaining peers of first creation, together with all existing peers bysuccession. The Conservative representatives had abandoned theirinitial claim that speaking rights should be hereditary.The proposals for restricting the powers of the House of lords to delay legislation, however, differed from those previouslyconsidered by the Cabinet, which had contemplated that a Bill whichwas rejected by the Lords in one Session could be enacted in thefollowing Session if again passed by the Commons. This had beenunacceptable to the Conservatives, and instead it was now proposedthat where a Bill was rejected by the Lords (who would be allowedup to two months to consider it), it should automatically become lawat the end of a period of six months, subject only to a resolution ofthe Commons and notwithstanding that the period ran into a new session or even a new Parliament. In this way the potential threat to a Labour Governments legislative programme in the last Sessionof a Parliament would be removed. Further, the Commons wouldbe given power to override the rejection by the Lords of any statutory instrument, thus removing the Lords&apos; present power to vetosubordinate legislation.Reform of the House of Lords on these lines would enable theGovernment to achieve its declared objectives in relation to the lords&apos; powers, and at the same time to eliminate the hereditary basisof the Second Chamber and ensure the Government of the day areasonable working majority. There had been general agreement among the party representatives in the Inter-Party Conference thatsuch reform would make possible development of the Lords&apos;functions as a scrutinising and reviewing Chamber, complementarybut subordinate to the Commons, in a way which would increase theefficiency of Parliament as a whole and relieve the Commons of someof their routine work. He sought the Cabinets approval to theproposals accordingly as a basis for further discussion by theInter-Party Conference, and their agreement that the conference should have in view the publication of a White Paper some time after the Budget. There still remained much work to be done on thedetail of the scheme, but if there was agreement between the parties on the legislation, there would be less urgency to introduce it in thecurrent Session.In discussion it was suggested that, notwithstanding the extentto which the hereditary principle would be retained in determining the membership of the new House and the degree of patronage withwhich the Prime Minister of the day would be endowed features
which would themselves be sources of criticism and misunderstanding the establishment of the House of Lords on the more rational basisproposed would strengthen its authority so that it would be more likely to use its powers to the full. Moreover, the Government wouldhave insufficient control over its own supporters since their votingrights would be enjoyed for life, subject to any retirement age. Inany event, since the Government would not have an overall majorityof the House, the cross-benchers would hold the balance andwould become a new constitutional force outside government control. It was likely also that the proposals would have the effect of strengthening the active membership of the Conservative opposition in the Lords. In these circumstances it was suggested that the powersof the Lords to delay legislation should be further reduced. Inparticular it was unacceptable as a constitutional principle, andcontrary to the conception of the Lords as a subordinate partner inParliament, that they should be given power to delay legislation which had been passed by the elected Chamber in order to enablepublic opinion to form on it. The extent of the delaying power might cause difficulty in practice in relation to an urgent and importantBill which reached the House of Lords late in the Session, and thereserve power of the Prime Minister to swamp the House by freshcreations would be ineffective in such circumstances.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the Cabinet hadalready decided in principle that the composition of the House ofLords should be reformed and that it was inherent in any suchreform that the authority, though not the formal powers, of that house would thereby be increased. The extent to which the Lordscould delay legislation depended more on the composition than onthe formal powers of the House, and under the proposals before theCabinet the Government would have reasonable assurance of amajority. There was in practice little tendency for peers to change their party allegiance, and the cross-benchers tended to support theGovernment; any contrary tendency could be corrected by newcreations. It was further pointed out that, while a reformed Houseof Lords should be permitted to exercise useful scrutinising functions,subject to the overriding power of the House of Commons, theprincipal and most indefensible power at present possessed by the lords that to veto subordinate legislation would be abolished. Inits practical effect the power to delay the enactment of Bills for six months was unlikely to cause difficulty, and the Governmentwould be assured of enactment at the end of the period without theneed to pass the Bill a second time through the normal stages.Further, the present power of the Lords to prevent the passage of aBill introduced in the final Session of a Parliament would be abolished. The proposals represented the only basis on which reform of the House of Lords could proceed with inter-party agreement,and represented a reasonable compromise which none the less was likely to work to the Governmenfs advantage on balance, and wouldenable the functions of the Lords to be developed by agreement in away that would benefit the Commons and the working of parliament as a whole. In particular, reform by agreement on the lines proposed
CC 11 (68)would ensure that the hereditary principle as the basis of the Houseof Lords would be permanently eliminated and would not rule outthe possibility of subsequent more radical reform to sever altogetherthe connection between the peerage as such and membership of theSecond Chamber.In further discussion the following main points were made :(a) The average age of the reformed House of Lords was likelyto be high and, especially, if a retirement age were adopted, it shouldbe possible to accommodate the new creations that would benecessary on a change of Government without unduly enlarging the size of the House.(/;) The provision whereby a Bill might be enacted at the endof a period of six months following disagreement, notwithstanding that this period overran a Session or even a Parliament, would notform a precedent for carrying Bills which had failed to complete their Parliamentary stages in one Session over to the next.(c) Although provision which enabled the period of delay to run from one Parliament to the next would have the effect that any bill which was carried over in this way would become an electionissue, this would not be avoided by provision to enact.a disagreedBill at the end of a Parliament, since the question of its repeal wouldthen be canvassed.(d) It would be undesirable for the introduction of legislation to reform the House of Lords to be deferred beyond the point at whichit could, if necessary, be forced through under the Parliament Actsin the current Parliament.(e) The question of Scottish representation was still to beconsidered by the Inter-Party Conference and consideration shouldalso be given to adequate regional representation generally, without,however, providing for any formal allocation. There were, however,practical difficulties in combining regional representation with a requirement of minimum attendance.(/) Episcopal representation in the reformed House might raisedifficulties in relation to Scotland and Wales.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that,provided that inter-party agreement on the reform of the House ofLords could thereby be achieved and the conclusions of theOpposition parties on the proposals were still awaited the majorityof the Cabinet supported the proposals set out in C (68) 26 as a basis on which the Government representatives should pursue their discussions in the Inter-Party Conference with a view to thepublication of a White Paper in ihe spring. The Cabinet should consider the White Paper in draft before the detailed proposals were finally agreed with the Opposition representatives, and should then consider also the timing of the introduction of the legislation. TheGovernment representatives on the Inter-Party Conference should&quot;in the meantime consult the Cabinet if any major difficulty arose in
the negotiations, or if they required guidance on any issue of substance, such as might arise in relation to the position of the bishops. The Government representatives were to be congratulatedon the progress which the negotiations had made.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals for reform of the House of Lordsset out in C (68) 26 as a basis for further discussion withthe Opposition leaders with a view to publication of a white Paper in the spring.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor to arrange for the negotiationswith the Opposition leaders to be conducted in accordancewith Conclusion (1), and to bring before them detailed proposals in the form of a draft White Paper, and any major point of doubt or difficulty which arose in thenegotiations.(3) Agreed to consider the timing of legislation to reform theHouse of Lords when they had before them the draft white Paper in accordance with Conclusion (2).AgriculturalPolicyFarm price review(previous reference:CC (68) 3rdConclusions)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the first secretary of State (C (68) 30) on the Farm Price Review for 1968.The First Secretary of State said it had not proved possible forthe Committee on Agricultural Policy to reach agreement on thelimits to which Agricultural Ministers should go in negotiations onthe Farm Price Review. His memorandum set out the background to the Review and his own recommendations. The Committee hadtaken into account a report by a Sub-Committee of the OfficialSteering Committee on Economic Policy on the extent to which the objectives of the present selective expansion programme for agriculture might need to be modified in the light of devaluation;they had also considered comments by the Economic Advisers onthe Sub-Committee&apos;s report. The agreed conclusions emerging fromthese studies were that it would be wrong at the present time to makeany radical change in agricultural policy, but that for the purposesof the present Review the emphasis should be placed so far as possible on stimulating production of those commodities which would produceimport savings over the next two years, as against those where the response to additional incentives would operate more slowly.The Treasury had advocated a total award of some  33 million,and the Agricultural Departments an award of  75 million, while theDepartment of Economic Affairs had supported an intermediateamount of  53 - 5 million. In his view, there were sound reasons foran award of the order of that recommended by the Department ofEconomic Affairs. Since the last Review, farmers&apos; costs had increased by  68-5 million.   Gains to the farmers arising from
b 2increased productivity were put at  30 million. On the basis of theTreasury recommendation, all the gains from productivity would berequired to meet increased costs and there would be no net benefit tothe farmers. This would not accord with the Governments general approach under the incomes policy towards gains from higher productivity in industry generally. On the other hand, an award of the size recommended by the Agricultural Departments wouldmean a net gain to the farmers which would be excessive in thepresent economic situation. The effect of the award which he recommonded would be to leave the farmers with half of theirexpected gains from higher productivity, after meeting increased costs.This net increase to farm income could not be regarded in the samelight as a wage increase, since it had to cover the farmer&apos;s return on past investment and his finance for new investment as well as his ownreward for management. To leave the farmers with a net increasein farm income of some  15 million, as under his proposal, was areasonable solution.As regards particular commodities, he recommended anincrease of Is. 6d. per cwt. in the guaranteed price for wheat, and anincrease of Is. per score in the guaranteed price for pigs. Since these commodities offered the prospect of securing substantial import saving over the next two years, there was a case for additionalincentives. As regards beef production and the related expansion ofthe dairy herd, there were conflicting considerations. On the onehand, because of the long production cycle for beef there was lessprospect of early import saving than in the case of wheat and pigs.On the other hand, having regard to the losses through the epidemicof foot-and-mouth disease there was a strong case for an awardwhich would restore confidence in the livestock sector. he recommonded an increase in the guaranteed price of 12s. 6d. per cwt.If the Cabinet reached decisions on the total size of the award and the negotiating limits for the commodities to which he had referred, he proposed that the distribution of the balance betweenthe remaining elements of the award should be worked out by theDepartments concerned, with reference to the Committee on agricultural Policy if agreement could not be reached. There were,however, two further issues which he invited the Cabinet to resolve.The Agricultural Departments recommended first that the industry should be given an assurance that the guaranteed price of beef wouldnot be reduced at the next two Annual Reviews; and second that thestandard quantity, which governed the payment of the guaranteed price for wheat, should be abolished. The argument for theseproposals was basically that they would increase confidence in theindustry and thus encourage the necessary expansion: as regardsbeef in particular, it was claimed that farmers would not undertake the necessary investment unless they had an assurance about market conditions for three years ahead. The argument against the proposals was that, while they would not involve any appreciable Exchequerexpenditure in the immediate future, they represented a substantialcontingent liability in the longer term.

The Minister of Agriculture said that the size of the awardshould be determined by reference to the degree of expansion whichthe Government wished to see. The Official Sub-Committee and theEconomic Advisers had taken the view that it would be wrong tomake any radical change in support policies at the present time. TheSub-Committee had held that the selective expansion programme,subject to minor modifications, continued to offer the rightguide-lines for future policy. The degree of expansion in home production which was technically feasible up to 1970-71 was no greater than the rate of expansion which had been achieved in thepast and represented a realistic objective for most commodities. the selective expansion programme had been accepted by the Governmentand the industry, and recent Government pronouncements had emphasised the new opportunities for import saving in agriculturewhich arose from devaluation. The present system of agricultural support had produced an industry which was efficient by comparisonwith that of other countries. The Ministerial Steering Committee onEconomic Policy had agreed that a further assessment should be madeof the Exchequer and resource costs of agricultural expansion and ofthe case for a change in the present system of support. While it might-be desirable to change that system at a later date, this was not a tissue for purposes of the present Review, which should be conductedwithin the framework of the selective expansion programme. Unlessthe present award were consistent with the objectives of that programme, there would be a danger of stagnant or even decliningproduction which would be contrary to the pledges given by theGovernment and would mean forfeiture of valuable import saving.Moreover, a firm home market for agricultural products was essentialas a basis for exports of food products and agricultural machinery which were becoming increasingly important.A substantial award was necessary this year because of the risein farm costs, much of which resulted from devaluation. TheGovernment had recognised that manufacturing industry would need in many cases to pass on cost increases resulting fromdevaluation to the consumer in the form of higher prices; because ofthe nature of the support system for agriculture, it was not open to farmers to pass on cost increases in this way, and it was therefore essential that the Review award should take full account of them.A substantial award was also necessary in order to ensure adequate provision for new investment. It was insufficient to leave the farmerswith only half of their expected gains from higher productivity, asunder the First Secretary&apos;s proposal. Past awards which had not allowed the industry to recoup its costs had damaged confidence andhad led to stagnant production. The 1967 award had rectified this and production had begun to expand. An award of the size recommendedby the Agricultural Departments would be less generous than the1967 award, but would ensure that this expansion was maintained.It would be right to give an assurance that the guaranteed priceof beef would not be reduced at the next two Reviews, in order togive the industry the necessary confidence to undertake new investment.   It was desirable to expand the production of cereals,
especially wheat, and the abolition of the standard quantity for wheatwould make a useful contribution. The amount of the standard quantity had corresponded to the actual level of production in recentyears, and abolition of the present arrangement would not create difficulties either in regulating home production or in our relationswith overseas suppliers.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the awardrecommended by the First Secretary of State was too generous. Itwould mean that the cost to the Exchequer would be greater in1968-69 than in 1967-68 by an amount in excess of  50 million,after allowance had been made for all the relevant factors includingthe savings to the Exchequer resulting from devaluation. Thiswould represent an increase of 20 per cent. The Government had recently taken a large number of painful decisions in order to restrain the growth of public expenditure as a whole. Unlessproposed expenditure for particular sectors were scrutinised with corresponding severity, there was a danger that the savings whichhad been decided on would be frittered away and the whole purposeof the recent measures would be defeated. It was therefore essentialto consider the size of the present award against this background.It was suggested in the memorandum by the First Secretary ofState that an award of  53 - 5 million would represent an increase of3 per cent in total net farm income, but this was probably anunder-estimate if account were taken of the continuing decline in thenumber of full-time farmers, the probable increase in production andthe likelihood that in the face of heavy increases in costs the gainsfrom higher productivity would be higher than the estimated 30 million. The increased expenditure on beef production whichthe First Secretary of State recommended would be excessive inrelation to the results secured: it would involve expenditure of some 50 million over the next three years to secure import savingsestimated at only  15 million per annum. Experience showed that,whatever award the Cabinet now decided on, there would be great pressure as the Review proceeded for them to concede some further increase in order to secure the agreement of the Farmers&apos; Unions.For all these reasons, while there might be a case for an awardsomewhat greater than the  33 million originally proposed by theTreasury, the figure should be substantially below that now proposedby the First Secretary of State.In discussion, it was argued that an award substantially below that recommended by the First Secretary of State would be tantamount to repudiation of the selective expansion programme towhich the Government was committed and would contravene the assurance given to the farmers that their gains from higher productivity would be used to finance additional investment and toimprove the farmer&apos;s standard of living as well as to meet increased costs. Indeed, an award somewhat higher than that proposed by theFirst Secretary of State would be justified. Expenditure on agricultural support should not be considered on the same footing
as the generality of public expenditure since it was directly related to import saving. On the other hand, it was pointed out that the costof agricultural support now amounted to about  1 million a day; theindustry was already prosperous as a result of the generous awardin 1967; there was no case for increasing this prosperity still furtherby an award which would augment total net farm income. Thiswould necessarily increase personal income to the farmer sincereplacement of capital equipment could largely be financed fromprovision for depreciation, which was excluded from the total of netfarm income as calculated for purposes of the Review.There was, however, wide support for an award in the region of that recommended by the First Secretary of State, on the basis that this would be a final limit and in no sense an opening bid in thenegotiations with the Farmers&apos; Unions. An award of this order would maintain the momentum of expansion without treatingfarmers more generously than other sections of the community. Itwas, however, desirable that before decisions came to be taken onthe next Reviews, there should be a searching analysis of thecost-effectiveness of the present support system and of the cost inresources and Exchequer expenditure of the expansion envisagedunder the existing programme.It was argued that an increase of 12s. 6d. in the guaranteed price of beef would be excessive. Experience showed that very largeExchequer subsidies on beef produced only modest results: between1964 and 1967 the total cost of Exchequer support for beef production had amounted to no less than  200 million in return for an increasein production of the same order as that envisaged by the agricultural departments between now and 1970-71. An increase of 7s. 6d. inthe guaranteed price, which would be sufficient to prevent a fall inprofitability, was the most that would be justified. On the otherhand there was support for the view that an award on beef less thanthat recommended by the First Secretary of State would prejudicefuture expansion in this sector. The benefits of such expansion to thebalance of payments could not be ignored simply because they wouldtake time to materialise. Beef production had only recently begun to expand and it would be wrong to bring this to a halt before a proper assessment of the costs and benefits involved could be made.It was possible that our policy on imports of beef might need to be modified in the future as a result of the foot-and-mouth epidemic,and sustained growth in home production would be a worthwhileinsurance.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) It was suggested that in view of the world surplus in milk products and the damage to our trading relations with commonwealth suppliers which would be caused by an increase in home production, there was no justification for increasing the guaranteed price of milk by more than Id. per gallon.. On the otherhand it was pointed out that Commonwealth countries had accepted that expansion of beef production in the United Kingdom would necessarily entail an increase in milk products; moreover, on thebasis of the increase in the guaranteed price for milk proposed
by the First Secretary of State, it was expected that our outputof milk products would still leave room for an increase in importsof butter by some 15,000 tons this year.(b) There were strong arguments both for and against abolishing the standard quantity for wheat and giving an assurance on thefuture guaranteed price for beef. The guaranteed prices determined for these commodities in the present Review would have a bearing on the desirability of adopting these proposals, and a final decision should therefore be taken when it was clear what these determinationswould be.(c) If the required expansion in beef production were to besecured, it was important that the breeding section of the industry should be given adequate incentives. There was therefore a case for allowing some increase in the hill cow and beef cow subsidies, ratherthan devoting the whole of the award for beef to an increase in the guaranteed price.(d) Any increase in the guaranteed price for sugar beet wouldbe unwelcome to those Commonwealth countries which were heavily dependent on sugar production.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it had shown that the Cabinet strongly supported the need for a morerigorous examination of the cost-effectiveness of the present systemof agricultural support and for fuller information on the cost inresources and Exchequer money of the expansion envisaged underthe existing programme. These matters would be the subject of thefurther studies commissioned by the Ministerial Steering Committeeon Economic Policy, to be carried out after the present Review. TheCabinet agreed that the total size of the award in the present review should in no circumstances exceed  52^ million. The Minister ofAgriculture should begin his negotiations with the Farmers&apos; unions on the basis of a total award some  10 million below this figure, andshould aim to secure a settlement at a total of  50 million. If hethought it necessary to go beyond that figure, he should consult theFirst Secretary of State, and refer to the Committee on agricultural policy if the First Secretary of State judged that to be desirable. TheCabinet endorsed the proposals by the First Secretary of State inrespect of negotiating limits for beef, milk, wheat and pigs, and agreedthat the Departments concerned should work out the distribution ofthe balance of the award between the remaining elements, withreference to the Committee on Agricultural Policy if agreement couldnot be reached. The Minister of Agriculture should refer theproposals for an assurance on the future level of the guaranteed price for beef and for the abolition of the standard quantity for wheat to theCommittee on Agricultural Policy when it became clear what thedeterminations in the present Review would be for the guaranteed prices of these commodities; the Cabinet agreed that the Committeeshould be authorised to settle these issues, referring back to theCabinet only if it were not possible to reach agreement.

The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Defence (C (68) 29) covering the draft White Paper onthe Defence Estimates, 1968.The Cabinet were informed that the draft White Paper took account of the amendments agreed by the Defence and overseas policy Committee at a meeting in the previous week.
