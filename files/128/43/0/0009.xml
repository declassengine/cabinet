CC 9 (68)confidential parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Oversea AffairsGreece(previous reference:CC(67) 74thConclusions,Minute 4)secret. The Foreign Secretary recalled that at their meeting on21st December the Cabinet had agreed that our policy should be to withhold contact with the present Greek regime at Ambassadoriallevel but to conduct day-to-day business with officials on theunderstanding that it did not involve any act which could beconstrued as formal recognition of the regime. In the interval thispolicy had been maintained in solidarity with the United States andour other North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) allies. Thissolidarity was now, however, breaking up. Several NATOcountries, in particular Germany and Turkey, had been havingdealings with the regime at Ambassadorial level. During his recent visit to Washington the United States Secretary of State,Mr. Dean Rusk, had told him that the United States government proposed to authorise their Ambassador to have dealings with theForeign Minister, although he would continue to have no contacts with the military members of the ruling junta for the time being.Although this would not be a formal act of recognition, it mightwell be interpreted as such. In these circumstances it would bedifficult for us to maintain our present policy; and it might be damaging to our interests to do so, since there were a number ofcommercial questions, including one large contract, which we couldnot pursue without high level contact with the Greek regime. he proposed to discuss this question with the German Foreign Minister,Herr Willy Brandt, during his forthcoming visit to Bonn and tokeep in close touch with the United States Government. If they and others of our NATO allies authorised contacts between theirAmbassadors and the Greek regime, it would be in our interest todo likewise. He did not propose that we should formally recognise the military regime, although it was in fact in control of the countryand our normal criteria for recognition were to that extent fulfilled.He sought the authority of his colleagues, however, to decide the timing of new instructions to our Ambassador authorising him to resume business with the Greek Foreign Minister while refraining from any action which would imply formal recognition of the regime.The timing of these new instructions would be related to the attitudeof our NATO partners. There was no question of our movingahead of them: but it would be against our interests to be left behind.In discussion the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposal was supportedlargely on the grounds that it was important for us to be able toexercise our proper influence on events in Cyprus through theGreek regime; and that this could only be done effectively if wehad contacts with the Greek Foreign Minister.   The situation in8752a 2
Cyprus had recently become more critical as a result of the decisionof the Turkish Cypriot community to set up their own separateadministration and the decision of President Makarios to holdelections.Approach to europe(previous reference:CC (68) 1stConclusions,Minute 1)The Cabinet Approved the policy proposed by the Foreign Secretary,The Foreign Secretary said that he had arranged to meet theForeign Minister of the German Federal Republic, Herr Brandt,on the following day as part of the consultations which the cabinet had agreed he should undertake with the Governments of the Fiveabout the consequences of the French veto. The Cabinet might now wish to be informed of the position reached in these consultations,and of the line he proposed to take with Herr Brandt.He had started the consultations with an informal approach to the Italian Government, who had invited him to visit Rome. Inthe discussions there the Italian Foreign Minister, Sr. Fanfani, had given enthusiastic support to the line the Cabinet had authorised the Foreign Secretary to pursue, and had reported, perhapsexaggeratedly, receipt of a Belgian initiative in the same sense. the benelux countries had indeed since shown themselves to be very favourable towards the idea that there should be close consultation jand collaboration between the United Kingdom and the Five on matters falling outside the scope of the Treaty of Rome, and had theprevious day held a meeting at Ministerial level from which it seemed likely that specific proposals in that sense might emerge.Indeed, the Government of the Netherlands seemed prepared to goeven further along this line than their Benelux partners and might in the end themselves decide to do so. The disappointing feature of the situation, if reports of consultations between the Five atofficial level were correct, was a change in the attitude of theFederal German Government, and especially that of Herr Brandt,who had supported us strongly at the meeting of the ministerial council of the European Economic Community (e.c.) at Brusselson 18th-19th December but seemed since then to have moved to a Iposition much nearer that of the Federal Chancellor, Dr. Kiesinger.Herr Brandt was now said to be unwilling to attend the meeting of western European Union (WEU) on 29th-30th January; and whilethe Foreign Secretary would of course seek to persuade him to be present, it would probably not be right, if he were not successful,for the Foreign Secretary himself and other Foreign Ministers toattend the meeting. More generally it now seemed likely that theFederal Republic were determined, before considering any formof collaboration or consultation with us, to explore with the Frencha series of propositions which were quite unacceptable to us, as thePrime Minister had recently made cjear to a representative of theUnited States Government. These would involve a relationship with the e.c. which would not amount even to association, i.e.,initially, the formation of a free trade area with some agriculturalcontent, followed by a period of customs union, at the end ofwhich there would be negotiations for membership, but with no
assurance of success. It was highly improbable that proposals onthese lines would be sincerely accepted by the French; and theycould well involve us in a period of uncertainty lasting several years in which we should neither know where we stood nor have anyrights or voice in the Community. There was some suggestion that herr Brandt was himself sceptical as to the value of these proposals and wanted no more than a month&apos;s respite in which it would be demonstrated that there were no grounds for Dr. Kiesinger&apos;sprofessed belief that the French might be persuaded to consideraction on these or similar lines. But such reports should be treated with considerable reserve because of the clear risk inherent in theGerman proposals of prolonged delay before our situation waseffectively considered.In these circumstances he intended to probe Herr Brandfsintentions and to seek to bring him back, so far as possible, to themore favourable position from our point of view which he had previously occupied. It was impossible to say in advance what werethe prospects of success in this approach; and there was acomplicating factor in that Herr Brandt personally seemed to havetaken umbrage because the first consultations had been held in rome instead of in Bonn. He felt, however, that his visit to Bonnwould afford an opportunity to straighten out that and any similarcomplications and to explore the position fully and frankly withthe German Foreign Minister, after which he would of courseinform the Cabinet of the outcome of his consultations.In discussion there was general agreement that furtherconsideration of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s consultations with the Fivemust await the outcome of his meetings with Herr Brandt on thefollowing day. In these meetings, however, it would be important to make very clear to the Germans that in our view the proposalsDr. Kiesinger would be putting to General de Gaulle were not likelyto prove acceptable either to us or to the French; and that it was essential for us that unpromising discussions with the French on our future relationship with the e.c. should not be prolonged beyondthe forthcoming meeting between Dr. Kiesinger and general de Gaulle. Of the German proposals the only one which mightafford us commercial advantage (but would be otherwiseunattractive) would be that looking to the formation of a free trade area with the e.c., and even that only if it did not have theagricultural content at present envisaged. It would be wrong,however, to exert so much pressure on the Germans as to increaseany annoyance they might currently feel we had caused them, orto risk the appearance that we were seeking to split off the Fivefrom the French or the Four from the Germans. We should also have regard to the dangers of prejudice to the solidarity of theEuropean Free Trade Association (EFTA) and our position in it.On the other hand it was pointed out that it was difficult tosee what steps we could take to improve our position in relation tothe e.c. other than to co-operate and to collaborate with the Five
so far as they were willing to do so; and certainly it was hardly possible for us to remain inactive in this field. Our line should therefore be to consult and co-operate with those countries in the eec and in EFT A who were likely to prove willing partners. there appeared to be vio risk of our getting out of step with those of ourEFTA partners who had applied for membership of theCommunity; indeed the most serious danger to the solidarity of efta at present was the proposal for a Scandinavian Union whichhad recently been discussed by the Nordic Council and was to befurther discussed at a meeting of Scandinavian Prime Ministers atHarpsund. This proposal, which envisaged a greater degree ofeconomic and political union between Scandinavian countries than was contemplated by the countries of the e.c., had not arisen from our application to join the Community but from consideration ofthe European situation which had arisen as a result of the Frenchveto. We had ourselves, suggested an early meeting of the ministerial Council of EFTA but little enthusiasm for it had been shown by the other members.In further discussion it was urged that, while more detailed consideration could not usefully be given to our position in relationto the e.c. until after the Foreign Secretary had reported on histalks with Herr Brandt, it would be essential that, as soon as possible thereafter, the Cabinet should consider our position in the context of a comprehensive review of our foreign relations, economic andpolitical, which should itself take account of the implications of theGovernment^ recent decisions to reduce our commitments andaccelerate the withdrawal of our forces from the Middle and far east. The French Governments reception of our decisions radicallyto reduce international commitments which they had advanced asobstacles to our membership of the e.c. suggested that nothing wecould do would overcome French objections to our membership ofthe Community; it would be necessary to consider the implications of these factors for our European policy as a whole, and not simplythe question how best we might improve our relations with the EECor even with the Five.   Anxiety was- also expressed lest undueconcentration on this latter question might entail the risks, referredto earlier in the discussion, of seeming to seek to split the Six orthe Five; we should also bear in mind the dangers of antagonisingthe French, who were not without means to injure us if they felt wewere trying to organise the other members of the e.c. against them.Nor should we risk splitting EFTA as between those countries whohad applied for membership of the e.c. and those who had not,thus estranging ourselves from the latter and prejudicing the futureof EFTA. It was further urged that it would be realistic to recognisethat a satisfactory development of our relations with the e.c. onthe lines of the approach to Europe we had; been pursuing was nowunlikely to be achieved for some time; and, in the light of thesetback which our recent decisions to withdraw from the middle and Far East were likely to cause to our relations with the UnitedStates and the Commonwealth, we were in some danger of puttingourselves in a position where, with the bulk of our trade still with
CC 9 (68)countries outside Europe, we nevertheless had no satisfactoryrelations with major partners anywhere in the world. It wastherefore important that the Cabinet should as soon as possiblereassess our whole external policy, recognising that, in thesecircumstances, the Prime Ministers forthcoming meeting with thePresident of the United States might be more relevant than ourconsultations with European countries, to which a rather lowerpriority might have to be assigned in future than hitherto.It was further argued that even within Europe there were considerable opportunities for fruitful co-operation with countries other than those of the e.c. and of EFTA, and notably with thecountries of Eastern Europe. Mr. Kirillin, the Soviet Minister for science and Technology, during the course of his visit to Londonearlier in the week for further discussion on scientific and technicalcollaboration between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union,an agreement on which was due to be signed on the following day,had shown himself conscious of the potential effect on the UnitedStates and the Commonwealth of the Governmenfs recent decisions to reduce our international commitments. He had been at pains todevelop good relations with the Confederation of British Industry,and had been able to arrange for further discussions on a wide variety of subjects. Situated as we now were, it might be advantageous for us to abate to some extent our attempt to achievemembership of the e.c., to give first priority to the pursuit of ourown interests and to develop co-operation where it seemed profitablewith countries in any part of the world, notably the United Statesand Eastern Europe. Indeed, it could be argued that the economic measures which the Government had announced to Parliament onthe previous Tuesday contained clear implications of this kind.On the other hand it was pointed out that it would be wrong to draw further and far-reaching conclusions as to our externalpolicy, whether political or economic, without a full survey of ourposition in the light of the recent decisions to reduce our overseacommitments, of the Prime Minister^ discussions in Moscow and washington (which would take place before Dr. Kiesinger&apos;s meeting with General de Gaulle) and of the results of the consultations withthe Five. Moreover, our economic position was not such that wecould afford, by too single-minded a pursuit of our own interests, toalienate the countries with whom it was important for us to maintaingood economic and political relations. A comprehensive review ofour external position in the light of the events of the last two monthshad already been put in hand; but it would clearly be right to allowsufficient time for a report on these lines to be carefully prepared.In addition to the points made in discussion, this review would haveto take into account other considerations, e.g., the fact that a majorobjective of current French policy was to seek to bring the Six, andparticularly Germany, into line with French opposition to theUnited States in a number of fields, a purpose which it would be inour interest to seek to frustrate; and the fact that, as regards EFTA,
there was at present no stable Government in Denmark and theposition of other EFTA Governments was uncertain. It would clearly be premature to attempt to balance the complex of conflictingconsiderations affecting our future external policy in anticipation ofthe outcome of the various international discussions which were in prospect.The Prime Minister, summing up the Cabinefs discussion, saidthat there was general agreement that the Foreign Secretary shouldbe guided at his meeting with Herr Brandt, by the various points which had emerged. In particular it was cle:.r that general de Gaulle would seek to persuade Dr. Kiesinger to endorse theFrench attitude to British membership of the e.c., or at least notto oppose it; and that Dr. Kiesinger must therefore be encouraged to elicit from General de Gaulle a full and clear statement of hisposition on this issue. It was also essential that the GermanGovernment should be left in no doubt that, after the meeting between Dr. Kiesinger and General de Gaulle, we could not tolerate further delay arising out of a prolongation of the franco-German discussions of our position in relation to the e.c..There was general agreement that it would be right for the Cabinetto consider as soon as possible a comprehensive review of our external policy. Meantime, it might be advisable for us, whileseeking to maintain the interest of our European friends in our application for membership of the e.c. and continuing our consideration of the positive proposals we might put forward if a promising outcome to our initiative for collaboration with thecountries of the e.c. and of EFTA seemed likely, to beware of promoting discussions among the European countries of a degreeor a kind which might prove divisive and therefore counter-productive.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to be guided, in his forthcoming discussions with Herr Brandt, by the points made in their discussion.(3) Agreed to consider, at an early meeting, a comprehensive review of our external policy on the lines suggested intheir discussion.CONFIDENTIALScotland 3.   The Secretary of State for Scotland said that the hurricaneStorm Damage force winds which had struck central and southern Scotland in theearly hours of 15th January had caused widespread damage. Itwas estimated that 70,000 houses had been damaged or destroyed and some 2,000 people rendered homeless. The most gravelyaffected areas had been Glasgow and Greenock, which he had
CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIALhimself visited on the previous day. The public services, assisted bythe Army, had done excellent work in dealing with the immediateconsequences of the hurricane, but local authorities were naturallyanxious to know what assistance would be made available to them.He had told them that they should immediately carry out worknecessary for the safety of the public and to prevent further damage to basically sound property; and he had arranged for the joint parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, Dr. Mabon,to meet the authorities on 22nd January to obtain an estimate ofthe cost of the work required on public and private property andthe extent to which it was covered by insurance. Local authorities were employing the labour force from their housing projects, butit was necessary to bring scarce labour in from outside, and therewas some reluctance on the part of contractors to undertakeemergency work in the absence of a clear indication whereresponsibility for payment would lie. There was no basis, however,for the suggestion which had been put to him in the House ofCommons that the storm would justify restoring the housing programmes which were to be reduced as part of the Governmentspost-devaluation measures. The houses affected could not be builtfor at least two years and would not contribute to the solution ofthe immediate problem.The Prime Minister said that the situation should be treated asa special emergency and not as a reason for altering the economic measures already agreed upon. On that basis the Secretary of state should discuss with the Chancellor of the Exchequer means ofproviding the help necessary to enable urgent repairs to be carriedout.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State forScotland.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for Scotland,what financial help should be provided on an emergencybasis for the areas affected by the storm.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,19th January, 1968.
