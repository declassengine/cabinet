public expenditure:Post-devsiuaiionMeasures(previous reference:CC (68) 4thConclusions,Minute 3)Overseas Aid(previous reference:CC (67) 74thConclusions,Minute 5)R7!The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the basic aid programme had been fixed at  205 million a year in cash terms until1970-71. This basic programme would not include the increasedsubscription to the International Development Association (IDA) of up to  10 million, about  6 million of food aid under the kennedy round and mitigatory aid to Singapore of about  25 million and toMalaysia of about  18 million over the next three years. Increases inthe aid payments expressed in dollars and other currencies, and rising costs in sterling resulting from devaluation, should be absorbedwithin the  205 million. He had recently learnt of a new proposal togive additional aid to Zambia of some  10 million, of which 7 million would fall in 1968-69. If this aid were authorised, itshould be found from within the  205 million programme.The Minister of Overseas Development said that negotiations onthe level and terms of the replenishment of IDA had met considerable difficulties and our increased subscription would probably not amount to more than  7 million or  8 million. He reluctantlyaccepted the proposal to absorb the extra costs arising fromdevaluation within the  205 million aid budget. This, however,represented a further stage in a serious decline in the resources givento overseas aid. In July 1966 the aid budget had been reduced from 225 million to  205 million, and in the review of public expenditurein the summer of 1967 it had been decided to hold the basic aid programme at  205 million in cash terms for three years, with theresult that its value in real terms declined. The direct result of devaluation was to add some  10 million to our commitments inthe form of subscriptions expressed in dollars to international organisations; allowances for technical assistance personnel in countries which had not devalued; and bilateral aid to some countries, mainly dependent territories, which had not devalued inview of their close economic links with countries such as the UnitedStates or Australia. The aid programme would also suffer fromrising sterling costs resulting from devaluation. The total effect of devaluation would be to reduce the real value of our aid programme by about 9 per cent. This was a serious matter, especially as othercountries were not likely to increase their aid programmes and theappropriations proposed by the United States Administration hadbeen reduced by Congress. There would be no increase in the totalflow of aid to developing countries, just at the moment wheneverything argued  in favour of such  an increase.    Our aidCC 5 (68)secret the Cabinet resumed their consideration of the memorandumby the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C (68) 5) on reductions in public expenditure.
programme should be increased as soon as our economic situationallowed. Contingency assistance to Zambia had not previously been counted within the normal aid budget and should not be infuture. Under normal aid criteria Zambia would not qualify for capital aid.Tn discussion the point was made that it was relevant to the credibility of the economic measures we were introducing not toadopt a more generous attitude to overseas aid than other developed countries, particularly the United States. As a result of the reductions applied by Congress, United States expenditure on aid was likely to be below last year&apos;s figure. Our aid programme should be subjected to a searching examination, and the aid we proposed togive to Singapore and Malaysia in mitigation of our militarywithdrawal should not be regarded as entirely additional to thenormal programme. On the other hand, it was pointed out that ourofficial aid programme accounted for broadly the same proportion(0-6 per cent) of our gross national product as the average of allcountries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation andDevelopment (OECD). Overseas aid brought material advantages to our export trade and therefore to our balance of payments. Thequestion of further aid to Zambia should be considered in detail;it was relevant to note that Zambia had refused to buy British goods for certain development projects and that she was apparently trading with foreign companies who were defying the United Nationsresolution on mandatory sanctions against Rhodesia. Zambia&apos;reserves of foreign exchange were increasing and her attitude to thiscountry was generally unhelpful. However, aid to Zambia resulted from our policies on Rhodesia, and we had encouraged her to startprojects designed to free herself from dependence on Rhodesia andto assume that she would get aid from us to complete them. In thisconnection it was open to question whether we should continue asguarantors to make repayments to the World Bank on the Rhodesianshare of the loan for the Kariba Dam: consideration should be givento the possibility that the blocked Rhodesian funds in London shouldbe used for this and other similar purposes.Military Aid The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that he had written to hiscolleagues in the overseas departments to ask for a substantial reduction in military aid. The aim should be to bring our currentcommitments to an end and to accept no new commitments.Expenditure on military aid would be  21 million in 1967-68, 23 million in 1968-69 and  19 million in 1969-70. Of the 1967-68figure, about  4 million represented military technical assistance,mainly to Commonwealth countries. The largest item in theremaining  17 million was military aid to South Arabia (now theSouthern Yemen) amounting to  11 million.In discussion concern- was expressed at the increase in theprovision for military aid in 1968-69. It had been agreed that military aid to the Southern Yemen should continue for six monthsup to May 1968 but there was no commitment after that date. Anyfurther aid given should be economic rather than military and should
be found from within the overseas aid budget. Military aid for singapore might well be discussed during the forthcoming visit ofthe Singapore Prime Minister, Mr. Lee Kwan Yew. Concern wasalso expressed at the rise in forecast Government expenditure overseas from  338 million in 1967-68 to  381 million in 1968-69.Further information should be provided about the composition ofthese figures and the reasons for the increases.overseas The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that some 3,000presentation merni3ers 0f the Diplomatic Service were stationed abroad comparedwith some 8,000 or 9,000 from other Government Departments.Our missions abroad had been instructed to give absolute priority to commercial work and the promotion of exports. It would be highly understandable at this time to withdraw our representation from countries where we had a good chance of increasing our exports.Savings from concentrating missions into single posts serving anumber of adjacent countries would be liable to be offset by increasedtravelling costs. Withdrawing our missions from certain countries might also result in those countries closing their missions in Londonand a consequential loss in foreign exchange. As a result of devaluation, diplomatic staff abroad had accepted a 3 per cent reduction in the value of their allowances which had not been raised to take full account of the extra costs of devaluation. diplomatic service allowances were subject to periodic review and consideration was being given to ways of reducing standards of accommodation.In discussion it was suggested that in view of the considerablerise in expenditure on overseas representation a searching review ofthe need for all our missions abroad should be set in hand. the emphasis should be on the promotion of exports. There should beless need for the gathering of political intelligence as our politicaland military commitments were reduced. We should aim to modelour representation abroad more on the pattern of other european countries and not attempt to maintain a full international coverageon the lines of the United States. On the other hand, the view was expressed that the forthcoming reductions in military commitments and forces abroad increased the value of diplomatic representation. Many of our missions were very small, and they didan excellent job in promoting exports and helping Britishbusinessmen. Their value was particularly recognised by exportersthemselves. Furthermore the recent successes we had achieved at theUnited Nations, notably on the Middle East, were greatly assisted by rapid and efficient diplomatic activity by our representatives inmany small countries. The Estimates Committee, which had recently reported on diplomatic accommodation abroad, had found little evidence of wasteful expenditure.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat subject to further consideration of the level of government expenditure overseas, the Cabinet agreed that the basic aid programme should absorb the increases resulting from devaluationand should remain at  205 million until 1970-71. The question of
further aid for Zambia, other than &quot;technical assistance, should be examined by the Ministers concerned. The level of military aid andof Government overseas expenditure generally should be consideredagain at the meeting of the Cabinet that afternoon in the light offurther information about the composition of the totals given inC (68) 5 and the reasons for the forecast increases in 1968-69 and1969-70 compared with 1967-68. It might well be desirable to set inhand a review of the present level of our overseas representation,in both foreign and Commonwealth countries, in the light of ourchanged position in the world and of the need for our missionsabroad to share in the sacrifices which the British people at homewere being expected to make. This review should cover thepossibility of closing missions, perhaps by means of concentratingresponsibility for several countries in one mission, and the extent towhich the efforts of our diplomatic staffs should be diverted from political to commercial activities.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to provide further details of the forecast Government overseas expenditurein 1967-68, 1968-69 and 1969-70 and in particular ofmilitary aid expenditure in those years, for considerationby the Cabinet at their meeting that afternoon.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Minister of Overseas Development, the Minister ofState for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Statefor Commonwealth Affairs, to consider whether anycontingency assistance should be given to Zambia in1968-69 and later years and if so whether the amountshould be found from within the overseas aid ceiling.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would give furtherconsideration to the most appropriate means of promoting a review of the level of our overseas representation on the lines indicated in his summing up.(4) Agreed that, subject to further study of government expenditure overseas, the basic aid programme should remain at  205 million a year until 1970-71, this sum to absorb any increase in costs, including those resultingfrom devaluation.SpacePolicyELDO and black Arrow(previous reference:CC (68) 3rdConclusions)The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of technology on the European Launcher Development Organisation(ELDO) and Black Arrow (C (68) 17).The Minister of Technology said that he recognised that the space budget must contribute to the economies required in public expenditure. In practice this meant a re-examination of the proposed expenditure in ELDO and on Black Arrow. In considering this expenditure they must recognise the major issue of policy involved,which was whether or not we should opt out of space technology.He advised strongly against doing so and thus denying ourselves the
considerable commercial, industrial and technological benefits to be derived in future from space activities. The Government of theUnited States were currently spending some $7,000 billion a year onspace research. With our existing commitments in ELDO and forBlack Arrow we should spend $179 million over the period 1968-70compared with projected expenditure over the same period of$279 million by Germany and $311 million by France. Thememorandum examined four possible courses:(i) Cancelling Black Arrow and withdrawing from ELDOimmediately. This would end Britain&apos;s nationalsatellite technology, bring serious international political consequences and, because of legal financial liabilities, weshould save none of our committed expenditure onELDO.(ii) Cancelling Black Arrow but retaining our commitment tothe current ELDO programme. This would also end our national satellite technology while continuing our european space effort which was less valuable to Britain.(iii) Withdrawing from ELDO immediately but retaining black arrow. This would have the same legal and political difficulties, and involve us in the same financial liability for damages, as course (i).(iv) Supporting ELDO until the present programme ended andthen withdrawing from it while keeping Black Arrow.This would involve a substantial saving as compared with supporting the expected future programme for ELDO,and would retain our national capability for the verymodest cost, considering all that was involved, ofapproximately  3 million a year.He asked his colleagues to agree to course (iv). If this were agreedit would then be necessary to decide whether or not to make any announcement in next week&apos;s statement. We had asked curEuropean partners in July 1967 to commission a cost/benefit study of the ELDO programme and this study was due for consideration in May 1968. It would create unnecessary friction if we were to announce our withdrawal from future ELDO programmes nowinstead of in the light of the study. It would cost us no more to wait.The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that he wouldalso recommend course (iv). If we now abrogated our existing commitments to ELDO it would cost us as much, by way of damages,as if we honoured them. Moreover, there would be no foreign exchange cost in continuing to meet these commitments because wehad a larger share of the orders placed by the Organisation than our present share of the total contributions to it. He had succeeded in 1966 in reducing the United Kingdom contribution from 39 percent to 27 per cent and inserting a break clause which enabled us torefuse future contributions to ELDO, without liability to damagesor ill feeling, when the agreed total figure of expenditure had been
reached. This total amounted to  75 million for the UnitedKingdom of which we had already spent  50 million and we had still to spend  25 million on the current programme. We should refuse to contribute to any future ELDO programme but continueto maintain our own Black Arrow programme.The Attorney-General said that he agreed with the Ministerof State for Foreign Affairs about withdrawal from our currentcommitments to ELDO. If we withdrew now and the issue were taken by our partners to arbitration as it would be under thetreaty the damages awarded against us might well amount notonly to our outstanding commitments of some  25 million but alsoperhaps to a contribution towards the nugatory expenditure by our partners if our withdrawal resulted in the abandonment of the presentELDO programme. He advised therefore that if we wished to endour financial contributions to ELDO, we should take advantage ofthe break clause which had been negotiated by the Minister of Statefor Foreign Affairs.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that paragraph 15 of thememorandum was not entirely accurate, the present PESC figuresdid not include any element for a future ELDO programme so thatan offer by the Minister of Technology to withdraw from such a programme represented no cut in the present public expenditureestimates. He agreed, however, that we should terminate our ELDOcommitments as soon as we could take advantage of the breakclause. As far as Black Arrow was concerned he had proposed thatthe estimates should contain nothing for this project beyondcancellation charges. This would enable Ministers to examine indetail the case for continuing Black Arrow over the next few months and if it was decided then to continue the project it would benecessary to provide a supplementary estimate.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat there was general agreement that we should end our financial contribution to ELDO as soon as our current commitments had been met. There should be no provision in the estimates for Black Arrowbeyond cancellation charges. There should be a rigorous examinationof the case for continuing Black Arrow over the next month or twoin the light of which they would decide whether or not to continueit. The Government statement about cuts in public expenditure should make no reference either to ELDO or to the future of black arrow.The Cabinet (5) Agreed that the United Kingdom should accept no further financial commitments in ELDO.(6) Agreed that there should be provision only for cancellationcharges in respect of Black Arrow in the Estimates for1968-69.(7) Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange for an earlyreview of the Black Arrow project.
The Minister of Technology said that the Cabinet, at their meeting on 9th January (CC (68) 3rd Conclusions), had invited theSecretary of State for Defence to consider with him to what extentsavings could be found in defence research and development to offset the savings still required to be found in 1968-69 in expenditure on government civil research and technological support. They had reached agreement on a reduction of  2 - 7 million in defence research and development expenditure, which included a reduction inspending on aerospace and advanced combat aircraft as well as staffsavings at the Royal Aircraft and Royal Radar Establishments, andhe had also found it possible to make a further saving of  0-65million by the Atomic Energy Authority (sea) (in addition to the cut of  3 million already imposed). This made the total of  3-35million which they had been asked to find and was in addition tothe  6-65 million which, he had already agreed, should be cut fromthe present provision for 1968-69 for Government research and technological support. The reduction of  10 million for which hewas asked in respect of 1969-70 would involve an actual reductionin civil technological support for industry between 1968-69 and.1969-70 unless the Secretary of State for Defence was able to agreeto further cuts in defence research and development expenditure inthe latter year. He could, however, offer a firm cut of  5 million in 1969-70 with the possibility of a further  5 million saving if but only if the Steam Generating Heavy Water reactor did not by then offer sufficient prospects of success to justify further expenditure upon it.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would accept, theproposals by the Minister of Technology for 1968-69 although theywere not entirely satisfactory since the Treasury had, in any event,expected to reduce the estimate for defence research and development in 1968-69 by  1-8 million as a result of their normal examinationof estimates. It was his understanding that the Cabinet had already agreed that there should be a reduction of  10 million, without qualification, in the expenditure on Government research and technological support in 1969-70. He could not be satisfied with less than this and he suggested that the application of stricterfinancial control particularly to some of the Ministry&apos;s dependentorganisations might contribute some of the savings required.The Secretary of State for Defence said that he had offered tohelp the Minister of Technology by accepting a cut of  2-7 million in defence research and development expenditure in 1968-69. Buthe was not in a position to offer any further cut in 1969-70 froma defence budget which had already been most severely pruned.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the arrangements agreed between the Secretary of State for defence and the Minister of Technology in respect of 1968-69 were approved. For 1969-70 there should be a firm cut of  10 million in Government research and technological support, as proposed bythe Chancellor.  It was not necessary at this stage to work out in
detail how this cut should be apportioned but there should be strongbias against reducing expenditure on civil technological support for industry. The possibility that a contribution might be made by areduction in defence research and development expenditure, as in1968-69, should not be ruled out at this stage.The Cabinet (8) Approved the reductions indicated by the Minister of technology in defence research and development andAEA expenditure, totalling  3-35 million in 1968-69.(9) Agreed that the present provision for government expenditure for research and technological support in1969-70 should be reduced by  10 million.Balance of The Prime Minister said that it would now be convenient foratVwhole&quot;68    ^e Cabinet to begin discussion of the adequacy and balance of themeasures taken as a whole.The President of the Board of Trade said that it was firstnecessary to decide what should be the total reduction in demandwhich the Government should aim to secure, whether by cuts in public expenditure or by increased taxation in the next Budget. TheChancellor of the Exchequer proposed that the target should be areduction of  500- l,000 million, which was the estimate given inthe latest medium-term economic forecast. In his view, it wouldbe unrealistic to aim at a reduction as large as  1,000 million: itwould not in any case be practicable to secure a sv/itch of resourcesof this order, and if it were, the result would be to produce a balanceof payments surplus so high as to give rise to serious international difficulties. It would be wiser to aim at a total reduction of about 750 million.Next, it was necessary to consider how much of this should besecured by reductions in public expenditure and how much by reductions in personal consumption. Personal consumption wasappreciably higher as a percentage of gross national product in thiscountry than in most other comparable countries. It was alsorelevant that we were now experiencing a boom in consumerspending. The tax increases which would be necessary to securerestraint in personal consumption would be politically acceptablein the present climate of opinion. There was therefore a case for securing a considerable part of the necessary reduction in demand by higher taxation; it was clear, however, that it would not be practicable or desirable to secure the whole reduction in this way.The right course would be to aim at cuts in public expenditure tothe value of some  400 million. This would still mean that public expenditure would be rising by some 3 per cent in 1968-69 and 2 percent in the following year, while personal consumption would go upby about 1 per cent and 2 per cent respectively in those years.In his original memorandum the Chancellor of the exchequer had proposed cuts in public expenditure amounting to some 370 million in 1969-70. From the decisions already taken by theCabinet, it was clear that cuts of this order could now be secured.
In addition, there would be further savings on the civil side fromrestrictions on the rate support grant, and some of the expenditureon family allowances would be offset by &quot; give and take&quot; taxadjustments. As regards defence, reductions of  70- 100 million in1969-70 would be the minimum which was acceptable. In theaggregate therefore the reductions in prospect were approaching some 450 million. While he would not argue that this total was too high,it gave some scope for adjustments at the margin as betweenexpenditure cuts and increases in taxation.Turning to the balance of cuts as between the different civilprogrammes, the reduction on roads was reasonable, bearing in mind that there must be some uncertainty how far they would be achieved in the local authority field; the housing cuts were reasonable, havingregard to the developing excess of households over houses available;and the interests of the development areas would be amplysafeguarded. Education, however, seemed likely to fare worst, taking account of restrictions on the n te support grant as well as of theproposed direct cuts, both in terms of the total cut and of the rateof increase in expenditure. Many of the cuts in education would arouse fierce opposition. There was therefore a case for reconsideringthe Cabinets decision to postpone for two years the raising of theschool-leaving age. This decision stood out among all the othersas the only one which ran counter to the Governments basic politicalprinciples; it would have unfortunate economic consequences through its effects on the future quality of the labour force, and would arousedeep hostility on the part of informed independent opinion. It wouldalso, because of its effect on school building, increase the clanger of under-employment in the construction industry.If this decision were reconsidered it would be necessary to findequivalent savings elsewhere. This might be done by reducinghousing approvals by a further 5,000, and by making savings of 3- 4 million in 1969-70 on grants and loans to service installations in the development areas. Any remaining deficiency could be made good by increased taxation or hire-purchase restrictions.It was wrong to think that we had to achieve a single target of savings which would then serve as a basis for economic policy fora substantial period: it would be necessary over the next 12 months to be flexible in managing demand to match the situation as itdeveloped.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he agreed that economic policy would need to be flexible to match the changing situationfollowing devaluation. But the changes which had so far occurredhad all pointed to the need for a bigger rather than a smallerreduction in demand. One important factor was the size of thebalance of payments deficit for 1967 which was now estimated tohave been  488 million, of which  400 million occurred during thesecond half of the year. It was absolutely essential that we should move from this position to a substantial surplus in 1969. The recentmeasures taken by the United States Government to reduce their
balance of payments deficit affected our position in that we mustrevise downwards the size of the surplus which it would be practicable for us to achieve in 1969: this would now be more likely to be 400 million than  500 million. If by the first half of 1969 we wereto be earning a surplus at this rate, whereas in the second half of1967 we had incurred a deficit at an annual rate of  800 million,we should need to ensure a switch of resources into exports and import saving, not of  1,000 million, but of  1,200 million. this made no allowance for the worsening in the terms of trade following devaluation, which would call for a further transfer of resources ofsome  250- 350 million if we were to achieve the required surplus.Some allowance must also be made for an increase in investment in manufacturing industry, for which  100 million would be a modestallowance. This added up to a requirement for a switch of resourcesof some  1,600 million. Against this could be set the measures announced immediately following devaluation which would probablyreduce demand by some  200 million. This still faced us with theneed for a reduction of some  1,400 million; while we could not contemplate an operation of this order, the argument showedconclusively that to aim at a reduction of  1,000 million was in no way excessive. If we were to secure less than this, the balanceof payments surplus in 1969 would be correspondingly smaller.The decisions taken by the Cabinet would secure the greaterpart of the reductions for which he had asked, but there should beno question of reversing them. His calculations showed thatthe decisions now taken represented total reductions in public expenditure of  330 million in 1968-69 and  360 million in 1969-70(assuming a reduction of  50 million in defence in that year). Butthe effects on demand would be substantially less, amounting to areduction of some  165 million in 1968-69 and  250 million in1969-70. This would leave nearly two-thirds of the whole reduction to be secured by increased taxation. It had also to be borne in mind that some of the measures so far agreed would reduce taxable capacity for example, the increase in the National Health service contribution, prescription charges and tax adjustments to offset thecost of family allowances. While it would be necessary to avoidacting too precipitately with the result that there would beunemployment and under-use of capacity, the general picture wasthat a disproportionate part of the reduction in demand was being left to be secured by higher taxation, and there should thereforebe no question of smaller reductions in public expenditure.His colleagues might wish to have some indication of the prospective rise in expenditure covered by the Supply Estimates for1968-69. Before the cuts, the Estimates would have shown anincrease in money prices of 12-2 per cent, or 11 per cent if the selective Employment Tax (SET), Regional Employment Premium(REP) and investment grants were excluded; the corresponding figures after the cuts would be 10-8 per cent and 9-8 per cent. Interms of constant prices, and excluding SET, etc., the increase beforethe cuts would have been 9 per cent and the increase after the cuts would be 8 per cent.  As regards the total of public expenditure (as
far agreed, would be as follows:Per centSocial Security              ............ 5-education    .................. 4-2Health and Welfare        ............ 3-housing      .................. 5-roads        .................. 8-other Transport    ............... 10 6Home Departments Services (excluding HomeDefence)        ............... 5-home Defence      ............... -25-0Technology          ............... 12-0Overseas Expenditure      ............ 6-1Agriculture          ............... 2-other Environmental Services   ...      ...      ... 5-other Expenditure................. 5-5In discussion, support was expressed for the view that to aim at a transfer of resources of  1,000 million would be excessive: if demandwere reduced to that extent, it was doubtful if industrial expansionwould be sufficient to take up the slack. There would therefore bea danger that resources would be left unused and this would haveadverse effects on confidence.On the other hand it was argued that while it was impossibleto prove the case for a reduction in demand of a precise amount,a reduction of the order proposed by the Chancellor of the exchequer was fully justified. The extent to which the cuts in public expenditure so far agreed would leave a requirement for increased taxation was disturbing. There were few increases in taxes whichwould not have adverse economic effects, either by eroding incentives to work or by undermining the prices and incomes policy. Therewas therefore no case for reducing the total cuts now envisaged.Moreover, public opinion at all levels was now expecting strongaction, and it would be disastrous if the Governmenfs measures were thought to be too timid either in their total effect or in respect ofparticular measures.The Cabinet-(10) Agreed to resume at a later meeting their consideration ofthe balance of the measures as a whole.Cabinet Office, S.W. I,13th January, 1968.distinct from the Supply Estimates), in terms of constant prices thiswould have increased before the cuts by 7 per cent, and would increase after the cuts by 4-7 per cent; if SET, etc., were excluded,the corresponding figures would be 5-5 per cent and 3-7 per cent.It would also be of interest to the Cabinet to have some figuresof the relative increase in expenditure on the different civilprogrammes.
