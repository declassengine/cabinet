public expenditure :Post-DevaluationMeasures(previous reference:CC (68) 5thConclusions)general reduction inDefenceExpenditureOverseas(previous reference:CC(68) 1stConclusions,Minute 3)8741a 2SECRETThe Cabinet resumed their discussion of the post-devaluationmeasures proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in C (68) 5.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, in response to a question aboutthe relationship between his proposals for public expenditure and policy on taxation and on prices and incomes, said that hisexpenditure proposals assumed that the Governments incomes policy would be effective in preventing the increase in pricesconsequent upon devaluation from causing incomes to grow fasteras a result of devaluation than they would otherwise have done.In so far as this assumption proved to be optimistic, it would benecessary to that extent to make greater use of taxation policy as a means of restraining the growth of demand.  In response to furtherquestions whether he was satisfied that the measures he was proposing in order to restrain public expenditure would, taken as awhole, prove sufficient to restore confidence in the stability of the economy, he said that the announcement of the measures before thepublication of the Estimates should neutralise any adverse reactions to the latter and, while he would have liked to see a larger total reduction in public expenditure, the Cabinets discussions had shownhow difficult it would be to achieve this.   He would of course beprepared to examine any further economies such as had beensuggested, e.g., in respect of postponement of expenditure ondecimalisation of the currency and of the expansion of StanstedAirport; but there was always a risk that such postponements mightwell lead to higher expenditure later. Perhaps the major points were that there was no absolute figure for reductions in public expenditure which would be just right and that the effect of the measures depended on their quality as well as on the total saving achieved.  In other words, the measures must be such as would demonstrate that theGovernment were prepared to make changes in policy considerableenough to achieve their purpose; and in his view, the proposals before the Cabinet would do this.  While, therefore, he would have preferred to make a larger total reduction in public expenditure programmes, he believed that his proposals, considering their natureas well as their scope, would prove adequate: he was accordinglyprepared to face the somewhat larger budgetary problem which might result.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, inconsultation with the Ministers concerned, would consider the further economies in public expendituresuggested in the discussion.The Prime Minister recalled that at their meeting on 4th january the Cabinet had invited the Defence Secretary, if he so wished, to propose alternative economies with a view to securing defencesavings no less than would be secured by cancelling the order forthe F-lll aircraft. The Cabinet now had before them a memorandumby the Defence Secretary (see (68) 19). Before considering thismemorandum the Cabinet might, however, wish to hear from theForeign Secretary an account of his recent visit to Washington and
also to have a report from the Minister of State for Foreign affairs on his tour of the Persian Gulf area.The Foreign Secretary said that he had had a disturbing anddistasteful discussion with the United States Secretary of State,Mr. Dean Rusk, in Washington on the previous day. He had alsomet the United States Secretary for Defense, Mr. McNamara, atlunch, and had had a telephone conversation with President Johnson.He had forcefully and faithfully presented to them the case for the cabinet&apos;s decision to withdraw from the Far East and from thePersian Gulf by the end of the financial year 1970-71 and to cancel the order for F-lll aircraft. Mr. Rusk&apos;s reaction had been, as always,kindly and courteous. But he had not concealed that he was shockedand dismayed. He had used the phrase &quot; For God&apos;s sake act likeBritain &quot;. He clearly believed that we were opting out of our worldresponsibilities. He had said that it was the end of an era; and bythat he had in particular implied that it was the end of the age ofco-operation between the United States and ourselves. confidence in us had been terribly shaken. An official of the State Departmentwho had been present at his meeting with Mr. Rusk had asked whatinternational role we thought we could play in future if we were planning to withdraw from the Far East and the Middle East andas he understood the Prime Minister to have implied in his recent conversation with the United States Under-Secretary,Mr. Katzenback, we planned to withdraw even from Europe if we did not secure 100 per cent offset for the foreign exchange costs ofstationing our forces in Germany. We therefore faced a critical situation in our relations with the United States. What Mr. Ruskhad called &quot; the acrid aroma of a fait accompli &quot; had hit them deeplyand hard. The consequences of our decisions could be very grave;and their cost in the short run might be greater than the savings theywere meant to achieve. It was possible that irreparable damage hadalready been done to our relations with the United States merely bycommunicating our decisions to them. But there was a chance thatour change of policy would be grudgingly accepted by the UnitedStates if we (a) decided not to cancel the order for F-lll aircraft and(b) extended by a year, to 1972, the time limit for our withdrawal from the Far East and, consequently, from the Persian Gulf. On thefirst point it was only the possession of F-lll aircraft which wouldgive credibility to the general capability which we claimed we shouldhave available after our withdrawal from the Far East and middle east for use in Europe and elsewhere in the world. On the second point there was no doubt that the United States Government were more concerned by our withdrawal from the Middle East than fromthe Far East. In the Far East they were hopeful of bringing theViet-Nam war to a fairly early conclusion and thereafter of being able to exercise sufficient influence in the area from their island bases in the Pacific. They would therefore prefer us not to set any termfor our withdrawal from the Middle East, let alone announce a date,and to postpone our withdrawal from the Far East until 1972. Hehad tried to explain to them that we could not stay in the Middle Eastafter our withdrawal from the Far East; so long as we remained inthe Persian Gulf, we could not make the savings that would result
from eliminating our carrier force. Although representatives of theDepartment of Defense had understood this, Mr. Rusk had not:nor had he understood that, once we had announced our withdrawal from the Middle East, we should probably not be able to stay there as long as we intended. The Foreign Secretary considered however that the arguments he had repeatedly deployed on these points would,on reflection, quickly become clear to the whole of the United states administration; and he had made clear to them that the Cabinet&apos;decision was firm. But he had undertaken to report their views tohis colleagues. In view of United States reaction he now recommended that we should postpone our withdrawal from theFar East by a year and then withdraw from the Far East and thePersian Gulf at the same time.The Prime Minister said that the attitude of the United StatesGovernment was considerably affected by their fear of a swing toisolationism in America. This had been clear from his talk withMr. Katzenbach. He had not implied to Mr. Katzenbach that we intended to withdraw from Germany. But he had made clear thatarrangements whereby the United States pre-empted all Germany&apos;savailable foreign exchange to offset the stationing costs of their forces, leaving us to pay our own, would be unacceptable; and thatin that event we might be forced to consider difficult policy decisions.But this did not affect the new principle in our defence policy, whichwas now to concentrate on Europe. He was not impressed by theAmerican complaint that they had been faced with a fait accompli.The economic decisions announced by President Johnson on1st January would add an additional  100 million to the burden onour balance of payments; but they had been taken without consultingor warning us. It was important to our future relations that bothwe and the United States should recognise, especially now that wewere both seeking to eliminate our external deficits, that we musteach look after our own interests. They might be able to damageus economically if they wished; but it should not be thought that wewere not in a position to reply in kind by, for example, withdrawingour investments from the United States. Our common interests werefrequently frustrated by the United States Administration^ regard for their public opinion. He recognised that they had their domesticdifficulties; they should also recognise that we had ours.The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that in the lastweek he had visited all the countries of the Persian Gulf. He had seen the Shah of Iran, King Faisal of Saudi Arabia, and the Rulersof the various Persian Gulf States, and had communicated to them the decision of the Cabinet to withdraw our forces from the persian gulf not later than the end of the financial year 1970-71. Reactionshad ranged from the practical readiness of the Shah and King Faisalto work out alternative arrangements for preserving stability in thearea after our withdrawal to downright panic on the part of the rulers of some of the smaller States. Some Rulers had urged thatwe should not withdraw at all; and there had been some suggestionthat some of the wealthy oil States might offer to pay part of our
defence costs. All the Rulers had agreed that any public announcement of the date of withdrawal would be dangerous forthe future stability of the area in that it would enable subversiveelements to plan more effectively to exploit the situation followingour withdrawal. On the timing of our withdrawal there were three main arguments for spreading it over four rather than three years.First, three years was a short time in which to complete all thearrangements which would be necessary, including the abrogationof existing Treaties. Secondly, in Bahrain at least, more time was needed to build up local industry. Thirdly, three years was too short a period to enable the various States to settle the numerous territorialdisputes between themselves. As a result of his visit he was convincedthat it was essential to allow ourselves more time for withdrawal andthat, although we should have a fixed date for withdrawal in mind,we should not announce it publicly.In discussion the view was expressed that we could not afford to disregard the views of the United States Government. defence and foreign policy decisions could not be taken in a vacuum. If weacted in a way likely to provoke United States hostility, we riskedgrave financial and economic consequences. The United States didnot need to take hostile action, but merely to refuse their help. our future position and influence in the world were at stake. The UnitedStates were determined to reduce their own defence expenditure;and it was likely that, as we withdrew into Europe, they would withdraw from it to some extent. This could significantly disturbthe equilibrium within Western Europe and between Western and eastern Europe which had prevailed for the last 20 years. If we withdrew from the Far East and retained a sophisticated and generaldefence capability in Europe, we could still exercise a possiblydecisive influence. The date of our withdrawal from the Far east was a matter of judgment. An extra year might make all thedifference between an orderly withdrawal and a precipitate and dangerous rout. It would be an additional advantage if this delayhelped to avoid prejudice to our relations with the United States.On the other hand it was argued that the time had come for a decisive break with our previous policies. We should no longeradopt policies merely because the United States wished us to adoptthem and out of fear for the economic consequences if we did not do so. The friendship of the United States had been valuable to us;but we had often paid a heavy price for it. Both countries now facedbalance of payments difficulties. The United States were dealingwith theirs by a policy based mainly on self-interest. They couldnot complain if we did the same. We were making a basic change ofpolicy, which was bound to be painful. We had already told our allies of our decisions; and the inevitable damage was thereforealready done. If we now modified those decisions we risked getting the worst of both worlds. World-wide commitments were not anessential condition of United States co-operation. Our policy was now to concentrate on Europe; and there was no reason why ourrelations with the United States should not be at least as good as,for example, those between the United States and Germany.
In discussion of our withdrawal from the Persian Gulf it waspointed out that damage had already been done now that the localRulers had been informed of our decisions; and an extra year wouldmake no significant difference. The threat to our oil installationsdid not come solely from the possibility of subversive or nationalistuprisings but also from clashes between States, such as an attack byIraq on Kuwait or by Iran on Bahrain. On the other hand it was argued that time was needed for Iran and Saudi Arabia to agree on arrangements to ensure stability after our withdrawal and for theother States in the area to acquiesce in them. Iran had already promised not to attack Bahrain, and on that basis Saudi Arabiamight exercise similar restraint. In view of the size of our investment in the area we had a strong interest in ensuring an orderly withdrawal and in leaving stable arrangements behind us. We should allow ourselves an extra year to organise this. It was possible that inpractice we might be able to leave earlier. But, if we announced an earlier date, there would be the maximum risk of disorder and of damage to our oil installations.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat, in the light of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s talks in Washington, ofthe visit of the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs to the persian gulf and of the Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s conversations with theGovernments of Malaysia, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand,the Cabinet would wish to consider whether their decision towithdraw our forces from Malaysia and Singapore and from thePersian Gulf by the end of the financial year 1970-71 should stand.Although it would not in practice be possible to remain in thePersian Gulf after we had withdrawn from the Far East, rather different considerations applied in the former case and individual members of the Cabinet held different views on what our policy should be in the two areas. A separate decision should thereforebe taken in each case. Before these decisions were taken, it wouldbe right for the Commonwealth Secretary to be able to report on his visit to the Far East, during which he had undertaken to convey theviews of the Governments concerned to his colleagues. final decisions should therefore be deferred until a meeting of the Cabineton Monday, 15th January, at which the Commonwealth secretary would be present and he himself would also be able to report on his forthcoming discussions with the Prime Minister of Singapore,Mr. Lee Kuan Yew.The Cabinet (2) Agreed to defer a final decision on the dates of our withdrawal from the Far East and the Persian Gulf onthe basis proposed by the Prime Minister in his summing up of their discussion.The Prime Minister said that, before continuing their discussionof the economies to be made in defence policy and expenditure, theCabinet should know of the representations which the Chiefs of staff had made to him, as they were constitutionally entitled to do, about
the difficulties which would confront them in implementing a decisionto complete our withdrawals from the Far East and the Persian Gulfas rapidly as was now contemplated. They had in no way sought to challenge either the decisions themselves or the need for them;indeed, in pointing out certain difficulties involved in the timing ofthe withdrawal from the Persian Gulf, they had referred to their responsibility to see that the withdrawals were carried out in the best possible way. Their concern had been rather that, whereas underthe previous policy announced in the 1967 Defence Review white paper our withdrawal from the areas East of Suez by the mid-1970swould allow those withdrawals to take place concurrently with the consequential reductions in the size and the changes in the structure of the Armed Forces, the more rapid withdrawal by 31st March, 1971,now envisaged would make that concurrence impracticable. Thiswas because the corresponding reductions in the size of the armed forces could not be effected by that date without enforcedredundancies, which would not be in accordance with the terms ofservice of the members of the Forces. Unless, therefore, thecompletion of the reduction in the size of the Armed Forces couldbe postponed somewhat beyond the date set for completion of thewithdrawals from areas East of Suez, they would be faced, especiallyhaving regard to the scope and nature of the reductions now envisaged, with serious problems in maintaining the morale and discipline of the Forces. By way of illustration of this point, theChiefs of Staff had outlined a number of specific problems whichthey would encounter, including notably those arising from thedecisions taken in 1966, and now again in 1968, to phase out aircraft carriers.He was satisfied that the representations made by the Chiefswere legitimate and reasonable; and he invited the Secretary of Statefor Defence, who had been present at his discussion with them, to supplement the report he had just made in any respect he feltnecessary.The Secretary of State for Defence endorsed the Prime Ministerssummary of the representations made by the Chiefs of Staff, adding that they themselves had been properly concerned that there shouldbe no publicity about their representations to the Prime Minister.The Chiefs had been rightly anxious about the problems of morale and discipline which would arise if they were required to demobiliseas many as 75,000 men over a period of some three years, instead ofover the period of some eight years which had been provided for under the previous policy. Such a rate of rundown would inevitably involve compulsory redundancies, the effect of which would be reinforced by the fact that accelerated withdrawals and rundownnow under discussion followed successive reviews of defence policyinvolving reductions in the size of the Armed Forces. There was clear evidence that these reductions had affected recruiting for all three Services; the recruiting figures for the previous month,December 1967, had been particularly bad and an unusually high proportion of non-commissioned officers were now seeking to leavethe Royal Air Force.   The Chiefs of Staff were therefore anxious
bthat the statement of policy to be made to Parliament in the following week should provide for a measure of flexibility in respect of therate of rundown of the Armed Forces; and the Cabinet would appreciate that it would be wrong for him, as Secretary of State for defence, to disregard the advice of the Chiefs of the Services on questions of morale and discipline, for which they were responsible.In his judgment it would be possible to reach the targets set for arundown of the Services in four years but extremely difficult to doso in three. In particular, as regards the Persian Gulf, the problemsof withdrawal would not be exacerbated if the terminal date for withdrawal was the same as that set for the withdrawal from theFar East: moreover, because of the rigidity imposed by the difficultiesof rapid demobilisation, and because our forces stationed in the Gulfwere in any event not large, an earlier withdrawal from that area would not produce any significant financial savings. These wereissues of political, rather than financial, judgment; and in his view there would be advantage in not announcing that the withdrawal from the Gulf would be completed in 1971, though he consideredthat, if the Cabinet decided to complete the withdrawals from boththe Middle and Far East in 1972, it would be right to announce thatas the Governmenfs decision.The Cabinet then turned to consideration of the memorandumby the Secretary of State for Defence on defence cuts and the F-lll(C(68)19).The Defence Secretary said that at their meeting on 4th january the Cabinet had favoured cancellation of the F-lll but had left itopen to him to put forward alternative economies. If the proposals that he now put forward were accepted, the result would be a saving in defence expenditure of some  3,500 million in the five years1967-68 to 1972-73 by comparison with the plans of the previous administration. In addition to the saving of  114 million inplanned defence expenditure following the defence expenditurestudies which would result from the cuts made immediately following devaluation, there would be savings of  100 million each in 1969-70and 1970-71 and  150 million in each of the following two years.These very large reductions in the defence programme had to be viewed against the risks to morale that would flow from the large and very rapid rundown in the manpower of the Services that wouldbe involved, particularly if the date for final withdrawal from theFar East and Middle East was 31st March, 1971. It might not infact prove possible to disband our forces at a rate which would keep pace with our withdrawal and thus achieve by March 1971 theservice manpower target previously set for 1975; a still lower total strength for the forces might subsequently prove possible, although this could not yet be quantified. He believed that the risks to servicemorale that were involved in this rundown were acceptable; but, atthe same time, it was vital to this morale, to our security and to our influence in the world, that the resources that we were still preparedto devote to defence should be spent on the most cost-effectiveprogramme that we could devise.   Reductions in commitments
would enable certain types of capability to be eliminated, replacedor reduced to the lowest viable level; but the programme must continue to provide the types of capability necessary for the levels of warfare in which our forces might become involved. He had therefore put forward proposals for cuts in the defence programme on the basis that the F-lll was retained. Given the commitmentsthat we now planned to maintain, we could phase out the carrierforce and sea-based fixed-wing aircraft when we left the Far Eastand the Persian Gulf, though it might be cheaper to complete therefit of HMS Ark Royal which was already in hand and phase outHMS Eagle instead; it would not now be worthwhile to cancel theorder for naval Phantom aircraft. There would be a general slowing down in the rate of naval construction, including a 50 per cent reduction in the building rate of fleet submarines. Now that we hadspent or committed 95 per cent of the capital cost of our polaris submarines, this programme, which would involve running costs of only about  20 million a year, should continue. The progress which France and China were making with the development and productionof nuclear weapons, the unlikelihood that our abandonment of nuclear weapons would influence the attitude of other countriestowards non-proliferation and the probability that nuclear weaponswould in fact proliferate pointed strongly to our retaining our nuclearcapability, although we should seek to reduce expenditure at the atomic Weapons Research Establishment. We would not need todecide until about 1975 whether or not to develop a further generation of nuclear weapons.As regards the Army, it would not be possible to eliminate any specific capability; but economies would result from manpowerreductions which would involve the elimination of 28 major units in four years and a reduction of 13,000 in supporting arms. There wouldalso be a large number of small reductions in the equipment programme. The RAF would retain the Harrier aircraft; and itwould not now be economic to cancel any RAF Phantoms. Weshould, however, decide not to develop an alternative to theAnglo-French variable geometry aircraft (AFVG), since nocollaborative project seemed likely. We should cancel the Martelair-to-ground guided weapon, phase out the Bloodhound surface-to-air guided weapon more quickly, and probably not proceed withthe planned Airborne Early Warning (AEW) aircraft. We shouldalso make large reductions in the planned maritime reconnaissance and transport aircraft forces by eliminating older types of aircraft.There would also be large economies in research and development expenditure (particularly on aero-space) and in the general supportof the forces; some details of these would be given in the defence white Paper.These proposals were made on the basis that the problem wasto find alternative economies in defence expenditure thai wouldenable the F-lll to be retained and that its cancellation was notbeing pressed for symbolic or presentational reasons. The case for retaining the aircraft on economic grounds was strong in view ofthe benefits which offset arrangements would bring in both the short
CC6(68)and the long term. On military grounds, the aircraft had the full support of the four Chiefs of Staff, although the economies whichmight have to be made in order to retain it would fall on the programmes of all three Services. Without the protection whichthe F-l 11 would provide the lives of our servicemen would be at risk.Moreover, it was an essential component of our contribution to NATO, particularly in view of the cancellation of the AFVG and ofthe revised strategy which NATO had now adopted, largely at ourinstance, of increasing&quot; conventional air power in order to delay thepoint at which the use of nuclear weapons might begin. The F-lllwas irreplaceable as regards its range, low-level performance and reconnaissance capability. If, however, we were to do without it butnot fall to the level of Holland and Belgium in our air contribution to NATO the best, though very inferior, alternative would be topurchase 75 additional Phantoms, which would reduce to  115 million the saving that would be made by cancelling the F-lll. It was forthis reason that, in the proposals before the Cabinet, he had suggestedthat from the financial point of view it would be right to seekadditional savings of this amount and retain the F-lll. This couldbe done by cancelling Martel and finding the balance of the economies from among the cancellation of the AEW aircraft andthe earlier elimination of Bloodhound, the Argosy and theV-Bombers. He would guarantee that, if necessary, further economies would be made in the period 1972-77 to save the full costof the F-lll. This underlined the degree of priority which he andthe Chiefs of Staff attributed to the F-l 11.In reply to certain specific questions about the F-lll. theDefence Secretary said that there was no reason to think that theUnited States Administration would cancel the version of the F-lllthat we had ordered although they might cancel the other twoversions; that the sideways-looking radar and cameras for theaircraft already existed; that anti-ballistic missiles and other air defences did not seem likely to constitute an undue risk to low-levelaircraft in the next decade; and that the need for Martel would notnecessarily increase if the F-l 11 were cancelled. If the F-l 11 wereto be used for interdiction attacks against airfields in eastern europe, this would not involve any special risk of counter-action bythe Soviet Union with nuclear weapons; nor was there any reasonto think that the aircraft would not be able to return to base.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that experience with thePolaris and Phantom programmes demonstrated clearly the risksthat were involved in becoming committed to very large projects.If these escalated in cost, or if it became necessary to makereductions in the defence programme, the cancellation of suchprojects did not produce large savings once they were well underway. The cost of the F-lll had already risen from  300 million to 425 million; and it was likely that there would be further cost increases, particularly as the provision for running costs in theEstimates was very low but costs, especially for spare engines, were likely to rise if, as seemed likely, the United States cancelled two of 2
the three versions of the aircraft. He did not accept that offset salesunder the F-lll had any great merit, unless it could be clearly shownthat the aircraft was an essential military requirement within our new overseas policy; but on this count he did not consider that aconvincing case had been made. The F-lll had been orderedprimarily in relation to the East of Suez strategy; in relation to Europeour contribution to NATO, assuming that we retained Polaris,would remain adequate by comparison with those of other european countries, particularly as it was not at all clear that France andGermany would in practice sustain the defence programme to whichthey were currently working. There had not been adequate timeto examine the savings that had been suggested as alternatives tocancelling the F-lll; but, in any event, it was essential for bothpresentational and financial reasons that the cuts in the defence programme as a whole should contain a major equipment item andnot consist of a series of minor cuts. For these reasons we shouldcancel F-lll.The Foreign Secretary said that, although the time might come when we could with advantage give up Polaris, this would now onlysave running costs of  20 million a year and its surrender would bring us no advantage in the political or non-proliferation field; weshould therefore retain it. As regards the F-lll, we had assuredour friends and allies outside Europe that, although we werewithdrawing from East of Suez, we would retain a general military capability which would be useable at our discretion in that area.The F-lll was the key to the credibility of these assurances. no alternative to the aircraft was now available in the timescalerequired; and, without it, it would be evident that we lacked arelevant general capability. As regards Europe, and our foreignpolicy generally, it was essential that we should have the kind ofmilitary capability that would enable us to take political initiativesand play a part in shaping affairs, particularly in Europe, in the1970s. The F-lll was an essential component of such a capability,which other countries would have to take into account and whichwould therefore give us the degree of influence that we ought to have;without it we should be opting out of any role in Europe and in theworld generally.In discussion there was support for the view that we should retain the F-lll. In relation to Commonwealth countries in theFar East the consultations in which the Commonwealth secretary was currently engaged had shown the importance which thesecountries attached to the aircraft as an earnest of our intention tomaintain a general capability that would be relevant to their defence.For the United States also, it was a touchstone for our intentions.Although the aircraft had originally been ordered primarily inrelation to our role in the Far East, in the intervening period NATOstrategy had changed in a way which made conventional strikeaircraft of greater importance and we had in the meantime notproceeded with the AFVG of which we had planned to order 150mainly for use in Europe.   It was not possible to devise a
departmental programme, whether in the defence or in the civil field,which did not contain some large projects and long forwardcommitments; and the fact that the F-lll was of this type was not,therefore, a valid argument for cancelling it. Since so large a partof the cost of the F-lll programme was on a fixed price basis, therisk of cost escalation in continuing with it was less than would be involved if we were to proceed with the various projects that had beensuggested as alternative cuts.On the other hand it was argued that it was essential that theexpenditure cuts should include the cancellation of the F-lll if theywere to be acceptable as a whole and if it was to be made completelyclear that we were making a major change of policy and abandoningour world-wide role. The capability provided by this aircraft wasnot essential for a role in Europe; and its retention would thereforebe seen to conflict with our intention not to provide a special defencecapability for use East of Suez. Our present economic difficulties were largely due to the growth in Government expenditure overseas.The cancellation of the F-lll would produce large savings in overseas expenditure; would release resources for the export driveand import-saving; and would also result in large budgetary savings.It was essential that there should be a major cut in the defence equipment programme which would balance the political effects of,for example, deferring the raising of the school-leaving age.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the balance of opinion in the Cabinet was in favour of cancellingthe F-lll and, in view of this and of other considerations, of retaining our nuclear capability. It was very important, however,that there should be no premature disclosure of this decision. Itmust be recognised that the cancellation of the F-lll would depriveour forces of a capability which the Chiefs of Staff regarded as of very high priority and that a full reappraisal of our defence programme, which would take some time, would be necessary in thelight of this decision. A passage for the statement on the expenditure cuts should be drafted with this in mind. It should leave open for later decision the question whether we should retain a capability todevelop and produce advanced combat aircraft.The Cabinet (3) Confirmed their decision to cancel the order for the F-lllaircraft.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Foreign, Defence and Commonwealth Secretaries toconsider the terms of a passage covering defence and overseas policy for the statement on the expenditure cutsto be made to the House of Commons on 16th January.(5) Invited the Defence Secretary to consider the implications for the defence programme of the decision to cancel theF-lll.
Visit ofthe PrimeMinister ofSingaporeThe First Secretary of State said that the Cabinet had not yetbeen. able to discuss vthe recommendations in his memorandum c (68) 15 about the line to be taken in the discussions starting on thefollowing Sunday, 14th January, with the Prime Minister of singapore, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew. The Cabinet might therefore now wish to consider, before adjourning their discussion until the following monday, 15th January, at what stage in the talks with Mr. Lee itwould be right to broach with him the question of additional aid inmitigation of the effects on Singapore of the Cabinefs decision to accelerate our withdrawal from the Far East. In his view the rightprocedure would be to devote the initial discussions with Mr. Leeon Sunday, 14th January, to hearing his representations and topresenting the considerations underlying the Cabinefs decision,without raising the question of additional aid. Even if Mr. Lee did so, it would not be advisable to mention any figures until the laterdiscussions with Mr. Lee the following Monday, when the cabinet would have had time to hear a report from the commonwealth secretary on his visit to the Far East and to consider his ownmemorandum C (68) 15 on the line to be taken with Mr. Lee.In discussion there was general agreement with the procedure proposed by the First Secretary. This would not only be right, bothprocedurally and tactically; it would also help to make it clear thatthe Cabinet did not regard their conclusions on withdrawal asdefinitive and that decisions would not be taken until after theyhad heard the Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s report. Meantime, since mr. Lee would no doubt seek to make informal contact with anumber of Ministers individually, it would be necessary in suchcontacts to avoid any anticipation of the formal discussions he wouldbe having with the Prime Minister; and, in so far as such contactswere unavoidable after the formal discussions had started, ministers should speak strictly in accordance with the sense of the Cabinefsdiscussions.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that it was generally agreed that it would be right to proceedwith Mr. Lee on the lines proposed by the First Secretary. TheCabinet had already decided to take final decisions on withdrawalat the conclusion of their discussion of the Commonwealth Secretary&apos;sreport on Monday, 15th January; and they were now agreed thatthey should consider the recommendations in the First Secretary&apos;smemorandum concerning additional aid to Singapore at the samemeeting, which would take place before the final discussion withMr. Lee. They were also agreed that it would be best if ministers could avoid seeing Mr. Lee before the initial meetings with him on sunday, 14th January; and that in any meetings with him thereafter,they should speak in accordance with the collective view of theCabinet. The next meeting of the Cabinet would take place onMonday, 15th January, at 10 a.m.; and its first business would beto take final decisions on the matters to which he had just referred.Now that the Cabinet were approaching final decisions on a wide range of important matters of policy affecting future public
CC 6 (68)expenditure, it was more than ever essential to preserve the confidential nature of the Cabinet&apos;s proceedings on all these matters,particularly on the visit of Mr. Lee and the representations made bythe Chiefs of Staff.The Cabinet (6) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,13th January, 1968.
