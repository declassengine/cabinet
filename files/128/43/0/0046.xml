CabinetMinisterialBroadcasts(previous reference:CC (64) 5thConclusions,Minute 2)CC 46 (68)confidential. The Prime Minister said that recent attempts to secure the participation of Ministers in broadcast programmes, particularly the&quot; World at One&quot; on sound radio and the television programmesconducted by Mr. David Frost, had underlined the necessity for ministers to consult his office before accepting an invitation, inaccordance with the procedure laid down in &quot; Questions of procedure for Ministers &quot; (CP (66) 5). In programmes primarily designed forentertainment a Minister might be placed at a disadvantage either bythe selection of the other participants, or by the presence of a hostileaudience, or by distortion produced by subsequent editing.In discussion it was pointed out that Ministers were placed in adilemma by invitations to participate in discussion of particular problems. They might refuse to participate, in which case the presentation might be inaccurate and one-sided, or they could take part in order to ensure the Governments point of view was stated,but would then run the risks which the Prime Minister had indicated.Some Ministers might prefer to participate, if at all, only in programmes concerned with current affairs, in which the subject was likely to be more seriously treated. But there were precautions whichcould be taken to avoid embarrassment in either type of programme;for example, the Minister could insist that the programme should notbe transmitted live and that he be given an opportunity to object toany alterations subsequently made in it. Some topics could not,however, be suitably handled in a programme designed primarily toprovide entertainment: for example highly technical subjects, ofwhich it was difficult to give an accurate account in the time and bythe methods available. But if for any reason a Minister declined an invitation to take part in a programme, he was liable to be pilloriedfor his refusal; and those responsible for the broadcast might claim that since he had refused to take part he had no right to correct anyinaccurate or misleading impression which the programme might havegiven. There might therefore be advantage in Ministers eitheragreeing among themselves that they would not appear in anyprogramme designed primarily for entertainment, or adopting a set of agreed rules to govern their participation.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therehad been occasions when a Minister had been able to use one of the programmes in question with success to put a particular line of policybefore a wide audience; but they must recognise that the purpose ofthe programmes was not to facilitate Ministerial communication withthe public, and a Minister should not take part unless he was in astrong enough position to defeat any critics that might have beenasked to participate with him. It would be helpful if the paymaster general would arrange for the Home Publicity Committee to examinethe question whether any rules could be drawn up to guide Ministersinvited to participate in broadcast programmes, and in particular toenable them to reach a satisfactory agreement with the broadcasting authorities on the manner in which the programme would be
conducted. In the meantime Ministers should continue to refer to his office any invitations to take part in a broadcast programme.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Paymaster General to arrange for the HomePublicity Committee to consider the question of Ministersparticipating in broadcast programmes, on the lines indicated in the Prime Ministers summing up.(2) Took note that Ministers invited to participate in broadcastprogrammes should continue to consult the PrimeMinisters office before accepting an invitation.CONFIDENTIALParliamentaryAffairsFutureBusinessDivorce law reform(previous reference:CC (68) 20thConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Prime Minister reported that the Parliamentary Committeehad considered on 7th November the attitude to be taken by theGovernment on the Divorce Law Reform Bill, which was likely to be reintroduced in the present Session. They had agreed that, as in theprevious Session, the Government should be neutral, save that theLord Chancellor should be free to express his personal support forthe Bill. Since the previous Session&apos;s Bill had made some progress inthe House of Commons, the Committee considered that it would be appropriate to provide Government time in order that the Housemight have the opportunity to reach a conclusion on the Bill in thepresent Session. Time could be provided at less cost, to theGovernment early in the Session than during the summer and it had therefore been agreed that, if the Bill was not sponsored by aMember who secured a high place in the Ballot for Private Members&apos;Bills, arrangements should be made for the Second Reading of theBill to be put down for discussion after 10.00 p.m. so that it could be adjourned to a morning sitting.In discussion it was reported that the Members who had secured the first three places in the Ballot had been unwilling to sponsor theBill, and that it had been taken up by Mr. Alec Jones in ninth place.It was therefore proposed that he should put it down for the firstFriday available for Private Members&apos; Bills, when it was unlikely tobe reached, and subsequently for debate after 10.00 p.m. with a viewto the adjournment of the discussion to the following morning.Mr. Leo Abse was understood to have objected to this arrangement,but it could be explained to him and to Mr. Jones that the intention was to give the Bill an opportunity to get into Standing committee before other Private Members&apos; Bills, and hence a good possibility of passing through the House of Commons early in the Session.
confidential. The First Secretary of State said that at their meeting on 4th November the Ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomes had unanimously agreed that the interim settlements which had been concluded in October in the building and civil engineering industries should be referred to the National Board for Prices and Incomes(NBPI) as soon as possible, accompanied if necessary by a statutorydirection to defer payment of the increases. The background to thisdecision was that in May this year the unions&apos; claims for a 12 percent pay increase had been referred to the NBPI. The Governmenthad made it clear at the time that while negotiations on the claimcould continue during the NBPFs enquiries, no commitment shouldbe entered into before the Board&apos;s report, which was now expectedto be ready at the end of November, had been published. In spite ofthis the unions and the employers had concluded interim settlementswhich provided for an increase of nearly 5 per cent (when a cost-of-living bonus paid in March 1968 was taken into account) butcontained no productivity features. The Ministerial Committee on prices and Incomes had concluded that the interim settlements were a clear breach of the incomes policy and that it would be damaging to allow them to go through. The unions and the employers hadbeen consulted about the proposed reference and had not reactedunduly strongly against it; the opposition had come almost entirely from within the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP). She had arranged to meet the employers and unions in the building industrylater in the day; she would see whether some compromise solutionmore compatible with the Governments incomes policy could befound and would report the results to a meeting of the ministerial committee on Prices and Incomes on the following day.In discussion it was pointed out that there would almost certainlyneed to be a debate in the House of Commons if a reference to the nbpi were made. Over 100 Labour Members had signed a motionopposing the reference, and the Opposition might put down a motion of their own for debate on a supply day. It was strongly argued thatthose members of the PLP who had signed the motion were out oftouch with opinion in the trade unions and that they should be firmlyreminded that the only alternative to a prices and incomes policy wasdeflation and the deliberate creation of unemployment. There waswide support for the view that the Government should give a firmlead on this issue both in public speeches and in discussion with theirown supporters and that they should make clear to the PLP their determination to operate the incomes policy effectively.The Cabinet-CD Took note of the Prime Minister^ report.(2) Invited the Lord President, in consultation with the chief whip, to explain to Mr. Leo Abse and Mr. Alec Jonesthat the proposed arrangements for discussing the DivorceLav/ Reform Bill in morning sittings would be likely tofacilitate the early passage of the Bill.
The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theFirst Secretary should report at the meeting of the ministerial committee on Prices and Incomes on the following day the outcome of her discussions with the unions and employers in the buildingindustry. If, in the light of these discussions, it were decided toproceed with the reference to the NBPI, an early meeting of theParliamentary Labour Party should be arranged at which the first secretary and other Ministers concerned could explain the reasonsfor the decision and the Governments determination to operate the incomes policy effectively.The Cabinet-Invited the First Secretary of State (i) to report to the Ministerial Committee on Prices and incomes the outcome of her discussions with theunions and employers in the building industry;  ;(ii) to consult the Lord President and the Chief Whip witha view to arranging a meeting of the parliamentary labour Party if this should prove necessary.OverseaAffairsRhodesia(previous reference:CC (68) 45thConclusions,Minute 4)SECRET*4. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary informed theCabinet that the Minister without Portfolio, who was conducting thecurrent negotiations with the regime in Salisbury, had suspendeddiscussions during the celebrations of the third anniversary of the illegal declaration of independence by Rhodesia and was now visitingthe capitals of the East African members of the Commonwealth,pending a resumption of contact with the regime later in the week.His interim report on the discussions during the previous week had now been considered by the group of Ministers responsible for supervising the negotiations. It disclosed not only that the regimewere maintaining their opposition to any external form of secondguarantee against retrogressive amendment of the Constitution (suchas would be provided by our own proposal that in addition to the&quot; blocking quarter&quot; provision, any amendment of the entrenchedclauses of the new Constitution must be subject to appeal to theJudicial Committee of the Privy Council) but also that they were still at odds with us on many other points which we regarded as essentialto a satisfactory settlement of the constitutional dispute, including such questions as cross-voting, the composition of the Legislature, the criterion for continued detention of individuals, and so forth. It had become clear that no further progress on these points would beachieved unless we were prepared to offer some alternative form of second guarantee and to disclose this in reasonable detail. It was now proposed, therefore, that we should inform the regime that wewere prepared to contemplate an alternative form of second guaranteewhereby proposed amendments of entrenched provisions of theConstitution would not only be required to achieve a three-quarters
majority in the Legislature on both Second and Third Readings of the relevant legislation but would also have to be submitted to a referendum, which would take place between these stages. A request for such a referendum could be initiated by a small number ofmembers of the Rhodesian Parliament and would automatically bereferred to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, who would decide whether the proposed amendment involved unjustdiscrimination between the races or infringed the fundamental principles of the Declaration of Rights or would constitute animpediment to progress to majority rule. If they so decided, it wouldbe necessary for two-thirds of the electorate registered on the &quot; A &quot;and &quot; B &quot; Rolls, counted separately, to vote in favour of the proposed amendment before the legislation could proceed to Third Reading:As an additional safeguard it would be provided that no referendumof this kind could be held and therefore no amendment to theentrenched provisions of the Constitution could be made until200,000 Africans were registered on the &quot; B &quot; Roll, which would notbe for some time.The effect of this proposal would be to retain a role for the privy council (which would be of presentational advantage to us) but toleave the final decision with the Rhodesian electorate. To this extent it should meet the objection of the regime to any arrangement which made the amendment of the Constitution dependent upon the consentof a wholly external authority; but it should at the same time enablethe Rhodesian electorate, if it so wished, to over-rule the RhodesianParliament on any constitutional amendment which threatened the basic provisions of the Declaration of Rights.The Minister without Portfolio would be authorised to make thisproposal to the regime and perhaps to concede certain modifications in it (e.g., on the precise number of Africans to be registered on the&quot; B &quot; Roll before the referendum procedure could be instituted at all) on the basis of the clearest possible understanding that we should only be prepared to implement it if we received satisfaction on all theother outstanding points. In short, we should insist on a packagedeal. Finally, it would be an essential element in any settlement onthis basis that the regime must recognise publicly possibly in the jointcommunique to be issued at the end of the discussions that the newConstitution would make the same provision as the 1961 constitution for steady advance to majority rule, and would ensure that noimpediment should be placed in its way.In discussion there was general agreement that, in so far as thealternative form of second guarantee put the final decision on amendments to entrenched provisions in the hands of the Africanson the &quot; B &quot; Roll, it should in fact prove a more effective safeguardthan our original proposal based simply on reference of suchamendments to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. It was particularly important that the referendum should be based on a prescribed proportion not of those actually voting but of thoseregistered on each Roll, counted separately.  As a result abstention
would constitute a negative vote. This would put a powerful weaponin the hands of registered Africans; and it should also enable us to dispense with any stipulation that we must retain some degree ofcontrol over the manner in which a referendum was conducted,including the form in which the relevant options were expressed.Provided that we maintained this provision and continued to insist that the alternative form of second guarantee was dependent upon our receiving full satisfaction on all other outstanding points, weshould be able to defend the proposed settlement as a whole to publicopinion, both at home and abroad, if, as was probable on balance, itwas rejected by the regime.The Cabinet-(1) Approved in principle the instructions to be given to theMinister without Portfolio for the conduct of the next stage of negotiations with the regime in Salisbury.(2) Took note that the Minister without Portfolio would be instructed, in addition, to report back to the cabinet before either concluding a settlement on the basis nowproposed or finally breaking off negotiations.Vietnam(previous reference:CC (68) 45thConclusions,Minute 3)Nigeria(previous reference:CC (68) 43rdConclusions,Minute 2)secret the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the UnitedStates Government now expected that the Government of SouthVietnam would soon be ready to join in the negotiations in Parisabout Vietnam. Against this favourable development had to be set the grave view which the United States Government took of a recentmortar attack by the North Vietnamese on their forces from the demilitarised zone between North and South Vietnam. The UnitedStates representatives at the Paris talks were pressing the north vietnamese to prevent further attacks.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the FederalNigerian forces were facing considerable military difficulties. Theywere now operating at the end of long lines of communication andBiafra was being supplied with large quantities of arms. ChiefEnahoro, the Federal Nigerian Commissioner for Information, whowas in London, had requested the supply of additional arms for theFederal forces. This request was under consideration, in consultationwith the Defence Secretary, on the basis of our existing policy whichruled out the supply of aircraft but allowed arms and ammunition to be supplied. Chief Enahoro had said that, although the federal government intended to stop Red Cross night relief flights into Biafrabecause aircraft were also taking arms there by night, they would not do so until there had been time for the relief flights to be rearrangedto take place by day. He appeared to be unwilling tomake representations to France about the supply of arms to Biafrafrom fear that the result would be an increase in supplies. TheFederal Government were ready to be reasonable about a structurefor a Nigerian constitution which would provide a place for the Ibos
OverseaPolicyNATO and our policy towardsEurope(previous reference:CC (68) 42ndConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs on the North atlantic treaty Organisation (NATO) and our policy towards Europe(C (68) 123).The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that a doubleapproach was now being made in furtherance of our European policy.He would be following up M. HarmeFs initiative at discussions whichhe had arranged in the margin of the forthcoming Ministerial meetingof NATO. The object of these discussions would be to prepare issuesfor decision at the next Ministerial meeting of the Western european union in January. The Foreign Ministers of the Five had acceptedhis invitation to these discussions. He doubted whether M. Debre,the French Foreign Minister, would accept. The discussions ifsuccessful would involve neither new expenditure nor new commitments on the part of the United Kingdom.  He understoodCC 46 (68)provided that there was one Nigerian State and not two. The obstacle to a settlement was the Biafran leader, Colonel Ojukwu, and he wasstanding in the way also of the creation of land corridors along whichrelief supplies could flow to Biafra. Dr. Azikiwe, the Biafranrepresentative, was on a confidential visit to London, and there mightbe advantage in arranging a meeting between him and Chief Enahoro.The International Committee of the Red Cross were expected to request additional money soon for relief in Nigeria and we should then have to consider making a further contribution.In discussion, it was pointed out that we could meet the federal governments request for small arms ammunition only if we wereto run down heavily the stocks for our forces which were alreadybelow their proper level. The stocks would take a year to replace.Although the French Government had denied that they weresupplying arms to Biafra, it was clear that arms were being supplied from France and that the French Government could stop them if they wished. These supplies had not been allowed for when earlierforecasts had been made that the war in Nigeria would come to anend quickly, and unless they were stopped hostilities were likely tobe protracted, and perhaps on an increased scale. We should continueto sustain the Federal Government against tribal secession and encourage action, particularly in the Organisation for African Unity,to publicise the activities of France and bring pressure to bear on her to cease supplying arms to Biafra. With the continuance of the warit could no longer be assumed that local supplies of grain andequivalent foodstuffs in Nigeria would be adequate to preventstarvation.The Cabinet (3) Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.
that the Defence Ministers of the Five, Denmark and Norway hadsimilarly accepted an invitation from the Secretary of State for defence to discuss collaboration on European defence.In discussion it was agreed that the Federal GermanGovernment were motivated by a strong desire to cement Franco-German reconciliation and yet were becoming increasingly frustratedby French obstruction. Our main object should be to continue to seek to detach the Federal German Government from their too-readycompliance with French wishes. It was pointed out that while thelatest Franco-German suggestions for a trade arrangement held noattractions for the United Kingdom they could be expected to attractsome other members of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA),and it would be necessary therefore to prepare our tactics carefullyon this before the forthcoming Ministerial meeting of EFTA.The Cabinet Took note with approval of C (68) 123.CONFIDENTIALRacialDiscriminationRace relations and the Police(previous reference:CC (68) 4thConclusions,Minute 2)6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C (68) 122) on race relations and the police.The Home Secretary recalled the decision that actions taken bythe police in the course of their operational duties should not bebrought within the scope of the Race Relations Act, but that therewould be advantage in amending the disciplinary code in due courseso as to make discrimination a specific offence. This proposal hadrun into difficulties, and he sought the agreement of the Cabinet thatit should not be pursued.The opposition of the Police Federation to the amendment ofthe code was intense and deep-seated; and the Police Advisory Board,representing both the police service and the police authorities, were unanimous in advising him not to proceed with the amendment.Repeated explanations of the case for amendment had failed to convince the Board, and the opposition of the police service had not,as he had hoped, died away. It was based on the proposition that,since the constable&apos;s oath bound him to carry out his duties &quot; withoutfavour of affection, malice or ill-will&quot;, to make a specific offence ofan action which would in any case be a breach of the oath and of theexisting provisions of the code on abuse of authority would place anunjustified slur on the police service. The Secretary of State forScotland had encountered similar opposition from the relevantScottish organisations, and agreed with him that the proposal shouldbe dropped. It had originally been intended to serve a presentationalpurpose in countering Parliamentary criticism of the fact that the race Relations Bill did not cover the police in their operational role,but none had arisen, nor had the immigrant organisations shownmuch interest. No doubt they would complain if the proposal was abandoned, but they had taken the line that what mattered was notprovisions written into the statute or the discipline code, but theattitude of mind of the police force. On this he could emphasise that
positive action had been taken; he had arranged for instruction onrace relations to be included in training courses and the MetropolitanPolice had designated an officer in each station to deal with problemsof race relations. While, therefore, the advantages of amending the discipline code would be purely presentational, the disadvantages had proved to be greater than they had expected, since there was nodoubt that the police would continue to object and that they would obtain some support both from the Opposition and from publicopinion.The Prime Minister said that the Chancellor of the Exchequer,who was unable to attend the meeting, had sent him a minute arguing that the proposal to amend the discipline code should not be abandoned. The Chancellor had pointed out that the proposal hadbeen adopted as a compromise less satisfactory than applying the race Relations Act to the police in their operational role, and thought that if it were now abandoned there would be strenuousopposition from the leaders of immigrant opinion. Americanexperience had illustrated that good relations between the police andthe coloured community were indispensable in creating a tolerantsociety. There was no doubt that the immigrants believed that thepolice discriminated against them, and the Chancellor thought that anumber of policemen agreed with Mr. Enoch PoweLFs views on race.At a time when the Government had thought it right to pass anImmigrants Act to limit the number of Asians admitted to the country from Kenya, and to reopen negotiations with Mr. Ian Smith aboutthe future of Rhodesia, many of the Governments supporters inParliament would also be offended by the abandonment of theproposal to amend the discipline code.In discussion there was support for the view that the proposed amendment of the discipline code had been no more than apresentational device, and that the Government should take accountof the strong opposition of the police themselves and the police authorities to a provision which seemed to cast doubt on the validity of the oath taken by constables, and indeed by magistrates. It was arguable that an oath and a discipline code in general terms were ofmore value than specific references to particular kinds of discrimination.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were not disposed to press the Home Secretary to insist on an amendment of the discipline code in the face of opposition from the police. There should, however, be no immediate announcement of the Governmenfs decision; it should simply becommunicated to the Police Advisory Boards for England and wales and for Scotland at a suitable meeting.The Cabinet Agreed that the police disciplinary code should not be amended to make racial discrimination a specific offence.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,12th November, 1968.
