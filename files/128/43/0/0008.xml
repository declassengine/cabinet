*The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the general adequacyand balance of the measures to reduce public expenditure proposedby the Chancellor of the Exchequer in C (68) 5.Some doubts were expressed about the strength of the case for reductions of the order proposed. Could there be any assurance that to proceed once again by means of a drastic reduction in demand would in fact remedy our balance of payments difficulties? Noconcrete evidence had been produced to demonstrate that if weachieved a reduction on the scale proposed the resources whichwould be freed would in fact be redeployed into export and import saving. It was not clear how this would happen and how the differentsectors of industry would be affected.On the other hand it was argued that the cuts taken as a whole were not adequate to the situation. The proposals had suffered fromthe attempt to devise a set of measures which would be acceptable to different sections of opinion, instead of judging the issues onstrictly economic criteria. There would be little in the package of measures which would affect the consumer, and few decisions whichwould be unpopular except in the political arena. The measures would therefore not bring home to the public the gravity of thepresent economic situation, particularly since their announcement would be followed shortly by publication of Estimates which would show a substantial increase in public expenditure for 1968-69. If inaddition to this increase, earnings levels were to rise by something in excess of 6 per cent, it was doubtful if the cuts would be sufficientto contain inflationary pressures, let alone to ensure the necessarytransfer of resources into exports and import saving. some two-thirds of the necessary reduction in demand would be left to besecured by increases in taxation, which it would be difficult tointroduce without adverse effects on the prices and incomes policyand on incentives.There was, however, support for the view that the aggregatereduction proposed was of the right order of size and was adequate to meet the need. There could be no escape from the need to effect a reduction in consumption, both public and private. While it was true that a reduction in demand had not in the past sufficed to correct the balance of payments deficit, this was because there had never been a sufficient incentive for industry to move into exports;devaluation would provide this. The measures should therefore give us a real opportunity to escape from balance of payments constraint,though they would still need to be supplemented by a continuanceof all the Governmenfs existing policies to increase industrial efficiency and secure a better regional balance in the economy. Itwas possible to argue that the true balance of payments deficit atthe present time was substantially less than the annual rate of 800 million which the out-turn for the second half of 1967 would imply; but on any calculation there was still a need for a shift of resources of the order of  1,000 million.  While public expenditure* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET8751 a 2
would still rise substantially despite the cuts, to limit its increase in real terms to 3-7 per cent in 1968-69 and a smaller amount in thefollowing year was a considerable achievement, given past,commitments and the inevitable momentum of public spendingprogrammes, and would mean that public expenditure over thisperiod would constitute a falling proportion of gross national product. The cuts should be tolerable for the working populationgenerally, provided that they took effect against a background of falling unemployment.The present measures, however, would not be sufficient in themselves and the whole operation would have to be completed by measures to reduce personal consumption in the next Budget.But if the announcement of the present measures made it plain, asit would have to, that a severe Budget was in prospect, consumerswould go on buying in anticipation of Budget changes and the presentboom in consumer spending would be prolonged for several months.This would hamper the diversion of resources to exports and could have serious results for the balance of payments. There wastherefore a strong case for announcing concurrently with the reductions in public expenditure some action to restrain consumerspending for example by use of the tax regulator or by a furthertightening of hire-purchase controls.It was strongly urged that the Cabinet should reconsider their decision to postpone the raising of the school-leaving age for twoyears from 1970-71. Of all the measures decided on this was theone which most obviously contravened the basic principles for whichthe Government stood; it would be damaging to the economy inthe long term; and was most likely to provoke very strong opposition.It would increase social inequalities, and would mean that educationwas bearing a disproportionate share of the cuts. The decisionrepresented an unjustified deference to opinion abroad rather thana regard for our real economic needs, and would find support only with those who at heart were opposed to raising the leaving age atany time. Alternative ways of securing the same savings should besought; there was good reason to think that this could be done by introducing more discrimination into Government financial support for industry and assistance to development areas, and by taking account of the reduced need for Exchequer support, following devaluation, for many of the projects for assistance to industry whichwere now under consideration. Further areas for alternative savingswere grants to direct grant schools, on which the Secretary of Statefor Education had put proposals for reductions to the Chancellorof the Exchequer, and research and teaching staffs in universities.On the other hand it was argued that, while opposition topostponement of the school-leaving age was deeply felt, it was notwidespread; the imposition of prescription charges would be likelyto provoke stronger opposition among the Governments supporters.There were also sound educational reasons against raising the leaving age in 1970-71, notably the effect on staff-pupil ratios.The Lord Privy Seal said that he would be unable to advocate inthe House of Lords the proposal to defer the raising of the school-
leaving age and would therefore have to consider his position as amember of the Government.There was some support for the view that a reduction inMinisters&apos; salaries should form part of the package. The fact thatno reduction had been made in previous economy measures hadprovoked strong criticism. The immunity of Ministerial salaries wasconstantly brought up by the trade unions in current wage negotiations. A reduction in Ministers&apos; salaries, possibly extended toall Members of Parliament, would make a considerable psychologicalimpact, would accord with the present mood of the country andwould strengthen the Governmenfs hand in conducting a firmincomes policy. On the other hand it was argued that a reductionin Ministers&apos; salaries would be seen as an empty gesture which inview of the level of taxation would have no real effect. It would be quickly forgotten by the public. It would be wrong to extend any reduction to private Members of Parliament, for whom theGovernment had succeeded in providing an adequate level of remuneration only after a long struggle. In any case, anannouncement of a reduction in salaries would be better made in the context of the Budget than as part of the present measures.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) We should not succeed in bringing public expenditure within bounds and in creating the right attitude to work without a fundamental examination of ways of introducing greater selectivityinto social security. The present provisions of the welfare State werebeing exploited by a minority and this was undermining the will towork of the average citizen.(b) Consideration should be given to direct measures to help the balance of payments by restrictions on the export of capital andby mobilisation of the portfolio of overseas investments in privatehands.(c) The cuts in defence expenditure were disproportionatelysevere, bearing in mind that, whereas domestic cuts could always be restored, the consequences of the defence cuts for our internationalstanding would be irreversible. We still depended for our economic prosperity on world-wide markets; and the reduction in our international role, which the defence cuts would entail, would bring a heavy economic cost in the future. Our accelerated withdrawal from the Middle and Far East would reinforce a growinginternational tendency towards isolationism.(d) The effect of the cuts on the strategic road network could have an adverse effect on economic recovery and on the Governmentsregional policies. It would be preferable for a higher proportion ofthe reduction in the roads programme to fall on secondary roads.(e) The Secretary of State for Scotland said that the decisions on rate support grant would mean asking local authorities in scotland to absorb cost increases equal to some 2 per cent of their total
expenditure or 4 per cent of their expenditure on education. He didnot believe that they could possibly achieve this.(/) An increase in personal savings would help to reducedemand; and there was much to be said for including an appeal for higher savings in the announcement of the Governments measures.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, replying to the discussion,said there was no profit in making general criticisms of the packageof measures without recommending what should take its place.There should be no illusions about the gravity of our balance ofpayments position; and urgent action was essential to put it right.The overriding priority was to restore our economic health; it was this, rather than pursuit of social objectives, which must govern theaction to be taken in the present crisis. It had been asked whether we could be certain that the measures would fulfil their purpose.There could be no certainty in these matters; all the Governmentcould do was to take the steps which would give us the best chanceof escaping from our present difficulties. There might be room forargument on the margin of the proposals; but there could be nodispute that, if devaluation was to succeed, it was essential to make room in the economy for a massive diversion of resources intoexports and imports saving. It was impossible to say exactly how these resources would be switched; but, if the right conditions forthe switch were not created, devaluation would certainly fail in its purpose.It had been suggested that the Government should take stepsto restrict further the export of capital and to mobilise the privateportfolio of oversea investments. He had these matters underconsideration and it might be possible to take some action in this field; but the difficulties were considerable. It was relevant that his predecessor had secured a substantial improvement in the capital account through the voluntary programme of restrictions on investment in the sterling area and by means of the Corporation Tax;the result was that the capital account no longer represented the drain on the balance of payments which it did two years ago. while we possessed assets overseas to the value of some  17,000 million,our liabilities amounted to over  16,000 million; this was a narrowmargin for a major industrial country. While mobilisation of theprivate portfolio of oversea investments for the reserves might conceivably make some contribution to our short-term difficulties,no measures of this kind could possibly relieve us of the need to earn a substantial balance of payments surplus by 1969. We should,moreover, avoid having to sell portfolio investments at a loss; andwe should also beware of any measures which savoured of panic.There was a real danger that, by adopting draconian defensive measures in respect of our balance of payments, we should provokecounter-measures by other countries, leading to a general decline in world trade from which we would have most to lose.He would have preferred to secure greater reductions in public expenditure so as to reduce the requirement for increased taxation.There was great difficulty in devising tax increases which did not haveadverse economic consequences; in particular, it would be unwise to
The Cabinet Took note with approval of the Prime Ministers summing up of this part of their discussion.Draft The Cabinet then turned to consider a note by the Secretary of statement^&apos;7 the Cabinet (C (68) 24) coverinS a draft of tne parliamentary statement to be made by the Prime Minister to the House ofCommons on the following day, and simultaneously to be published as a White Paper.The Prime Minister said that, in view of the shortage of time, itmight be best if the Cabinet were to concentrate on the body of thestatement paragraphs 8 to 50 inclusive. He would himself wishto give further consideration to the opening and closing sections,and in doing so would take into account the Cabinefs discussion onincrease, direct taxation without paying careful regard to the effects on incentives. While some other countries raised a bigger total amount in taxation, few, if any, had a tax system which was assteeply progressive as ours. The question of tightening hire-purchasecontrols had been raised; and he would consider this further.However the total effect of the reductions which he proposed wouldbe to slow down substantially the rise in public expenditure; theincrease in 1969-70 should be just under 1 per cent in real terms.Postponement of the raising of the school-leaving age was themeasure which he had approached with the greatest repugnance;but the savings it would secure represented 10-15 per cent of thetotal. If the proposal were abandoned, there would then be a case for reopening other painful decisions and the whole package wouldbe endangered. It was essential to look for substantial identifiablecuts which would not make economic nonsense or lead to a breakdown in services; and it was extremely difficult on this basisto find alternatives to the cuts he had proposed. He did not accept that the need to restore confidence abroad pointed in a differentdirection from the economic realities of our situation. The measureshe proposed should serve equally to restore confidence and to give us the chance to put our economy on to a sound footing.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said the balance of opinion in the Cabinet was that the proposed reductions in public expenditure were of the right order of magnitude. Some Ministers had expressed strong opposition topostponing the raising of the school-leaving age; but, on balance,the Cabinet agreed that their previous decision to this effect shouldnot be reopened. There was no clear majority in favour of theproposal to announce a reduction in Ministers&apos; salaries as part of thepresent measures; and, if Government spokesmen were questioned,in the forthcoming debate, about this or about a reduction in the remuneration of Members of Parliament, they should say that theGovernment were making no proposals in these matters and that inany case this was a question which could more suitably be considered in the context of the Budget.
the statement as a whole. It was agreed that it would be desirable to redraft paragraphs 4 and 5 so as to limit so far as possible speculationabout the scope of the further measures to restrain demand which itwould be necessary to take in the Budget; and, in particular, to omit the reference to the total figure of some  1,000 million by which itwould be necessary to cut back demand. It would be better for this figure to be given to the House of Commons by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer in his speech in the Debate on the statement, when there would be fuller opportunity for him to explain the significance of the figure, particularly that it would represent an objective to beachieved over the next two financial years and not over 1968-69 only.The Cabinet turned to the section of the draft statement dealingwith changes in defence policy and expenditure (paragraphs 8 to 23inclusive).The Prime Minister said that, since the meeting of the Cabinetthat morning, he had considered the draft of these paragraphs withthe Ministers responsible for oversea policy and had agreed withthem a number of amendments which he would now read to theCabinet.In discussion there was general agreement with the greater partof the amendments suggested by the Prime Minister and the ministers responsible for oversea policy: a number of further drafting amendments were agreed, and the following points noted:(a) The Foreign Secretary and the Commonwealth secretary had put in hand the action necessary to inform other governments and Organisations of our decisions.(b) The Defence Secretary should indicate in the Defence white paper in February that the changes in defence policy and in the structure and equipment of the Armed Forces arising from the cabinet&apos;s approval of decisions on our commitments and expenditurein the Middle and Far East would be the subject of a further and comprehensive Defence White Paper to be laid before Parliament inthe following July. The Lord President should consider, inconsultation with the Defence Secretary, how this arrangement mightbe prevented from resulting in the duplication of two-day debates on defence.(c) The second and third sentences of paragraph 16 would moresuitably be the subject of fuller explanation in a Ministerial speech in the course of the debate on the statement and would be omitted from the statement itself.(d) The estimated financial savings mentioned in paragraph 19should at this stage be less precise, and the forecast, at the end ofparagraph 21, of future levels of defence expenditure should bere-presented so as to give a clearer picture of the successive and substantial reductions in the burden of oversea defence expenditureinherited from the previous Administration.The Cabinet then turned to the sections of the draft of thePrime Minister^ statement dealing with civil expenditure(paragraphs 24-50 inclusive). A large number of drafting amendments were agreed and the following main points were made:
8751bSocial Security(e) In paragraphs 26 and 27 it would be better to refer to the raising of the income limits for the rent rebate scheme after thesection on family allowances and not immediately after the referenceto helping the most vulnerable classes in the community, since theformer measure, though justified, would not help the poorest.Education(/) In considering paragraph 28 it was suggested that, in viewof the opinions expressed earlier in their discussion, it would be right for the Cabinet to reconsider the decision they had taken to postpone the raising of the school-leaving age by two years.The Prime Minister said that it did not appear from thediscussion that there was a sufficient body of opinion in the Cabinetin favour of reopening the decision they had taken on this question to warrant its reconsideration and it must therefore stand. It wasthe general view of the Cabinet, however, that the concluding twosentences of paragraph 28 should be omitted from the statement.(g) In paragraphs 32 and 33 the cuts in capital expenditure bythe universities implicit in the total saving on education were toosevere and should be substantially reduced. Alternative savings in expenditure on education should be found, by means to be agreed between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of Statefor Education and Science, from the capitation grants to direct grantschools and the grants to research councils.Health and Welfare(/;) In paragraph 37 it would be undesirable to specify the groups to be exempted from the proposed prescription charges beforeinitiating consultation with the medical practitioners. The Ministerof Health should therefore bring forward the meeting planned for the afternoon of 16th January to noon on that day, emphasising that theinformation given to the doctors&apos; representatives was to be treatedas confidential until after the statement.(/&apos;) The amount required to be added to the National insurance contribution to prevent the National Insurance Fund from going into deficit was in fact 8d.; but the proposal to round the figure up toIs. could be justified on the ground that to put the Fund into surpluswould provide more flexibility for the future.Transport(/) On paragraph 42 it was suggested that the total reductionin public expenditure on roads should be redistributed so as to reducethe cuts in major road programmes and increase the cuts in expenditure on the maintenance and improvement of minor roads,in accordance with national economic priorities, including thestimulation of industrial activity in the development areas. On theother hand it was suggested that, since expenditure on minor roadswas a local authority function and the achievement of the necessarysavings was to that extent less certain, the proposal might well
prejudice the achievement of the total saving desired. It would be right, therefore, to maintain the distribution of economies on road construction and maintenance in the form set out in the draft statement, but with the proviso that the distribution of savings mightbe reconsidered later if it could be shown that the total saving desiredwould not thereby be prejudiced.Local Authorities(k) On paragraph 48 it was strongly urged that as regards1968-69 the-proposed requirement for local authorities to absorb any future and unavoidable increases in cost by making savings elsewhere,and similarly the proposed restrictions on the amount of expenditureeligible for rate support grant for 1969-70 to 3 per cent in real termsabove the amount eligible for 1968-69, were too severe and would either prove impracticable or involve substantial increases in local rates. This would certainly be so in Scotland. In England andWales the local authorities had already obtained an increase in therate support grant for 1968-69 to take account of recently approvedincreases in teachers&apos; salaries. In Scotland, however, the renegotiation of teachers&apos; salaries followed some time after theprocess in England and Wales, and there had thus been no similaradjustments in the rate support grant for 1968-69 in Scotland, whichwas accordingly being asked to accept a very substantially moreonerous restriction on expenditure for 1968-69 than England andWales. On the other hand it was argued that the rate of increase in local authority expenditure and the difficulty of exercising control overit save indirectly through the rate support grant was such as to justifythe proposals in the statement: moreover, these had been agreed,subject to the overall balance of the package, in the Cabinet&apos;s earlier discussions. The proposal put forward at the Cabinefs meeting on11th January, that the amount of specific savings on roads andpossibly other designated blocks of expenditure, which theGovernment should ask local authorities to make, should be deducted from the total of expenditure accepted as eligible for rate support grant in 1969-70, had been examined but had been found not to be practicable. Nevertheless, it was expected that local authorities would be able to make substantial savings. The text of the statement should therefore be retained, subject to the deletion of the referenceat the end of the paragraph to further increase of Exchequer grant and the insertion of a further sentence to the effect that fuller detailsof the proposed economies both for England and Wales and forScotland (where special problems were involved) should be worked out with local authorities, and that the House of Commons would bekept informed.(/) It would be necessary to insert after paragraph 48 an appropriate passage dealing with economies in public expenditure inrespect of Northern Ireland.Economies in other Sectors(m) The Cabinet were informed that the proposal to defer the rebuilding of Government offices in Whitehall would not effect anysaving in the relevant years, since rebuilding could not begin until
1971 and the only expenditure to be incurred in 1968-69 would beon completing the purchase of sites already under negotiation. Itwas agreed that the statement should not refer to the rebuilding ofWhitehall.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet had now agreed the amendments which should bemade to the text of the statement, save for those which he himself would wish to make in the opening and concluding sections in thelight of the Cabinefs discussion and which would take account ofthe suggestion that the final sentence of paragraph 56 should be omitted. It was not certain whether the revised statement could be printed as a White Paper in time to be placed in the Vote Officebefore the statement was made: if not, duplicated copies would beprovided in the Library of the House of Commons for Members ofParliament and the White Paper would be issued as soon as possible thereafter.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,19th January, 1968.
