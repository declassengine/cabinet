ParliamentaryBusinessOverseaAffairsUnitedNations(previous reference:CC (68) 30thConclusions,Minute 6)OpeningMeeting of the23rd Sessionof the GeneralAssemblySECRET2. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that themain topics considered at the opening meeting of the 23rd Session ofthe United Nations General Assembly, from which he had returnedon 15th October, were the Czechoslovak situation, disarmament andthe Middle East. In addition to making a major speech in theGeneral Assembly, he had held meetings with a number of theForeign Ministers present in New York. As regards the middle east, he had reiterated to Mr. Riad, the Egyptian Foreign Minister,and to Dr. Eban, the Foreign Minister of Israel, the need to providethe Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Dr. Jarring, withconstructive proposals on which to continue his mission in theMiddle East. There was a widespread feeling that unless this was done Dr. Jarring would not continue. Dr. Eban had appeared readyto make a statement which would open the door for discussions between Israel and Jordan, and he understood that the Israeliproposals had now been communicated to Dr. Jarring. It was forIsrael to make some concession, and he understood that she would do so by ceasing to insist on direct negotiations with the Arab States.The situation in the Middle East, though still difficult, thereforeshowed signs of improvement. Mr. Riad had indicated that Egyptwas ready to consider proposals by the shipowners for releasing theships at present trapped in the Suez Canal.On Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr. Gromyko,had stated that the situation there was of concern only to the warsaw Pact countries. This had alarmed the United States andothers, especially when Mr. Gromyko had subsequently extendedthis concept to cover the &quot; Socialist commonwealth &quot;, which wasnot defined as having any geographical limitation. A meeting hadbeen held in New York of representatives of the North atlantic treaty Organisation (NATO) countries (except Iceland and Portugal)who had attended the opening meeting of the 23rd Session of theUnited Nations General Assembly, and the NATO ministerial council, which was to meet in November instead of, as usual, inDecember, would consider the implications of the Soviet attitude.The objectives would then be to persuade other NATO countries to undertake additional commitments, as we had done earlier thisyear, and to secure a satisfactory statement on the duration of the nato Alliance, since it was open to member countries to give noticeof their intention to cease to be parties to the North Atlantic Treatyafter it has been in force for 20 years. He had had discussions withthe Yugoslav and Turkish representatives on the attitude that shouldbe adopted towards possible Soviet action against Yugoslavia; thisalso would have to be considered by the NATO Ministerial Council.9533CONFIDENTIAL1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.

Debre: but these could be considered under a later item of the agenda.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that, while in new York, he had had discussions with the Foreign Ministers ofGuatemala and Argentina about the problems of British Hondurasand the Falkland Islands respectively. These had been constructiveand it seemed likely that progress would be made with both problems.In discussion, it was agreed that in due course memoranda setting out the latest position on our negotiations with Guatemala aboutBritish Honduras and with Argentina about the Falkland Islandsshould be circulated for consideration by both the Defence and oversea Policy Committee and the Cabinet.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that, during his recent visit to New York, he had met the Nigerian representative atthe United Nations who had said that recent difficulties with theRed Cross in Nigeria had been resolved. Although the situation in nigeria was still serious, the Federal forces were carrying out relief work as they advanced and it was clear that no massacre of the Iboswas intended.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.(2) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary in due course to circulate memoranda on British Honduras andthe Falkland Islands for their consideration.It was agreed, in discussion, that the Cabinet would wish to giveearly consideration to the situation in Vietnam and to our attitude to it.The Prime Minister said that Mr. Smith, the leader of the illegal regime, had now made a statement in Salisbury on his attitude tothe British proposals for a settlement of the Rhodesian problem which had been handed to him at the end of the talks inHMS Fearless. The burden of this had been that the main obstacle to agreement had been the British insistence that the entrenchedclauses of the independence Constitution should be safeguarded bya system of appeals to the Privy Council. It had been recognisedduring the discussions in HMS Fearless that Mr. Smith might seek to conceal his unwillingness to accept the proposed settlement as awhole by concentrating attention on this point, which might bedifficult for us to explain publicly, and on alleged British obduracy.In fact, it had been clearly established that Mr. Smith&apos;s objection was not merely to the Privy Council as such as the proposed appellatebody, but to any form of extra-parliamentary guarantee, internalor external, for the entrenched clauses.
Approach toEuropeFuture Policy(previous references:CC(68) 15thConclusions.Minute 2 and cc (68) 26thConclusions,Minute 3)secret. The Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary of State forForeign and Commonwealth Affairs (C (68) 113) to which was attached a copy of his telegram of 13th October to the Prime minister from New York.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that since theFrench Government had imposed their veto on negotiations forBritish membership of the European Economic Community (e.c.)there had been initiatives of two main kinds. There had been theproposals for a trading arrangement, between the Six and the UnitedKingdom and some other European countries, which the germans had seen as a prelude to our eventual membership of the community and which the French had seen as a substitute for United kingdom membership. These proposals had never held attractions for us:the negotiations involved could be as laborious and difficult as those for entry into the e.c. and it was difficult to see how they could be reconciled with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).The other main line of approach had been the Benelux proposalswhich aimed to achieve co-operation, between the United Kingdomand as many of the Six as would participate, in those fields whichwere outside the scope of the e.c. Treaties and therefore not subjectto French veto. We had welcomed this latter approach. recently the Belgian Government had taken a new initiative on these lines which he had discussed in New York with the Foreign Ministers ofGermany, Belgium and Italy. M. Harmel, the Belgian ForeignMinister, had proposed that the subject of European co-operation should be placed on the agenda of the Ministerial Council of theWestern European Union (WEU) on 21st/22nd October and theFrench Government had agreed to this suggestion. The aim ofM. Harmel and the other Foreign Ministers with whom he had discussed this initiative would be to establish at this meeting ofWEU a special group to study the scope for closer Europeancollaboration, beginning with foreign policy and defence and extending perhaps to technology and cultural exchanges; and toreport   in   time   for   substantive   discussion   of   the   group&apos;sCC 42 (68)The Minister without Portfolio added that the British side hadrepeatedly tried to elicit from Mr. Smith a written assurance thatthe rest of the package (including&apos; the &quot; blocking quarter &quot; of directly elected Africans) was acceptable to him: but he had refused to commit himself.The Prime Minister said that it was now for Mr. Smith to replyformally to the British proposals and to the Prime Minister^ offer to send the Minister without Portfolio to Salisbury for further discussions. Meanwhile, Ministers should avoid being drawn intoargument on Mr. Smith&apos;s statement, or anything else he might say.The Cabinet (3) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers statement.
recommendations at the Ministerial meeting of WEU in January.The agreement of the French Government to the inclusion of this item on the agenda had been a surprise and it was possible that theFrench, feeling their increasing isolation and the irritation of theirpartners in the e.c., would participate helpfully in the discussions.It was more realistic to suppose, however, that the French would atsome stage seek to obstruct progress by, for example, preventing the inclusion in the discussions of non-members of WEU (anextension to which we and the Five attached importance) orrestricting the subjects which they were prepared to discuss. If theFrench did prove obstructive the work should if necessary go aheadwithout them. The Federal German Government continued tovacillate in their European policy. French agreement to inclusionof the item on the WEU agenda had enabled the Germans also toagree to participate in these discussions but whether they would continue to do so if the French made trouble remained to be seen.Although the Federal German Government had become increasinglyirritated with the French Government, particularly since the invasion of Czechoslovakia, there was no doubt that they still attached thegreatest importance to maintaining their close links with France.He proposed that the United Kingdom Government at the meetingof WEU on 21st/22nd October should support M. HarmeFs initiative and seek agreement there to the establishment of the special groupwith instructions to report, if necessary without unanimity, in time for decisions on substance to be taken at the WEU Council meetingnext January. If the French Government proved obstructive weshould be prepared to seek the agreement of the Five to settingthese studies in hand without France.The following points were made in discussion:(a) An important programme of practical Europeancollaboration was now under discussion within the North atlantic treaty Organisation (NATO) framework, particularly about theproposed advanced combat aircraft and in the Nuclear PlanningGroup. We must not endanger the prospects of achieving Europeancollaboration in defence, which was of vital concern to us, by opening up defence discussions in WEU. The French had a veto in WEUand might also argue that defence discussions in WEU madeunnecessary the current discussions which we were holding with theGermans and others within the NATO framework. Moreover, itwas essential to conduct European defence discussions within the framework of NATO which, unlike WEU, included both the UnitedStates and Scandinavian countries. In matters of defence we had atpresent no bargaining strength with the Federal GermanGovernment: this might come if the current discussions were broughtto a successful conclusion. The initiative now proposed in WEUmust be taken in such a manner as not to endanger the currentdefence discussions within NATO.(b) While there might be some scope for redeployment of our forces in the context of European collaboration, there were strong political and economic objections to any increase in the cost of our defence programme to the Exchequer or the balance of payments.
IndustrialAffairsEngineeringManualWorkers(previous reference:CC (68) 40thConclusions,Minute 3)(c) When the Government originally decided to apply for EECmembership they had also considered the possible alternatives of aNorth Atlantic Free Trade Area (NAFTA) and of &quot; going it alone &quot;.The chances of establishing NAFTA in the foreseeable future seemedif anything more remote now than then. We therefore had no alternative to &quot; going it alone &quot;, in the sense of pursuing our own economic and political interests as best we could whether bilaterallyor multilaterally and building up our economic strength as rapidly as possible. This policy was not, however, inconsistent with theForeign Secretary&apos;s present proposals.(d) It was argued that the time had come to end fruitlessinitiatives to gain entry into the e.c.. There was no doubtconsiderable scope for European collaboration in many fields onbilateral as well as multilateral bases but this would be preventedso long as the French Government considered we were proposingcollaborative projects simply as a device for gaining entry into the eec. Domestic and European public opinion was becoming increasingly less interested in the question of our entry into the e.c.,which would not become a live issue for many years. On the otherhand, it was pointed out that the Government had decided tomaintain their application for membership of the e.c. after theFrench veto and remain firmly committed to this policy which mustbe pursued consistently. Moreover, we could not ignore the interestsof some of the Five who were increasingly concerned to promoteour closer association with them. M. HarmeFs proposals need inno way conflict with our objective of establishing a strong UnitedKingdom economy or with other major British objectives.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the proposals by the Foreign Secretary in supportof M. HarmeFs initiative at the forthcoming meeting of the Councilof WEU. The Foreign Secretary should give further considerationto means of giving greater content to the proposals for collaborationand should also take account of the points made in discussion,particularly the importance of avoiding a conflict of interests on defence.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the summing up by the PrimeMinister.confidential. The First Secretary of State said that the negotiations on the pay claim for manual workers in the engineering industry, whichhad been taking place under her chairmanship since 14th October,had now reached a crucial point. The employers, in her viewrightly, had adopted a very firm line especially in their insistence onobtaining satisfactory productivity conditions in exchange for any improvement in their offer. They had been successful in this andthe unions had tabled a memorandum on productivity which enableda fruitful discussion on productivity and training to take place.
Pay of Ships&apos;Clerks inLondon andComparableWorkers inLiverpooland HullSubsequently the employers put forward an improved offer tied toproductivity conditions and based on improvements in minimum rates rather than minimum earnings levels. The estimated cost wasabout 10 per cent over the three years, but these cost estimates werenot at all reliable. The unions were claiming that because of thedelay in reaching a settlement the effective duration of the agreement would be four years rather than three.The unions had reacted sharply against this latest offer and theemployers might be ready to improve it but by how much was not clear. One possibility would be to drop the proposal for a general increase entirely and to offer a bigger increase on the basic rate which would have the advantage of doing more for women and lower-paid employees. A meeting of the National Committee ofthe Amalgamated Union of Engineering and Foundry Workers hadbeen called for Friday, 18th October, but it was not clear whetherthis was in expectation of a new offer which the union leaders couldrecommend to the National Committee as a satisfactory settlement,or whether they hoped in recommending a rejection of a new offer to secure confirmation of the decision to call a strike on a sounderlegal basis in view of the interim injunction now being sought in thecourts. It was clear that the productivity conditions were a majorstep forward and she thought that a settlement involving increases of perhaps 10A-11 per cent should be acceptable. There was somehope that a satisfactory agreement might be reached during thecourse of the day and she asked for discretion to endorse such anagreement after consultation with the Prime Minister and theChancellor of the Exchequer.In discussion there was general agreement that the first secretary should be authorised to agree a settlement as proposed.It was emphasised however that this was a claim of crucial importance to the economy and to incomes policy, that the employers were standing firm, and that the great majority of the employeeswere opposed to a strike. It was all the more important therefore that a satisfactory settlement should be reached which was not adefeat for incomes policy or a victory for militancy.The Cabinet (1) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with thePrime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer andother Ministers concerned, to seek a settlement of theclaim on behalf of manual workers in the engineering industry on the lines indicated in her statement.The First Secretary of State said that decisions were required on three inter-linked pay issues. An interim offer of 15 per cent hadbeen made to ships&apos; clerks in the London docks, of which 5 per centwas said to be covered by increases in productivity and 10 per centcould be represented as a payment on account in advance of the major productivity settlement under Stage II of the Devlinprogramme. This interim offer had been accepted by the transport and General Workers&apos; Union (TGWU) and by most of the ships&apos; jclerks but not those in the Royal group of docks.  An increase of j
about 10 per cent had been given to Liverpool dockers without proper advance notice under the voluntary early-warning system;and at Hull there was a claim by clerks and tallymen for an increaseof 5s. an hour, equal to 50 per cent on the time rate. These claims and settlements were all far beyond what could be justified underthe incomes policy. The London ships&apos; clerks had received a 20 percent pay increase only 12 months previously, and there was a serious danger that a fresh increase of 15 per cent would lead to a furtherround of the traditional leap-frogging between their pay and that ofthe dockers. In these circumstances the best solution was to proceed as quickly as possible to a proper productivity settlement underStage II of the Devlin programme. To this end both sides of theindustry had now agreed to her proposal to convene, later this month,a meeting of the National Modernisation Committee of Docks.In the meantime, while the TGWU had accepted the 15 per centoffer in London, an unofficial go-slow had begun in the Royal Docksin protest mainly about the productivity conditions attached to the interim offer. The employers had issued a warning that from monday, 14th October, clerks who did not work in accordance withtheir agreement would be paid only for the work they did. On16th October a mass meeting at the Royal Docks reaffirmed theglo-slow tactics and put forward a claim for a general increase of3-34- per cent unrelated to productivity; and for an unspecifiedadditional increase on account of past productivity achievements.The employers had decided from today to send home those ships&apos;clerks who refused normal working; and she had just heard thatthe Royal Docks had been brought to a standstill that morning bythe failure of the ships&apos; clerks to report for duty. It now seemed likely that the engineering negotiations might be concluded beforethe Government needed to disclose their intentions on the offer to ships&apos; clerks. But even if it proved possible to avoid prejudice to theengineering negotiations, it was clear that acquiescence in the 15 percent offer, assuming that a settlement was now possible on this basis,would have a very serious effect on incomes policy generally. Onthe other hand a major dock strike would have the gravestconsequences for the economy. In all the circumstances, she thoughtthat the right course would be to secure a settlement up to the limit of the 15 per cent interim offer but for less if possible; and she soughtdiscretion to proceed on this basis.In discussion there was general support for the course of action proposed by the First Secretary of State. It was emphasised that theeffect of a dock strike, which in London alone might cost the balanceof payments  50- 70 million over three weeks, would deal a severeblow to our post-devaluation economic strategy and that this couldnot be contemplated. Although a settlement of 15 per cent wouldcertainly be harmful to incomes policy it need not be fatal. If asatisfactory engineering settlement were achieved this would tendto offset the adverse repercussions of a bad settlement for ships&apos;clerks.   Incomes policy did not have to be abandoned simply
because of one breach, however serious. It was all the more necessaryto continue to apply it as strictly as possible, bearing in mind that each month it operated was a gain for our post-devaluation economic progress.On the other hand it was urged that acquiescence in the 15 percent increase for the ships&apos; clerks, even if it was now unlikely tocomplicate the engineering negotiations, might well be fatal toincomes policy. Such a major breach of the policy would increasepressures elsewhere. The gas and steel industries were alreadypressing for increases beyond those justified by the incomes policycriteria and an offer in line with the policy which had been madeto the miners had been turned down by the Executive of the NationalUnion of Miners. A claim of up to 20 per cent for teachers wasalso shortly expected. But apart from these important practical considerations it was wrong that the incomes policy should be appliedless stringently to those in a strong negotiating position than to thosewho were in a weak position. The interim offer would be most unlikely to buy peace in the docks but would provoke exaggerateddemands from other dock workers. Moreover it was now far from jcertain that a settlement within the 15 per cent offer could be reached.If a stoppage was inevitable anyway the right course would be for Ithe Government to take a stand based on incomes policy rather thansacrifice the policy to no purpose.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theships&apos; clerks&apos; claim presented the Government with a most difficultchoice. While it was clear that to concede the 15 per cent increase would be harmful to incomes policy, the balance of opinion in theCabinet favoured a settlement within this total if the alternative wasa stoppage in the docks which would have the most serious effects on our economic prospects. The First Secretary of State should therefore attempt to secure a settlement for the ships&apos; clerks inLondon within the 15 per cent offer put forward by the employers, Ibearing in mind the need to avoid endangering a successful outcometo the engineering negotiations. If it nevertheless proved impossibleto settle within this limit and a serious stoppage appeared to be unavoidable, a new situation would be created which the cabinet would have to consider.The Cabinet (2) Invited the First Secretary of State to be guided by the Prime 1Ministers summing up in seeking a settlement of the 1ships&apos; clerks&apos; dispute in London.1SECRET I*5.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord chancellor (C (68) 111) on the reform of the House of Lords to which Iwere annexed a revised draft of the White Paper setting out tl.Governments proposals and a draft Parliament Bill.ParliamentaryAffairsHouse ofLords Reform(previous reference:CC (68) 36thConclusions,Minute 5)
B 2The Lord Chancellor said that at their meeting on 18th July, theCabinet had decided that the best course open to the government appeared to be to implement the proposals worked out by theInter-Party Conference and that work should go ahead on thepreparation of the necessary Bill; the position was to be reviewed inthe autumn in the light of the feeling of the Labour Party and in thecountry generally. Since then the Committee of Ministers under his chairmanship had given careful consideration to the draft Bill,now in an advanced state of preparation, and to the problems of presentation, and had concluded that it would be preferable to publish the White Paper as a statement of the Governmenfs proposals andnot as an agreed document. This would enable them to present theproposals, which were undoubtedly radical in substance, in a waymore attractive to their own supporters; a revised draft of the white paper intended for unilateral publication had been examined by theCommittee in detail at their last meeting. He proposed that theWhite Paper and Bill should be shown to the other parties in draft and was confident that if this course was followed they would still beprepared to co-operate despite the change in presentation;consultation was in any case essential to avoid public criticism. he sought the authority of the Cabinet to consult the Leaders of theConservative and Liberal Parties on the drafts, and as time wasshort it would be helpful if the Cabinet considered the draft white paper at their present meeting. If this course of action were agreed,he proposed that it should be announced in the course of the debate on the Address.In discussion there was general agreement with the approachsuggested in the Lord Chancellors memorandum, even though someaspects of the proposals were not as radical as might be desired. Thepoint was made that it might be desirable to take the opportunity toreduce further the number of law lords and bishops. It was pointedout, on the other hand, that so long as the House of Lords retainedits judicial functions its membership must include a sufficient numberof persons qualified to discharge those functions; and that the lawlords did not vote on political issues. As for the bishops, it would be premature to reduce further the number in the House of Lords ata time when the whole question of the relationship between theChurch of England and the State was under examination. there might be pressure for representation from the non-conformistChurches, but it should not be too difficult to deal with if it arose.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet were in sympathy with the approach proposedby the Lord Chancellor. As the White Paper had already been examined by a Committee of senior Ministers, it would not benecessary for the Cabinet to consider it in detail, and discussion should concentrate on points of major significance.The Cabinet then turned to consideration of the White Paper.The following were the main points made in discussion:(a) Paragraph 29, which was largely new, was an attempt to forestall the inevitable criticism of the increase in the Governmenfs
powers of patronage which the proposals entailed. In practice, therewere substantial safeguards against the abuse of patronage in thepractice of consulting the Leaders of the Opposition Parties and inthe existence of the Political Honours Scrutiny Committee, but these could not be made public; the problem was one of reassuring thepublic, and the paragraph would make a useful contribution to thisend. There was general agreement that the idea of an advisorycommittee, despite its superficial attractiveness, was unworkable;such a committee would come under intolerable pressure.(b) Paragraph 48 raised the difficult question of Scottishrepresentation in the reformed House. Specific provision forScottish peers dated back to the Act of Union and some form of statutory recognition of the special position of Scotland was essential;the words in square brackets towards the end of the paragraph should therefore stand; they would also cover the special interest of wales. It was pointed out on the other hand that this was a subjectto which considerable thought had been given and which was still under consideration. It might be possible to insert a suitablereference in a preamble or even a declaratory clause in the Bill; butit was unlikely that direct and binding provision could be made, andthe words in square brackets were therefore inappropriate. It would however be desirable to include some assurance that the special position of Scotland would be recognised in the legislation, if this were practicable, without purporting to bind the Prime Minister inadvising on the exercise of the Prerogative.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in C (68) 111.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor to reconsider paragraph 48 ofthe draft White Paper in the light of the discussionrecorded at (b) above.(3) Subject to (2) approved the draft White Paper annexed toC (68) 111 for the purpose of consultation with theLeaders of the Conservative and Liberal Parties.SocialServicesEarnings-RelatedPensionsSchemeCONFIDENTIAL6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president (C (68) 106) about the proposed earnings-related pensions scheme, and memoranda by the Chancellor of the Exchequer aboutthe effect of the scheme on the pensions entitlement of public serviceemployees (C (68) 112) and the frequency of pension reviews underthe scheme (C (68) 110).The Lord President said that the scheme set out in C (68) 106would, if adopted, complete the fulfilment of the Governmentspledges to introduce a wholly earnings-related insurance system.Earnings-related short-term benefits had already been introduced:the current scheme would apply the same principle to retirement pensions. When Ministers came to examine the pensions systemthey found that the existing arrangements could not remain inoperation for much longer because of the burden which the successiveincreases in the flat-rate contribution placed on the lower-paid
workers. The choice lay between replacing the present system byfinancing pensions increasingly out of taxation, and re-casting thewhole structure of benefits and contributions. They had chosen thesecond alternative, believing that it would entitle the contributor to claim social insurance by right, and in particular to acquire pension rights which would make it unnecessary for him to apply for supplementary benefit. The proposals aimed at creating a state system of earnings-related benefits compatible with the continued existence of healthy private insurance schemes. It was essentialthat the contributor to the State scheme, as to the private scheme,should regard his contribution as a form of saving, and not as a formof taxation. Both types of scheme inevitably pre-empted taxableresources; but once the link between contributions and benefits was understood, the insurance principle would enable more revenue in total to be raised than would be tolerable if contributions wereindistinguishable from taxation. If, however, the contributions wereto be considered as savings, it was necessary so to arrange the pensionformula that the better paid would accept that the system gave thema reasonable return, while at the same time the lower paid were raised above the supplementary benefit level. The formula chosen to achieve this balance related contributions and benefits to earnings up to a ceiling of about one-and-a-half times the national average.The initial rate of contribution would be 61 per cent for employees and 6\ per cent for employers, plus the employees contribution tothe redundancy fund. Pensions would be based on earningsaveraged over a whole working life, each year&apos;s earnings beingrevalued in line with increases in the national average. The benefit would amount to 60 per cent of earnings up to half the national average and 25 per cent thereafter. The scheme would mature over20 years. The Exchequer contribution would continue at about thepresent level. Consultations with both sides of industry would benecessary before the details could be finally settled, and it was proposed to publish a White Paper shortly before the christmas recess as a basis for discussion with a view to the introduction of aBill early in the 1969-70 Session.The Cabinet might wish to defer a detailed discussion of thescheme until a later meeting, but at this stage he would draw attentionto the relationship between public and private insurance schemes andto the question of the degree of dynamism to be applied to thepensions of existing pensioners. Private occupational pension schemeshad expanded considerably in recent years and it was not intended that the State scheme should undermine them. Since, however,payment of both State and private pensions could result in some cases in an individual receiving benefit in excess of his wages on retirement,it was proposed to permit a partial &quot;abatement&quot; whereby thepercentage of earnings paid by members of approved occupational schemes and their employers would be reduced with a relatedreduction in the employees&apos; State pension which the employer would undertake to make good from his occupational scheme. It had notbeen found possible to provide for full transferability of pension
rights, but it was proposed to provide that a contributor on leaving a pensioned post could either preserve his accrued pension rights orrecover his own contributions.It had been thought politically necessary that the scheme should give some advantage to the existing pensioners, who would neverobtain even partial entitlement to the improved pension payable under the new scheme. The original intention had been to secureto pensioners a fair share of increasing national prosperity by raising the pension in line with increased national average earnings (earningsdynamism). It had become clear in the course of discussions,however, that the Government could not at present accept the costof earnings dynamism for existing pensions. They were committedas a minimum to making the pension proof against inflation, i.e., to increasing it in line with increasing prices; but since in recent yearspensions had risen faster than prices it would be necessary to offersomething more than price dynamism if pensioners were not to be worse off than recent experience had led them to expect. It wastherefore proposed to undertake to review benefit rates in the lightof specified factors such as the movement of prices and earnings, but without commitment to more than price dynamism. In order,however, to make this arrangement publicly acceptable, it was thought necessary to undertake to review benefits annually ratherthan biennially.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the earnings-relatedpension scheme had been worked out in close collaboration with theTreasury, and he was broadly in agreement with it except on theproposed annual uprating of benefits. The review of social benefitswas the first forward-looking piece of social planning which theGovernment had undertaken. For this reason it was important thatthe scheme should not be allowed to pre-empt excessive resources which they might later find, in the light of other long-term plans,could be more usefully devoted to, for example, education orhousing. On the proposed pension formula, the cost of the scheme with earnings dynamism on a biennial review would have risen bythe year 2002 to  10,971 million. An annual review would addabout  550 million in what would otherwise be the off-years betweenupratings. Moreover, an annual review of pensions under the new scheme would create pressure for annual increases in old-schemepensions and in supplementary benefits, and the repercussions mightspread to wage adjustments and to other public sector pensions and pay. It was consequently important to maintain the flexibility ofthe new scheme for as long as possible, bearing in mind that, whileit would be possible to move from biennial to annual reviews, itwould not be possible to move in the opposite direction.The effect of the earnings-related pension on the pension entitlement of public service employees raised problems which wouldhave to be discussed with staff interests, and, while negotiations wouldnot be easy, there was some possibility that agreement could bereached provided that compensating improvements were conceded in other features of the occupational schemes in return foran abatement of the public service pension.   If, however, the
staff demanded expensive compensating improvements, it would notbe possible to abate the contribution to contributory public service pensions to take account of the increase in the State pensioncontribution.In discussion it was observed that current pensioners were interested almost exclusively in protectiong their pension against inflation, and had shown little interest in the concept of obtaining afair share in rising national prosperity. They would therefore presshard for annual reviews of benefits based on the cost of living. Butif earnings dynamism were not adopted at least in part, pensioners&apos;standard of living would gradually fall behind that of the working population. Moreover, some element of earnings dynamism wouldmake the scheme more attractive for the lower paid. It was also suggested that, since some of the economic assessments contained inC (68) 106 might be open to question, it would be helpful to theCabinet to have a collective view from the economic advisers aboutthe economic effects of the scheme.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet would wish to resume their consideration of the earnings-related pension scheme at a later meeting. In the meantime it wouldbe useful if those Ministers who wished to raise points on theLord Presidents paper would send their comments to the lord president, who should consider them in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Social Security.Arrangements should also be made for the comments of the economicadvisers on the economic effects of the scheme to be obtained.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed to resume their discussion at a later meeting.(2) Invited Ministers who wished to comment on C (68) 106 tosend a note of their points to the Lord President beforethe discussion was resumed.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for theeconomic advisers to consider the economic effects of theproposed earnings-related pensions scheme.Cabinet Office,17th October, 1968.
