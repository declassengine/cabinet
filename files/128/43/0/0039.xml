CC 39 (68)secret. The Prime Minister reported that the parliamentary committee had considered how best to handle the proposal putforward informally by M. Jean Monnet that the Labour party should join the Action Committee for a United Europe, and theproblem, which had arisen in connection with the report of theLabour Party Fuel Study Group, of establishing satisfactory liaison between the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the LabourParty and the Government on the consideration of major questionsof policy.The Committee had taken the view that the invitation to join the Action Committee for a United Europe was primarily a matter for the NEC, though the Parliamentary Labour Party were also concerned and the Government had an interest in ensuring thatthe Labour Party&apos;s representations on the Action Committee were of appropriate national and international standing. It had beenagreed that he should in the first place ask the Acting General-Secretary of the Labour Party, Miss Barker, to call a meeting ofthe officers of the Labour Party and the Parliamentary Labour Partyto consider the invitation, and such a meeting, at which the lord privy Seal and the Chief Whip would be present, would take placeshortly.The Committee had also considered a letter from Miss Barkerdated 26th July, copies of which he had sent to members of theGovernment, expressing concern at the failure of Ministers to take account of the work of Labour Party Study Groups in formulatingGovernment policy. The Committee had agreed that liaison between the Government and the Party should be improved butconsidered it important that there should be communication in both directions. It was disturbing that Study Groups were set up on matters directly related to the work of individual Departmentswithout the responsible Minister being informed. He had therefore proposed in his reply to Miss Barker that representatives of the NECand of the Government should meet to consider arrangements for establishing more satisfactory liaison.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Ministers statement.The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the week after the summer recess. ;The Lord Privy Seal said that it was hoped to complete theremaining business in time for Parliament to be prorogued onFriday, 25th October, but the new Session would not be openeduntil Wednesday, 30th October, in case it should prove necessaryto defer the prorogation until 28th or 29th October.

1&apos;&apos;IALIS ILI OF THE 11- 1 Q RI   i JoyRhodesia(previous reference :CC (68) 30thConclusions,Minute 6)The Prime Minister said that Mr. J. R. A. Bottomley of theCommonwealth Office was returning to London later that day fromhis visit to Rhodesia. Until he did so there was little to report.The Commonwealth Secretary had made it clear publicly that weshould be prepared to resume the discussions with Mr. Ian Smiththe leader of the illegal regime, only if there was a possibility ofsecuring a settlement on the basis of the six principles which wecould honourably accept; and that we should never slam the door.
IndustrialAffairsEngineering:manual workers(previous reference :CC (68) 29thConclusions,Minute 1)confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the first secretary of State (C (68) 99) on the breakdown of wage negotiationsfor manual workers in the engineering industry.The First Secretary of State said that the gap between the latestoffer of the Engineering Employers Federation (EEF) and the claimput forward by the Confederation of Shipbuilding and EngineeringUnions (CSEU) was now very large. The National Committee ofthe Amalgamated Engineering and Foundry Workers Union (AEF)had decided by a vote of 31 to 30 to call a strike in support of theclaim from 23rd September. This decision had been criticallyreceived by some of the other unions concerned but the ExecutiveCouncil of the CSEU had subsequently endorsed the strike decision,though the date had now been postponed until 21st October. Someof the unions were balloting their members on the strike issue andthe result of the ballot by the Electrical Trades Union (etu),which was expected to show a large majority against the strike,would be known on 7th October. The EEF considered that earlyintervention by the Government would strengthen the influence ofThere could be no question of our reaching an agreement whichwas not in accordance with our own six principles and unless therewere what Ministers had described as a substantial change in circumstances in Rhodesia so as to justify reopening discussionwith the other countries of the Commonwealth on the principle ofno independence before majority rule (n.i.b.m.r.). AlthoughMr. Ian Smith had recently demonstrated his ability to resist pressure from his own Right-wing supporters for example, in introducing legislation to remove the mandatory death penalty for &quot;freedomfighters&quot; the constitution promulgated in Rhodesia containedprovisions contrary to each of the six principles. In some respectsit appeared that Mr. Smith might be ready to move closer to ourposition but there were as yet no indications of his willingness togive assurances on the provision for a &quot; blocking quarter &quot; in anew constitution for Rhodesia or in the formation of a broad-basedGovernment. It was right that the Government should continueto explore the possibility of achieving a negotiated settlement.They recognised that this could in certain circumstances exposethem to criticism within the Commonwealth or at the United Nations.But equally there was a real danger that, with the passage of time,other pressures could develop to inhibit an honourable settlement.Right-wing and racialist tendencies could develop further in rhodesia; and the Government of South Africa, where publicopinion favoured the Rhodesian Right wing, might be obliged toadopt a more active policy of support for them with a growingdanger of racial conflict in Southern Africa.
Prices and incomes(previous reference :CC (68) 29thConclusions,Minute 5)the militants and discourage those union leaders who wanted toavoid a strike. They would be prepared to make a smallimprovement in their offer but did not think that this would be acceptable to the CSEU. Opinion among the union leaders was divided. Some of them were optimistic that a settlement could bereached without a strike, but there appeared to be unanimity amongthe unions concerned that the EEF&apos;s current offer was far fromsatisfactory. Although at least one influential trade union leaderfavoured Government intervention now, others were strongly opposed to it. Her own view was that, while the Governmentwould find it increasingly difficult to seem to be standing byinactively as the threat of a major strike drew nearer, it would bea mistake to intervene before the results of the etu ballot were known. In the meantime she was considering, and having costed,possible alternative bases for settlement which might be put forwardwhen the time was right.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that it would be a mistake for the Government to intervene before the results of the etu ballot were known and endorsed the course of action proposed by the First Secretary ofState.The Cabinet (1) Took  note,  with   approval,   of  the  Prime  Minister^summing up.The Prime Minister said that the Governments policy for prices and incomes was likely to come under heavy criticism at theLabour Party Conference. Arrangements had been made for asmall group of Ministers, under the chairmanship of the Chancellorof the Exchequer, to consider the objectives of incomes policy fromthe latter half of next year. In the meantime it was important thatall Minister^ should make clear their support for the existing policyand for the decision which the Cabinet had taken in relation to theextension of compulsory powers when the existing legislation lapsed.In discussion it was pointed out that much of the opposition atthe Conference would be likely to come from representatives of thetrades unions. This might be reduced if it were made clear that theGovernment were examining the objectives of incomes policy afterthe present powers expired and that they were not necessarilywedded to the principle of a statutory incomes policy.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the First Secretary should tell the conference that the Government were examining the objectives of incomes policyfrom the latter half of 1969. In the meantime it must be made clearthat they stood by the present policy and by the statements whichhad been made in Parliament about the duration of compulsory powers.The Cabinet-(2) Took  note,  with   approval,   of  the  Prime  minister&apos;s summing up.
A NationalHydrocarbonsCorporationCONFIDENTIAL4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Ministerof Power (C (68) 100) on proposals by the Labour Party FuelStudy Group for the establishment of a National HydrocarbonsCorporation.The Minister of Power said that the Fuel Study Group in theirreport made proposals of major importance about future natural gas and oil policy which would require careful study: but decisions were not urgently required. However, it might well be necessaryfor Government spokesmen at this year&apos;s Labour Party conference to give the Governmenfs view on these proposals, which were at variance with existing Government policy so far as the futurefunctions of the Gas Council were concerned. The Fuel study group recommended that the proposed National HydrocarbonsCorporation (NHC) should take over some of the Gas Councilsprincipal responsibilities as well as assuming new functions in thedevelopment of oil, gas and petro-chemical exploitation at homeand abroad. If the Government indicated to the Conference a willingness to consider seriously the proposals to transfer majorresponsibilities from the Gas Council, which would be contrary tothe recent announcement of Government policy, this would seriouslyundermine the morale of the Gas Council at a time when all itsenergies must be devoted to the speedy exploitation of North Seanatural gas. As for the other proposed functions of the NHC itmight be found that these might be equally well or better performed to the extent that the Government decided they should be theresponsibility of a public body rather than private companies by existing public corporations such as the Gas Council itself, theNational Coal Board, or partnerships between these bodies and private companies. He recommended that Government spokesmenshould take a non-committal line at the Conference on the proposals;undertake to study the report; but sound a warning about theobjections to the proposed transfer to the NHC of the Gas Councilspresent responsibilities for buying, storage and distribution of natural gas.In discussion there was general agreement that while thegeneral objectives of the report by the Fuel Study Group could beaccepted the actual proposals would need careful consideration before the Government were in a position to make any substantivepronouncement about them.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that atthe Conference the Government should be prepared to indicate thatthey accepted the general objectives of the report by the LabourParty Fuel Study Group but had not yet taken a view on therelative merits of various possible methods, including the suggestedNational Hydrocarbons Corporation, for achieving these objectives.He would endeavour to arrange that the National Executive
Committee of the Labour Party would propose at the conference the establishment of a working group, drawn from members of theGovernment and of the Executive Committee, to consider the study group&apos;s proposals further.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,24th September, 1968.
