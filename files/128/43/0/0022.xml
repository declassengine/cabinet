secret. The Chancellor of the Exchequer communicated to theCabinet particulars of the proposals in the forthcoming Budget.In accordance with precedent, details are not recorded in theCabinet conclusions.secret. The Prime Minister said that some Ministers felt that in ourpresent critical economic situation the Government should give a lead to public opinion by volunteering an abatement of, say, 10 percent in Ministerial salaries for a period of 12 months. Any actionof this kind was envisaged as extending to all members of theGovernment, including junior Ministers; but the salaries of Membersof Parliament would not be affected. Other members of the Cabinet,however, held a contrary view; and it was therefore desirable tobring the matter to a decision.In discussion some support for the proposal was expressed. Itshould have a significant psychological impact, particularly at a timewhen the general public were being asked to conform to a policyof wage restraint, despite the rise in prices which would result fromdevaluation and other decisions of economic policy; and it should therefore provide a valuable reinforcement to the Governmentsforthcoming efforts to establish a more rigorous prices and incomes policy.On the other hand public opinion would be liable to discountthe proposal as being little more than a presentational device, whichwould make no significant difference to the incomes of the individuals affected, although it might bear more hardly on junior ministers. Moreover, it would be liable to generate an expectation that the salaries of Members of Parliament should be similarlyabated; and this would be unacceptable. Finally, the gesture wouldbe reminiscent of rather similar action taken at the time of thefinancial crisis of 1931; and, in so far as it might therefore leadpublic opinion to suppose that our circumstances resembled thoseof that critical year in other respects, it might damage confidenceat the precise moment when all the Governments efforts should bedirected to restoring it. Any Minister who wished to surrender partof his salary voluntarily and privately was, of course, at liberty to do so.secret. The Cabinet discussed the latest developments in theinternational monetary situation; the conclusions reached wereseparately recorded and copies were circulated only to The Queen,the Prime Minister and those Ministers who had to take action asa result. A copy is kept in the standard file of the Secretary of theCabinet.
The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of opinion in the Cabinet must be judged to be against theproposal.The Cabinet-Decided not to proceed with the proposal for an abatementof Ministerial salaries at the present time.Prices andIncomesPolicy on productivity,Prices and incomes(previous reference:CC (68) 20thConclusions,Minute 4)secret. The Prime Minister recalled that in their earlier discussions of future policy on productivity, prices and incomes (CC (68) 16th,17th, 18th, 19th and 20th Conclusions) the Cabinet had agreed thatthe provisional decisions which they had then taken should befinalised at the present meeting.The Secretary of State for Economic Affairs said that there were two main points of policy on which the Cabinet should concentrateas they moved towards a final decision. The first related to theproposal for a ceiling of 3-1 per cent for increases in incomes, savefor genuine &quot; productivity &quot; increases. It could be argued on theone hand that the policy would lose credibility if there were noceiling, and on the other hand that it would fail for lack of sufficient support if a ceiling of 3J per cent were imposed on increases in incomes in a situation where the Budget proposals, superimposedon devaluation, seemed likely to increase the cost of living by asmuch as 7 per cent. Second, the Cabinet might wish to considermeans of mitigating the effect on lower-paid workers of the policy as provisionally agreed. If it was felt that there was any case for modifying the decisions previously taken, there were two possibilities: either the ceiling figure of 3% per cent should be raised to 4 per cent or, alternatively, consideration might be given to thepossibility of adding to the present sole exception to the ceiling(i.e., genuine productivity bargains) a further exception to cover thecase of lower-paid workers. But this further exception could safely be made only if it could be sufficiently closely defined to prevent its use being extended, e.g., by maintenance of income differentials, to higher paid workers. Otherwise, it would undermine the wholepolicy.The only other point requiring consideration was the suggestionat an earlier discussion that, if it proved impossible to obtain theagreement of the employers and the trade unions to an extension ofthe present initial period of standstill on a voluntary basis, statutory provision to this effect might have to be made. It was relevant toany further discussion of this proposal that a statutory standstillperiod would require the early warning arrangements also to be ona statutory basis. But this was a provision which the Cabinet had wished to avoid; and it was in any event covered by existing powers.
The Minister of Labour said that on the last mentioned pointhe would himself have preferred the initial period of standstill to beof three months&apos; duration; but he recognised that this might be held to be excessive and was prepared to accept a period of two months.It would be unrealistic, however, to suppose that the Trades UnionCongress (TUC) would be prepared to accept an initial standstill on either basis. As regards the suggestion that the ceiling of 34. percent might be raised to 4 per cent, the decisive factor was likely tobe the extent to which maintenance of the present figure of 34. percent was considered essential for reasons of general confidence inour economic and financial stability. It was difficult to see how to formulate and agree with the trade unions an exception to thisceiling for the benefit of lower-paid workers in such a way that itwould not undermine the whole policy. It might be possible towork out such a formula in the area covered by wages councils; but even here complex relationships of earnings to basic rates of wagesmade the problem a difficult one. In other areas of incomes policyit would be impossible.In discussion it was suggested that it would be difficult tomaintain the ceiling of 34. per cent in view of the fact that the Budgetalone seemed likely to raise the cost of living by 2 per cent andthis increase would aggravate considerably the price impact of devaluation. But the objections to any mitigation by makingincreases in incomes of lower-paid workers an exception to theapplication of the ceiling seemed to be unanswerable. Anotherpossibility might be to convert the ceiling to a norm; but this would clearly weaken the effect of the whole policy. The only other possible course would be to increase the ceiling from 34 to 4 per cent; andthis might need to be seriously considered notwithstanding that it involved a retreat from a figure which had been widely publicised.The risks involved in such a course might therefore be considerable.But they needed to be weighed against the risk that the policy asprovisionally agreed would not attract sufficient support to be made effective; and this might be the most damaging outcome of all.On the other hand it was argued that from the point of viewof securing support for the policy, a ceiling of 4 or even 44 per cent would have little advantage over a ceiling of 34 per cent in terms ofacceptability, whereas the additional threat to confidence in sterlingwhich would be implicit in any retreat from the widely publicisedfigure of 34 per cent would be very damaging, particularly at ajuncture when the instability of the international monetary system,unless speedily rectified, could result in a very sharp fall in the real value of wages. It might indeed be too much to hope that a policybased on a ceiling of 34. per cent would be accepted by the tradeunions or public opinion generally or that it could be applied with complete effectiveness. On the other hand there was no alternative to seeking to maintain this policy in present circumstances; and whatever risks this entailed were preferable to the risks implicit ina laxer policy.
The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat, while the ceiling of 3  per cent must be maintained, furtherconsideration should be given to the possibility of finding some means whereby, without undermining the policy as a whole, theposition of the lower-paid workers might be eased.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) There was general agreement with the proposal that, in thecase of particular groups (e.g., teachers) whose remuneration wasnormally adjusted at intervals of more than a year and had not been increased during such a period, the ceiling should apply to the annual rate of increase, with the result that the permissible increase mightbe higher than 3J per cent; but the implementation of substantial increases of this kind should nevertheless be staged where necessary.It would be for further consideration, in the light of the expectedreport of the National Board for Prices and Incomes on this point,whether the current disparity between England and Wales on the onehand and Scotland on the other in the starting points of the two-yearsettlements for teachers should be eliminated by making the nextsettlement for one year only in the case of the former.(b) The Cabinet&apos;s provisional agreement on policy for restraint of rent increases had been designed to parallel in severity their policy for restraint of prices and incomes. The latter had been somewhatmitigated in recent discussions; and to that extent the policy onrent restraint might now appear relatively more stringent. Theproposal that the Housing Ministers should be given powers torequire phasing of local authority and private rents should beconstrued as including rents charged by New Towns and LocalAuthority Housing Associations. This point was particularly important in Scotland.(c) The Cabinet confirmed their understanding that in regard toretrospective wage settlements lump sum payments made at the endof a period of deferment could not be effectively dealt with throughlegal powers but only by continuing to give employers a legaldefence against further action to recover the deferred pay.Moreover, where a settlement was deliberately inflated, in order thatat the end of the period of deferment the loss sustained might berecouped over the following year, it would not be possible to limitpayments under that agreement to whatever ceiling might be prescribed for the second year; but any new agreement between thesame parties in the second year could be referred to the NBPI andsubsequently deferred. The Secretary of State for Economic affairs would give further consideration to the difficulty posed by settlementsproviding for exceptionally large increases, whether of these or anyother kinds.The Cabinet-(1) Confirmed in principle the provisional decisions reached intheir earlier discussions of future policy on productivity,prices and incomes.

(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs and theMinister of Labour to consider, and report to the cabinet at their meeting on Thursday, 21st March, whether any steps could be taken, consistent with Conclusion (1)above, to make the prices and incomes policy more acceptable as regards lower-paid workers in relation tothe ceiling of 1\ per cent.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,18th March, 1968.
