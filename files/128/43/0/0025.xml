8899a 2SECRET1. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet of the latestinitiative by the President of the United States, President Johnson,to end the war in Vietnam an initiative which took the form of anundertaking to restrict the United States bombing of North Vietnamin the hope that the reaction of the Government of North Vietnamwould be such as to enable the United States Government thereafter to suspend the bombing altogether and so to satisfy the condition which the Government of North Vietnam had always attached tothe launching of any negotiations for a peaceful settlement. in response to a request from President Johnson that, in our capacity as one of the co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference on Vietnam,we should use our influence to promote this initiative with the soviet union as the other co-chairman, he had requested the soviet ambassador, M. Smirnovsky, to represent urgently to the SovietGovernment the importance of eliciting a favourable response to this offer from the Government of North Vietnam. The soviet ambassador had confined himself, in reply, to maintaining that hisGovernment could not prescribe the attitude which the Governmentof North Vietnam should adopt on this issue; and he had emphasised that President Johnson&apos;s initiative did not in itself fulfil the north vietnamese stipulation of a complete and unconditional cessation ofthe bombing. Nevertheless, he had agreed to remind his Governmentthat the communique issued at the end of the Prime Minister^ visit to Moscow in the previous January had committed both the Britishand the Soviet Governments to take, &quot; singly or jointly &quot;, all actionswithin their power to achieve a political settlement of the dispute in Vietnam; and he had undertaken to convey promptly to Moscowthe Foreign Secretary&apos;s offer to discuss the latest United Statesinitiative with the Soviet Foreign Minister, either in London orin Moscow. In these circumstances we might entertain a cautioushope that President Johnson&apos;s offer might hold some prospect of resolving the present deadlock. And this prospect might be improved by the Presidents simultaneous statement that he did not proposeto seek re-election at the forthcoming United States presidential election in November, since the Government of North Vietnamshould calculate that, if they did not respond to an initiative whichmust now be recognised as owing nothing to domestic politicalmotivation on President Johnson&apos;s part, they might lose a genuineopportunity of achieving a peaceful settlement of the conflict andmight subsequently find, after the Presidential election, that PresidentJohnson&apos;s successor would be both disposed and pressed by publicopinion to intensify the war rather than to seek to bring it to an end.In discussion there was general agreement with this assessment of the position. It was suggested, however, that we should take this opportunity to extricate ourselves finally from the embarrassmentwhich we continued to incur as a result of the Governments refusal to dissociate themselves from United States policy in Vietnam. Ifthe latest United States initiative failed, public opinion in the UnitedStates would be liable to revert to a less conciliatory attitude towards
Malta(previous reference :CC (68) 24thConclusionsMinute 3)the Government of North Vietnam and to press for an intensification of the military effort. We should not allow ourselves to be ranged,in that event, automatically on the United States side; and we should therefore take the present opportunity to prepare to move towards a position in which we were seen to be not unsympathetic towards theUnited States but no longer in declared support of her policies. Onthe other hand, the basic reason for which we had always hithertorefused to dissociate ourselves from the United States in relationto Vietnam namely that, if we did so, we should cease to be able to exert any influence either in Washington or in Moscow as far as theVietnam conflict was concerned remained no less valid than hitherto. Indeed, this might be the moment at which our influencecould be of critical importance; and to that extent it v/as thelast moment at which we should seek actively to dissociateourselves from the United States Government. They had been warned repeatedly, both in private and in public, that we could not support them if they extended their bombing of North Vietnam; andthey would therefore have no grounds for criticising us if, as a resultof a failure of their latest initiative, they felt compelled to intensifytheir military effort in Vietnam and found that they had noendorsement from us in doing so. But that was a decision whichmust wait until the fate of the United States initiative was clear; forthe moment, we should confine ourselves to exerting all our efforts to reinforce, by representations to the Soviet Government, the main purpose of the initiative itself.The Lord Privy Seal informed the Cabinet that his negotiationswith the Malta Government about the future of the dockyard had resulted in complete agreement on terms satisfactory to us. For thefirst time the Malta Government had put forward proposals of theirown and we had been in a position to impose conditions. the malta Government proposed to introduce early legislation to nationalise the dockyard under Section 38 of the Malta Constitution.It had been accepted that, while we would provide no new money forthe next six financial years, the Malta Government would be permitted to draw  3 million, of the  31 million outstanding underthe financial agreement, to develop and diversify the dockyard andto meet the net cost of nationalising the shares and the assets ofBailey (Malta) Limited after allowing for the surrender of their andour receipts as creditors. There would be a limit of  100,000 ondisbursements for these purposes in the current financial year. Itwas also agreed that we would provide  3 million of additionaldevelopment aid in 1974-76, by which time we should probably haveto provide additional aid in any event. The Malta Government had accepted that the implementation of our undertakings would fullydischarge all obligations of any kind that the British Governmenthad hitherto incurred towards the Malta Government in relation tothe dockyard. Finally, it had been agreed that 1st April, 1968, shouldbe the cut-off date for the valuation of the company&apos;s liquid assets and for our indemnity of 1963 to the Malta Government.There remained a possibility that C. H. Bailey Limited would bring an action against us, but we were less vulnerable under the new
SocialServicesSickness andUnemploymentBenefit :Waiting Days(previous reference :CC(68) 17thConclusionsMinute 2)confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of social Security and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, on waiting daysfor sickness and unemployment benefit (C (68) 65).The Minister of Social Security said that at present no payment was made for the first three days of any period of interruption ofemployment due to sickness, injury or unemployment, unless thespell of interruption lasted for twelve working days or more, in which case payment was made retrospectively for the first three days. Inorder to accommodate an increase of family allowances within thepublic expenditure limits, the Cabinet had accepted her proposal that this retrospective payment for waiting days should be abolished,and a Bill had been introduced accordingly. While there had beenvery little adverse public reaction to the proposal, and that of theTrades Union Congress (TUC) had been mild, serious objections hadbeen expressed by the Governments supporters in Parliament andit appeared unlikely that it would be possible to carry the relevantclause in Committee.The Social Services Sub-Committee on the new earnings-relatedpension scheme had, however, been considering the possibility, inthe context of that scheme, of a more radical proposal to transfer to employers responsibility for up to the first four weeks of sickness.While recognising that this would constitute a major change of policyand that there would be formidable practical difficulties to be overcome, the Sub-Committee had supported her view that therewould be a strong balance of advantage in such an arrangement,subject to the working out of a practicable scheme in consultation withthe Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and the TUC. Thetransfer of responsibility for these payments to employers wouldrelieve the national insurance scheme of liability for up to three-quarters of its present sickness benefit load and would avoid the extensive duplication of administrative effort which now resultedwhere sick pay was paid both from the national insurance schemeand by employers. If such a transfer could be made in advance ofthe new earnings-related pension scheme, this would provideCC 25 (68)agreement than under the previous proposals and, even if the malta government were unable to secure the passage of legislation, weshould be in an unassailable public position.The Prime Minister expressed the Cabinets congratulations onthe successful conclusion of the negotiations conducted by the lord privy Seal.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Foreign Secretary andthe Lord Privy Seal.
justification for withdrawing the present proposal to abolishrepayment of benefit for waiting days, and much larger savings would accrue to the National Insurance Fund. One possibility would be to announce in the debate on the Second Reading of thepresent Bill that the clause abolishing payment for waiting dayswould be withdrawn at Committee stage and replaced by an enablingclause permitting the transfer of responsibility for the first few weeks of sickness benefit to employers, and that the Government would proceed to discuss the detailed arrangements with the CBI and TUC.This course, however, would gravely prejudice the course of thenegotiations with these bodies, since they would strongly object to anysuch announcement being made before they had been consulted inany way. She therefore thought that it would be preferable to announce at Second Reading that the Government had now decidedto review further the BilPs proposals in relation to waiting daysagainst the background of the introduction of earnings-related short-term benefit and the growth of employers&apos; sick pay schemes,and would be discussing the matter with the CBI and the TUC. she would say that, in the meantime, an amendment would be moved in committee to withdraw the clause abolishing the repayment of waiting days. She therefore sought the agreement of the Cabinet inprinciple that she should seek to work out with the CBI and the TUCa scheme for transferring responsibility for the early weeks of sicknessto employers and that she should make a statement on the SecondReading of her Bill that afternoon on the lines she had described.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the Government were already discussing with the CBI and the TUC the question of placingon employers a liability for making payments to suspended workers.It would be logical now to extend these consultations to embrace thetransfer to employers of liability for the early weeks of sickness whileemployees were still in employment. It would, however, be desirableto take enabling powers in the Bill at its Committee stage, so thatliability could be transferred to employers as soon as a scheme wasworked out, and the necessary offset to the cost of the increase in family allowances be achieved as soon as possible. Whether the saving was achieved by abolishing repayment of waiting days or bythe transfer of sickness benefit liability to employers, it would betemporary only, since a corresponding reduction of contributions would have to be made when these were next reviewed. The delay in opening negotiations with the CBI and the TUC could be justified on the grounds that it was necessary to inform Parliament first ofwhat was proposed, but it should be made clear that there would be full consultation in working out detailed proposals.In discussion it was pointed out that the current negotiationswith employers on the payment of suspended workers had beenprolonged and had first explored the possibility of a voluntaryscheme. Moreover, the extent of such payments was to some extentunder employers&apos; control, since the need to suspend employees couldbe reduced or avoided by better management. It was a different matter to negotiate on the basis that the Government were already committed to taking enabling powers and that all that remained was
to work out the means of operating such a scheme; and co-operation was unlikely to be secured on this footing. In any event, the TUCwould first want to discuss the establishment of a dismissal procedure to avoid the dismissal of employees with a poor health record; and prolonged negotiations would be necessary on such matters as thebasis of the sickness payments, the arrangements for medicalcertification and the incidence of the cost of the new arrangements,which could fall unevenly between different industries.In further discussion it was suggested that if the government announced an intention to withdraw the clause abolishing payment for waiting days they would be in a weak position to ensure thatconsultations over the transfer of responsibility for sick pay to employers proceeded expeditiously and did not break down.Consultation with the CBI and the TUC should not be undulyprolonged and the possibility of achieving savings through theabolition of repayment for waiting days should not be abandoned inadvance, if the necessary savings to offset the increase of family allowance was to be secured and the Budget statement was not tobe undermined with a harmful effect on oversea opinion. It wouldbe preferable therefore not to announce on Second Reading of theBill that the clause abolishing repayment of waiting days would be withdrawn, but to say that the Government were reviewing theirpolicy on this issue and would be discussing it with the CBI and the tuc, and that the Committee stage of the Bill would be deferredto enable this consultation to take place. It should be possible tocarry this consultation sufficiently far to allow enabling powers tobe taken at Committee stage without evoking criticism, although many of the details of the scheme would have to be left over for later discussion. It might in the event prove impossible to negotiate a scheme with the CBI and the TUC, but the Government wouldbe in a stronger position to retain the clause abolishing payment forwaiting days if they could show that they had explored all possible alternatives. It would be desirable, when informing the House ofCommons that the proposal to abolish payment for waiting dayswas being reconsidered, to make it clear that it was still necessaryto achieve a saving to offset the cost of the increased family allowances.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that itappeared unlikely that the clause in the Family Allowance and national Insurance Bill which abolished the payment for waitingdays could be carried in Committee. In all the circumstances theCabinet, on balance, took the view that the Minister should make ageneral statement on the Second Reading of the Bill, indicating thatthe Government were reviewing their policy in this matter againstthe background of the growth of employers&apos; sick pay schemes and theintroduction of earnings-related short-term benefits, and would beentering into full consultation with the CBI and the TUC; and that,in the meantime, the Committee stage of the Bill would be deferred.It would be necessary, however, to make it clear that savings to offset
the cost of the increase in family allowances would have to beachieved by one means or another; and they should leave open thepossibility of retaining the existing clause if the discussions provedabortive. The Minister should settle the terms of her statement inconsultation with the Lord President and the Chief Secretary,Treasury.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Social Security(i) in consultation with the Lord President and the chief secretary, Treasury, to make a statement in the Houseof Commons on the Second Reading of the family allowances and National Insurance Bill on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up oftheir discussion;(ii) in consultation with the Minister of Labour, to initiateconsultations with the CBI and the TUC on the transfer to the employer of responsibility for the payment ofbenefit in the early weeks of sickness.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,2nd April, 1968.
