2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week, including the debate onthe Budget which the Chancellor of the Exchequer would open on tuesday, 19th March. There was general agreement on theimportance of securing the most forceful and convincing presentation of the Budget proposals and the related policies on prices and incomes. The Lord President would be responsible for co-ordinatingarrangements whereby Ministerial speeches over the next few weekswould be directed principally to this end.The First Secretary of State said that at the request of thePrime Minister he had convened a Group of Ministers to considerthe issues raised by a request from the Minister of State for commonwealth Affairs (Mr. George Thomas) to be permitted to speak in his personal capacity as a prominent Methodist in oppositionto the Third Reading of the Sunday Entertainments Bill. The bill was a Private Member&apos;s Bill, for which the Government had provided the draft. Until recently Bills had either been recommended oropposed by the Government, or had been genuinely Private Members&apos;Bills which the Government had left to take their own course, andthere had been no question of Ministers speaking in a personal capacity. Under the present Administration, however, a fourthcategory of Bill had developed: Bills concerned with controversialsocial problems, for which the Government had thought it right togive facilities in terms of drafting, and where necessary parliamentary time, to enable Parliament to come to a conclusion. It was in relationto this category, of which the Sunday Entertainments Bill was an example, that the problem arose, largely because, while theGovernment as such adopted an attitude of neutrality, they hadpermitted the departmental Ministers concerned with the Bills toexpress their own personal views, normally in favour of the objectthe Bill was designed to attain.confidential. The Prime Minister said that, in view of the very heavyadministrative pressure to which Ministers and their senior advisershad been subject since the previous autumn, he hoped thatarrangements would be made for them to obtain a reasonable respiteeither at Easter or at the Spring Bank Holiday. Ministers shouldmake it their personal responsibility to ensure that this was done.The Prime Minister then referred to two further recent instances of articles in the Press which purported to disclose discussions inthe Cabinet and in a Cabinet Committee. These incidents reinforcedthe need for all Ministers to preserve the strictest discretion aboutmatters which were under collective discussion. They should alsoensure that their junior Ministers were again reminded of their obligations in this respect.
The majority of the Group of Ministers under his chairmanshiphad taken the view that in future no Minister, whether or not hewas departmentally concerned, should express a personal view onBills to which the Government collectively took a neutral attitude.The departmental Minister^ intervention should be confined toadvising Parliament on the practicability of the measure and on any amendments necessary to ensure that it reached the Statute Book ina suitable form. It had been suggested, on the other hand, that all ministers, whether departmentally concerned or not, should be free to express their personal views, or, alternatively, that the PrimeMinister should decide, on the rare occasions when a Minister notdepartmentally concerned wished to speak, for example in the lightof the Minister^ long and public association with the point of view which he wished to express, whether he should be allowed to do so.The majority of the Group considered that the first alternative might result in several Ministers with strong conscientious convictionsfeeling impelled to speak, with the result that opportunities for private Members to participate in the debate would be limited; andthat the second would place the Prime Minister under the necessityof reaching a series of difficult personal judgments. If the view of themajority, which he shared, were adopted, a special difficulty would arise in relation to the Divorce Reform Bill, because the Solicitor-General, speaking for the Government in the Second Reading debate in the House of Commons, had indicated that he personally was opposed to the Bill. If a ban on the expression by Ministers of their personal opinions were introduced at this point, the Lord chancellor would be prevented from expressing his own support of the Bill inthe House of Lords. The Group of Ministers therefore thought thatthe Lord Chancellor should be permitted on this occasion to give a brief indication of his support.In discussion it was pointed out that it was difficult to convince the public of the Governments neutrality on the principle of a Billfor which they were providing Government time in the House ofCommons if, in addition, the Minister departmentally responsibleexpressed himself as personally in favour of the objects the Bill sought to achieve. In the particular case in question, however, Mr. GeorgeThomas&apos;s position was well known, and it could do the Governmentno harm if he were allowed to take part in the debate on the SundayEntertainments Bill. It was a mistake to speak of the government as neutral on Bills of this character. All Ministers had their own views; they merely refrained from offering Parliament collectiveadvice on the principle of the Bill. It was arguable that the public should know where Ministers stood on the issues in question, andit was not clear that the departmental Minister need be precluded from expressing a personal view provided that the Cabinet were consulted on each occasion. They could then consider the question in the light of the views of Ministers with a different departmental responsibility, for example, in relation to the application of a Billto Scotland or Wales, or with no departmental responsibility, who might with equally strong conviction hold views in an opposite sense:it might then be urged that if some Ministers held views contrary to
SECRETNationalLottery(previous reference:CC (68) 19thConclusions,Minute 3)The Lord Privy Seal drew attention to the possibility of a seriousprocedural difficulty arising from the proposal, which the cabinet had approved at their previous meeting, to insert a provision in theFinance Bill removing the legal obstacles to the establishment of anational lottery. He understood that the rules of order of the Houseof Commons excluded the possibility of foreign matter being tackedon to Finance Bills by way of amendment, and that constitutional practice prevented the inclusion of such matters among the originalprovisions of such Bills. The Standing Orders of the House of Lordsalso condemned tacking as un-Parliamentary. It would be embarrassing if, in an attempt to sound opinion in the House ofCommons on a national lottery, the Government exposed themselvesto accusations in the House of Lords of unconstitutional practice, or,alternatively, since the House of Lords did not divide on theCC 20 (68)those of the departmental Minister with the primary responsibility,he should refrain from expressing his personal support or opposition and confine himself to a declaration of the Governmenfs neutrality.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet were in favour of adopting the recommendationof the majority of the Group of Ministers that no Minister should express a personal view on Private Members&apos; Bills for which theGovernment were prepared to give special facilities while maintainingcollective neutrality, subject to the proviso that if a Minister withdepartmental responsibility wished to express a personal view heshould consult the Cabinet. If, having considered the view of other ministers on the Bill in question, the Cabinet agreed that thedepartmental Minister should express a personal view, he could doso; but in any event no Minister other than the Minister withdepartmental responsibility for the topic in question should speakin debates on Bills of this type. It followed that Mr. George Thomasshould not speak on the Sunday Entertainments Bill. In view of thedifficulty of applying the new procedure to the Divorce Reform Bill,however, the Cabinet agreed that the Lord Chancellor should be free to express his support of the Bill in the Second Reading debate inthe House of Lords, as the Solicitor-General had briefly expressed his opposition at the corresponding stage in the House of Commons.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that Ministers without departmental responsibility inrespect of the Bill in question should not speak on private members&apos; Bills on which the Government adopted an attitude of neutrality, and that a Minister withdepartmental responsibility should do so only with the specific agreement of the Cabinet.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would advise Mr. GeorgeThomas that he should not speak on the Third reading of the Sunday Entertainments Bill.
Rhodesia(previous reference:CC (68) 19thConclusions,Minute 1)provisions of a Finance Bill whether certified as a Money Bill ornot, to the accusation that the Government were attempting toprevent the House of Lords from expressing an opinion on theprinciple of a national lottery. It might therefore be better to find some other way of assessing opinion in the House of Commons.He had not, however, thought it right to consult the authorities ofthe House on the point because of its association with the Budget,and it might be that the difficulties were not as great as he feared.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he did not think therewas any constitutional objection to the insertion of the proposedclause in the Finance Bill, and he proposed that it should be includedin the Bill as introduced rather than by way of amendment, so as toavoid the necessity for recommittal. An appropriate means of enabling the House of Lords to express an opinion on the issue mightbe to arrange a debate specifically on a national lottery before theFinance Bill reached them.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the points to which the Lord Privy Seal had drawn attentiondid not suggest that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should refrain from using the Finance Bill as a means of sounding the opinion ofthe House of Commons on a national lottery, but rather that theHouse of Lords should take a separate opportunity of consideringthe matter. It would be convenient for them to do so between SecondReading of the Finance Bill in the House of Commons and itstransmission to the House of Lords.The Cabinet-(3) Took  note,   with   approval,  of  the  Prime   minister&apos;s summing up.The Commonwealth Secretary said that he had considered withthe Foreign Secretary how best to meet the pressure in parliament for a statement on our policy towards Rhodesia in view of themeeting of the Commonwealth Sanctions Committee that was dueto take place on the following day and the meeting of the united nations Security Council that was expected shortly. They had concluded, on balance, that the right course would be for a holdingstatement to be made in Parliament that day in terms which would,so far as possible, leave us free to take what action seemed bestas matters developed in the United Nations. The statement wouldexpress relief at the decision of the regime in Rhodesia not to proceedwith the hanging of 35 more men but at the same time make it clearthat the problems raised by the recent executions had not been solved,particularly as a further 70 men remained under sentence of death.It would go on to amplify our attitude to the proposals for asettlement of the Rhodesian problem which had been brought backby Sir Alec Douglas-Home from his discussions with Mr. Ian Smith,making clear that in view of the executions these proposals couldnot be followed up. The position as regards the Rhodesian Judiciarywould be dealt with in terms which had been agreed-with the LordChancellor and the Attorney-General and there would be a reference
secret. The Commonwealth Secretary said that there was animminent danger of armed conflict breaking out between Guyanaand its neighbour Surinam, which was an autonomous State withinthe realm of the Netherlands. The dispute was over an area of some5,000 square miles of uninhabited territory which had always beenconsidered as part of Guyana when it was a British Colony.Surinam had established posts in the disputed territory in connectionin the statement to the position as regards the United Nations andthe Commonwealth Sanctions Committee, expressing our desire toknow the views of our Commonwealth psrtners and of other membersof the Security Council before finally deciding what action weshould take.The Foreign Secretary said that it was clear from representations made to him by a delegation of ambassadors acting on behalf ofrepresentatives of African States that there would be strong pressure for a resolution in the Security Council calling for the use of force against Rhodesia. The composition of the Security Council was such that a strong resolution seemed certain to receive eight votes,probably with four against it, the outcome turning on the votes ofthe two Latin American members. We were considering thepossibility that the problem of Rhodesia should be dealt with in two stages in the Security Council: first a resolution which we couldsupport, expressing abhorrence at the recent actions of the regime;and subsequently a second stage dealing with the action to be taken,on which our view would depend on what was proposed. It was clear that we should face an extremely difficult situation in the united nations, particularly as the representative of the Soviet Union wouldbe Chairman of the Security Council from the beginning of April.In discussion there was general agreement that a statement onthe lines proposed by the Commonwealth Secretary should be madein Parliament that day, although it was for consideration whetherit might not more conveniently be made by the Prime Minister in response to Questions that had already been put down to him for answer that afternoon. In view of the number of issues requiringcontinuous attention that seemed likely to arise on Rhodesia, aspecial group of Ministers would be constituted to deal with them.One matter requiring consideration was the possibility of a new approach which would enable action to be taken against firms ratherthan Governments for breaches of mandatory sanctions.The Cabinet-(4) Agreed that a statement on our policy on Rhodesia on thelines proposed by the Commonwealth Secretary shouldbe made in Parliament that day.(5) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for a group of Ministers to be constituted to deal with all aspects of our policy towards Rhodesia.
with a proposed hydro-electric scheme: and Guyana wished toremove them by force. We were not directly involved in the dispute.But it was our interest to prevent the outbreak of hostilities between a member of the Commonwealth and a State which was part of ourally, the Netherlands. An attempt to arrange a meeting between thetwo sides in Barbados had been unsuccessful. But we were continuing to use our influence with Guyana to prevent hostilities.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that we were also intouch with the Netherlands Government; and that the United StatesGovernment, although they would not mediate, were exerting their influence in favour of a settlement. The question had not been referred to the International Court.The Cabinet Took note of the Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s statement.Prices andIncomesFuture policy on Productivity,Prices and incomes(previous reference:CC (68) 19thConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of future policy on productivity, prices and incomes on the basis of memoranda by theSecretary of State for Economic Affairs (C (68) 45, 54, 56 and 58)and by the President of the Board of Trade (C (68) 46).The Prime Minister said that arrangements had been made forthe Secretary of State for Economic Affairs and the Minister ofLabour to meet representatives of the Trades Union Congress (TUC)on 18th and 19th March to give them first a broad indication, and later a fuller account, of the Governments intentions on prices and incomes policy. He himself proposed to meet the Trade UnionGroup of Members of Parliament or their representatives on 18thand 19th March for a similar purpose. Representatives of the confederation of British Industry (CBI) would be seen on the morning of 19th March and consulted more fully after the budget speech; it was important that any discussion with them on generalbudgetary matters should take place only when the Chancellor of theExchequer was present.The Secretary of State for Economic Affairs said that his memorandum (C (68) 58) considered the merits of the three possiblesolutions to the problem of the duration of the proposed statutory powers over prices and incomes which had been canvassed in the cabinets previous discussion. These were:(i) to take powers for 18 months with provision for Parliamentto continue them for a further period by the expiring laws Continuance Act;(ii) to take powers for two or three years only, subject to annualrenewal within that period by affirmative resolution procedure; or(iii) to take powers without time limit subject to annual renewalby affirmative resolution procedure.
While course (ii) would set a firm limit to the duration of the powers,under courses (i) or (iii) it would be open to the Government tocontinue them indefinitely. If course (i) or (iii) were adopted, itwould be necessary to decide whether the Government shouldpublicly present this as legislation which was intended to be permanent. It would be necessary to assess the likely reactions tothis in Parliament and industry: the CBI and TUC would almost certainly be strongly opposed to any suggestion of permanent powers.His own view was that statutory powers would be requiredpermanently; they would probably not need to be as far-reaching asthe powers it was now proposed to take, but should be more extensivethan the powers available under existing legislation. If this were accepted as the long-term objective, it raised a difficulty in respectof course (i), since there was only limited scope under the expiring laws Continuance procedure for amending the statutory provisions which were being continued and this might make it difficult to move towards powers of an intermediate character of the kind he had suggested.Despite this, course (i) had a number of advantages over theother courses and he recommended its adoption. It was essentialthat the Government should commit themselves firmly to takingpowers which would be valid for at least 18 months; an undertaking to this effect should be given in the Budget debate, and theGovernment should also indicate then that they would probably seek to continue the powers for at least one further year. If this were done, adequate powers would be available during the critical post-devaluation period. It would be undesirable, however, to give anycommitments at this stage in respect of statutory powers in the longer term.If powers were taken for at least 18 months, this would makeit easier to abandon the proposal to include in the new legislationa prohibition of retrospective wage payments following the impositionof a standstill. The longer the powers were to remain in force,the smaller was the risk of employers and unions agreeing onretrospective payments. The power to delay wage increases could continue to be used to prevent excessive settlements designed to compensate retrospectively for loss of earnings through deferment ofa previous wage increase. It would probably not be possible toprevent retrospective wage payments entirely, since if these took theform of lump sums the money would be in the hands of the recipientsbefore the statutory powers could be invoked. Nevertheless, he recommonded that the legislation should not include a prohibition ofretrospective payments, provided that the statutory powers were to bevalid for at least 18 months.In discussion there was general agreement with the proposal totake powers for 18 months with provision for their continuance bymeans of the Expiring Laws Continuance Act. While this coursewould not have any significant presentational advantages in respect
of Parliament and the TUC as compared with annual renewal by affirmative resolution, it had a number of other advantages. Actionto renew the powers would under this procedure fall to be takenin the late autumn which, because of seasonal influences, was less likely to be a period of economic strain than the late spring orsummer, when action would fall to be taken under a procedure of annual renewal by affirmative resolution. Moreover, it would be easier under the procedure of the Expiring Laws Continuance Actthan it would be under the affirmative resolution procedure to renewsome powers but not others and it was desirable to have thisflexibility. It would be important to draft the Prices and incomes bill in such a way as to leave the maximum room for manoeuvrein this respect. While it might be possible to provide for renewal of the powers through the Expiring Laws Continuance Act withoutany specific reference to this in the Prices and Incomes Bill itself, itwould be preferable to include such a reference in the same form ashad been used in other recent legislation. In any case, it would be important from the point of view of confidence overseas for theGovernment to make clear, both in the Budget debate and in theproposed White Paper, that they were retaining the freedom to renew the powers after 18 months and that they anticipated that it wouldprobably be necessary to renew them for at least one further year.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) There was general agreement that the legislation should not include a prohibition of retrospective wage payments following theimposition of a standstill. The Government should say that ifretrospective payments began to be made in a way which would undermine the incomes policy, they would be prepared to introduceseparate legislation to stop this.(b) Under the present voluntary arrangements for notification of wage increases, it had been accepted by industry that increases should not be implemented for a period of one month following theirnotification, pending a decision by the Government whether or notto make a reference to the National Board for Prices and Incomes(NBPI). In the forthcoming consultations with the CBI and TUC,efforts should be made to secure agreement to an extension of thisperiod, if possible to three months but failing that to two months,on the basis that the period would be subsumed in the maximum period of 12 months for which a wage increase could be delayed underthe proposed statutory powers, and would not be additional to it.(c) It was proposed in paragraph 27 of C (68) 45 that the powerto delay wage increases should be framed by reference to the rates of remuneration of the employees affected by a particular settlement,rather than by reference to the implementation of the settlement asin the existing provision in Part II of the Prices and Incomes Act,1966. The object of this proposal was to avoid the problems of definition which arose under the existing provision and by this means to make the exercise of the power more effective without changing itsbasic purpose. It was, however, accepted that there should be no attempt to use the statutory powers in such a way as to preclude
increases above the ceiling figure in the earnings of individualworkers, since the intention was that the ceiling figure should applyto the aggregate effect of a given settlement on the earnings of all those affected, and that it would be permissible within that limit forsome of the workers concerned to get more than the ceiling increasewhile others got less. The delaying power should be so framed as to fit in with this.(d) There was general support for the proposals on future pricespolicy in C (68) 45, subject to the modifications that the power to delay price increases would be exerciseable only in conjunction witha reference to the NBPI, and that it would not be intended tointroduce statutory notification of price increases unless voluntary arrangements proved inadequate, in which case statutory notificationwould be introduced selectively in the sectors concerned.(e) The Royal Commission on Trade Unions and EmployersOrganisations was likely to make recommendations on measures toimprove trade union structure and organisation and on plantbargaining which would help indirectly in promoting a sound incomes policy in the future. There was now a reasonable prospect that theCommission^ report would be unanimous.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet had reached agreement on the main issues affecting futureproductivity, prices and incomes policy, subject to final ratificationat their meeting on 18th March. The Prices and Incomes Committeeshould consider further the proposal that the power to delay wage increases should be framed by reference to the rates of remuneration of the employees affected; the Committee should decide this matter before a draft White Paper was submitted to the Cabinet. TheChancellor of the Exchequer would outline the government&apos;s proposals, without going into detail, in his Budget speech and theSecretary of State for Economic Affairs would elaborate them whenhe spoke in the Budget debate on Thursday, 21st March. TheSecretary of State and the Minister of Labour should arrange to briefthe Press on the evening of 19th March, and should be guided in thisby the points made in discussion, in particular as regards the duration of the statutory powers. The aim should be to publish a White paper as soon as possible after the conclusion of the Budget debate,preferably on Monday, 25th March, and it might be convenient forthe Cabinet to consider a draft on Thursday, 21st March.The Cabinet-(1) Took note with approval of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for thePrices and Incomes Committee to consider further theproposal that the power to delay wage increases should be framed by reference to rates of remuneration.
(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs and theMinister of Labour to arrange to brief the Press on the evening of 19th March, as indicated in the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up.(4) Invited the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs to circulate a draft White Paper for consideration by theCabinet with a view to its publication as soon as possible after the conclusion of the Budget debate.Post office services and charges(previous reference:CC (67) 53rdConclusions,Minute 4)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Postmaster-General (C (68) 59) about proposed increases in Post Office chargesfollowing a report by the National Board for Prices and Incomes(NBPI).The Postmaster-General said that he was not able to give a fulland final view on the recommendations which had now been madeby the NBPI because he was committed to awaiting the comments of the Post Office Users&apos; Council, the Post Office economic development Committee, and the Staff Sides of the Post OfficeDepartmental Whitley Councils. However, he wished to seek hiscolleagues&apos; agreement to the amount of additional revenue whichthe Post Office should now seek to raise. The financial requirementsof the Post Office would be increased over the next three years tothe extent of  140 million for pay increases, which would be heldwithin a ceiling of 3-\ per cent a year; of  130 million for capital investment; and a  81 million for other reasons including a higherfinancial target which had been agreed with the Treasury. The PostOffice thus faced a shortfall of  351 million over the next three years.They intended to make good  165 million of this by improvements in productivity leaving a net shortfall of  186 million. The increased charges recommended by the NBPI would eliminate  170 million ofthis. In present circumstances, and taking into account the new financial target set for the Post Office was intended to be achievedover the next five years, he hoped that his colleagues would agreethat he should increase tariffs to the extent recommended by the nbpi and thus raise an additional  67 million in a full year. Hecould not, however, accept the Board&apos;s recommendation that theintroduction of the two-tier letter service should be delayed until 1st April, 1969: arrangements were already well advanced tointroduce it this autumn. Accordingly, he proposed to defer for thetime being some increases in charges in order to offset the additional revenue which the Post Office would be receiving from the earlierintroduction of the two-tier letter service.The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for economic Affairs said that they agreed with these proposals.The Cabinet Approved C (68) 59.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,14th March, 1968.confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the first secretary of State (C (68) 57) about the British Standard Time Bill.The First Secretary of State recalled that when the Cabinet had considered the proposal to introduce British Standard Time they had concluded that it should be introduced as a permanent arrangement,and not experimentally. The Secretary of State for Scotland had recently proposed to the Home Affairs Committee, however, that,in the light of the extent of the opposition to the Bill on SecondReading in the House of Commons and of continued criticism inScotland, there was a case for amending the Bill so that it wouldexpire after three years unless continued by affirmative resolution.As an alternative, it had been suggested that the Home secretary should give an explicit undertaking to amend the Act, if this proved necessary in the light of experience. This would avoid exposing theGovernment to charges of vacillation after their change of policy onthe third London airport; but the majority of the Committee thoughtthat it would be unfortunate to suggest that the Government werereadier to yield to pressure from the opponents of the proposal tobuild the airport at Stansted than to a large body of opinion inScotland. The majority of the Home Affairs Committee, with whom he himself agreed, therefore recommended that the Bill should be amended.In discussion there was general agreement that the amendmentof the Bill was the better course.The Home Secretary said that since the Bill would not be takenin Standing Committee for some time it would be convenient to announce the decision in reply to a Question.The Cabinet (1) Approved the recommendation of the Home AffairsCommittee that the British Standard Time Bill should be amended so as to expire after three years unless continued by affirmative resolution.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to announce their decision inreply to a Question in the House of Commons.
