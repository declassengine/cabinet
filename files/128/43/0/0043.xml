confidential. The Cabinet considered arrangements for the Debate on&apos;the Address. It was agreed that the Chief Whip, in consultationwith the Ministers immediately concerned, should give furtherconsideration to the question whether a free vote should be permitted to Private Members on the Government side of the House on thequestion of reducing the age of voting to 18, and should report their conclusions to the Cabinet in case it proved necessary to indicate the Governmenfs intentions during the Debate on the Address.The Prime Minister recalled that a Ministerial Committee, underthe chairmanship of the former Lord President (Mr. Crossman), had reported on proposals for devolution to Scotland and Wales,particularly in the administrative and Parliamentary spheres. Theseproposals had been further discussed by the then Lord President withthe Secretaries of State for Scotland and for Wales, the Leader ofthe House of Commons and the Chief Whip, and subsequently bythis Group of Ministers, with the addition of the Home Secretary,under his own chairmanship. It had been decided to recommend tothe Cabinet that The Queen should be advised to refer in her speech on the Opening of Parliament to the appointment of a constitutional commission, with the powers and status of a Royal Commission, toconsider further the functions of the central legislature in relation tothe countries, nations and regions of the United Kingdom, and theconstitutional relationship between the United Kingdom, the channel islands and the Isle of Man. The Group, enlarged by the addition ofthe Ministers principally concerned with local government and regional questions, would meet again to discuss the terms of reference of the Commission and the passage to be recommended for inclusion in The Queen&apos;s Speech, and would report to the Cabinet on thefollowing Tuesday. The proposal to devolve on the Secretaries ofState for Scotland and for Wales certain functions in respect ofhealth, agriculture, ancient monuments, royal palaces and tourismhad been discussed bilaterally with the Ministers concerned, and,subject to further consideration of points of detail, he proposed torefer to these measures in his speech on the Debate on the Address.It was proposed to anticipate the criticism that the appointment of a constitutional Commission was a means of delaying action to dealwith the problems created by the rise of nationalist movements by including a dynamic element in the terms of reference so that theCommission would be required to take account of developments which occurred while it was sitting, such as the Governmenfsresponse to the recommendations of the Royal Commissions on local Government in England and in Scotland (the Redcliffe-Maudand Wheatley Commissions) and any decisions the government might take in respect of the problems of Northern Ireland. It was important that the Government should not be inhibited in taking any necessary decisions in respect of local government in GreatBritain and of the problems of Northern Ireland, and furtherconsideration was being given to the question whether NorthernIreland should or should not be included in the remit of theConstitutional Commission.9534
In discussion it was suggested, on the one hand, that fullerconsideration should be given to constitutional questions of suchfundamental importance before the Government committed themselves to recommending the appointment of a constitutional commission, and in particular that there would be advantage inwaiting until the Reports of the Redcliffe-Maud and WheatleyCommissions were received. On the other hand, it was argued thatthere was some expectation that a reference to the problems of devolution would be included in The Queen&apos;s Speech, and that if theterms of reference could be drawn in such a way that the Governmentwere not precluded from making progress with reforms while theCommission was sitting, the appointment of such a body would bea valuable means of securing progress in this field. It would, inparticular, ensure that the advocates of separatism were compelledto put forward specific proposals for public discussion.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theGroup of Ministers involved in the recent discussions on devolution,with the addition of the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, theMinister of Housing and Local Government and the paymaster general, should meet again before the next meeting of the Cabinetto consider the implications of including Northern Ireland in theremit of the proposed Constitutional Commission, the terms ofreference of the Commission, and the passage which The Queenmight be recommended to include in the Speech on the Opening ofParliament. The Home Secretary should prepare a paper on these points and should revise for the consideration of the Cabinet thepaper (MISC 215 (68) 4) which he, with the Secretaries of State forScotland and for Wales, had prepared on the proposal to appoint a Constitutional Commission. Both these papers should be circulated to the Cabinet as well as to the Group of Ministers.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would convene a meetingof the Ministers principally concerned to consider thepoints indicated in his summing up, and would thereafterreport to the Cabinet.Demonstration The Home Secretary informed the Cabinet that the Vietnamagamst the War Solidarity Campaign and other bodies were planning a largedemonstration in London on Sunday, 27th October, and that,although the majority of demonstrators were opposed to violence,there was evidence that a small group of extremists would attemptto make use of the demonstration to provoke the police intorepressive action. The organisers of the demonstration had agreed with the police that the route should run from the Embankment atCharing Cross, by way of Ludgate Circus, Fleet Street and theStrand, to Whitehall. Some of the extremists proposed to leave themain demonstration in Trafalgar Square and make for GrosvenorSquare. He had discussed the demonstration with the commissioner of Police of the Metropolis, who believed that he could maintaincontrol of the demonstration, and thought that to use his power under the Public Order Act 1936 to prohibit it would do more harm
secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that at the ministerial Meeting of Western European Union (WEU) in Romeon 21st-22nd October, the Belgian Foreign Minister had put forwardhis proposals for closer co-operation between European countries inforeign policy and defence. These were supported by all theMinisters present except the French who rejected them inuncompromising and contemptuous terms. At an informal discussionwith all the other Ministers, except the French, he had proposedthat since the French refused to agree to the Belgian ForeignMinister^ proposals being pursued in WEU they should be followed up outside it. The Dutch and Italians had warmly supported this;the representatives of the Federal German Republic, Belgium and luxembourg had said that they would need to consult their governments; and it had been agreed that a further meeting shouldbe held at the time of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation(NATO) Conference in November. All in all the outcome at Romehad been very much as he expected. He would be in close touchwith the Foreign Ministers of the other countries concerned beforethe next meeting of WEU at the end of January. In the meantimefurther moves towards closer European co-operation might well takeplace in the context of the informal talks on defence which theSecretary of State for Defence proposed to hold at the time of the nato Conference.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;sstatement.than good. The police would be present in strength in Whitehalland round the Palace of Westminster: they proposed to keep a singleline open for traffic in Whitehall, but otherwise to allow thedemonstrators to sit in the roadway. They had adequate powers todeal with violence, and the Home Secretary&apos;s reply to parliamentary questions later that day would draw attention to the penaltiesavailable to the courts. It was not proposed to bring in troops to and the  civil power, or to call for police reinforcements from outside london. The Commissioner of Police thought that there was some risk that after the main demonstration was over bands of extremistsmight attempt to cause damage, but believed that police precautionswere adequate to deal with them. Instructions had been given thataliens known to have been convicted of violence should not beallowed to enter the country to take part in the demonstration, butthere was no ground on which to prevent other foreign students from entering the country.The Cabinet (2) Took note of the Home Secretary&apos;s statement.
Rhodesia(previous reference:CC (68) 42ndConclusions,Minute 2)The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of theCabinet (C (68) 118) covering a telegram from the British high commission Residual Mission in Salisbury containing the text ofaide-memoire by Mr. Ian Smith, leader of the illegal regime.The Prime Minister said that a meeting of Ministers had beenheld on 23rd October to consider Mr. Smith&apos;s aide-memoire on theproposals for a Rhodesian settlement which had been communicatedto him in HMS Fearless. No further decisions were required fromthe Cabinet at this stage: but he invited the Minister without portfolio to inform them of the latest position.The Minister without Portfolio said that Mr. Smith&apos;saide-memoire gave no clear indication of the Rhodesian regime&apos;attitude towards the British proposals, and it would be necessary toconsider its full implications and to press Mr. Smith to state which of our proposals he found acceptable and which he did not. It wouldalso be necessary to make clear to Mr. Smith that we had gone to thelimit in making concessions. In particular, there must be a secondguarantee to reinforce the blocking quarter. Alternatives to thesystem of appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy council were being considered by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office,and he would report further to his colleagues: but any proposalswhich might be put forward must constitute a genuine alternative,not merely a fall-back position, and must offer an effective ifpossible a more effective safeguard than the Privy Council proposalitself. The South African Government had been requested to conveyour views to Mr. Smith and we should have to see how far theywere prepared to go in bringing pressure to bear on Mr. Smith. all this would require time. It was important if he was to visit Salisburythat some prior assurance should be obtained that he should beallowed to see Mr. Nkomo and the Reverend Sithole and discussthe British proposals with them.The Prime Minister said that at Gibraltar Mr. Smith had appeared willing to allow Messrs. Nkomo and Sithole to visit London,but had not committed himself on access to them in Rhodesia itself;it was important that he should do so. He thought there were three possible hypotheses : that Mr. Smith genuinely wanted an agreement and that it was merely a question of the price he was prepared topay; that he did not wish for agreement but hoped to throw the blame for a breakdown on us, in which case he had played his cardsbadly; or that Mr. Smith, who was indecisive by nature and subjected to considerable pressure in different directions, did not really know what he wanted. The attitude of South Africa was difficult to evaluate at this stage. While the South African Government hadnot changed their fundamental attitude it seemed probable that they wanted good relations with their neighbours and stability on theirnorthern borders, and it seemed reasonable to assume that theywould work to this end both by direct contacts with the Rhodesianregime and through their political contacts in Rhodesia. Thoughthe position was by no means clear, Mr. Smith appeared to haveinduced his colleagues to accept that agreement was possible providedthat the problem of an external guarantee could be resolved.  Most
Nigeria(previous reference:CC (68) 42ndConclusions,Minute 2)probably he wanted an agreement but was not yet prepared to takea decision and outface the hostile reactions of his own supporters.The Ministerial Group which had been set up to consider Rhodesianmatters would discuss the aide-memoire further and a report wouldbe made to the Cabinet in the following week. Meanwhile, he wouldtake the line in Parliament and in public that there was nothingfurther to say at this stage. Mr. Smith&apos;s aide-memoire had not been published and would not be. If necessary, he would say that Pressspeculation which had appeared about the aide-memoire&apos;s contentswas wide of the mark.In discussion, it was pointed out that the position would have tobe held in the United Nations. The United Kingdom representative at the United Nations, Lord Caradon, would have to be informed of developments, though there was nothing of substance that hecould say at present.The Cabinet (2) Took note, with approval, of the statements by the PrimeMinister and the Minister without Portfolio.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion at their next meeting inthe light of the further consideration to be given to thematter by the Ministerial Group.The Lord Chancellor said that it was deeply offensive to many people, that, while we were sending relief supplies to Biafra, we were continuing to supply arms to the Nigerian Federal Government. Weshould consider offering publicly to cease the supply of these armsif the French were prepared to cease sending arms to Biafra.In discussion, it was pointed out that, although the FrenchGovernment were aware that arms were being supplied to Biafrafrom France and could prevent their export if they wished, they werenot themselves supplying them. They had stated this publicly andalso at the recent meeting of the Western European Union in Rome.It was not therefore open to us to make the offer proposed by theLord Chancellor. Our policy was to support the Federal government against the rebellion by Biafra and in this we had the support of thegreat majority of African States. There was no inconsistencybetween continuing to supply arms to the Federal Government and,at the same time, doing what we could to alleviate the sufferingresulting from the war. Although it was clear that Biafra wouldnot be able to establish itself as a separate State, it was impossibleto forecast how long hostilities in Nigeria would continue, but thefact that in areas reconquered by Federal troops the inhabitantswere returning to their homes pointed against a protracted campaign,even though arms supplies of the kind the Lord Chancellor had referred to tended to prolong it. International observers had established that genocide against the Ibos was not taking place.The Cabinet -(4) Agreed that our policy on the supply of arms to the federal government of Nigeria should not be changed.
OverseaPolicyVietnam(previous reference:CC (68) 42ndConclusions,Minute 2)SECRET*3. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that a wishhad been expressed that the Cabinet should consider United states policy in Vietnam and the possibility that we might dissociateourselves from it and, in particular, from the bombing of north vietnam. During his recent visit to the United States, he had made enquiries about United States policy towards Vietnam. The publicattitude of the United States Government was that they wereprepared to stop the bombing of North Vietnam if they had an assurance that the Government in Hanoi were prepared to make a reciprocal gesture. They had already stopped the bombing of large areas of North Vietnam but were not willing to stop it permanentlyor unconditionally. None of the candidates for the United StatesPresidency had indicated a willingness to stop the bombingunconditionally. The public attitude of the Government of north vietnam was that they were unwilling to promise any reciprocalgesture if the bombing was stopped and that in any negotiations theywould not meet the Government of South Vietnam or regard anyonebut the National Liberation Front as representing . that country.There were signs that the heavy burden of the war on North Vietnamwas forcing a reduction in her military activities. Although therehad been no progress in the official talks in Paris between representatives of the United States and of North Vietnam, highlyconfidential discussions about a possible package settlement hadbeen taking place there and it was believed that the Soviet union was urging the North Vietnamese to make the necessary reciprocalgesture. The package under discussion consisted of a completecessation of the bombing of North Vietnam together with acceptance by her of the Government of South Vietnam as a party to discussions,the re-establishment of the demilitarised zone between North andSouth Vietnam and the cessation of attacks on cities in SouthVietnam. Our policy had always been to persuade the United Statesagainst any action that would escalate the conflict in Vietnam and,in particular, against bombing Hanoi or Haiphong. In view of the delicate state of negotiations between the United States and north vietnam, we should not at this point change our policy and dissociateourselves from that of the United States.In discussion, the view was expressed that it was unrealistic forthe United States to require a prior assurance of reciprocal action by the North Vietnamese before the bombing was stopped. AlthoughNorth Vietnam could not give such assurance in advance, she had indicated that if the bombing were to stop there would be a response.The United States should therefore stop the bombing for a periodwithout seeking prior guarantees. We should make it plain publicly that this was our view and that we were no longer associated with united States policy in Vietnam.On the other hand, it was argued that it would be wrong for usto change our policy at this time. If we were to do so, we might wellencourage North Vietnam not to agree to the proposed packagesettlement and, in addition, it might appear that we were intervening
IndustrialAffairs(previous reference:CC (68) 42ndConclusions,Minute 4)confidential. The First Secretary of State said that the ships1 clerks in theRoyal group of docks in London had unanimously voted in favourof a return to work so that negotiations with the employers could be resumed. This would give her Department a chance to influence the negotiations in a direction more compatible with prices and incomes policy. In the engineering industry the employers and unions had reached agreement, in the talks which had taken place under her aegis in the previous week, on a number of important issues. In particular the unions had agreed to accept method study and a new wage structure based on job evaluation and they had made some concessions on training.   It had at one time seemed9534CC 43 (68)in the United States Presidential election campaign. It would benecessary to carry out a full reappraisal of our policy towards theUnited States when the outcome of the Presidential election was known and our policy in Vietnam should be covered in this. Therewere arguments for taking the opportunity offered by the forthcomingchange in the United States Administration to disengage from a leading position on Vietnam which did not give us great influence over United States policy and was out of line with the position ofour friends in Europe. It would not be easy for us to do this, however,particularly in view of our position as co-Chairman of the geneva conference and it was a fact that at various times in recent years wehad influenced United States policy on Vietnam. Moreover, no attempt on the part of the Government to play a more passive roleon Vietnam would eliminate the need to take a definite line in response to critics of United States policy in Parliament and thecountry. One difficulty in our situation was that much greaterpublicity had been given to our support for United States policythan to our role as a mediator or to our attempts to preventescalation of the war in Vietnam.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement that we should not at this time change our policy on Vietnam. Although there would be some advantage in seeking to play a more passive role in this area of policy, it would bedifficult for us to do so and we should not in any event under-estimate the part which our influence had played in shaping United states policy on Vietnam. Moreover the Soviet Union, who feared directChinese intervention in Vietnam, attached importance to our roleas co-Chairman of the Geneva Conference in the Western interest.A full appraisal would, however, be necessary of the implications of the outcome of the United States Presidential election for our policies, including that for Vietnam, and the Cabinet would wish to resume their discussion when this appraisal had been made.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.
SocialServicesEarnings-relatedPensionsScheme(previous reference:CC (68) 42ndConclusions.Minute 6)confidential. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of a memorandumby the Secretary of State for Social Services (C (68) 106) about theproposed earnings-related pensions scheme and of memoranda bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer on the effect of the scheme on thepensions entitlement of public service employees (C (68) 112) and onthe frequency of pension reviews under the scheme (C (68) 110).They also had before them a note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C (68) 117) to which was appended a note on the scheme&apos;economic effects prepared by a group of Economic Advisers.The Secretary of State for Social Services recalled that at their previous discussion the Cabinet had concentrated on two aspects ofthe scheme, the degree of dynamism to be promised arid the frequency of pension reviews. These were crucial to the whole structure of thescheme, but there were a number of other points requiringconsideration, in particular the relationship between the scheme and occupational schemes, the proposed levels of contributions and benefits and the proposed abolition of the married women&apos;s option.There was also the all-important question of presentation; in his judgment the acceptability of the proposals would depend largely on the skill with which they were presented. He had in mind a white Paper which would have much of the character of a green paper; it would be designed to stimulate public discussion and provide a basis for consultation with affected interests, and would ileave it open to the Government to modify their proposals in thelight of the views expressed. It would help in meeting the tighttimetable if the Cabinet were prepared to consider the White paper in page proof.likely that they would be able to conclude a settlement which wouldbe consistent with the prices and incomes policy and would include a number of useful measures for improving productivity.Unfortunately the talks had broken down on 18th October-ostensibly at least on the issue of equal pay for women. The situation was now very confused. At her suggestion the employers had agreedto propose the immediate setting up of a joint working party todiscuss job evaluation for women. This would be a useful move inthat it would help to get away from the concept of a special rate forwomen. But it was too early to say what the unions&apos; reaction wouldbe or how the situation would develop in the next-few weeks. Onthe whole she was not unhopeful as the package on which agreement had been provisionally reached in the previous week containedelements which both the employers and the unions would be reluctant to lose.The Prime Minister said that the fact that a national engineeringstrike had been averted was largely due to the skilful way in whichthe First Secretary and her Department had handled a very difficult situation.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minis ter&apos;s summing up of their discussion.
In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The scheme proposed in C (68) 106 would not be a fundedscheme, but would be financed on a pay-as-you-go basis; in thisrespect it departed radically from earlier thinking in the LabourParty. The idea of a funded scheme had great attraction, but itwould wreck the occupational schemes which now covered a largeproportion of all workers and provided a large part of private savings.The basis of the present proposals was that provision for old agewould rest on a partnership between the State and private schemes,with the latter responsible for most of the savings element.(b) The reactions of occupational pensioners would be crucialand it was therefore reassuring that the National Association ofPension Funds had expressed the view that an option to contract out on an abatement basis would be an essential part of any state scheme which sought to do more than cover basic needs. It wouldnot be easy to negotiate amendments in the public service schemes,but there was considerable pressure for improvements in the benefitsavailable under them and there was some possibility that agreement could be reached if improvements were conceded to offset the adverse effects of the State schemes. Those affected included, inaddition to the Civil Service, contributors to the general localgovernment scheme, the police and teachers&apos; schemes and the variousnationalised industry schemes and extensive consultation would be needed.ic) It was proposed that under the new scheme working wivesshould be treated in the same way as single women in employment and be required to pay contributions; under the present schemethey were free to opt out if they so wished and had been doing so in increasing numbers. The change would not be popular with marriedwomen, particularly the higher paid who would face a steep increasein contributions; though single women who were already liable topay full contributions might regard it as only fair. But there weresound reasons of principle in favour of the proposed change; inother respects, such as the treatment of widows, the proposed schemewas generous to women and the change would be in harmony with current moves towards equal pay. Women earning less than  5 or so a week would not be liable for contributions in any case. Somemisgivings were expressed about the effect of the change on the willingness of married women to return to teaching, a matter of vitalimportance to the schools, but the general feeling of the Cabinet wasin favour af abolishing the married women&apos;s option. The white paper should be drafted on this basis as a means of sounding publicopinion; payment of contributions by married women was not essential to the scheme and the decision could be reconsidered if thepublic reaction were unfavourable.id) The proposals envisaged a much smaller surplus in the fund in the early years than had been contemplated in earlier thinking.This was largely the result of the proposal that the scheme should
mature after only 20 years, but it was arguable that it would be wise to plan for a larger surplus. A larger surplus would mean highercontributions but employers&apos; contributions would increase much lessthan employees&apos; under the proposals as they stood and it would seemreasonable to find the extra money from this source if the economic implications of doing so were acceptable. It would be useful if theEconomic Advisers could produce a report on the desirability of alarger surplus and the implications, particularly in terms of prices and higher export costs, of financing such a surplus by increasingemployers&apos; contributions.(e) It was suggested that it would be better to abandon the ideaof an identifiable National Health Service contribution within thetotal contribution; such contributions were in reality taxes and assuch foreign to the nature of the scheme. It was pointed out on theother hand however that a recent survey had shown that 60 per cent of people believed that the National Health Service was financedwholly or mainly from these contributions. It would be difficult tofind a satisfactory reason for doing away with the contributions andthere was therefore a presentational advantage in retaining them.(/) When the scheme was fully operative lower-paid workers who had hitherto had to rely on supplementary benefit would be assisted through retirement pensions financed by contributions. this had been a main object of those who worked out the proposals, but might be used to found the charge that the Government were ineffect switching part of the burden from the Exchequer to thecontributors. In fact the effect of the proposals taken as a whole would be to increase the cost to the Exchequer, not reduce it, and itwould be important to bring this point out in presenting the scheme.Higher-paid workers would admittedly be worse off, but this was theprice of lifting the pensions of the lower paid above supplementary benefit level.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, summing up thediscussion, said that he would report to the Prime Minister theprogress which the Cabinet had made. They were agreed that thesuccess of the proposals would depend very largely on theirpresentation and that the White Paper should have something of thecharacter of a Green Paper, being designed to provide a basis fordiscussion without committing the Cabinet to every particular. the morning&apos;s discussion had ranged widely and the Cabinet had reachedprovisional conclusions that the married women&apos;s option should be abolished and an identifiable National Health Service contributionbe retained. But a decision on the main structure of the scheme must depend on the conclusions reached on the linked questions ofthe degree of dynamism to be guaranteed and the frequency ofpension reviews, and the Cabinet should resume their considerationof these questions at their next meeting.The Cabinet-(1) Took note with approval of the Foreign and commonwealth secretary&apos;s summing up of their discussion.
(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for theEconomic Advisers to consider the desirability of building up a large surplus during the early years of the schemeand the economic implications of doing so by raisingemployers&apos; contributions, and to circulate a note of theirviews.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion at a later meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,24th October, 1968.
