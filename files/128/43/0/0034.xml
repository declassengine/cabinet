Parliament1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.CONFIDENTIALOversea Affairs 2. The Foreign Secretary said that the State Visit of PresidentState Visit of Saragat of Italy which was to have taken place from 16th to 23rdJuly had had to be postponed. The Presidents presence in italy was considered necessary in view of doubts whether the new ItalianGovernment would receive a vote of confidence from the ItalianParliament. He had explained to the Italian Ambassador that giventhe complex arrangements involved in a State Visit it might now be some time before the Presidents visit could take place.the Presidentof ItalyFrance(previous reference :CC (68) 30thConclusions,Minute 6)The Foreign Secretary said that the recent French elections were an overwhelming victory for the Gaullists and the IndependentRepublicans and a defeat for all the other parties. They were a reaction against the disturbances which had taken place in May, and showed the futility of demonstrations against a Government, whenthe demonstrators did not know what they wished to put in its place and could not count on widespread popular support. There was apossibility that M. Pompidou might be replaced as Prime Minister.French policies were unlikely to change, in particular with regard tothe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and to the British applicationto join the European Economic Community (e.c.). But France&apos;power to carry her policies through might have been weakened asa result of the May disturbances.The French Government had announced a series of measuresinvolving incentives to exporters, quota restrictions and theadministrative surveillance of imports. These measures would leavethe Kennedy Round untouched and the French Government had announced its decision to comply fully with its engagements underthe e.c. and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).The French would have some difficulty in justifying the measuressince their reserves of gold were still very large; but the e.c. were likely to give the necessary approval. The real danger lay in the reaction of the protectionist lobby in the United States. We werenot in a position to criticise the French measures; and to do so would not help.In discussion the view was expressed that it was right not to takethe lead in opposition to the French measures, but to leave the e.c. and the GATT to make the running. There was a possibility thatthe French Government might be obliged to reduce its expenditureon defence, although it would probably prefer, if necessary, toabandon the Concorde project rather than to sacrifice the Frenchnuclear deterrent.9118CC 34 (68)CONFIDENTIAL
The Foreign Secretary said that the situation was still not clearwith regard to reports that Greek orders for British goods had been cancelled, allegedly following a reply by the Prime Minister to a supplementary Question in the House of Commons. The GreekDirector-General of Press and Information, M. Stamatopoulos, haddenied reports that the Greek Government had decided to cancelall contracts with British firms. The Ambassador was in touch withthe Greek Government.The Commonwealth Secretary said that President Kaunda ofZambia had accepted an invitation to visit this country from 16thto 20th July. He had accepted that we could not go back on our previous decision to provide no further contingency economic aid for Zambia.The Commonwealth Secretary said that Tanzania had agreedto resume diplomatic relations and was thus the last country to doso of those which had broken with us over Rhodesia in December1965. An announcement to this effect would be made that day. the resumption of relations with Tanzania was the result of a visit thereby Mr. Malcolm MacDonald, the British Special Representative in east and Central Africa. It would not entail any change in our policy on economic aid.The Foreign Secretary said that there were signs of progress onthe issue of disarmament. Sixty nations had so far signed the treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. He was now considering, in the light of discussions which the Minister of Statefor Foreign Affairs, Mr. Mulley, had recently had in Washington,what further proposals might be put to the Eighteen NationDisarmament Committee. The Soviet Ambassador, M. Smirnovsky,had delivered to the Foreign Office on 1st July a memorandum containing nine proposals on disarmament which the SovietGovernment now wished to discuss in the Committee. Thememorandum contained some proposals clearly intended to promote the strategic interests of the Soviet Union. But there were others which had previously been advanced by the West; and there was a reference to the possibility of measures to limit the flow of arms tothe Middle East, which represented a departure from previousSoviet policy. Agreement had also been reached between the UnitedStates and the Soviet Union to discuss in the near future thelimitation and reduction of offensive and defensive strategic nuclearweapon delivery systems.The Prime Minister said the Cabinet would wish to congratulatethe Foreign Secretary and the Ministers of State for Foreign Affairs,Mr. Mulley and Lord Chalfont, on the signature of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The British Government, and the foreign secretary personally, had played an important part in bringing toa successful conclusion the negotiations leading up to the Treaty.
Nigeria(previous reference :CC (68) 33rdConclusions,Minute 3)IndustrialDisputesRailways(previous reference :CC (68) 32ndConclusions,Minute 2)The Commonwealth Secretary said that the announcement on 2nd July that Lord Hunt would lead a mission to Nigeria to advise on relief had been well received. He contemplated two stages in therelief operation-an emergency air lift followed by a longer termland lift. It was not intended to wait for Lord Hunt to return before making plans for an air lift to alleviate the immediate suffering.Our efforts to achieve a cease-fire had recently suffered a setback;and it was clear from a speech on 30th June by Colonel Ojukwu,the Head of the Biafran Government, that Sir Louis Mbanefo, theBiafran representative at the recent talks in Kampala on a cease-fire,would not after all be coming back to London to resume talks withrepresentatives of the Federal Government. This development haddemonstrated the importance of direct access to Colonel Ojukwu;and he hoped that Lord Hunt would see Colonel Ojukwu in thecourse of his relief mission. Meanwhile, the commonwealth secretary was supporting a proposal that Mr. Arnold Smith, theCommonwealth Secretary-General, should visit Biafra in order tocontact Colonel Ojukwu.In discussion the question was raised whether it was right tocontinue to supply arms to the Federal Government when the continuation of the war was causing so much suffering. It waspointed out that we were only supplying arms in normal quantities;that the Federal Government could easily get these arms from othercountries; and that it was the intransigence of the Biafrans whichwas largely responsible for the continuation of the war. Biafra wasinsisting on recognition of its secession by the Federal government as a condition for a cease-fire, whereas the Federal Governmentwere fighting for the territorial integrity of Nigeria and could not therefore accept secession. The sympathy which the Biafran causeenjoyed in this country was largely due to the successful public relations of the Biafran authorities. They were employing a public relations firm in the same way as the Katangan authorities had atthe time of Katanga&apos;s secession from the Congo in 1960-62. It was desirable that a full study should be made of the activities in thiscountry of public relations firms employed by foreign authorities.The Prime Minister said he would consider, in consultation with theLord President, how to pursue this.The Cabinet-Took  note  of  the  statements  by  the  Foreign  and commonwealth Secretaries and of the points made in discussion.secret. The First Secretary of State said that, contrary toexpectation, the Annual Conference of the National Union of railwaymen (NUR) were proving more militant than the ExecutiveCommittee. They had rejected the managements latest offer andhad appointed a small negotiating committee whose members were clearly determined to stand out for an all-round increase in pay.British Rail were afraid that the &quot; go-slow&quot; might drag on for
several weeks and had considered warning their employees thatthose who reported for duty but could not be given work becauseof the action of other employees would in future be sent homewithout pay. In discussion with the Chairman of British Rail theprevious day she and the Minister of Transport had explained thatthe Government could not approve a general increase which wouldconflict with the prices and incomes policy; but that it was important that British Rail should avoid taking action which could subsequently be said to have precipitated a national strike. In the light of thisBritish Rail had decided not to announce the suspension of the guaranteed week and the member of the Board responsible for labour relations had flown to Penzance for discussions with theNUR committee. There was in her view a serious risk of a national strike; and the Cabinet should consider what its attitude would balfour this materialised. To approve an all-round increase of the kindthe NUR were seeking would be in direct conflict with prices and incomes policy and have serious repercussions on the wage negotiations in the engineering industry. There might, however, bescope for a small improvement in the management^ offer withoutbreaching the prices and incomes policy for example, by providingfor some payment on account to be made in return for firmundertakings about future productivity.The Minister of Transport said that, although the &quot; go-slow &quot;had given rise to great inconvenience for London commuters, its effect on the economy was so far negligible. Both exports and imports were still flowing freely through the ports and the transferof freight traffic to the roads was proceeding smoothly. He had putin hand a study of the consequences for the economy of a nationalrailway strike. The &quot; go-slow &quot; had had a serious effect on BritishRaiFs finances. They could not make any increase in their offerwithout adding to their financial difficulties and conflicting with theprices and incomes policy. The Government should therefore giveBritish Rail their whole-hearted support; their intervention in thedispute could only lead to an increase in British RaiFs offer and thiswould destroy the credibility of their management decisions. It wasin any case by no means certain that there would be a national strike.There were indications that lower paid employees, whose earningshad in some cases fallen substantially because of the &quot; go-slow&quot;,would be reluctant to strike; and British Rail thought that a seriesof partial stoppages in different parts of the country was more likely.In discussion there was wide support for the view that it wouldbe wrong for the Government to intervene in the dispute and thatthey should support the management of British Rail even at the riskof a national strike. A national strike would, however, be a serious matter and the Governmenfs readiness to face it must be largelyconditioned by their assessment of the consequences for the economy,the effect on foreign opinion and the likelihood of sympathetic action by other groups of workers, for example, in the docks. the seamen&apos;s strike of 1966 had had serious consequences for the economy, though these were not likely to be repeated in the present case because of the small proportion of our exports which wascarried by rail.
DefenceSupplementaryStatement onDefencePolicy, 1968:Draft white paper(previous reference :CC(68) 11thConclusions,Minute 5)The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that it would be wrong for the Government totake any action which might lead the railwaymen to believe that further intransigence would lead to an improvement in the managements offer. British Rail should be left to continue their discussions at the Annual Conference of the NUR, but if these failedto produce results it would be necessary to consider whether theGovernment could usefully take any initiative with the aim of reaching a settlement which conformed with the prices and incomes policy. In this event, he would consider the matter again with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the First Secretary of State and theMinister of Transport, and they would consult other ministers concerned as necessary.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the Prime Minister^ summing up.4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary ofState for Defence (C (68) 83) covering the draft SupplementaryStatement on Defence Policy, 1968.The Defence Secretary said that the draft White Paper took account of amendments agreed by the Defence and Oversea PolicyCommittee at a meeting in the previous week and of other amendments proposed by individual Ministers. The White paper was intended to show how the major decisions on defence policytaken earlier in the year would be put into effect. The defence budget for 1968-69 and 1969-70 would be contained within theceilings that had been set and it would only be necessary to provide 25 million for cancellation charges on the F. 111 programme whichwas much less than the speculative figures which had appearedrecently in the Press. Manpower reductions would be somewhatgreater and would be made earlier than had been forecast for thelong term a year ago and would be achieved by 1973-74. Since1964 there had been a reduction of a quarter in the plannedmanpower and equipment programmes of the forces and of a thirdin planned expenditure. The draft White Paper reported progress on our military withdrawals from Singapore and Malaysia and fromthe Persian Gulf, and described the additional contributions thatwe proposed to make to the defence capability of the North atlantic treaty Organisation (NATO). In order to maintain the strength ofthe proposed forces, it would be necessary to recruit at a rate of35,000 annually compared with the current intake of only 25-28,000and, unless recruiting could be improved, it might be necessary toconsider the reintroduction of conscription. It was important,therefore, to restore public confidence in the Services as a careerand for this reason the draft White Paper sought to emphasise the positive aspects of the now primarily European role of the Services.The Cabinet then considered the draft White Paper in detail and the following main points were made.
Paragraph 21It should be made plain by inserting quotation marks that thesecond half of the first sentence of this paragraph was a quotationfrom the communique of the meeting of NATO Defence ministers at The Hague in April, 1968.Paragraph 37The Defence Secretary said that he and the Chiefs of Staffattached high priority to the proposal mentioned in this paragraph to purchase 26 additional Buccaneer aircraft, which had the supportof a majority in the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee. As aresult of the re-shaping of NATO strategic thinking, in which we hadplayed a major part, greater emphasis was now placed onconventional operations with a consequent need for more aircraft for the strike /reconnaissance role. We had always made a contribution in this role and it had been the intention that, as theCanberra aircraft which we currently contributed to NATO wastedout, they should be replaced by the F. 111. When the F. Ill wascancelled, he had stated that it would be necessary to do something to mitigate its loss. The additional Buccaneers would cost  62million over ten years compared with  450 million for the F. 111.They would enable us to make a meaningful contribution to thestrike/reconnaissance role and to maintain techniques of this kindof operation in the Royal Air Force. They would also allow usmore flexibility in the date by which an advanced combat aircraft would be required in service and thereafter would be available tomaintain our contribution to NATO maritime operations in the late1970s. The order for the aircraft would go to a &quot; grey &quot; area and,because we should avoid the cancellation charges on Buccaneersnot required following the decision not to re-fit HMS Victorious,there would be no additional costs this year and under  2 million in 1969-70. Provision had been made for the programme withinthe Defence Budget ceilings up to 1972-73.In discussion, it was argued that in our present economic andfinancial situation we should not purchase the additional Buccaneers.We were already planning to make substantial additional contributions to NATO and should avoid becoming committed to being the only European NATO country which contributed to theexpensive strike/reconnaissance role, particularly as this might prejudice our freedom of action in deciding in due course whetheror not to participate in the development of an advanced combat aircraft. The purchase, which would involve substantialexpenditure in 1970-71 and 1971-72, would introduce additionalrigidity into the Defence Budget and make it more difficult to achieveany further economies that might be necessary. It was not asufficient justification for new programmes of this kind that theycould be financed within the ceilings set for the Defence Budget;they must be considered on their merits.The balance of opinion was, however, in favour of purchasingthe additional Buccaneers. The military arguments for the purchasehad been  strongly made and there were important political
arguments also in relation to our position in NATO. Theexpenditure involved was, moreover, too small within the defence budget as a whole to add materially to its rigidity or to prejudice the extent of any savings that might be necessary in the defence budget for 1969-70.Paragraph 48An addition should be made to this paragraph to indicate thatincreasingly substantial savings in Army Support manpower couldbe expected beyond the current year.Paragraph 57The last sentence of this paragraph should be confined tostating the recruiting requirement without indicating the need for it to improve since the point could be better taken and elaboratedin the debate on the White Paper.Paragraph 73The third sentence of this paragraph, which dealt with thepossibility that the United States contribution to European defencemight be reduced, should be omitted.Some minor amendments in the White Paper were agreed orremitted for consideration by the Defence Secretary with theMinisters concerned.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the draft Supplementary Statement on defence policy, subject to the points made in discussion, and noted that itwould be published on 11th July. Since the reductions and closuresthat would be necessary in the United Kingdom - military baseorganisation in the next few years would have important regionalimplications, the Ministers concerned with economic and regionalaffairs should be given adequate opportunity to represent their interests effectively before decisions were taken.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposal to purchase 26 additional buccaneer aircraft.(2) Subject to points agreed in discussion, approved the draftSupplementary Statement on Defence Policy 1968appended to C (68) 83.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Defence, before reaching decisions on United Kingdom military base organisation with regional implications, to consult the ministers concerned with regional and economic affairs.
CONFIDENTIALBristol: 5.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of west Dock     Transport on Bristol West Dock (C (68) 84).The Minister of Transport said that at the Ministerial steering committee on Economic Policy on 2nd July (SEP (68) 11th Meeting),opinion was evenly divided between, on the one hand, outrightrejection now of the Bristol West Dock project and, on the other,allowing Bristol Corporation to go ahead without any grant or loan from the Ministry of Transport and without access to the PublicWorks Loan Board. His paper summarised the main considerations involved. There was in his view no economic justification for the dock. The return on a discounted cash flow (dcf) basis was 2f to4J per cent as against a minimum of 8 per cent for public sectorprojects and between 10 and 20 per cent for most current portdevelopment projects. It could be argued that dcf calculations werenot appropriate to a long-term project of this sort but they were theonly available measure of prospective economic return. rejection of the scheme would mean that Bristol would lose traffic and thatthere would be no further expansion; it would not involve the closure of all port facilities there. He recognised, however, that to reject the scheme, on which the Bristol Corporation were prepared to risk their own money, would have serious political implications, would create acute difficulties locally and might lead to resignations fromthe South-West Economic Planning Council. If the corporation were allowed to go ahead with the scheme the Government couldrefuse to give them loans and grants under the Harbours Act, 1964.The Corporation could, however, challenge in the courts the refusal to give a grant, though he was advised that such a challenge was unlikely to be successful. The Government could not stop theCorporation from borrowing about a third of the finance requiredfor the dock from the Public Works Loan Board.In discussion it was argued that a decision to reject the scheme would preclude further expansion of the port of Bristol and thus leadto its eventual disappearance. If the Corporation were told thatthey would have to finance the whole of it themselves they might welldecide to postpone it until the results of the Severnside study became available. A decision to oppose the Bristol Corporation Bill on second Reading would give rise to considerable embarrassment inParliament and the Government might have difficulty in securing amajority. The decision would be regarded as an example of the&quot;Whitehall knows best&quot; attitude towards a project on which thepeople of Bristol were prepared to risk their own money. It wouldbe a serious blow to regional planning and would almost certainly lead to resignations from the Economic Planning Council. It was unreasonable to prevent the local interests concerned from carrying through a project of this kind while less desirable projects in theprivate sector, such as the Brighton Marina, which involved equallyheavy calls on national resources, were allowed to proceed withoutchallenge.
On the other hand, it was strongly argued that to allow thescheme to go through would involve a gross misuse of national resources. The full cost of the project would in one way or anotherhave to be met from public funds; it represented an addition to public borrowing and expenditure and to the public sector&apos;s claim on resources. No provision had been made for it in the public expenditure Survey and if it were allowed to go ahead theexpenditure would need to be offset by savings on other transportprojects for which there was greater economic justification. Thedevelopment of major ports, which the Government were committed to nationalise, must be planned on a national basis and the port facilities within the Severn estuary should be considered together.There was surplus capacity in the South Wales ports, which were linked to Bristol by the Severn bridge, and a decision to go ahead with the West Dock would prejudice future development in SouthWales which already faced growing unemployment problems.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that themajority of the Cabinet favoured outright rejection of the BristolWest Dock. The Minister of Transport should announce theGovernments attitude to the project before the debate on the SecondReading of the Bristol Corporation Bill and it was possible that the promoters of the Bill might decide not to proceed with it.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Transport to announce, before the debate on the Second Reading of the Bristol CorporationBill, that the Government were not prepared to allow theWest Dock scheme to proceed.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.4th July, 1968.
