CC 2 (68)secret the Cabinet resumed their discussion of the post-devaluationmeasures proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in C (68) 5.The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the First Secretaryof State (C (68) 1) on the consequences of devaluation in the field of social security.The Minister of Social Security said that an increase ofsupplementary benefits would be required in the autumn or earlywinter of 1968 but the amount of the increase should be determinedlater. It would be preferable, however, not to specify a date forthe increase in supplementary benefits in the Governmenfsstatement on their economic measures but to say only that theywould be increased at the right time.In discussion it was suggested that some more specific indication of the timing of the increase would assist in maintaining the incomes policy; if no indication were given the Government would be questioned on their intentions. There was general agreement thatthe statement on the Governmenfs economic measures should include a reference to the increase in supplementary benefits in theautumn of 1967 and should say that these benefits would be further increased in the autumn of 1968.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that supplementary benefits should be increased inthe autumn or early winter of 1968 and that the statement on the Governmenfs economic measures should say thatsupplementary benefits would be further increased in theautumn of 1968.The Minister of Social Security said that she accepted that national Insurance benefits should not be increased before October1969 but this should not be announced now, because there would be pressure to advance the date. She also agreed that the standardof living of National Insurance beneficiaries should not be improved in this period as compared with that of the working population generally. But it would be unwise to announce now thatthe increase of National Insurance benefits would be related to themovement of prices instead of earnings. This would create pressure for a benefit increase early in 1969 when the rise in prices wouldbe likely to exceed the value of the recent increases in benefit.Moreover, the basis of previous benefit increases was not generallyunderstood, and to announce now that the next increase would be related to the movement of prices might be taken as meaning that
there would be no reduction of expenditure in this field. TheGovernments statement of their economic measures should thereforesay only that National Insurance beneficiaries could be given no increase in their standard of living as compared with that of theworking population. It was desirable to preserve the maximumflexibility in this way, because of uncertainties as to the futuremovement of prices and earnings.In discussion, while there was general agreement that benefits should not be increased before the autumn of 1969 and that theincrease should be related to the movement of prices, it wasquestioned whether, in view of the recent increase, it was necessaryto make any public reference to a further increase of benefitstwo years ahead. It was pointed out, however, that unless somespecific indication were given of a restriction on the next benefitincrease, credit could not be claimed for the resultant saving. Tosay no more than that benefits would be increased in two years&apos;time and would take account of the movement of prices might betaken as an indication that there was no change of policy and asover-generous. But if the statement said explicitly that benefit increases would be related strictly to prices, this treatment ofexisting pensioners would be difficult to reconcile with the treatmentof future pensioners that would be promised in the White Paper on earnings-related pensions which it was planned to publish later inthe year.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet were agreed that National Insurance benefits should not be increased before the autumn of 1969 and that theincrease should be related to the movement of prices. TheGovernments statement on the economic measures might be on thelines that benefits would be increased in two years&apos; time and wouldenable the increase in prices over that period to be dealt with, butthat the standard of living of those on benefit would not be allowedto improve relative to that of the working population. The precise form of the statement, which should enable a saving of  35 million to be claimed, should be considered further by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, in consultation with the Minister of Social Security,in the light of the Cabinets discussion.The Cabinet (2) Agreed that National Insurance benefits should not beincreased before the autumn of 1969 and that the increase should be related to the movement of prices since theprevious increase.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer in consultationwith the Minister of Social Security, to consider theterms in which this decision might be reflected in theannouncement of the Governments economic measuresso as to indicate a saving of  35 million in accordancewith the summing up of their discussion by the PrimeMinister.
The Minister of Social Security said that she accepted that thebenefit of the 7s. increase in family allowances which would take effect in April should if possible be confined, by means of taxadjustments, to families with low incomes and that this principle should in due course be extended to the whole family allowance.A further increase of about 3s. a week would be needed in theautumn, however, if the Government were to fulfil their specificcommitment to protect families with very low incomes against theeffect of devaluation. The increase in supplementary benefits wouldnot help those with low earnings and those affected by the wagestop. The purchasing power of earnings of  12 per week would fall by 7s. and men with low earnings were commonly inemployments in which it was difficult for them to increase their earnings or suffered from physical or mental disabilities. the poorest families could not be helped by extension of the rate rebatescheme, which was not designed for this purpose. Such familiescould be helped selectively only by means of an increase in family allowances combined with compensating tax adjustments to offset the benefit to the wealthier families. By this means the cost of a3s. increase in family allowances wpuld be reduced from  35 million to  9 million a year.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that adjustment of tax allowances would not reduce the cost of any family allowanceincrease as reflected in the Estimates. In view of the rise in theforthcoming Estimates for 1968-69, and in particular of the risein the Family Allowance Estimate in consequence of the increasealready given, he could not accept that there should be any further improvement in family allowances. It would not be practicable inthe coming year to introduce any scheme of options which might reduce the cost of any further family allowance increase falling onthe Estimates although he was considering this possibility for the longer-term. If any increase in family allowances was considered essential it could only be given on a means-tested basis. Thestatement on the Governments economic measures should say that consideration was being given to the possibility of introducingselectivity into the coming 7s. increase and subsequently into thepayment of the whole family allowance. He would be prepared toconsider incorporating into the supplementary benefit scheme a3s. child&apos;s allowance which might be paid, subject to means test,notwithstanding that the father was in full-time work; this, if practicable, would be an interim measure pending the reshaping ofthe Family Allowance scheme on more selective lines and could be announced in the Budget.In discussion it was suggested that, while some of the objectionof principle which the Cabinet had previously seen in the applicationof a means test to family allowances might be removed if it wereplainly only an interim measure, it would be unduly expensive toset up the necessary additional administrative machinery temporarily.It was also suggested that alternative means of helping the poorestfamilies might be identified in the Cabinefs subsequent considerationof expenditure on other services.
RateRebates(previous reference:CC (67) 67thConclusions,Minute 4)postponement of the raising of the school leaving age(previous reference:CC (67) 68thConclusions,Minute 3)The Cabinet-(4) Agreed to resume their consideration of family allowances in the light of their subsequent discussion of expenditureon other services.The First Secretary of State said that it would be desirable toincrease the income limits for rate rebate to take account of changesin earnings and prices since the scheme was introduced. Theoriginal scope of the scheme would be restored if the income limitapplicable to single and married householders were increased by 1 a week in each case. The allowances for children should beincreased by either 10s. or  1 bringing the additional cost to 7-5 million or  10-4 million in a full year.The Cabinet-(5) Agreed to consider rate rebates when they resumed their discussion of family allowances in accordance with conclusion (4).The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the First Secretaryof State (C (68) 2), to which was annexed a memorandum on the postponement of the raising of the school leaving age.The Secretary of State for Education and Science recalled thatthe Government were at present committed to raising the school leaving age from 15 to 16 in 1970-71. Deferment for three years would release to the labour market an additional 400,000 15-year-oldsat a time when the working population was expected otherwise tobe virtually static and there was likely to be a large demand formanpower. Deferment would also postpone the temporarydeterioration in the pupil-teacher ratio and in the problem of accommodation that would otherwise occur. On the other hand,raising the age would have less effect on the productive potential of the economy than on the total numbers in employment, since15-year-olds were less productive than the average worker.Moreover, the places in which voluntary staying on at school beyond15 was least marked were the development areas and areas of high unemployment. In the long run raising the age would help toproduce a better-educated working population. There was amarked difference in voluntary staying on after 15 as betweenincome groups, and as between the North of England and the South;deferment would prolong these social and geographical differencesand would leave the less well-off areas with a less well educatedlabour force. There were therefore strong social and economic arguments against deferment to balance against the savings thatwould accrue. The plans for raising the age were closely connectedwith those for comprehensive reorganisation, and the effect of deferment on the latter could be very marked after the first year;while the Chancellor of the Exchequer proposed offsetting additional expenditure of  3 million in 1968-69 and  8 million in the next two years to ensure that policies on comprehensive reorganisation and for the relief of the educationally deprived areas could proceed,it was likely in practice that the whole of this sum would be directed to comprehensive reorganisation.
While educational opinion was divided on the issue, and therewas some expectation that raising the age would be deferred, itwas desirable to examine the possibilities of achieving comparablesaving by alternative methods. He had proposed a cut of 50 per centin the cost-of-living increase due in the autumn of 1968 in studentawards, which would save about  4 million; the Chancellor of theExchequer had included this among his present proposals, but ifthe increase were totally withheld there would be a saving of some 8 million in the first year and  12 million in the next two years.There were also possibilities of further savings of universityexpenditure, but it was unlikely that substantial savings could beachieved on capital account; as regards current expenditure, a newquinquennial agreement had recently been made and there wouldbe strong criticism if this agreement were to be broken. It had tobe borne in mind, however, that if the rate support grant were alsoreduced as the Chancellor of the Exchequer proposed, this toowould result in further restrictions on educational expenditure.In discussion it was suggested that deferment raised important issues of principle and social justice, since the different educationalopportunities available to the children of the middle class and ofmanual workers respectively were the main source of class division.It would be wrong for 400,000 children a year to be deprived of educational opportunity which should be available to all. Further,unless the leaving age were raised there was likely to be a shortage in industry of workers with middle-range ability. It was essential,for economic reasons, that industry should secure better educatedyoung entrants; this would, for example, enable major improvements to be made in apprenticeship schemes. Unemployment had been shown to be related to the time spent at school, and over the next20-30 years there was likely to be substantial redundancy in the unskilled labour group. The starting date 1970-71 had been proposed after a full study of its practical implications. Because inthe next decade the school population would rise, this was the most favourable year from the point of view of the pupil-teacher ratio;deferment would only postpone and increase the practical difficulties.If a decision to defer were taken, it would be difficult subsequently to establish a firm starting date. It was pointed out that raising theage had had the support of all parties and to defer the date wouldbe strongly criticised by progressive educational opinion. Providedthat alternative compensating savings could be found, raising the again 1970-71 was unlikely to affect confidence in the Governmenfseconomic measures, and indeed could be presented as beneficial tothe country&apos;s economy. It was therefore suggested that the possibility should be explored of achieving comparable savings either outsidethe educational service or elsewhere within it, and in the field of university expenditure and research in particular. The recent increase in the number of arts students, the scale of research projects and of post-graduate grants were all calculated to divert graduatesaway from industry. Even if fewer university places were thenavailable, this would be preferable to deferment of raising the
OtherExpenditureon Education(previous reference:CC (67) 67thConclusions,Minute 4)leaving age and so depriving 15-year olds of educational opportunity,since places would be available in colleges of further education andteacher training colleges for those who would have otherwise gone to a university. Financial provision for university education was now out of scale with provision for schools. Additionally, it wassuggested that there would be advantage in replacing student grantsby loans; in reducing the support given to direct grant schools; andin abolishing the tax reliefs that could be claimed for educationalexpenditure.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the issue was oneof the limited deferment, and not of the abandonment of the raising of the age. Adherence to 1970-71 would create shortages of accommodation and of teachers in some areas which, combined with the element of compulsion involved, would substantially reducethe initial educational value of the change. It was suggested that expenditure on educational priority areas, on comprehensivereorganisation, and on teacher training was of greater importance than the leaving age in achieving educational equality, and thatincreasing numbers of children were remaining at school voluntarilybeyond age 15. Additional possibilities of achieving comparablefurther savings elsewhere in the field of education, includinguniversity expenditure, had been explored, but were not to be found.There was a risk that the total public expenditure saving nowproposed might be too low in the present economic situation, and itwas important not to reduce it. It was suggested that deferment couldnot be avoided if the educational service was to make its appropriatecontribution to the total saving, in the light of the reduction in expenditure that was being sought elsewhere in the social services.The deferment should, however, be limited to two years and shouldb&quot; accompanied by a firm commitment that no further deferment\   aid be made.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet were reluctant, on grounds of social justice, to deferraising the leaving age. However, for reasons of economic necessity,and in the absence of any prospect of securing alternative additional savings of the same order elsewhere in the educational or other services, there was a balance of view in favour of deferment by two years, subject to a firm public undertaking that there would beno further postponement.The Cabinet (6) Agreed that the raising of the school leaving age should be deferred for two years from 1970-71.In discussion of means of reducing educational expenditureother than by the deferment of raising the school leaving age, it wassuggested that a reduction in the sums made available for post-graduate research would reduce the tendency of the universitiesto retain graduates who were needed in industry.The Cabinet (7) Agreed that free milk should be withdrawn from secondary schools with effect from September 1968.
b(8) Agreed that reductions in planned capital expenditure, inEngland and Wales but not in Scotland, for further education, libraries and the Youth Service should bemade on the scale proposed.(9) Agreed that the cost of living increase for student awards,due in September 1968, should compensate for only50 per cent of the rise in the cost of living.(10) Agreed to consider further, at the same time as they considered again the proposals relating to family allowances, the proposal to increase the price of school meals by a further 6d. in April 1969.(11) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretaryof State for Education to consider ways and means of saving a further  10 million a year on university (includingstudent and research grants) and Research Councilsexpenditure.The Minister of Health said that in his opinion the cut proposedby the Chancellor of the Exchequer was disproportionately high.The proposed increase for health and welfare expenditure in 1968-69over 1967-68 was only 4 per cent in real terms, which was substantially less than that for most of the other major programmes.Nevertheless he was reluctantly prepared to accept a cut of theorder proposed although he disagreed with the method suggested:the saving of some  50 million on doctors&apos; prescriptions. Therejntroduction of prescription charges was a tax on the sick, imposedwhen they were least able to bear it. The limited exemptionsproposed by the Chancellor for those on supplementary benefits,those with incomes at or below supplementary benefit level and war pensioners in respect of their disabilities were those given whenprescription charges were last made. They did not however go wide enough to cover many categories of patients who would be seriously affected but, as the previous Government had discovered, there were serious practical difficulties in the way of extending&apos;the scope ofthese extensions. The doctors had been unwilling to co-operate inthe past in such an extension and would probably be equallyunwilling now. Any widespread scheme of exemption would in any event require substantial additional staff to administer. although he thought it might be possible to find some means now ofexempting those over 65, this would still leave the chronic sick andchildren subject to prescription charges. In any event there were serious objections in principle to a general reintroduction ofprescription charges which discouraged the sick from seeing theirdoctors without necessarily discouraging the irresponsible, and whichonce reimposed would be very difficult to remove again.He suggested therefore that instead of reintroducingprescription charges they should raise the sum required by increasingthe health service contribution which had remained unchanged since1961 at 3s. 4d. a week. An increase of Is. a week would produce the  50 million a year for which the Chancellor had asked.   His
proposal would have the additional advantage that, since children,chronic sick and the elderly did not in any event pay this contribution, it would not be necessary to exempt them. Theproposal involved no additional work and therefore no additional staff. It had been argued that unless prescription charges werereintroduced the credibility of the Chancellor^ whole package of measures would be in danger. In his opinion this demonstrated a failure on the part of the Government to defend their policiesvigorously enough over the last three years and they should not takethe wrong measures now simply for presentational reasons. Theyshould not forget that the Government had very recently given a pledge that the most vulnerable sections of the community would be protected from the aftermath of devaluation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the reintroduction of prescription charges had, rightly or wrongly, come to be regardedas a symbol at home and abroad of the governments determination to take all the measures required to restore the economy. Failure to introduce prescription charges now would therefore undoubtedly affect confidence. But in any event theproposal put forward by the Minister of Health amounted to additional taxation and would thus reduce taxable capacity in a way which reintroduction of the prescription charge would not. Hecould not afford the reduction in taxable capacity on this scale atthis time. He had however offered to examine with the Minister ofHealth whether it was administratively practicable to give additionalexemptions costing  15 million a year. They had come to theconclusion after careful examination that this was not practicable in the short term, that is, in time to reintroduce prescription charges in the spring as required. But it might be possible to make widerexemptions in the longer term and, once the scheme on the lines he proposed had been introduced, he was ready to examine further with the Minister of Health the possibility of amending it to extendexemptions at a later date. While he recognised that there introduction of charges would bear hardly on some people therewas no doubt that free prescriptions had led to considerable wastageand some of the saving of  50 million expected would come froma reduction in the amount of medicines prescribed. Finally, he pointed out that he was seeking no contribution at all in the formof cuts in the hospital building programme.In discussion it was urged that while it might well be necessaryin present circumstances to reintroduce prescription charges, thescheme should be more selective than that proposed by theChancellor. The general principle should be that those at work should pay for their medicine while the chronic sick, the retired,expectant mothers and children should not. Doctors should have little difficulty in recognising these additional exempt categories anda special prescription form might be provided for them on whichchemists would make no charge. The reduced saving could be made good by a smaller increase in the health service contribution thanthat proposed by the Minister of Health. It would be necessary to rely on the co-operation and honesty of the doctors but sample
investigations could be carried out to check abuse without additional staff beyond the 250 required to administer the exemptions proposedin the Chancellors scheme.On the other hand it was argued that past experience had shown that the doctors would not willingly co-operate in a massiveexemption scheme of this kind and would resolve their difficulties with their patients, if it were introduced, by exempting wherever possible. In any event it would be extremely difficult to define the chronic sick satisfactorily for this purpose. For example, shoulddiabetics who were regularly taking drugs and continuing at workbe treated as chronic sick? Married women, including many ofthose gainfully employed, did not pay the health service contribution,but if qualified as chronic sick might nevertheless be automaticallyexempted from paying prescription charges which they might wellbe able to afford. The general public were now ready to acceptfar-reaching and severe economic measures, and the reintroduction of prescription charges would not be generally unwelcome; and weshould bear in mind that while we were living on foreign credit wewere in no position to ignore the views of our creditors. a compromise on the lines which had been suggested in discussion widespread exemption financed by an increase in the health service contribution would be more unpopular than the original proposal.It would also pre-empt substantial taxable capacity at a time whenthe Chancellor would find it difficult to raise additional revenue onthe scale required.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that there should be a further examination of the compromise solution on the lines discussed. The compromise would involve theintroduction of a prescription charge of 2s. 6d. an item with theexemptions already proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.But the elderly, children, expectant mothers and, if feasible, the chronic sick would also be exempted. The cost of these additionalexemptions would be made good by an addition of say, 6d. a week in the employee^ health service contribution. The Chancellor andthe other Ministers concerned should examine the feasibility and cost of a compromise on the above lines and report back to theCabinet to enable them to give further consideration to the matter at their meeting on Thursday, 11th January. There was generalagreement with the Chancellors other proposals relating to health and welfare, subject to further examination by the Chancellor andthe Minister of Health of the advisability of holding down local health and welfare expenditure on capital account by about 12 million instead of  20 million between 1968-69 and 1970-71 asproposed by the Chancellor.The Cabinet (12) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Minister of Health and the Minister of social security, to examine the compromise solution in respectof prescription charges, outlined in the Prime Ministers
summing up, and to report on it in time to enable theCabinet to consider the matter further at their meetingon Thursday, 11th January.(13) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerof Health to examine further and, if possible, reach agreement on the extent to which capital expenditure on local health and welfare should be held down between1968-69 and 1970-71.(14) Approved the proposal to increase dental charges to 30s.per treatment.The Minister of Housing said that the Government were deeply committed to the target of 500,000 houses in 1970, and there hadbeen a good prospect that this target would be achieved until the reductions in the housing programme which had been agreed aspart of the Governments review of public expenditure in July 1967.The further reductions now proposed would mean that the targetcould not be achieved: if they were implemented, housingcompletions in the public sector in Great Britain would be unlikely to exceed 210,000 in 1970, and the total of completions in both public and private sectors, and including Northern Ireland, wouldprobably be about 430,000 to 440,000. He would have preferred a smaller reduction than that proposed in 1969-70; however, subjectto decisions on the rest of the package, he was prepared to acceptthe reductions proposed.If the reductions were agreed, there were a number of important points affecting presentation: the Government should not commit themselves to a revised housing target for 1970; they should make clear their intention to protect the priority areas from the effects ofthe cuts; and they should stress the fact that we were now movinginto a period where, because of the developing excess of householdsover houses, it would be right to switch the emphasis of theprogramme from the building of new houses to the improvement ofthe existing stock.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that it would be wrong to expect savings comparable to those proposed in England andWales to be secured in Scotland by administrative means. Eighty percent of houses built in Scotland were provided by local authorities a much higher proportion than in England and Wales and accordingly a comparable reduction in the public sector programme would mean a more severe reduction in Scotland in terms of totalhousing output.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he agreed that theGovernment should announce their intention to switch the emphasisof housing policy outside the priority areas from new building torepairs and improvements, but it should be understood that any increase in expenditure on the latter should be balanced by corresponding reductions in expenditure elsewhere in the housingfield.In discussion it was argued that the proposed cuts in theprogramme for England and Wales represented the maximum which
could be reasonably imposed, bearing in mind that there were stillsome If million houses in the slum category. The rate of expansion in the construction industry was very sensitive to changes in thehousing programme and if the industry were given the impression that there were to be widespread and severe reductions, there couldbe a considerable loss of confidence leading possibly to unemploymentin the industry. On the other hand, it was argued that if present plans were adhered to, housing expenditure would be increasingmuch faster than expenditure on other social services at a time when we were moving into a period of housing surplus. There was a danger that over the next two years the construction industry wouldbecome overloaded as industrial investment recovered. Accordingly,the implications of a bigger reduction in approvals than that proposed for example, by an additional 5,000 should be examined.As regards Scotland, there was support for the view that a smaller reduction would be justified; but if Scotland were to be givenmore lenient treatment, it would be necessary also to considerwhether this should be extended to development areas in the restof Great Britain.There was general agreement that in presenting theGovernments decision, emphasis should be laid on the points referred to by the Minister of Housing. In particular, theGovernment should make it clear that the priority areas would besheltered from the effects of the cuts to the maximum possible extent. It seemed likely that some of the local authorities in these areas, especially where there had recently been a change in political control, would in any case cut back their programmes: but it was right that if they did so, the responsibility should be seen to betheirs and not the Govern ment&apos;s.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet agreed that reductions should be made in thehousing programme for England and Wales not less than those proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer; but the implications of a further reduction of 5,000 approvals should be examined. since a comparable cut in public sector approvals would bear more heavily on total housing output in Scotland than in England andWales, the case for reductions in the programme for Scotland shouldbe considered further, together with the position in development areas in the rest of Great Britain.The Cabinet-(15) Agreed that reductions should be made in local authority housing approvals in England and Wales in 1968 and1969 not less than those proposed in C (68) 5.(16) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Ministerof Housing, to report to the Cabinet in the following week on (i) the implications of reducing housing approvals inEngland and Wales by a further 5,000; and
Concorde(previous reference:CC (66) 39thConclusions,Minute 4)(ii) the extent to which reductions should be sought inthe housing programme for Scotland and for development areas in the rest of Great Britain,taking account of the points made in discussion.The Foreign Secretary said that a group of Ministers under his chairmanship had considered the case for withdrawing from the concorde aircraft project. They had before them the memorandumby the Minister of Technology and the report by officials which were attached to C (68) 4. There were at present no grounds on whichthe Government could legally terminate the treaty which governedtheir participation in the project. If nevertheless we were toabrogate the treaty unilaterally, the French Government would beable to bring an action before the International Court who could beexpected to award damages against us which might amount to asmuch as  200 million. We should also have to pay cancellationcharges amounting to some  50 million to the British firms involvedin the project. This nugatory expenditure would probably wipe outthe savings to the Exchequer from cancellation which might be ofthe order of  200 million. If we continued with the project untilthe spring or early summer of 1969, there might then be anopportunity of abandoning it without risking liability for damages,if the technical problems proved to be so great as to make theaircraft virtually unsaleable: it would be clear by that time whetheror not this was the case. Meanwhile, however, the Governmentwould have spent a further  100 million on development and production, and would still incur cancellation charges of  50 million to British firms.Against this background, his colleagues had not been able toreach agreement on the course the Government should follow. Somefelt that, given the amount of damages for which we should be at risk, the impact of unilateral abrogation of the treaty on our international standing and the effects of cancellation on our positionas an advanced industrial Power, it would be wrong to withdraw atthis stage and we should continue at least until the spring or early summer of 1969. Other Ministers felt that we should be justifiedin withdrawing now, given the virtual certainty that the costs of the project would escalate further, the overriding need for savings in thenext two years, and the fact that cancellation would undoubtedlysecure substantial savings in those years whereas it would probablybe three years before we had to pay any damages.It had been suggested that we might seek to mitigate theamount of damages which would be awarded against us by offeringtechnical assistance and facilities to the French if they wished tocarry on alone. His own view, however, was that it would be unacceptable to opinion in this country to make any such offer.Since his discussion with the Ministers concerned, he had obtained the views of our overseas posts on the likely reaction toour unilateral abrogation of the treaty by the Governments of theEuropean Economic Community (e.c.) other than the French.The view of our representatives was that the Governments of theFive, with one exception, would be likely to react adversely: they
would probably interpret our action as being motivated mainly bypique at the French veto of our application to join the e.c. andas a sign that we were no longer seriously interested in Europeancollaboration in the technological field.The Attorney-General confirmed that there were no legalgrounds on which we could terminate the treaty at the present time.If we were not prepared to offer assistance to the French to help them to complete the project alone, we could. not expect anymitigation of the amount of damages which would be awardedagainst us. If on the other hand we continued until 1969 and it became clear by that time that the project was not likely to becommercially viable, this would provide us with legal grounds forabrogating the treaty; and if in those circumstances we were towithdraw unilaterally the Court would be likely to find in our favour.In the light of these considerations, his advice as lawyer to clientwould be against cancellation at the present time.The Minister of Technology said that he was opposed tocancellation now, not only because of the political and financial implications, but also because of the consequences for the airframeand aero-engine industries. By the spring or early summer of 1969,it would be clear whether the technical problems had been sufficiently overcome to make the project viable and this would be reflected in the extent to which the airlines were prepared at thattime to place firm orders for Concorde. The right course was for him to hold discussions now with the French authorities with theobject of laying down conditions which would have to be fulfilled ifwe were to continue with the project after the spring or early summer of 1969. These conditions should be expressed in termsof a minimum number of firm orders for the aircraft. If theFrench Government agreed to such conditions, but when the time came were not prepared to abide by them, it should then bepossible for us to abrogate the treaty unilaterally without riskingthe award of damages against us. If the French declined to acceptthe conditions in the first place, he would still recommend that weshould withdraw in 1969 if the conditions were not met, and the factthat the French had declined to accept such conditions should thentell in our favour in any legal proceedings.In discussion it was argued that the estimates in C (68) 4 ofthe additional expenditure which the Government would incur ifthe project continued for a further 18 months were almost certainlytoo low. Moreover, it was unlikely that it would be possible in1969 to demonstrate conclusively that the technical problems were such as to render the project no longer viable: it would always be urged that, given more time and money, the technical problemscould be overcome. On the other hand, if we cancelled now weshould be securing savings in the short term which would be offsetin later years by payment of damages: this would simply be tantamount to raising a forced loan from the French. That was anunattractive prospect, and the Government should not put itself in
Procedure(previous reference:CC (68) 1stConclusions,Minute 2)the position of being held accountable for payment of heavydamages across the exchanges in 1970 or 1971. As regards the objection that we should be told in 1969 that any outstandingtechnical problems could be overcome given more time and money,this would lose its force if conditions for the continuance of the project could be established on the lines proposed by the Ministerof Technology: any substantial delays to deal with technical difficulties would progressively reduce the lead which Concorde was now expected to have over the American supersonic transport, andthis would be reflected in a reduction in the number of firm ordersfor Concorde; if this went far enough, the conditions for continuing the project would not be met and we should have a clear case for withdrawal.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said the Cabinet agreed that we should not at this stage unilaterallyabrogate the treaty governing the Concorde project. The Ministerof Technology should consider with the Attorney-General the drafting of conditions, preferably to be expressed in terms of aminimum number of firm orders for Concorde, which should be metif we were to continue with the project beyond the spring or early summer of 1969; this should be the subject of early discussion withthe French.The Cabinet (17) Agreed that the Government should not at this stagewithdraw from the Concorde project.(18) Invited the Minister of Technology to consider, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the attorney-General and other Ministers concerned, what conditions we should seek to agree with the FrenchGovernment for continuance of the project beyond the spring or early summer of 1969.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet should resume their discussion of measures to restrain public expenditure in the civilfield on the afternoon of Tuesday, 9th January, when they shouldalso complete their discussion of family allowances. They should consider the measures as a whole, including those relating to defence,on the afternoon of Friday, 12th January, by which time the foreign secretary, who had been able to rearrange the timetable of his consultations overseas, would have returned to London.The Cabinet (19) Agreed to continue their discussions on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,8th January, 1968.
