LegislationCommonwealthImmigration(previous reference:CC(68) 14thConclusions,Minute 2)8801CONFIDENTIAL1. The Home Secretary said that he was under pressure inParliament to introduce legislation immediately to implement therecommendations of the Departmental Committee on immigration appeals under the chairmanship of Sir Roy Wilson. He was prepared in principle to introduce an appeal system, but it would be impracticable to legislate in the current Session, and, apart from theneed to defer a measure which would necessitate an appreciableexpenditure of money and manpower, some time would be neededafter the passage of legislation to bring the appeals machinery intooperation. He proposed, however, to say in the debates on theCommonwealth Immigrants Bill that during the period before a formal appeal system could be introduced he would send twoexperienced lawyers to Kenya to hear appeals against refusal of anentry certificate on the grounds that the applicant was not entitledto come in otherwise than on the quota, for example as a dependentor a student, and he would undertake to consider himself bound bythe appeal team&apos;s decision.In discussion it was suggested that it would make a substantialdifference to the feeling in the House of Commons if the legislationconferring a right of appeal could be introduced in the current session; but the House of Commons had been told that neither thestaff nor the funds were available for the immediate introduction ofan appeal system, and to promise legislation now would appear tobe a reversal, under pressure, of a measure of postponement whichthe Government had considered necessary on economic grounds.Moreover, there was reason to think that some of the critics of theCommonwealth Immigrants Bill would be satisfied with a promise tointroduce legislation on appeals as soon as possible. The content ofthe legislative programme for 1968-69 had still to be considered by theFuture Legislation Committee, but when the legislation on appealshad been deferred from the current Session there had been no reasonto think that it could not be accommodated in the programme for1968-69.In further discussion it was suggested that there was anxietyamong Asians in East Africa outside Kenya lest the proposed quota of 1,500 should not be open to them, and it might be desirable for the appeal team to visit centres outside Kenya. In view of complaintsthat the proposed quota for Asians from East Africa was too small,it might also help to allay criticism if the Government could undertakeat once to increase the number; but no figure was specified in the bill and it could be made clear that the total would be kept under review.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Home Secretary should announce in the debates on the Commonwealth Immigrants Bill that the government intended to introduce early legislation to give immigrants a right ofappeal against refusal of entry to this country, and that in themeantime he was arranging for experienced lawyers to hear appealsinformally in East Africa.  He should explain that, in view of the
pressure on the current Session&apos;s legislative timetable, it was not practicable to introduce the Bill in the present Session, but should refrain from giving an explicit undertaking in respect of next Sessionwhich would anticipate The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening ofParliament. The Home Secretary should consider, in consultationwith the Commonwealth Secretary, what arrangements might bemade for the informal appeals team to consider appeals from Asiansresident in East Africa elsewhere than in Kenya.The Cabinet-Invited the Home Secretary (i) to deal with the question of legislation to implement the report of the Committee on immigration appeals on the lines indicated in the PrimeMinister^ summing up;(ii) to consider, in consultation with the Common-wealth Secretary, interim arrangements forhearing appeals in East Africa from Asiansoutside Kenya.Foreign PolicyGeneral(previous reference:CC (68) 9thConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Cabinet considered a note by the Foreign Secretary towhich was attached a paper on foreign policy (C (68) 42).The Foreign Secretary said that the paper was designed to serve as the basis for the reassessment of our external position and policy for which the Cabinet had called at their meeting on 18th January.Part I of the paper suggested that the decisions which had alreadybeen taken in particular the decision to withdraw from East of Suezby the end of 1971 had gone far to shape the options open to theUnited Kingdom and to direct us towards a Europe-based policy.The paper pointed out that nevertheless there would be serious risks to our national interest round the world as a consequence of our withdrawal, and that for example the Soviet Union might inconsequence gain indirect control of the Middle East oil supplies tothe West. In order to continue to defend our many intereststhroughout the world to the best of our ability we needed now tomaintain and extend our existing political and economic links withthe Commonwealth and other countries and use all non-militarymeans open to us to build up a stronger British influence. But, forthe longer term, we should aim to become part of a more cohesiveWestern Europe which would provide a power structure able to exertworld-wide influence in defence of its interests. Part II of the paperconsidered three possible variants of such a Europe-based policy.The alternatives of attempting indefinitely to &quot; go it alone &quot; or tobecome part of a cohesive Western Europe which sought to hold thebalance, as a third force, between the United States and the soviet union, held no attractions, since neither offered a real prospect of jgiving the United Kingdom the opportunity of influencing future jworld developments or of protecting its world-wide interests. thus the logic of events presented us with no satisfactory alternative policy to seeking to play an influential part, as soon as we could, in a j
CC 15 (68)cohesive Western European grouping, acting generally in harmony with the United States. If this were our agreed objective we mustmeanwhile prevent as far as we were able the existing european economic Community (e.c.) from developing in directions whichwould make it more difficult if not impossible for us eventually tojoin it. The next tactical moves in our relations with Europe were considered in other papers before the Cabinet, notably C (68) 43which discussed the Franco-German Declaration and the benelux proposals and proceeded on the basis that our eventual objective wasthat which he had just stated.The Defence Secretary said that in general he agreed with thepaper&apos;s conclusions, and in particular that our policy must beEurope-based, though in his view it was necessary to consider more closely what should be our objectives in that part of the Northernhemisphere from the United States to the Soviet Union which,following the Cabinefs decisions in January, would become our mainarea of interest, and how East-West relations might best be improvedso as to give us the maximum security at the lowest cost. Our primeobjectives should be to sustain economic growth in the UnitedKingdom comparable to that of our European neighbours, and toreduce the future cost of European defence. To these ends we needed to examine carefully what would be the best balance of our politicaland economic relations with the member States of the European free trade Association and with the countries of Eastern European as wellas with the members of e.c.. In this context we should take intoaccount the substantial reduction in Russian power and influence over Rumania and other Eastern European countries. Finally, wehad to consider what sort of relations between Europe and the UnitedStates were best calculated to lead to a satisfactory settlement of theproblem of European security. It would be premature at this stage to take decisions on these questions, but careful thought should begiven to them. We had hitherto been too much concerned with our desire to join the e.c.: the economic relations between its members would, he thought, prevent its development into a power structurethrough which we could influence world affairs. We should thereforepay more attention to our long-term objectives, and less to theproblems of entry to the e.c., which should be regarded as one means to the attainment of these objectives.In discussion the general view was that the broad lines of the analysis of our external position and prospects put forward in theForeign Secretary&apos;s memorandum were acceptable. The course ofevents culminating in the Cabinet&apos;s recent decision to accelerate our withdrawal from the Near and Middle East pointed clearly to theneed for us to regard ourselves as a Europe-based Power, and as suchconcerned with the development of political stability and economic progress on both sides of the North Atlantic Ocean. It must,however, be recognised that for the immediate future, and particularlywhile we were excluded from participation in a wider Europeangrouping, the recovery of our economic strength and stability, and
consequently the pursuit of our national interest to that end, must take first priority. We still retained, however, substantial and widespread interests in other parts of the world, despite thecontraction of our military presence there, and the measures to betaken to maintain and enhance our influence throughout the worldby non-military means therefore required urgent consideration. Thisshould cover the possibilities open to us in all possible fields, includingcommercial, cultural and aid activities, the pursuit of a more positivepolicy in support of the peace-keeping role of the United Nations,and the development of world economic co-operation through theUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development.In further discussion it was urged that United kingdom membership of the e.c. was now blocked for some years and wasnot necessarily the best option open to us. Further consideration was needed of the forms of European and Atlantic association whichwould be most suitable for us in the political, defence and economicfields, more particularly since the Kennedy Round should greatlyreduce the eec&apos;s external tariff wall, which had been a major reasonfor seeking membership of that body. Our failure to make progress towards membership of an enlarged Community carried the risk that,while having none of the advantages of membership for the foreseeable future, we should continually be treated by other countries as if wewere about to join. This would be to the disadvantage of our world-wide trade interests, including notably our trade with the countries of the Commonwealth, the European Free Trade Area (EFTA) and eastern Europe, which it was in our interest to develop.On the other hand it was argued that it would be wrong to allowour exclusion from the e.c. to cause us to take too pessimistic aview of our external situation. There was no serious danger that our friends in the e.c. would allow it to develop in ways disadvantageousto us; and there were pressures within the e.c. which were likely in the foreseeable future to lead to the relaxation of its policies, notably in respect of agriculture and of the Yaounde Convention. Nor was there, as perhaps discussions had shown, any viable alternativegrouping with which we might associate neither EFTA nor theCommonwealth could be sufficiently strengthened for that purpose.It would also be wrong to exaggerate the possibilities of detente withEastern Europe progress towards that goal must inevitably be gradual, and it could not in any event be achieved until a solution hadbeen found to the problem of the division of Germany. It was further pointed out that the memorandum before the Cabinet was not concerned so much with the narrower issue of achieving entry intothe e.c. as with the broader objective of constructing a wider andmore outward-looking Europe of which we should be a part, andwhich would constitute a power structure which would be influentialfor good in world affairs.In further discussion the following additional points were made:(a) In seeking, as was proposed in C (68) 42, to strengthen theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) we must not act in sucha manner as to.reduce our prospects of obtaining satisfactory financial support for the cost of our forces in Europe.
(b) The prospect of a Russian threat to Middle East oil suppliesseemed remote, and any threat was more likely to come from localdisorders after our withdrawal. It was pointed out in this connectionthat we were already encouraging and participating in discussions between the Rulers of the Gulf States to achieve a more suitableorganisation and peaceful atmosphere in that area before our withdrawal in 1971.The Cabinet then turned to consider a note by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, to which was attached a paper on the franco-German Declaration of 16th February and the benelux proposals (C (68) 43), and a further note by the Foreign Secretary towhich was attached a translation of a memorandum by the ItalianGovernment (C (68) 44).The Foreign Secretary said that the papers considered theimmediate tactical situation with which we were faced in Europe.Now the French Government had pronounced a veto on negotiationsfor our entry into the e.c. we had had to recognise that there wasno prospect of United Kingdom membership for some time to come.In these circumstances we had decided not to withdraw our applicationfor membership, but instead to find ways forward either on the basisof acting in concert with the Five member States which had supported our application, or with the Six member States if this couldbe arranged in circumstances in which France could not exercise have to. Our discussions with our friends in Europe had led to the benelux proposals, which provided for consultation and collaborationover a wide area without establishing new institutions which wouldin any way risk disruption of the existing institutions of theCommunity and without inhibiting our own economic development or our trade and political links with other parts of the world; and for collaboration with other European countries, in addition to the applicants for membership of the e.c., notably in the technologicalfield. The Government had decided that these proposals offered thebest prospects of achieving progress and had accordingly welcomedthem. The proposals had since been accepted or welcomed by all governments directly concerned except the French Government,which had been seriously concerned at this development. Accord-ingly, in his recent discussions in Paris with the Federal german chancellor, President de Gaulle had agreed to the Franco-GermanDeclaration with the express intention of avoiding further development of the Benelux proposals. The Declaration itself wasempty and devoid of substance: indeed French government spokesmen had gone out of their way to make clear to the BritishGovernment and to other European Governments that it representedno change whatever in their previous views. The FrenchGovernment had told us that there might be some possibility of a trade arrangement covering industrial products, but only on condition that we were prepared to buy substantial quantities of agricultural products from the Community.He did not believe that the Franco-German Declaration couldbe developed in any satisfactory sense.  Nevertheless, it would be
gravely embarrassing, in our relations with Germany, to reject outof hand the Franco-German Declaration and the prospect of someconsequent trade arrangement. We had accordingly informed theGerman Government that we would be prepared to examine anyconcrete proposals which they were able to put before us. At thesame time we had reminded them that they had earlier stated thatthere was no conflict between the Franco-German Declaration andthe Benelux proposals, and that we assumed therefore that they wouldnot object to work going forward on both simultaneously.Since then the Italian Government had circulated a memorandum which was a very useful initiative. It proposed that at the EECmeeting on 29th February the Six should discuss both the benelux proposals and the Franco-German Declaration; ensure that developments of the Community took account of the views of theapplicant States and vice versa; and promoted a meeting of theForeign Ministers of the Six and the four applicants to agree onprocedures for closer co-operation leading to political and economicunification of Europe. He hoped that after the meeting of the EECon 29th February it might be possible to move forward to consultation between ourselves and other applicant States on the one hand andthe Six or the Five on the other first at expert and later at ministerial level. If, as he hoped, these meetings could be arrangedand could lead to agreement on practical areas for immediateconsultation and collaboration, then progress towards the economicand political development of a cohesive Western Europe could continue even while General de Gaulle continued to deny usmembership of the Community. We had hitherto taken anuncompromising &quot; all or nothing &quot; attitude because, if we had not done so, the progress represented by the Benelux and Italianproposals would not have been achieved. He therefore asked forthe authority of his colleagues to seek to make as much progress aspossible on the lines indicated in the Benelux proposals and theItalian memorandum; and to consider on merits any concreteproposals which might emerge from the Franco-GermanDeclaration of 16th February.In discussion there was general agreement with the foreign secretary&apos;s proposals. It would, however, be necessary to consider our position carefully if the Federal German Government provedunwilling to support the Benelux initiative; it would be important to preserve good relations with that Government, whose co-operation was necessary for us in other fields, notably that of international monetary policy. It would also be important to avoid prejudice tothe unity and stability of EFTA, which was important to us, and whosemember countries, both those which had not applied for membership of the e.c. and those which had, would be anxious to participate inschemes for European collaboration which might arise from the benelux proposals, notably in technological and industrial develop-ment. Moreover, we must be on our guard against being drawn intoarrangements which would be to our disadvantage this would be particularly important in respect of free trade arrangements whichmight arise out of the Franco-German Declaration involving our
purchase of European agricultural surpluses in return for freertrading arrangements in industrial goods.Subject to these provisos, it would be right for the foreign secretary to seek to develop consultation and collaboration with our friends in Europe on the lines he had proposed, and in the light of the outcome of the meeting of the Ministerial Council of the e.c. on29th February at which the Benelux proposals, the Franco-GermanDeclaration, and the Italian memorandum would be considered. Itwould, however, be prudent not to set too high our expectations ofwhat might result from that meeting, since the French Governmenthad been at pains to make clear its hostility to our being drawn intomeaningful consultation and collaboration on a collective basis withthe member countries of the e.c., and the attitude of the Governmentof the Federal German Republic had so far offered little assurance of effective support for our cause. On the other hand, we had torecognise that we were no longer a very great Power, and thisrequired us, while keeping in mind our eventual objectives, to judgeeach situation as it arose, rather than to seek to bring other countries to comply with our wishes.The Cabinet then considered two memoranda by the Minister of technology. Technological collaboration with Europe after the veto(C(68)40) and the European Technological Institute (C(68)41).The Minister of Technology said that, although our proposalsfor technological collaboration with Europe and for the establishmentof a European Technological Community, including a EuropeanInstitute of Technology, had been made by the Prime Minister in his speech at the Guildhall on 13th November, 1967, in the context ofour attempt to enter the e.c., failure of this attempt had not reduced the importance for us and for Europe of moving towards closerscientific and technological collaboration. Unless this was doneeffectively, we could not hope to narrow the technological gap between Europe and the United States and avoid the increasingdominance of European industry by large United States corporations.Although France was against any development that would create newinstitutions, our proposals had aroused much interest among othermembers of the e.c.. But they were not yet fully understood; inparticular there were indications that some European countriesbelieved mistakenly that we were ready to share our industrial secretswith them and that technological progress would best be made bymeans of large projects such as Concorde or the European 300 GeVaccelerator. We should have to make it plain that our willingness toparticipate in bilateral or multilateral projects would depend strictlyon merits in each case, and projects would have to be worthwhile in themselves and involve an area of technology that was itself worthpursuing. Our objective should be to establish on a European basis the means of assessing, in the light of probable European requirements10 years or so ahead, the areas of technology in which firms and governments could most advantageously concentrate their effort andthe social and industrial consequences of the changes that would be
needed. Such assessments were already being made by United Statesindustry and it would be among the main purposes of the proposedEuropean Technological Institute to do the same for Europe. Themain problem in this country and in Europe lay in developing theindustrial base in directions and on a scale that would be competitivewith the United States; and we should pursue policies to this end.This would involve collaboration between employers and trades union in this country and in Europe.In discussion it was argued that any arrangements that weremade for collaboration in research should extend to european countries outside the e.c., in particular Scandinavia, and that itwould be more advantageous for us to concentrate our efforts in this field in the Research Committee of the Organisation for economic co-operation and Development (OECD), which included the UnitedStates, Canada and Japan, than to pursue such collaboration on a european basis only. As regards industry, we had yet to face theproblems created in a democratic society by large industrialcorporations not subject to Government control, and these would bemuch more severe on a European scale. Nevertheless thepreponderant view was that technological collaboration with a strongindustrial bias was an essential part of the development of ourrelations with our friends in Europe; this was also the view of the confederation of British Industry, and there was no reason why weshould not explore its possibilities, including the establishment of a european Technological Institute with our friends in Europe. Thepolicy recommended by the Minister of Technology should thereforebe adopted.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet generally supported the conclusions of the foreign secretary&apos;s paper as a basis for our future policy towards Europe.We could not expect to make much progress towards membership of the e.c. so long as President de Gaulle was in power. But it wasthe view of the Cabinet that we should pursue the Benelux proposals,and welcome the Italian initiative. We should not decline to consider,nor should we set any great hopes on, the Franco-GermanDeclaration of 16th February. However events developed, our first priority must be to build up our own economic strength; and weshould also consider how we might strengthen our influence, in those areas outside Europe from which we had decided to withdrawmilitarily, by non-military means such as economic aid, tradedevelopment, information work and cultural activities. The cabinet also agreed in general with the proposals of the Minister of technology for technological collaboration with other european countries, on the understanding that they would not entailparticipation in uneconomic projects involving large expenditure.The Cabinet -(1) Took note, with approval, and subject to the points made in discussion, of the memorandum on Foreign Policyannexed to the Note by the Foreign Secretary (C (68) 42).(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theCommonwealth   Secretary   and   the   other   Ministers
AircraftjfadustryBristol SiddeleyEnginesLimited(previous reference:CC (67) 16thConclusions,Minute 1)secret. The Minister of Technology said that the Cabinet should be aware that the report of the Committee of Inquiry under thechairmanship of Sir Roy Wilson into the pricing of certain contractsmade with Bristol Siddeley Engines Ltd. during 1959-63 would belaid before Parliament as a Command Paper on the following day.The report stated, in terms, that the conduct of the personsnegotiating the contracts on behalf of the company amounted tointentional misrepresentation by which the negotiators on theGovernment side were deceived. The persons concerned were notnamed, but the occupants of the relevant posts could be identifiedfrom published material. Any references to the report outside theHouse of Commons should therefore be confined to quotation fromthe text of the Command Paper, since statements going beyond this might be actionable. In announcing the publication of the report he proposed to say that the papers had been submitted to the Attorney-General, who had found no grounds for criminal proceedings. Hewould decline, however, to say whether the Government would press for further repayment in respect of the excess charges in view of theconclusion in the report that the repayment of  3 - 96 million obtained in the previous year had itself been based on the fraudulent material.Since then the issue had been complicated by the fact that BristolSiddeley Engines Ltd. had been taken over by Rolls Royce Ltd., towhom the Government were paying a subsidy in respect of thedevelopment of engines for the Airbus.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Minister of Technology.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,27th February, 1968.principally concerned, to arrange for the preparation and consideration by the Defence and Oversea PolicyCommittee, of a memorandum examining the non-militarymeans by which our influence might be maintained and strengthened in those areas outside Europe from whichwe had decided to withdraw our forces.(3) Invited the Minister of Technology, in consultation with theForeign Secretary and the other Ministers principally concerned, to pursue the proposals put forward in the two memoranda on technological collaboration with Europe(C (68) 40) and European Technological Institute(C (68) 41).
