confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the first week after the Easter recess.confidential. The Prime Minister, on behalf of his colleagues, extendeda welcome to those Ministers who were joining the Cabinet for thefirst time. He intended to take advantage of the opportunity providedby the reconstruction of the Government both to simplify and to reinforce the arrangements for the collective discussion of public business. The structure and membership of Cabinet committees would be reviewed in the next few days; and in future these committees would be expected to bring as many issues as possibleto a point of decision, with the minimum of reference to the cabinet itself. This should relieve the burden on the Cabinet, which had recently become unduly heavy; and it should give the Cabinet more time in which to review Government business as a whole, on thebasis of regular reports from its subordinate Committees. Inaddition, a new Committee of the Cabinet would be established toenable senior Ministers to consider more fully the political and parliamentary implications of major issues of policy, such as theforthcoming legislation on prices and incomes. White Papers shouldcontinue to be submitted for approval by the Cabinet as a whole;but, here too, issues of policy should be decided as far as possible by the relevant committee and the Cabinefs consideration shouldbe confined to broad questions of policy and presentation.In discussion there was a general welcome for these new arrangements. There should be no departure, however, from the established principle that details of the composition and terms ofreference of Cabinet Committees were not publicly disclosed; and ministers should discourage ill-informed speculation about the redistribution of Departmental functions (e.g., in relation to thesocial services) which might be entailed by the recent Ministerialchanges but would require careful and detailed consideration before being brought fully into effect.This might also be a suitable occasion for the Cabinet to give further consideration to the conventions governing the disclosure of ministerial discussions; and for this purpose they should take anearly opportunity to resume their adjourned discussion of the reportof the Lord Chancellors Committee on Ministerial Publication.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers statement on the conduct of Government business.(2) Agreed to resume, at an early meeting, their considerationof the report of the Committee on Ministerial Publication.8943
The Cabinet were also informed that the debate on the reportof the Estimates Committee on Prisons, Borstals and detention centres, which should have taken place on the previous day, hadbeen frustrated by the refusal of members of the Estimates Committeeto move the Motion as a protest against the curtailment of thetime available for the debate by the prolongation of the debate onthe adjournment of the House for the Easter recess.In discussion it was pointed out that while the Governmentcould not concede that, the Estimates Committee having failed totake advantage of the opportunity to debate the Report on a SupplyDay, the Government were under an obligation to provideGovernment time for the purpose, the subject was nevertheless oneof considerable interest and arrangements might be made for it tobe debated otherwise than on the Estimates Committee report later in the Session. It was for consideration, however, whether debates on the adjournment of the House for a recess, which had tended tobecome longer without becoming more valuable, were now necessaryin view of the greater opportunities provided for Private Members toraise matters of concern to them. If the debates were to continueit might be useful for the topics for discussion to be selected byMr. Speaker.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thevalue of debates on the adjournment before a recess merited furtherconsideration. The Lord Privy Seal should consider whether thematter could usefully be referred to the Select Committee on procedure and could announce in the Business Statement on thefollowing Thursday that the matter was under consideration.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord Privy Seal to consider whether the practiceof holding debates on the adjournment of the House for arecess should be remitted to the Select Committee on procedure, and to refer to the matter in the BusinessStatement later in the week on the lines indicated in thePrime Minister^ summing up.OverseaAffairsRhodesia(previous reference:CC (68) 24thConclusions,Minute 3)secret. The Foreign Secretary said that the United kingdom representative at the United Nations, Lord Caradon, was continuinghis consultations with the Afro-Asian Group on the draft resolution on Rhodesia but did not expect to have further discussions withthem for a day or two. He had been authorised to table ourown draft resolution when he thought the moment was right. Itwas possible that we should then be under Afro-Asian pressure onsuch points as posts and telecommunications, transport and the supervision of sanctions by a Committee of the United Nations.It was unlikely that the Afro-Asian group could muster sufficientvotes in the Security Council to secure the inclusion of provisions
Vietnam(previous reference:CC(68) 25thConclusions,Minute 1)8943directed against South Africa or Portugal. We might, however, bein difficulty over demands to make mandatory the principle of noindependence before majority rule, or to ban further talks with the illegal regime; and in certain circumstances we might even have toconsider using our veto. These were however only possibilities; andit was still too early to say how things would develop. It was likely that the debate in the Security Council would continue well after easter.The Foreign Secretary said that the Government of north vietnam had suggested that talks with the United States should takeplace at Phnom Penh in Cambodia. The United States saw difficultyin this since they had no diplomatic relations with Cambodia; butthey were ready to meet in Djakarta, New Delhi or Rangoon.Failing Geneva, which was unlikely to be chosen, Paris was also apossible meeting place.  It was significant that the Prime Ministerof North Vietnam, in a recent interview with the ColumbiaBroadcasting Service, had spoken about the need for a coalition government in South Vietnam, thereby implying that he accepted that even after a settlement there would still be a separateSouth Vietnam.  The Government of North Vietnam were showingsome independence of both the Chinese Government, who were hostile to any steps towards a settlement, and of the SovietGovernment.  In their view the object of the first meeting between north Vietnam and the United States would be to arrange an unconditional cessation of United States bombing and to fix a timeand place for further talks.   If the talks did not materialise theUnited States would on this basis in practice be free to resume the bombing.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that there were no grounds for believing that President Johnsorfs decision to limit the bombing of North Vietnam had been pre-arranged with theGovernment of North Vietnam.  The latter were not as concerned as many Western observers with the limited character of the bombingpause. The cessation of bombing north of the 20th Parallel was initself a substantial gain for them.  Moreover, the effect on north vietnam of the prolonged military operations and of diplomaticpressure from the Soviet Union should not be under-estimated.There was reason to think that President Johnson had for some time had in mind a decision to limit the bombing.  Although they had broken down, there had been contacts between the United Statesand North Vietnam at the time of the Prime Minister^ visit to moscow in January of this year.   The explanations of Americanpolicy which the Prime Minister had then, and subsequently, beenable to give the Soviet Government might have played their partin persuading the latter to bring pressure to bear on North Vietnam.The Soviet Prime Minister had not yet replied to the message whichthe Prime Minister had sent him immediately after President Johnsonhad ordered a partial halt in the bombing of North Vietnam.
Approach to europe(previous reference:CC (68) 15thConclusions,Minute 2)The Council of Ministers of the European economic community (e.c.) had considered at their meeting on 5th April areport by the European Commission on the possibility of entering into an &quot; arrangement&quot; with the United Kingdom and the otherapplicants for membership of the Community. The meeting hadbeen confused and inconclusive. The Permanent Representativesof the Six would be holding further discussions shortly and theCouncil of Ministers would probably review the results early next month. The Commission had urged that the &quot; arrangement &quot; shouldbe seen in the perspective of the enlargement of the Community andof the accession of the United Kingdom in particular. The french had been completely hostile to this concept and their own proposals,which contained a significant agricultural element in addition to reductions on industrial tariffs, were very limited. The others had rejected the French view, and although the Germans had taken upa less forthright position than the others there were some signs that their opposition to the French approach might be hardening.It was difficult to extract any meaning from the recent Franco-German proposals, and on the main issue we should have to await the results of further discussion among the Six. The most hopefulprospect for us would be to make progress on the recent benelux proposals in particular in relation to technology and defence-and it seemed likely that we might be able to take an initiativeon these soon when the new Belgian Government had been formed.South-east asia treaty organisation(previous reference:CC (67) 23rdConclusions,Minute 3)The Commonwealth Secretary said that he had recentlyattended a meeting of the Council of the South-East Asia treaty organisation at Wellington. The meeting had been overshadowedby President Johnson&apos;s statement on Vietnam, which had come asa surprise to the members of the Council. From our point of view the most important result of the meeting had been that the timetable for our military withdrawal from the Far East had been generally accepted, although with regret and a little bitterness. the communique issued after the meeting was satisfactory in this respect.In the course of the meeting he had had useful discussions with therepresentatives of Australia and New Zealand about the Five-power conference which was due to take place in Kuala Lumpur in June.He had found them both very cautious in their approach to themeeting, and this fitted in well with our own interests. TheAustralian Government had clearly not yet settled their future policyafter our withdrawal in 1971; while as a result of our withdrawal,New Zealand was having to engage in a fundamental reappraisalof its political and defence arrangements in South-East Asia, and to face the need for more direct dependence on Australia and even,possibly, some form of integration of their services. Both theAustralian and New Zealand representatives had shown great interest in what equipment we were prepared to leave behind and on what terms; and his conclusion was that it would pay us to be asgenerous as possible.On his return journey he had called at Singapore and seen thePrime Minister, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew.   He had remonstrated with
LegislationReforms of theLaw and practice onChildren and young Persons:Draft white paper(previous reference:CC (65) 40thConclusions,Minute 6)confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C (68) 68) to which was annexed the draft of a white paper &quot; Children in Trouble &quot;.The Home Secretary said that the proposals outlined in theWhite Paper sought to effect a new reconciliation between the needsof the child and the interests of society, with somewhat moreemphasis than hitherto on the need of the child for care. Theproposals preserved the essential principles of the White Paper &quot; the child, The Family and the Young Offender &quot; published in August1965 but met the most important criticisms which it had evoked.The juvenile courts were preserved, but juvenile offenders would bedealt with outside the courts so far as possible. Those between 10and 14 would be brought before the courts as in need of care,protection or control, but only after full consultation among those concerned with the child and those between 14 and 17 would be prosecuted only after similar consultation and with the agreementof a- magistrate. It was also proposed to provide new forms of&quot;intermediate treatment&quot; between supervision and removal from home, and to integrate the approved schools within a comprehensive system of residential establishments for children in the care of the. Lee Kuan Yew about the action of the Singapore Governmentin diversifying their holdings of sterling during the recent gold crisis.He had been unable to secure any commitment that Singapore&apos;sholdings of sterling would be restored to their former level. but mr. Lee Kuan Yew had said that he hoped to send the PrimeMinister a satisfactory message on his question after the SingaporeGeneral Election on 13th April. Mr. Lee Kuan Yew had alsostressed the need for Singapore to have air power in order tomaintain international confidence in its economy: he was determined to have an air force of his own, if possible in co-operation with theGovernment of Malaysia, but if necessary alone. He wished to buy British equipment and was ready to pay for it in dollars.The Commonwealth Secretary was convinced that in presentcircumstances Mr. Lee Kuan Yew was likely to prove our best friendin the Far East and the best guarantee for a peaceful withdrawal ofour forces and the subsequent protection of our commercial interests.He thought that provided we could be reassured that the MalaysianGovernment were reconciled to Mr. Lee&apos;s proposals we should examine Singapore&apos;s requirements sympathetically. He had alsovisited Brunei and would be reporting on the result of his visit tothe Defence and Oversea Policy Committee.The Cabinet-Took note of the statements by the Foreign Secretary andthe Commonwealth Secretary.
local authority. The proposals were likely to be welcomed by those concerned with the problem of juvenile delinquency, and it was desirable that the White Paper should be published as soon aspossible as a basis for consultation on details before legislation, whichit was hoped to introduce early in the following Session, was prepared.The Lord Chancellor said that the Home Affairs Committeehad approved the Home Secretary&apos;s proposals and the text of theWhite Paper, subject to certain minor amendments. They had,however, taken the point that if the proposals were fully implementedby 1974-75, as the Home Secretary hoped, the demand for additionalchild care staff would pre-empt the supply of scarce social workersneeded by other services. The timing of the implementation of theBill would therefore have to be considered with this and the outcome of the review of public expenditure in mind.In discussion there was general approval of the proposals in theWhite Paper. It was pointed out, however, that they would need tobe carefully presented if the Government were not to be open to the criticism that, having appointed the Interdepartmental Committeeon Local Authority Personal Services, and indeed the RoyalCommission on Local Government in England, they had formulatedproposals on matters to which the reports of these two bodies wouldbe relevant without waiting to receive their advice. The Chairmanof the Interdepartmental Committee (Mr. Seebohm) had, however,been shown a draft of the White Paper and had said that he would welcome its publication and would see no objection to its appearingbefore the report of his Committee. The proposals could be madeto fit whatever pattern the Committee might recommend for theorganisation of the local authority social services. Similarly, theJoint Committees, which it was proposed should plan the system of&quot; community homes&quot;, could reflect whatever structure of localgovernment might be adopted in the light of the Royal Commission^report.The only respect in which the White Paper might be said to commit the Government to a particular view in advance of their consideration of the reports of the Seebohm Committee and theRoyal Commission was the pre-eminence accorded to the ChildrenCommittees of local authorities in the machinery for dealing with children and for planning the provision of community homes; but any proposal to displace the Children Committees would arousestrong opposition. It was suggested that the publication of theWhite Paper as a basis for discussion would afford some opportunityfor the proposals to be seen in the context of the reports of theSeebohm Committee and possibly of the Royal Commission. On theother hand, it was important that legislation should be introduced in the autumn, both to put an end to the present unsatisfactoryposition of the approved schools and to avoid the criticism that theGovernment, having published a White Paper, were for the second time failing to follow it up with legislation.
confidential. The Minister of Technology said that the annual marchfrom the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment to London,organised by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, was due toIn further discussion it was pointed out that the new proposalswhen fully implemented would cost an additional  3% million a year.The Home Secretary had agreed with the Chancellor of theExchequer, however, that he would not enter into any commitmentabout implementing the proposals until after the review of public expenditure in June 1969. The proposals would also involve a transfer of net expenditure of some  2 million from the exchequer to the local authorities in respect of approved schools. This was likely to be unwelcome to the authorities, and there was a risk thatthe tendency of a high rate of delinquency to occur in the poorerareas might place on the authorities with the least resources a greaterburden than they could effectively discharge. There might be acase for giving priority to certain areas, as with educational provision.The intention was, however, that the Joint Committees which wouldbe responsible for providing community homes should be based onauthorities with a good record in child care, and the arrangement for joint provision of facilities should enable areas with greaterresources and experience to help those which were less well off.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the Home Secretary&apos;s proposals in principle, and,subject to consideration of any textual amendments which ministers might send to the Home Secretary, approved the text of the white paper. There might be advantage in publishing it, if this were practicable, during the recess; but before publication the HomeSecretary should arrange to consult the Chairman of the RoyalCommission on Local Government in England. In presenting theWhite Paper he should be guided by the points made in their discussion. He himself had been impressed with the servicerendered by foster parents, and the opportunity might be taken topay them a tribute by inserting a passage on their work in theWhite Paper.The Cabinet-(1) Approved, subject to minor drafting amendments, the white paper appended to C (68) 68.(2) Invited   Ministers   who   wished   to   propose   drafting amendments to send them to the Home Secretary.(3) Invited the Home Secretary (i) to consult the Chairman of the Royal Commissionon Local Government in England;(ii) to consider, in consultation with the Lord President,the date of publication of the White Paper;(iii) to be guided in the presentation of the White Paperby the points made in their discussion.
take place on Good Friday, 12th April. Although the organiserswished the march to be completed peacefully, as in previous years,it was possible that there would be some organised violence similarto that which had occurred at the demonstration in GrosvenorSquare on 17th March. If there were violence, it would probablytake the form of an attempt to invade the Royal Ordnance Factory,Burghfield, which lay on the route. Preparations had been made to resist any such attempt but only minimum force would be used,unless it became evident that the vitally important areas in the centre of the factory were threatened. Any attempt to gain entry intothose areas would have to be opposed with whatever force wasnecessary.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Minister of Technology.CONFIDENTIALDurham 6.   The Home Secretary said that there were now four prisonsPrison jn tne country which had to accommodate, in conditions of maximumsecurity, groups of dangerous, clever and unscrupulous prisoners.Three of the prisons were quiet, but there was trouble at DurhamPrison where some of the worst offenders were concentrated. Inthe past, they had been allowed considerable latitude in themanagement of the maximum security wing and the present unrestwas due to resentment at the introduction by a new Governor offirmer discipline. Complaints about food had been manufacturedas an excuse for demonstrations; and some prisoners had gonewithout their meals for about eight days. As long as this challenge to authority continued, it was impossible to make what might otherwise seem reasonable concessions and he intended to give theGovernor the fullest support. He thought that the Cabinet shouldbe aware of the situation and he hoped that they would support him in standing firm.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement by the HomeSecretary.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,9th April 1968.
