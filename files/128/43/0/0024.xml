LegislativeProgramme1967-68(previous reference:CC(68) 10thConclusions,Minute 3)CC 24 (68)confidential. The Lord President said that a recent review of the business for the remainder of the Session indicated that the governments programme of legislation could be completed if Parliament sat untilThursday, 1st August, and for a further fortnight in October. Thiswould permit a Recess of two weeks to be taken at Whitsun. If thistimetable was to be adhered to, however, it was essential thathe should not be asked to find time for any Bills not already in theGovernments programme.The Cabinet Took note of the Lord Presidents statement.confidential parliament 2.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.SECRETOverseaAffairsFalklandIslands(previous reference:CC (67) 57thConclusions,Minute 2)3. The Foreign Secretary said that we had for some time beenhaving talks with the Argentine Government about the future of the falkland Islands with the object of establishing a satisfactory long-term relationship between them and of securing the removal of the travel restrictions which had been imposed by the Argentine. a necessary condition of these talks had been a willingness on our part to discuss the transfer of sovereignty. On this point we had proposed a draft formula stating that we would be prepared to recogniseArgentine sovereignty over the Islands only if we were satisfied thatthe Islanders themselves regarded the safeguards and guaranteesoffered by the Argentine Government as satisfactory to their interests.We had also insisted on making clear that a transfer of sovereigntycould not be expected in the immediate future. The argentine government would not agree that the transfer of sovereignty shouldbe subject to the Islanders&apos; veto, and had pressed that it should dependon the United Kingdom Governments, not the Islanders&apos;, satisfactionwith the proposed arrangements. We had given no publicity to the talks, in order to give them the best chance of success. But there had recently been a sudden burst of Parliamentary interest; and he had thought it necessary to make a statement in the House of commons on the previous day and to make plain that we would agree to acession of sovereignty only if it were clear to us that the Islandersthemselves regarded such an agreement as satisfactory. otherwise there would have been a danger of feeling running so high inParliament as to make any agreement with the Argentine impossible.He had so worded his statement as to avoid giving offence to theArgentine Government; but, although there had been no reaction sofar, it was still possible that they would, as a result, break off the talks.8898
Rhodesia(previous reference:CC (68) 23rdConclusions,Minute 2)Malta(previous reference:CC (68) 16thConclusions,Minute 2)The Foreign Secretary said that the debate on Rhodesia in theSecurity Council was proving difficult, but not more difficult than wehad expected. Our Western allies and the Latin American states were being helpful. A draft resolution would probably be tabled bythe Afro-Asian Group; and it now seemed likely that we should alsowish to table our own draft. It appeared from the debate on rhodesia in the House of Commons on the previous day that fromthe point of view of Parliamentary opinion in this country there mightbe some advantage in our taking such an initiative.The Minister of State for Commonwealth Affairs said that theLord Privy Seal was in Malta trying to negotiate with the malta government a settlement of the problem of the ownership of the malta Dockyard. A scheme for declaring the dockyard companybankrupt had fallen through and the Malta Government were nowplanning to nationalise it under the terms of the Malta Constitution.The Lord Privy Seal had had a long meeting the previous day withthe Prime Minister of Malta, Dr. Borg Olivier; and they were meetingagain that day. If no settlement were reached there was a danger that the dockyard would have to close at the end of the month.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Foreign Secretary andby the Minister of State for Commonwealth Affairs.SECRETPrices andIncomesProductivity,Prices and incomes:Draft white paper(previous reference:CC (68) 22ndConclusions,Minute 4)4. The Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary of State for economic Affairs (C (68) 64) to which was attached a draft white paper on Prices and Incomes Policy in 1968 and 1969.The Secretary of State for Economic Affairs said that the drafttook account of points made by the Confederation of British Industry(CBI) and the Trades Union Congress (TUC) during the recentconsultations with them, and incorporated amendments approved bythe Ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomes. It was possiblethat the CBI and TUC would give a less hostile reception to the white paper than had at one time seemed likely. The CBI proposed toissue detailed guidance to their members on the interpretation and application of certain parts of it. The phraseology of the draft wasto a considerable extent governed by that of previous White Paperswhich had acquired a recognised meaning in negotiations for bothsides of industry; this reduced the scope for presentational changes.In discussion a number of amendments to the draft White paper were agreed and the following main points were made (a) Paragraph 14 on page II-1 gave the impression that theonly price increases which would be compatible with the policy were those attributable either to devaluation or to the Budget; there would,however, be justifiable increases due to other causes and the paragraph should make this clear.
(b) Paragraph 14 on page III-J referred to the need for thestaging of wage increases of over 3\ per cent which were justifiedbecause more than a year had elapsed since the pay of the employeesaffected had last been adjusted. The wording of this paragraph wasnot intended to prejudge the question whether or not the instalmentsof an increase which were being staged would contain anyretrospective element.(c) The Minister of Housing would consider further what action might be taken in respect of any excessive increases in rentsintroduced by local authorities during the interval between the recentreference to the National Board for Prices and Incomes of rent increases by certain local authorities and the inception of the newphase in the prices and incomes policy on 20th March. He would inform the Prime Minister of the outcome.(d) It was not necessary to include in the White Paper a referenceto the need for restraint in rent increases for business premises and land, but the point should be made on the Second Reading of theproposed Prices and Incomes Bill.(e) A paragraph should be added to the section on rents to theeffect that the Government already had powers in respect of rent increases by New Town authorities and by the Scottish special housing Association, and these powers would be used to ensure the phasing of such increases where appropriate.(/) Television advertising rates should be added to the list ofgoods and services subject to early warning arrangements set out inAppendix I.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theSecretary of State for Economic Affairs should now revise the draft white Paper in the light of the discussion and should, in consultationwith the Lord President, arrange for its publication on Wednesday,3rd April; it would not be necessary to make any statement inParliament. He would himself hold a further discussion of theGovernments proposals with the Trade Union Group of Membersof Parliament on the day before publication.The Cabinet (1) Approved the draft White Paper attached to C (68) 64,subject to the amendments agreed in discussion.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, inconsultation with the Lord President, to arrange for theWhite Paper to be published on Wednesday, 3rd April.PublicExpenditureProspects(previous references:CC (67) 61stConclusions,Minute 8 and cc (67) 73rdConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer on public expenditure (C (68) 63).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that following thedecisions in the previous January the Government had published theirpublic expenditure plans for the next two years, showing in real terms
an increase over the previous year of 4f per cent in 1968-69 and of1 per cent in 1969-70. It was essential that the commitment to limitexpenditure to this extent should be met; but additional expenditure could already be foreseen which, in the absence of further savings,would take the total increase over 5 per cent next year. He therefore proposed that there should be another review of expenditure in asearch for further possible savings in 1968-69; that, for 1969-70, weshould seek to avoid any further commitments before the review inJune of this year; and that, for 1970-71, the Government should avoidwherever possible further commitments on the timing of new expenditure until the corresponding review in June 1969.In discussion it was suggested that rational conclusions about thefuture course of public expenditure could not be reached on the basisof global totals, which did not distinguish between expenditure on capital and current account, between amounts raised by taxation andby borrowing or between those increases which involved a reductionin private consumption and those which did not. Moreover, it wouldbe unwise for the Government to be committed irrevocably to limiting the increase in public expenditure in 1969-70 to 1 per cent. If the impact of the recent Budget proved to be more disinflationary thanthe situation required, the resultant slack in the economy might either be taken up by increasing public expenditure or by allowing private consumption to rise; and the choice in this respect should not beprejudged. Moreover, the concept that any increases in one sector of public expenditure must be offset by corresponding reductions inthe same sector was unduly rigid; the relative priorities of the variousprogrammes of public expenditure could well change during the next three years. For these reasons it was essential to avoid a repetition of the situation in which the Cabinet had found themselves from timeto time over the last few years, when they had been faced with theneed to make urgent and insufficiently considered reductions in public expenditure in order to meet sudden crises. New machinery was required to ensure that public expenditure was kept continuouslyunder review, in relation to the development of the economy as awhole. The Ministerial Steering Committee on Economic Policy(SEP) should in future conduct a review of this kind each month; andthey should report, at quarterly intervals, to the Cabinet.In further discussion the following main points were made:(a) Early consideration should be given to control of the verylarge sums at present expended on investment grants, regional employ-ment premia and agricultural deficiency payments. It was pointedout, however, that, while the future of investment grants and of thepresent system of agricultural support was already under review, theGovernment were committed to continue payments of the regional employment premium for a period of seven years from their introduction.(b) The imposition of a ceiling on manpower for the public services had proved already to be an effective instrument of controlover both recruitment and expenditure.  On the other hand staffing
was a function of policy; and there were clear limits to the extent towhich the Government could realise policies involving activeintervention in the economy while restricting the growth of the publicservice. The manpower ceiling inevitably involved a reduction inthe scope and standard of many services provided for the public; and in the case of the police and prison officers, for example it couldplace at risk the enforcement of the law and the maintenance of public order. While the ceiling on manpower should be maintained, a more effective effort was therefore required to secure substantial staffsavings in some areas of administration including quasi-Governmentcommissions as well as Government Departments in order thatserious staff shortages elsewhere could be relieved. It might well bedesirable to reinforce the efforts of the Organisation and Methodsdivision of the Treasury by instituting some form of independentreview of manpower in the public service, which, without calling inquestion policy objectives, would ascertain whether those objectivescould be attained by more efficient and economical methods of staffdeployment and management. Finally, it might be helpful in public discussion of these topics to try to dispel some of the misconceptionsarising from the indiscriminate use of the term &quot; civil servants &quot; byemphasising that many members of the civil service fulfilled functionsdirectly related to the well-being and convenience of the public suchas driving and vehicle examiners.(c) There was already a standing instruction that new proposalsfor Departmental expenditure should include an estimate of theadditional manpower required as well as of the financial cost. Thisinstruction should henceforward be strictly observed.The Cabinet (1) Approved C (68) 63, subject to the points made in discussion.(2) Took note, with approval, that the Prime Minister would arrange for the Ministerial Steering Committee onEconomic Policy:(i) to conduct monthly reviews of public expenditure inrelation to the development of the economy as awhole;(ii) to provide quarterly reports on this subject forconsideration by the Cabinet.(3) Took note, with approval, that the Prime Minister would give further consideration to the desirability of promotingsome form of independent review of manpower in thepublic service.Cabinet Office, S.W.J,28th March, 1968.
