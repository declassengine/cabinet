(previous reference:CC (68) 37thConclusions,Minute 2)secret oversea Affairs l. The Foreign Secretary said that we did not know theCzechoslovakia strength of the Warsaw Pact forces that had invaded Czechoslovakiaon the night of 20th-21st August, but it was clear that their gripon the country was complete although some free radio stations were still operating. Ground forces of the Soviet Union, East Germany,Poland and Bulgaria were involved together with Soviet air forces.There were also indications of an increased level of activity in theSoviet long-range air and rocket forces but these did not appear tobe in a high state of alert. A remarkable feature of the politicalsituation was that no Czech leader had so far shown himself willingto act as a Soviet puppet. Mr. Dubcek, the Secretary of the CzechCommunist Party, and others were in detention, but PresidentSvoboda had issued a statement on the previous evening calling forthe withdrawal of the invading troops and for the liberalisationprogramme in Czechoslovakia to continue; it might be, however,that the Soviet authorities hoped that he would be prepared toco-operate with them. The Czech people were behaving with verygreat restraint and, although there had been some deaths, widespreadbloodshed did not seem likely. It was not clear why the soviet union had resorted to military action, despite the agreement reached at Bratislava; it might be that they did not consider thatcensorship was being sufficiently rigidly imposed by the CzechGovernment as a result of the agreement or that they feared the outcome of the elections for the Presidium of the Czech CommunistParty which were due to take place on 9th September.Our decision to publish a statement on the previous daycondemning the Soviet action had been both right in principle andjustified in its results. Our objective had been to avoid acting in isolation but to be among the leaders of the reaction of world opinion. Support had been rallied in the United Nations and sevenmembers of the Security Council, including France, had called fora meeting of the Council, at which all but the Soviet Union and hungary had voted for the matter to be inscribed on the agenda.Those voting in favour had included Algeria and also India and pakistan, whose High Commissioners had been called to a meetingof Commonwealth representatives in London at the commonwealth office on the previous day where they had been briefed on the facts of the situation as we knew them and of our attitude to them. It waspossible that there would be a vote on a suitable Resolution in theSecurity Council by the following day. There would be great advantage if, despite the certainty of a Soviet veto, this happenedbefore a puppet Government had been set up in Czechoslovakia.We should decide, in the light of events, what further action wouldbe appropriate in the United Nations.As regards the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO),he had stressed in an interview on television about our attitude to the Czech crisis that recent events had demonstrated theOrganisation^ great importance.   Nevertheless, it did not appear
that we faced the likelihood of general war in Europe but rather a serious setback to a better understanding between East and West.Although some precautionary action had been taken in NATO andsome consideration given to the possible refugee problem, no generalalert had been instituted.Looking to the longer-term effects of recent events on ourrelations with the Soviet Union and on East/West relationsgenerally, our objective should remain to obtain world-widecondemnation of the Soviet action but to avoid becoming singled out as particularly hostile. We should need to consider our attitude on trade and on Ministerial and official visits to countries whichhad participated in the aggression and for the present such visitsshould be avoided. He had himself cancelled his planned visits to Hungary and Bulgaria but was prepared to carry out that toRumania unless the Rumanian Government preferred him not todo so.In discussion, there was general agreement with the actionwhich had been taken to issue a Government statement on theprevious day and with its terms. There was agreement also thatour policy should be on the lines indicated by the Foreign Secretary.It did not appear that there was at present any threat to peace inEurope generally and the Soviet Government had been at pains to impress on NATO Governments the limited nature of the action that was being taken. We had been aware that forces were being concentrated on the borders of Czechoslovakia and were not therefore taken by surprise; but the NATO authorities werebeing careful to do nothing which might increase tension. Sofar there were no indications that a similar move was intendedagainst Rumania. There was at present a general understandingthat the West would not intervene against the Soviet Union in soviet bloc countries and that Soviet intervention in Berlin or ina NATO country would involve risk of general war. At the sametime, it was clear that the regimes in Eastern Europe, andparticularly that in East Germany, only remained in power by theruthless use of military force and of censorship. If the soviet union were to fail in her objectives in Czechoslovakia it waspossible that the regimes in the surrounding countries woulddisintegrate. It was not yet clear, however, that the Soviet union would be able to find Czechoslovak nationals willing to form apuppet Government and she might have to withdraw her troops.In that event the Czech people might not totally have lost. Weshould consider how far it would be in our interest, despite the risks involved, for the Soviet Government to fail and whether wecould do anything to encourage the Czechs to insist on the authorityof their legal Government and to press for the Russians towithdraw their troops. While we should not seek to stimulate the Czechs to resist, it would be right for us to ensure, in concert with other like-minded countries, that the facts of the situationboth inside and outside their country were available to them, jparticularly in the next few days, before it became clear whetheror not a puppet Government would be installed.  There would be j
advantage also in arrangements being made, for example, by theLabour Party and the United Nations Association, for publicdemonstrations to be held in this country in support of the Czechpeople and Government and for the Government to provide speakersfor them. It was important that, both in the forthcoming debate in Parliament and in demonstrations, the attitude of the british people as a whole should be made clear to the Soviet Government.We should consider whether our Ambassador in Moscow should be recalled for consultation and whether there would be advantage inusing the &quot; hot line &quot; to Moscow to reiterate our attitude and to ask the Soviet Government, even at this late stage, to withdraw herforces from Czechoslovakia. In general our aim should be tosecure the continuance of the existing Czech Government and thewithdrawal of Russian troops, though on the understanding thatthe Czech Government would have to make some concessions to russian opposition to the programme of liberalisation.In further discussion, it was agreed that no final decision should be taken at present on whether or not we should recogniseany puppet Government that might be installed in Czechoslovakia.This decision would have to be taken in the light of events in concert with our allies. For the present, however, we shouldcontinue to recognise the existing legitimate Government. Asregards trade, we should adhere to our traditional attitude of notinterfering unilaterally with it. Special consideration would,however, be needed of our attitude to the forthcoming Trade Fairat Brno, on which we should seek the views of the Czechsthemselves, and of trade concessions which were being considered in relation to the Soviet Union. There were currently 1,000 Czechstudents in this country on a six weeks&apos; visit as well as other Czechnationals. Arrangements would be made to extend their visas fora month at a time in the hope that the situation would by then have clarified; they would not be sent back against their will.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said thatthere was general agreement in the Cabinet with the action whichhad been taken so far in relation to events in Czechoslovakia.The likely future course of events was unclear and it might be that another meeting of the Cabinet would be necessary early in thefollowing week to consider the situation further and in particularany question of the recognition of a puppet Government. If in themeantime any urgent action became necessary, he would considerit with the Foreign Secretary. It would be helpful if the transcriptof the television interview which the Foreign Secretary had given on the previous evening could be circulated to all members of theCabinet. Ministers intending to make statements about our policyin relation to Czechoslovakia should consult the Foreign Secretary.An urgent examination should be made of prospective visits by ministers and officials and other sponsored individuals or partiesfor cultural and other exchanges to the countries involved in the aggression against Czechoslovakia.   In so far as such visits had
already been firmly arranged and were to our advantage, theyshould in general be allowed to take place though they would need to be carefully watched in the light of future developments. but no new arrangements for such visits should be made at present.As regards trade relations, we should not seek to close theSoviet Exhibition in London prematurely and, subject to the advice of the Czech representatives in London and to no further deterioration in the situation, our participation in the Brno TradeFair should be allowed to proceed. An examination should bemade of the implications of recent events on our trade policy withthe Soviet bloc generally, including in particular the relaxation that had been intended of our quota restrictions on Soviet imports intothis country when the trade situation permitted this; the implications for our policy on strategic exports and on the strategicembargo should also be examined with a view to Ministerialconsideration early in September. Consideration should also begiven to the possibility of increased BBC broadcasts of factualmaterial to Czechoslovakia and to the possibility that the &quot; hot line &quot;to Moscow might be used to reiterate to the Russian Governmentour attitude to their actions.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary:(i) to  arrange for  the transcript of his televisioninterview of the previous evening aboutCzechoslovakia to be circulated to all members ofthe Cabinet;(ii) to arrange for an urgent examination to be made ofprospective visits to the countries involved inaggression against Czechoslovakia on the basis indicated by the Prime Minister;(iii) to arrange for the possibility of increased factualbroadcasts to Czechoslovakia to be considered;(iv) to consider whether there would be advantage inusing the &quot; hot line &quot; to Moscow to reiterate our attitude on Czechoslovakia.(3) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to arrange forthe Ministerial Committee on Commercial Policy and the ministerial Committee on Strategic Exports to considerthe implications of recent events on our policy in relationto the aggressor countries on trade and strategic exportsrespectively.(4) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to draw the attention of the leader of the prospective Parliamentary delegation toBulgaria to the question whether it was desirable toproceed with the visit at the present juncture.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,22nd August, 1968.CC 38 (68)confidential parliamentary        2.   The Prime Minister said that, after discussion with theRecaHfor        LOrd Sgal m ^ Previous daV&apos; he had concluded that the debate on Government should take the initiative in recalling Parliament,Czechoslovakia and had informed the Deputy Leader of the Conservative Party(Mr. Maudling) and the Leader of the Liberal Party (Mr. Thorpe)of the decision later in the day. It was desirable that the sittingshould not be prolonged more than was necessary; but, onceParliament was recalled to consider events in Czechoslovakia, a debate on the situation in Biafra seemed inescapable. It wastherefore proposed that the House should sit for two days, on26th and 27th August.In discussion it was suggested that the debate on Biafrashould not appear to be given equal importance with that onCzechoslovakia. Both debates would take place on a Motion forthe Adjournment, but, while that on Czechoslovakia should rununtil 10 p.m. on 26th August, it might be for the convenience ofMembers if the House sat on 27th August only from 11 am. to4 p.m., as on a Friday.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theLord Privy Seal should seek the agreement of the Opposition partiesto this timetable and to the necessary procedural Motionsbeing taken formally. He himself would open the debate onCzechoslovakia, the Foreign Secretary winding up; and theOpposition might be invited to open the debate on Biafra, in whichthe Commonwealth Secretary would speak for the Government.In view of the importance of obtaining a good attendance for the debate on Czechoslovakia a two-line Whip should be issued, butMembers who were too far away to come back without inconvenienceshould not be pressed to do so.The Cabinet-(1) Endorsed the decision to recall Parliament to discuss thesituation in Czechoslovakia.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to seek the agreement of theOpposition parties to the arrangement of the business ofthe House of Commons on the lines indicated in thePrime Ministers summing up.(3) Invited the Paymaster General to arrange the business ofthe House of Lords to coincide with that of the Houseof Commons.
