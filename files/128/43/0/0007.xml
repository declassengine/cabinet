The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the post-devaluationmeasures as proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer inC (68) 5.The Prime Minister recalled that the Cabinet had agreed, during their discussions on the preceding Friday, 12th January, that at thepresent meeting they should first hear a report by the commonwealth secretary on the visits to Malaysia, Singapore, Australia and NewZealand, from which he had just returned, and then proceed to afinal decision on the timing of the withdrawal of our forces fromthe Middle East and the Far East. Before doing so, however, theCabinet would wish to take into account two messages which hehad received during the week-end from the President of the UnitedStates, the text of which would now be made available to theCabinet. He proposed that the Cabinet should then consider the memoranda, discussion of which had not been completed at their previous meetings, and those which had since been circulated(C (68) 8, 9, 16, 18 and 20), and also certain oral reports requestedin their previous discussion, concerning local authority roads, local health and welfare services, and public expenditure in NorthernIreland. The Cabinet might then resume their discussion on thebalance of the package of measures considered as a whole. at.30 p.m. the Cabinet might meet again to consider the draft of thestatement he would be making to the House of Commons on thefollowing day, copies of which were now being circulated to departments.The Cabinet were in general agreement with the procedure proposed by the Prime Minister. Their attention was drawn to aletter dated 11th January from the Governor of the Bank of england to the Joint Permanent Secretary of the Treasury, dealing withcertain financial considerations arising out of the proposedacceleration of the withdrawal of our forces from the Middle and far East, which Ministers might wish to take into account in their discussion on this subject.The Cabinet considered a memorandum C (68) 23 by theCommonwealth Secretary on his discussions on defence cuts withthe Governments of Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and singapore.The Commonwealth Secretary said that, during his recent visit to the Far East, he had informed the Governments of Malaysia,Singapore, Australia and New Zealand of our decision to complete the withdrawal of our forces from Singapore and Malaysia by 31stMarch, 1971, and to maintain no special military capabilitythereafter for use in the Far East, although our general capabilitywould be available for use there if circumstance in our own judgmentdemanded it. He had informed these Governments that final decisions would not be taken until he had been able to representtheir views to the Cabinet; anything less would have had disastrous consequences for our relations with them, and for our large interestsin the Far East.  All four Governments had reacted strongly against
our plans. They felt that we were letting them down. they considered that the timetable that we had set for the withdrawalwas too short to enable alternative defence arrangements to be made and thus to sustain confidence in the political stability and economic development of the area. They did not consider that our generalcapability to come to their assistance would be credible in thecircumstances. The Government of Malaysia had stressed thatthey would not have entered into responsibilities for East Malaysiabut for our undertaking in the Anglo-Malaysian Defence Agreement.The Government of Singapore had since last July been basing their economic and defence planning on the assumption that our withdrawal would not take place before 1973. They had reactedconstructively in their attempt to adjust their economy to thecircumstances of our proposed withdrawal: and they consideredthat we were now destroying the foundations of their plans. InAustralia, emphasis had been placed on the fact that this was thethird time our plans for the Far East had changed recently andimposed on them changes in their own defence planning. In all four countries great importance had been attached to the need for our general defence capability to be credible in relation to the Far East;and the Governments of Australia and Singapore in particular had stressed the importance in this connection of our having the F-lllaircraft.In the light of his consultations, he urged strongly that weshould reconsider the date of our final withdrawal from the far east. A longer delay might be crucial for peace and stability inthe area and for our continued friendly relationship with theCommonwealth countries concerned. Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, thePrime Minister of Singapore, was unwilling to accept any date forour withdrawal earlier than 1973 but, if we could fix the date at31st March, 1972, this would be of great value in enabling economicand defence planning in the area to proceed with some prospect ofsuccess. It would cost us very little to delay our withdrawal by ayear and, by showing willingness to take some practical account ofthe representations that had been made to us, we should reduce therisk that the countries concerned would take the retaliatory actionagainst us which was within their power. Without some concession on our part this risk was real. As regards our defence capability,it was clear that both to the Commonwealth countries in the far east and to the United States, the F-lll was of critical importance.The Prime Minister said that, on the previous day, he and theother Ministers primarily concerned had had discussions withMr. Lee Kuan Yew about our intended acceleration of our withdrawal from Singapore and Malaysia. Mr. Lee had been in avery excitable state; he had not shown any strong feeling aboutwhether we chose 1971 rather than 1972 for our withdrawal althoughif a choice had to be made he would clearly prefer the later date.His main concern had been that we should not withdraw from theFar East before 1973 and that thereafter we should maintain forcesin Singapore to provide air cover and some naval vessels in the area.He also wished to obtain air defence missiles and Hunter aircraftV
SECREI&apos;5from us and assistance in building up a command structure.Singapore was at present enjoying an economic boom as a result ofthe investment of capital from Japan and of a flight of capital therefrom Hong Kong where there were increasing doubts about thefuture of the Colony. If the security of Singapore were put in doubt,as Mr. Lee believed it would be if we were to withdraw by31st March, 1971, confidence would disappear and with it the presentgood economic prospects. He did not fear internal disorders somuch as an attack from outside. He saw the threat as coming not from China or Malaysia but from Indonesia which might be tempted to attack Singapore in order to divert attention from itsown serious internal economic situation.The Prime Minister, continuing, said that at the end of themeeting with Mr. Lee he had summed up the discussion. He had said that he and his colleagues had heard from Mr. Lee, in the strongest terms, his reasons for believing that the acceleration of theBritish withdrawal from Singapore to a terminal date earlier than1973 created very grave problems for both Singapore and the regionas a whole. The British Government took full account of these arguments. At the same time, he and his colleagues had made clear to Mr. Lee that a substantial speed-up of our withdrawal was essential. The prevailing view in the Cabinet favoured March 1971,but this was not yet definite. On Monday and Tuesday, 15th and16th January, the Government would be considering their finaldecision in the light of Mr. Lee&apos;s remarks and the report by theCommonwealth Secretary on his visit to the commonwealth countries concerned, the Foreign Secretary having already reported on his discussion with the United States Government. The BritishGovernment accepted the need to maintain confidence in Singaporewhich depended on the question of security. For this reason wewere willing to discuss with Mr. Lee and his colleagues as a matterof urgency, during their stay in the United Kingdom, what we could do to help to develop Singapore&apos;s defence capability. We laidemphasis on our view that there could be no permanent security for the region outside the framework of a wider regional defencearrangement with the other Commonwealth countries concerned.We recognised that the Government of Singapore must decide for themselves what was necessary for their own security. WhenSingapore had taken this decision, the British Government would do all in their power to enable Singapore to maintain their securityon the basis that they had chosen. It would, in our view, be inadvisable to take hasty decisions on the purchase of military equipment before full consultation with us. Whatever advice theBritish Government might eventually give, they hoped that theGovernment of Singapore would take account of it and would workout with the British Government the best arrangements that couldbe made in the light of their decision, so as to mitigate the dangers which might arise for both Governments.The Prime Minister said that the message from PresidentJohnson indicated that, while the United States Government
recognised that the decision on the questions at issue was one whichthe United Kingdom Government alone could make, they felt boundto emphasise that the announcement of our earlier withdrawal fromthe Far East and from the Persian Gulf would create serious problems for the United States Government and for the security ofthe entire free world; and that, if we decided to cancel the F-lllaircraft, this would be regarded both as a British disengagement fromcommitments to the security of Europe and areas outside europe and as a strong indication of British isolation which would be fatal to the chances of Anglo-American co-operation in defence procurement. Moreover, it would involve not only the appreciablefinancial penalites of cancellation charges but also the loss of present offset arrangements; and it would almost inescapably leadto complete cancellation of recent awards of military contracts toBritish firms.In discussion it was argued that, taken together, the report ofthe Commonwealth Secretary on his consultations in the Far East,the representations made by Mr. Lee, the messages which the PrimeMinister had received from President Johnson and the fears that hadbeen expressed by the Governor of the Bank of England about theextent of the risks to sterling from possible retaliatory action against us by the countries concerned all pointed strongly in the direction of postponing the terminal date of our proposed withdrawal from singapore and Malaysia by a year to 31st March, 1972. To do so would cost only about  10 million, with at least some offsetting savings in the amount of economic aid that we should need to give to Singapore and Malaysia, and would be well worth while in orderto reduce the risks of our interests. These risks were considerable,particularly if we did not make any concession in response to the strong representations that had been made to us. We could not afford to ignore the strongly expressed views of the United States,on whose goodwill we still depended in so many fields. Althoughretaliatory action against us by countries in the Far East mightinjure those countries as well as ourselves, it would be wrong, in themood engendered by our decisions and the difficulties they faced, toassume that all the Governments concerned would act in a whollyrational fashion. Withdrawal from the Far East even by31st March, 1972 would still constitute a major change of policy;its credibility would not be enhanced by advancing the date by ayear in face of all official and political advice to the contrary; thiswould look like panic. It was of the utmost importance to our continuing interests in the area that we should seek to obtain atleast the reluctant acquiescence of the countries concerned in ourdate of withdrawal from the Far East, and there was a much betterprospect of this if the date was fixed at 31st March, 1972.On the other hand it was argued that the information now before the Cabinet did not materially alter the situation as it hadbeen when the balance of view was that the date for final withdrawal from Singapore and Malaysia should be 31st March, 1971. Asregards the United States, past experience had shown that, althoughher initial reaction to our policy changes might be sharp, she was unlikely to take retaliatory action against us in view of the common
interests she had with us and our ability to damage her; in any event she was more deeply concerned about the Persian Gulf than about the Far East. It was right and natural for Mr. Lee to saythat each hour, month or year by which our withdrawal could be delayed, would be helpful to him; but Singapore was in a much stronger balance of payments situation than this country and haddiversified her foreign exchange holdings without consulting us.Any grants of economic aid would need to be tied in with arrangements about the withdrawal of sterling balances by singapore and Malaysia. The possibility that Singapore might diversify thebalance of her foreign exchange holdings out of sterling was a lesserthreat to sterling than we should face if the expenditure cuts as awhole failed to carry credibility particularly with countries and international companies which held working balances in sterling.For this purpose an early withdrawal of our forces from the far east, and the clear change of policy which this would demonstrate,was an essential element of the expenditure cuts. The governor of the Bank of England had specifically said that his comments onthe risks to our balance of payments from retaliatory action by countries in the Far East did not mean that he was questioning31st March, 1971 as the terminal date for the withdrawal of our forces from Singapore and Malaysia. We should therefore decide to withdraw finally from Singapore and Malaysia by 31st March,1971.In further discussion it was argued that, although a decision infavour of delaying our final withdrawal until 31st March, 1972would lose us the presentational and catalytic advantages that would flow from adopting a date a year earlier, this would not be so if wewere to decide that our withdrawal should be completed by the endof the calendar year 1971. A decision in this sense would moreoverhave the advantage of demonstrating that there had been substance in our undertaking to take account of the views of our friends andallies during the recent consultations which the Foreign and commonwealth Secretaries had had. If we were to adopt this dateit should apply also to the Persian Gulf.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet were agreed that we should decide that our withdrawal from Singapore and Malaysia and from the Persian Gulfshould be completed by the end of 1971 and that these decisions should be announced in the forthcoming statement on theexpenditure cuts.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the withdrawal of our forces from singapore and Malaysia and from the Persian Gulf should becompleted by the end of the calendar year 1971.The Defence Secretary said that, although the Cabinet had decided at their previous meeting that we should cancel our order for F-lll, he thought it right to draw the attention of his colleagues to the fact that the very serious risks which this decision involved
The Cabinet (2) Agreed that the decision to cancel our order for the F-lllshould not be reviewed.Foreign The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofExchange Costs State for Foreign Affairs (C (68) 16) on the foreign exchange costs ofof British . . .aForces in       British forces in Germany.-    . The Foreign Secretary said that the Defence and Oversea Policy(previous reference- Committee had agreed on 20th July, 1967 that we should exploreCC (68) 1st a new approach to the problem of offsetting the foreign exchangeConclusions, costs of British forces in Germany by negotiating a long-termMinute 3) agreement with the Federal German Republic for collaboration on military research, development and production. The Germans had welcomed the idea, but the Federal German Chancellor,Dr. Kiesinger, at his talks in London in October had explained that owing to problems with their defence budget the Germans wouldnot be ready for negotiations until early in 1968. subsequent discussions had shown that there was no prospect that a long-termcollaborative agreement with the Germans could bring offsetbenefits in 1968-69, since the Germans had delayed decisions aboutjoining in projects such as the Anglo-French Jaguar aircraft.Nevertheless, the idea still held out the best prospect of enabling usto dispense in the long run with offset agreements on traditional lines and the recurring friction caused by difficult annual negotiations.had been reinforced by the report of the Commonwealth secretary on his visit to Commonwealth countries in the Far East and by the messages which the Prime Minister had received from the Presidentof the United States. From the industrial viewpoint the HandleyPage company had informed him that one consequence of the cancellation would be the loss of orders worth $95 million in thenext five years on sales of their Jetstream aircraft. Although hewas not seeking to reverse the decision which had been taken hesuggested that the Cabinet might wish to consider reducing the order for F-lll aircraft to the minimum viable number; this would involvepurchasing 35 aircraft. We would save  90 million over the next10 years and retain the whole of the F-lll offset orders apart fromthe $100 million worth which he had arranged recently.In discussion it was argued that, in view of the new information which the Cabinet had been given on the F-lll situation, it wouldbe right to consider the matter further. It was clear that theGovernments of the United States and Australia in particularattached the very greatest importance to our having this aircraft and there were doubts whether the industrial capacity which wouldbe freed by the loss of offset orders would in fact be taken up with more worth-while alternative production for our balance ofpayments. On the other hand it was argued that all aspects of theF-lll problem had been very fully explored before the decision to cancel the order for the aircraft was taken and that, if at this latestage this or any other major element in the package of expenditure cuts was thrown open for reconsideration, it would be impossibleto reach decisions on the cuts as a whole in time for announcement on 16th January.
However, a transitional agreement would be required in 1968-69 to offset our foreign exchange costs which, after devaluation, would beabout  90 million. Likely offset from German sources next year would meet only about 45 per cent of this as against 60 per cent inthe current year. Until we knew more of United States intentionswe could not say whether multilateral discussions would be to our advantage. United States pressure to neutralise their foreign exchange costs, coupled with their measures to defend the dollar,were likely to restrict our room for manoeuvre. The negotiations would be difficult. The German attitude in the period following the French veto on our negotiations for membership of theEuropean Economic Community had not been encouraging but theFederal Government might be more helpful on the offset problem.We should therefore start negotiations at the beginning of february to obtain German agreement to the principle of a long-termcollaborative agreement on research, development and productionin the defence and possibly also in the civil field, and to press theGermans to find means of closing the gap between the offset we hoped to get on the lines of the current agreement and our foreign exchange costs; this might include some form of medium, orpreferably long-term, borrowing from the Germans, or german agreement to devote a further sum to facilitate major civil exportsales, for instance of aircraft. An announcement of our intentionto begin negotiations should be included in the Prime ministers statement to Parliament on public expenditure on 16th January.In discussion there was general agreement with the proposals in C (68) 16. Negotiations with the Germans should be at ministerial level from the start: but no Minister should be named in the statement to be made by the Prime Minister. In answer to questions in Parliament Ministers should express the firm resolveof the Government to obtain offset, but at the same time should avoid a commitment to obtain 100 per cent offset of all our foreign exchange costs. It would be better to stand on the reference in the supplementary Statement on Defence Policy of 18th July, 1967(Cmnd. 3357) that &quot; it remains essential to our balance of payments to find satisfactory arrangements to meet these costs in future,either by offset purchases or by other means &quot; rather than to revert to the wording of earlier statements which had referred to thepossibility of withdrawals of troops if our costs were not met in full.We should at this time be particularly careful to avoid creatingdifficulties with our European allies. The process of acceleratingthe withdrawal of British forces from other parts of the world andconcentrating our defence effort in Europe pointed towards a new approach to the offset problem.The Cabinet (3) Approved the proposals in C (68) 16, subject to theamendment proposed in discussion to the form of wordsto be used in the Prime Ministers statement on16th January.
Health and welfare(previous reference:CC(68) 4thConclusions,Minute 3)NorthernIreland(previous reference:CC (68) 3rdConclusions)The Minister of Health said that he was in correspondence withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer about reductions in expenditure on local health and welfare, and hoped that proposals which he had put forward would be accepted.The Cabinet (4) Took note of the statement by the Minister of Health.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that he had had discussions with the Minister of Finance for Northern Ireland, Mr. Kirk, andSir Cecil Bateman, the Head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service.Mr. Kirk bad made it clear that, in so far as cuts in expenditure inNorthern Ireland did not follow automatically from decisions taken at Westminster, the Northern Ireland Government would be disposed to follow the lead given from here. This would result in similar measures in respect of prescription charges, the school-leaving age, social security cash benefits and family allowances. They would seek to make economies in the roads programme, although Mr. Kirkhad remarked that this would be difficult in rural areas where therewas high unemployment, and to secure economies in the use of manpower both in central and local government. These steps would result in a total saving of some  5 million. He proposed tohold further discussions with Mr. Kirk later in the week with a viewto settling the details flowing from the main decisions.Oversea AidExpenditure(previous reference:CC (68) 5thConclusions)The Cabinet (5) Took note that a saving of  5 million could be looked forin Northern Ireland expenditure.(6) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to prepare a form of words to be used in the Prime Minister^ statement inParliament on 16th January.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the reason for theincrease in the forecast of Government oversea expenditure givenin paragraph 45 of C (68) 5 was that  245 million had been allowed for oversea aid in 1968-69 and 1969-70 as against  205 million in1967-68. The other components of the total figures remainedconstant. The additional aid was for food aid under the kennedy round, an increased subscription to the International development association and provision for mitigatory aid to Singapore and malaysia, which had not yet been negotiated.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet accepted the report bythe Chief Secretary, Treasury: there should be no reference to overseaaid in his statement to the House of Commons on public expenditure.The Cabinet (7) Took note with approval of the statements by the PrimeMinister and the Chief Secretary, Treasury.
The Defence Secretary said that the largest item in the table ofexpenditure on other military defence given in paragraph 61 ofC (68) 5 was the purchase of United States military aircraft underloan financing. Interest and repayment of principal fell within thedefence budget; the remainder was shown under this heading foraccounting purposes to indicate the total consumption of resourceshowever financed. This figure would of course be considerablyaffected by decisions on the purchase of United States aircraft. Ofthe remaining items,  25 million represented civil superannuationpayments; the balance was provision for headquartersaccommodation, Stationery Office supplies and miscellaneous smallitems, on which he hoped to make savings.The Cabinet-(8) Took note of the statement by the Defence Secretary.The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (C (68) 9) on the numbers of non-industrial CivilServants.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the total number ofnon-industrial Civil Service staff had risen from 453,000 at 1st April,1967 to 468,000 at 1st January, 1968, and would rise to 474,000 by 1st April, 1968. Before account was taken of the policy changesagreed by the Cabinet in the present review, it was estimated thatthe staff total would increase to 481,000 by 1st April, 1969. Therewas considerable public criticism of the growth of the Civil Service,and it was essential that some reference to this should be made inthe forthcoming debate in Parliament. He proposed that theGovernment should announce their intention to hold total numbersuntil the end of the financial year 1968-69 at the level of 474,000planned for 1st April, 1968. His memorandum indicated staffeconomies which could be made as a result of policy decisions inthe present review; further staff savings, which had been discussed with Departments but not yet agreed with them, which could beachieved by a slowing down or by acceptance of a lower standardof service; and the scope for making further economies by changesin employment policy. By these means it should be practicable to limit staff numbers as he proposed, though this would call for theutmost restraint by Departments in their future manpower demands.In discussion there was general agreement with the proposal by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. An announcement on thismatter should be included in the Prime Minister^ statement inParliament on the following day. While this should avoid committing the Government to keeping staff numbers within a precise figure, since this might provoke unnecessary criticism if inthe event that figure were exceeded by a small margin, the statement should announce that the Government were adopting as a firm targetthe freezing of the total of non-industrial Civil Service staff duringthe financial year 1968-69. The Chancellor of the Exchequer would arrange for the Treasury to discuss manpower savings with each
LocalAuthorityManpowerDepartment. While it might be possible to allow Departments somefreedom, within their assigned total, to balance staff reductions inone area with increases in another, it could not be assumed that thiswould be permissible in all cases since absolute savings would berequired from some Departments if the target for the Civil service as a whole was to be achieved.In further discussion there was general agreement that thepassage in the Prime Minister^ statement on Civil service manpower should go on to announce that the rebuilding ofGovernment offices in Whitehall would be deferred until the end of1969-70 or i970-71, though discussions on planning and possiblysome work on site clearance would go ahead.The Cabinet (9) Agreed that the Government should announce as a firmtarget that they intended to prevent any increase in thetotal number of non-industrial Civil Servants during thefinancial year 1968-69, and invited the Chancellor of theExchequer to supply a passage to this effect for inclusion in the Prime Minister^ statement in Parliament on16th January.(10) Invited the Minister of Public Building and Works to supplya passage for the Prime Minister^ statement announcing the deferment of the rebuilding of Government offices in whitehall on the lines indicated in discussion.The Cabinet considered a memorandum (C (68) 8) by the first secretary of State about local authority manpower.The First Secretary of State said that he had discussed with theMinisters concerned the possibility of restricting the growth of localauthority manpower in 1968-69. They had concluded that, sincelocal authority manpower was not directly under the control of thecentral government, the only means of procuring economies in this field was through the limitation of the rate support grant. In viewof the decision which had now been taken by the Cabinet on thissubject, Ministers should point out to local authorities, in the courseof the consultation which would take place after the Prime ministers statement, that decisions taken now could procure savings in expenditure on staff at the time when the limitation on the amountof local expenditure accepted as eligible for rate support grant wouldtake effect. To a considerable extent, however, the numbers of staff employed by local authorities reflected policies determined centrally,and the Ministers concerned had agreed that the Home AffairsCommittee should be asked to examine the possibility of postponing the appointed days in any legislation now pending which wouldmake increased demands on local authority staff.The Cabinet-(11) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation withthe Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister of housing and Local Government and the Secretary of
State for Wales, to prepare a form of words on economies in local authority manpower for inclusion in the PrimeMinister^ statement.The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Economic Affairs and the Minister of Public Building and Works(C (68) 20) on the implications for the construction industry of thetotal programme of public expenditure savings proposed by theChancellor of the Exchequer.The Secretary of State for Economic Affairs said that it was estimated that the total effect of the proposed reductions in public expenditure would be that the output of the construction industry,which had been expected to increase by 5-3 per cent and 5-5 percent in 1968 and 1969 respectively, would now increase by only - 2 per cent and 3 -1 per cent in those years. Over recent years the industry had achieved an improvement in output per worker ofsome 4 per cent per annum. The prospect was therefore that outputover the next two years would increase at a rate lower than thatwhich could be achieved with the industry&apos;s present manpower and resources. This would be a substantial change and a considerableredeployment of manpower to other industries could be expected.It was difficult to estimate the timing of the effects on the industry,but substantial unemployment could develop in the winter of1968-69. The effects might be particularly severe in some regions,though there had not been time to make estimates of this. It wastherefore important that the Government should keep under review the employment prospects in the industry since, if it was later decidedthat some extra work should be brought forward to keepunemployment down to an acceptable level, particularly in thedevelopment areas, the preparations could not be left till the last moment.The Minister of Public Building and Works said it had beensuggested in the Cabinet&apos;s earlier discussion that the recovery in industrial building might take up any slack which developed in theconstruction industry. It was, however, estimated that there wouldbe no increase in 1968-69 in building for private industry, though there should be an increase of some 10 per cent in the following year. It was desirable that some reference to the implications forthe construction industry of the cuts in public expenditure shouldbe made in the forthcoming debate in Parliament. In order to forestall gloomy pronouncements by spokesmen for the industry,it should be emphasised that an expansion in the industry&apos;s outputof some 3 per cent was still expected in 1968 despite the cuts, andthat planning and design work should continue so as to facilitatea further increase in output as soon as circumstances permitted.In discussion it was argued that the demands on the construction industry for new industrial building in the private sector could beexpected to increase more sharply than had been suggested, if due allowance were made for the expected recovery in exports and forthe effects of the Governmenfs regional policies.   Nevertheless, the
continued expansion of the construction industry had been animportant factor in maintaining employment in the development areas; the public sector accounted for a high proportion of construction work in these areas and the cuts could have serious effects there in the winter of 1968-69. It was therefore important that contingency plans for the commissioning of new work during next winter should be prepared in good time so that full regardcould be paid to regional and economic priorities in drawing up a programme.There was a general agreement that a reference to the implications for the construction industry on the lines proposed bythe Minister of Public Building and Works should be included inthe speech by the Chancellor of the Exchequer during theforthcoming debate in Parliament, or in a speech by some other minister during the debate if the Chancellor of the Exchequerjudged that to be more appropriate.The Cabinet (12) Invited the Minister of Public Building and Works tosupply to the Chancellor of the Exchequer a passage onthe implications for the construction industry of the reductions in public expenditure, on the lines proposedin discussion, for inclusion in a Ministerial speech duringthe forthcoming debate in Parliament.(13) Invited the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, inconsultation with the Ministers concerned, including theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Secretary of Statefor Wales, to arrange for contingency plans for new construction work to be prepared in time for use duringthe winter of 1968-69 if the employment situation should require this.Procedure The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet should meet again at.30 that afternoon to take up their discussion of the overall balanceof the package of measures on which they had now decided, and toconsider the text of the draft statement which had now been circulated to Departments. In these discussions the Cabinet wouldalso consider two tables setting out the financial effect of the reductions in public expenditure programmes now envisaged,copies of which would be made available to Ministers at once.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,16th January, 1968.
