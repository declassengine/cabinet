ParliamentCommonwealthImmigration(previous reference:CC (68) 15thConclusions,Minute 1)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Chief Whip said that 43 peers had indicated their intentionto speak on the Commonwealth Immigrants Bill that afternoon and if the Bill were amended in the House of Lords it was possiblethat it would not be returned to the House of Commons in time tosecure Royal Assent on the following day. If, however, the Houseof Lords were likely to pass the Bill during the night it might bepossible to suspend the House of Commons sitting until the Housereceived the Bill.The Lord Privy Seal said that it was probable that the House ofLords would pass the Bill in the early hours of Friday morning andthat there would be no amendments. This could not, however, be guaranteed.In discussion it was suggested that it would be more convenient to the House of Commons if the sitting were suspended until 9 a.m.on Friday, when the Lords amendments could if necessary beconsidered before the normal sitting began. If the discussion wereprolonged in either House, the Caravan Sites Bill, introduced byMr. Eric Lubbock, would be at risk, and this might deter opponents of the Commonwealth Immigrants Bill from employing dilatorytactics.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, subjectto confirmation that these arrangements were acceptable to theauthorities of the House, it would no doubt be for the convenience of Members if, rather than keeping them in the House until the Billcame back from the House of Lords, the sitting were suspendeduntil 9 a.m., and the Chief Whip should pursue the necessary consultations to this end.The Cabinet Invited the Lord President to make arrangements, in thelight of consultation with the authorities of the House ofCommons, to ensure that the House of Commons could, ifnecessary, consider Lords amendments to the Common-wealth Immigrants Bill on the morning of the following day.OverseaAffairsPeople&apos;republic ofthe SouthernvemenPreviousReference:CC (68) 14thConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Lord Chalfont)said that the outcome of the trial of the former Federal Ministers was now unlikely to be known for another week or more. Our warningswith regard to the dangerous situation which might arise if deathsentences were passed and carried out, seemed to have had someeffect on the moderate members of the South Yemen Government.Meanwhile, the Southern Yemen Minister of Defence had ordered the dismissal and expulsion of the 32 British military personnel whowere serving with the Southern Yemen forces under contracts8806a 2
concluded with the former Federal Government. There were no grounds to dispute this decision, but the Ambassador had protested against the manner of it and the accompanying anti-Britishstatements. The dismissals were probably related to an intention onthe part of the Southern Yemen Government to intervene militarilyin the Northern Yemen where the policy of the British Governmentwas one of non-involvement, and embarrassment might consequentlyresult from the presence of British personnel in the Southern Yemenforces. The continued presence of these men had already been an issue between the extremists and relative moderates in the southern yemen Government. The Ambassador had warned business firmsof the risks inherent in the situation, but had not yet reported any immediate danger to the British community.The Commonwealth Secretary said that a serious situation v/asdeveloping in Malta. The financial situation of the dockyard wascritical and it was faced with the possibility of closure in 10 days&apos; time.The consequent unemployment would create a potentially dangerousinternal security situation. The leader of the Malta Labour Party,Mr. Mintoff, was planning to use his influence with the Malta general works&apos; Union as a means of bringing about the downfall of theGovernment of Dr. Borg Olivier. The crisis over the dockyard hadbeen brewing for some time; and it was unfortunate that it should come to a head just at the time when the first discharge notices underthe redundancy scheme for the Services&apos; rundown in Malta (whichwould not in themselves have serious repercussions) were due to beissued. His advice from the High Commissioner was that in viewof their divided loyalties neither the Police nor the Malta Land force could be relied on in a crisis. It was doubtful how Dr. Borg Olivierwould react to disorders, i.e., whether he would resign or appeal forassistance by British forces in restoring order. Under an exchangeof letters of September 1964 we were obliged to consider a request from the Malta Government for assistance in the event of a threat to internal security, but not necessarily to meet it. Nevertheless theHigh Commissioner and the Heads of the Services in Malta consideredthat it might be in our interest to give assistance and had recommended that contingency planning should be undertaken. Theonly hope of avoiding a crisis was to keep the dockyard open; andthe Lord Privy Seal, who had been examining this problem with asmall group of Ministers, was ready, subject to the agreement of theTreasury, to make recommendations to this end. Meanwhile he hoped that it would be possible for him at once to invite the PrimeMinister of Malta to come to London for urgent discussions, witha view to reaching a solution of the dockyard problem and avoiding a very serious internal security situation.The Lord Privy Seal said he would be making urgentrecommendations on the way we should proceed to seek a solution to the problem of the ownership of the dockyard.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that contingency plans were being made for military intervention if necessary and for theevacuation of British subjects. Doubt was expressed whether, evenif we were asked to do so, we should be wise to intervene militarily
Prices andIncomesFuture policy on ProductivityPrices and incomes(previous reference:CC (67) 74thConclusions.Minute 1)secret. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary ofState for Economic Affairs on Future Productivity, Prices and incomes Policy (C (68) 45), by the President of the Board of trade on Prices (C (68) 46), and by the First Secretary of State on incomes policy Assistance to Low-Paid Workers (C (68) 50).The Prime Minister said that the Cabinefs discussion of productivity, prices and incomes policy had again been preceded byPress speculation about the Governmenfs intentions; and this mightwell have had a prejudicial influence on the discussion of this subject in the conference of executives of the Unions affiliated to the TradesUnion Congress (TUC) held on the previous day. This wasregrettable, the more so because it put the Cabinet under pressure toreach early decisions on their policy in this field and limited to someextent their freedom of action. It was particularly important,therefore, to preserve the confidential character of the Cabinefsdeliberations on this sensitive topic.The Secretary of State for Economic Affairs said that, inconsultation with those of his colleagues most closely concerned, hehad reached the conclusion that it was essential to take furtherstatutory powers to control increases in pay and prices, includingrents, for the year from August 1968 and renewable annually in orderto retain the beneficial effect of devaluation on costs and on our competitive position, and to avoid the development of wage/price in order, in effect, to defend the Government of Malta against the malta Opposition, especially since we had no commitment to do so.On the other hand, it was pointed out that if the present malta government were to fall and be replaced by a Government under mr. Mintoff, Malta, with its strategic position in the Mediterranean,might become neutralist or perhaps worse; this would also entail theend of our Defence Agreement with Malta and the loss of theimportant defence facilities at present enjoyed by the North atlantic treaty Organisation.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas a clear risk that a critical situation might arise in Malta overthe week-end; and arrangements should be made whereby he andthe Ministers immediately concerned could be kept in close touchwith the situation. There was general agreement that thearrangements proposed by the Lord Privy seal&apos;s group for keeping the dockyard open should be adopted subject to the agreement ofthe Chancellor of the Exchequer to their financial implications.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the statement by theCommonwealth Secretary and of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.
inflation. While the increase of wages and salaries between July1967 and July 1968 seemed likely to amount to 6J per cent if incomes policy continued on its present basis, the effect of devaluation on thecost of living made it very probable that the increase in income per head would in fact be as much as 7 or even 9 per cent over thefollowing year, taking account also of increases in the demand for labour and in company liquidity. The situation could not be contained by fiscal measures alone; and, in the light of the very smallmajority vote in favour of a voluntary incomes policy in the TradesUnion Congress (TUC) General Council on the previous day, theGovernment could no longer rely on a policy of voluntary restraint.A stronger policy and increased statutory powers were thus essential if the increase in pay and prices was to be limited to the extent necessary.He recommended that the basis of this stronger policy should bea ceiling of 1\ per cent for wage and salary increases, to be appliedas an annual rate from the terminal date of the previous increase,and that this should apply to all the main elements in remuneration.All increases up to this ceiling should be justified against the existingcriteria and any larger increases must be staged over a period. Ifthe pressure to allow increases above the ceiling was to be successfully resisted, it was essential that there should be no exceptions, except inrelation to genuine productivity agreements which conformed to theguide-lines laid down by the National Board for Prices and Incomes(NBPI). It would be impracticable to allow exceptions in the caseof lower-paid workers because of the pressure to extend such increases to the higher paid in order to maintain differentials. Acomplementary policy should be pursued in relation to prices. Toenforce these policies, the existing powers in the prices and incomesfield should be continued and extended in order to enable theGovernment, without any requirement to refer cases to the NBPI,to direct employers not to give pay increases contrary to their policy or to stop paying an increase already given. Similarly, theGovernment should have power to defer the implementation of the awards of statutory wage-fixing bodies; to defer proposed price increases; and to require reversion of increases already made. Themaximum period of delay that could be imposed on pay or price increases should be extended to 12 months; and retrospectivepayments to be made after the end of the period of deferment shouldbe prohibited. The Government should also be enabled to imposeprice reductions if the NBPI so recommended. It would be desirablethat these powers should be renewable annually by affirmative resolution.Prices and incomes policy had become at once the central andthe most sensitive element in the Governmenfs political and economic strategy; and there would be formidable political difficulties in implementing these recommendations. The Government could notrely on any substantial degree of support from the TUC; and theannounced desire of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) forstronger measures was likely to prove counter-productive in thisrespect.  Further, it would be clear to the public that their standard
of living would be frozen, and, in the case of some groups, reduced;and, if the cost of living were increased by any other factors,resistance to the incomes policy would be correspondinglystrengthened. In his view, his recommendations could be successfully implemented only on three conditions. First, increases in prices and charges should be handled as firmly as possible.Proposals for price increases of economic significance must be seen to be rigorously examined, including increases in the retail field; andthe existing criteria for increases must be strictly applied. the voluntary early warning arrangements for prices, and the statutorynotification of price increases, should be extended. Further, rentsmust be brought within the machinery for delay and control. Whilethe rent of private houses was in general already controlled orregulated, and while there were difficulties in intervening in rent-fixing by local authorities especially if local authorities were notto be discouraged from fulfilling their house-building programmes,the Housing Ministers had under consideration the possibility ofphasing larger rent increases in both the public and private sectors.Second, it would be essential to seek to restrict increases in propertyincomes in symmetry with the restriction of earned incomes. Third,provision must be made to avoid hardship among the lower-paid workers, who would not be excepted from the 3-J per cent ceiling on pay increases generally. Examination had shown that the onlypossibility of assisting lower-paid workers in the coming year in a manner likely to promote the incomes policy was through an increasein family allowances.The Minister of Labour said that he was in general agreementwith the proposals outlined by the Secretary of State for economic affairs. In his view it was now no longer possible to rely on a voluntary incomes policy based on the vetting of claims by the TUC.The effect of devaluation would put an increasing strain on anycontinued voluntary arrangements; for example, it seemed likely that the index of food prices, which were a main item in the retail prices index, was likely to increase from 113-5 to 125-5 in the12 months ending in June. Further, there had been a shift of power at the centre of the TUC; and powerful unions, such as the transport and General Workers&apos; and the Amalgamated Engineering andFoundryworkers&apos; Unions, were opposed to the TUC policy andwould be likely either to refuse to submit pay claims to the TUC orto ignore TUC recommendations on such claims. Moreover, theattitude of the CBI had changed; and it could no longer be relied upon to give the TUC the co-operation that was essential to thesuccess of a voluntary incomes policy. The stronger policy nowproposed would involve intervention in wage negotiations at factorylevel; this would throw a heavy burden of additional work on his department, but was essential if control over national agreementswas to be adequately reinforced.The President of the Board of Trade said that while he did notconsider that the case for a policy as severe as that now proposed
had been fully set out, in all the circumstances he accepted that, iffresh powers were taken to control incomes, some reasonable parallelaction would be needed in relation to prices. It was important,however, that the Government should not promise more than theycould perform. If, for example, they gave the impression of adopting a much stronger policy towards prices and if, as was certain,prices subsequently increased substantially as a result of devaluation,their policy would appear to have failed. In relation to the statutorynotification of price increases, he considered that his present reserve powers were already sufficient. There was no need for generalcompulsory notification, which would result in a wasteful use of staff and destroy the co-operation which was at present forthcoming from industry and trade. In relation to the statutory powers to reduceprices and defer price increases, he would be content with power toenforce a recommendation of the NJBPI that a price should be reduced or an increase deferred. But the criteria which had to be applied to price increases were very different from, and more complex than,those applicable to pay increases; and his Department had neitherthe knowledge nor the resources to enable them to make decisionsof this kind and to defend them without reference to the NBPI.Accordingly, he wished to reserve his position on these two aspectsof the proposals of the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs.The Attorney-General said that the Cabinet should consider theconsequences in terms of enforcement of taking the new powersproposed. There were inherent dangers in bringing the criminal lawinto the field of employer/employee relationships and contractualagreements, not least where public authorities and Wage Councilswere involved. If the powers proposed were taken, it would bedifficult to avoid using them in face of any clear breach of thelegislation; and a challenge to the unions in the courts would therefore be inevitable. The Cabinet should consider theconsequences for the wages policy if such action in the courts resultedin industrial action. Additionally, there would be attempts to evadethe powers by action which fell short of strike action, for exampleby working to rule or working &quot; without enthusiasm &quot;; and in thesecircumstances an offence might be difficult to prove. There mightbe similar difficulty in relation to the proposed power to preventretrospective payment of wage increases.In discussion the Cabinet first considered incomes policy. Itwas argued that the Government would be unwise to proceed withthe proposals recommended by the Secretary of State for economic affairs. To attempt a drastic policy of this kind, backed by extensivestatutory powers, would be liable to create disunity amongst the government&apos;s supporters and could be expected to lead in a short time to confrontations with some of the major unions, with alikelihood of extensive strikes. This would raise acute problems of enforcement; and the resulting political and economic repercussionscould be extremely serious. In the various phases of the incomes policy since July 1966, the Government had drawn heavily on the loyalty and co-operation of the trade unions and of their supportersgenerally; they could not continue to do this indefinitely.  The case
CC 16 (68)for such a drastic policy had not been made out: there was insufficientevidence of the degree of inflation which would be likely to result from the continuance of the incomes policy on a mainly voluntary basis, particularly in relation to the likely position in our competitorcountries abroad. Apart from the period of complete standstill on wages in the second half of 1966, the incomes policy in its various forms had not hitherto been effective; in particular, no real progress had been made in putting right anomalies in wage structures and in improving the position of the lowest paid.On the other hand it was argued that a more stringent policyand stronger statutory powers were essential in the economic situationwhich the country now faced. The average increase in incomes per head since July 1967 had been about 6 per cent. In the absence ofa stronger policy, the increase over the next 12 months could beexpected to be even larger because of rising prices, an increasing demand for labour and greater company liquidity. There was no prospect that productivity would increase on such a scale as to offset the inflationary effects of wage increases of this order. The narrowmajority secured by the TUC General Council for their proposals on incomes policy at the conference of trade union executives on theprevious day had underlined the fact that a largely voluntary incomes policy would be inadequate to cope with the situation. It wasmisleading to say that the incomes policy had hitherto beenineffective: once the Government had taken the measure of theeconomic importance of the policy, results had been achieved in the periods of standstill and severe restraint which could not have been secured by voluntary means. Nor could we take comfort from thepossibility that our competitors abroad would experience the same degree of inflation as we could expect in the absence of a stricterpolicy: our competitors did not face a comparable post-devaluationsituation nor had they our burden of accumulated international debt.Our whole economic future depended on securing the benefits of devaluation for the balance of payments. If we were to allowextensive wage increases, it might be possible to some extent to mitigate the effects on demand by fiscal measures; but these couldnot deal with the equally serious problems of the effects on industry&apos;scosts. It was essential to consider the proposals on incomes policyagainst the background of recent experience: wages in 1967 had risen by some 6 per cent, while prices had gone up by only 2 per cent,and the resulting increase in real wages had not been matched by increases in productivity; this was bound to have adverserepercussions on the movement of real wages in 1968.In further discussion it was argued that there could be no assurance that Parliament would approve legislation on the lines recommended in C (68) 45; nor would it be satisfactory if its passagewas secured only by a small majority. If adequate Parliamentarysupport was to be forthcoming, it would be essential for the policy on wages to be matched by equally severe measures to restrainproperty incomes and dividends; and the Governments fiscal policy would need to be seen to be directed towards a more deliberateredistribution of wealth.
The Cabinet next discussed prices policy. There was support for the view that, while it would be essential for the Government totake strong action in respect of selected price increases where these were not fully justified by increased costs, it would be unwise to givethe public the impression that more could be done towards keepingprices stable than would in fact be possible. Price increases wereinevitable following devaluation; indeed, there were sound economic reasons for allowing them to take place wherever they were justified by cost increases. In this situation, it would be wrong to set upextensive machinery for price control, since it could not, and shouldnot, prevent substantial price increases and would therefore be boundto be condemned as ineffective. Nor would it be sensible to attemptto frame statutory powers over prices so as to make them exactlyparallel with the proposed powers over incomes. On the other hand,it was argued that rigorous action on prices was essential to thesuccess of incomes policy. The recent report by the NBPI ondistributors&apos; margins (Cmnd. 3546) had shown that, if no action were taken, the maintenance of traditional percentage margins bydistributors would be likely to lead to unnecessarily high retail prices.This was only one example of the scope for Government action to restrain price increases; and it was essential that such action shouldbe pursued vigorously.The Cabinet then turned to consider rents. The Minister of housing said that he supported the proposals to take powers overrent increases set out in the annex to C (68) 45. Rents of privateaccommodation were, with unimportant exceptions, already subjecteither to rent control or rent regulation. In the former case rentswere in effect frozen. Under rent regulation, fair rents were determined by rent officers or rent assessment committees on principles quite different from those of prices and incomes policy;and these determinations sometimes resulted in sharp increases. Itwas the large, sudden increases which were particularly damagingfrom the point of view of prices and incomes policy; and it wastherefore proposed that the Housing Ministers should be empoweredto prescribe a system whereby large increases in private rents wouldbe subject to staging over a period of net more than three years. Thedetails would need further consideration: for example, it would benecessary to decide whether staging should be applied to rentdeterminations in respect of luxury flats. As regards local authorityrents, it was proposed that powers should be taken to requireauthorities to give early warning of rent increases, to require thestaging of rent increases so as to limit the size of increases in any oneyear and to direct in particular cases the date from which the increase should take effect. There were a number of difficulties about theseproposals. Many local authority rents were bound to increase as new houses came to be let; since the recent guidance on rent policyissued by the Housing Ministers, there had already been somemoderation of rent increases and the larger increases had in somecases been staged over a period; if, through Government intervention,local authorities were faced with the need for a greater contribution from the rates to the housing revenue account, this might lead to
reductions in housing programmes or other desirable forms ofexpenditure; and local authorities would resent Government intrusioninto a field which was traditionally their responsibility. But despitethese considerations, the need to bring local authority rents withinthe scope of the prices and incomes policy was overriding; and he therefore supported the proposals, subject to further examination ofthe details by the Housing Committee. It would be desirable forthe Housing Ministers to begin consultations with the local authority associations as soon as possible.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that the proposalscreated a special problem in Scotland, where local authority rentsWere in many cases unreasonably low and where the government&apos;s policy had been to encourage increases. He had some reservations about the specific proposals in the annex to C (68) 45 and would welcome further discussion in the Housing Committee.In discussion there was general support in principle for theproposed powers over private and local authority rents, subject tofurther consideration of the details by the Housing Committee.The Prime Minister said that there would not be time for theCabinet to complete their consideration of future policy on productivity, prices and incomes at the present meeting. So far asthe discussion had gone, the majority view had favoured acceptancein principle of the memorandum by the Secretary of State for economic Affairs (C (68) 45). But further consideration would haveto be given to some of the issues which had been raised in discussion,including the proposals to increase family allowances (in relation tothe criteria governing the pay of lower-paid workers); the alternativepossibilities in respect of future policy on prices; the problems of enforcement of the proposed powers in respect of prices and incomes; and a more detailed assessment by the ministerial committee on Housing of the proposed policy to restrain increases in rents.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for the ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomes to circulate,for consideration at an early meeting, an assessment ofthe alternative possibilities in respect of future policy on prices.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs toconsider further, in consultation with the Law Officersand in the light of the Cabinets discussion, the problemsof enforcement of the powers proposed in his memorandum C (68) 45, based so far as possible ondrafting instructions for the necessary legislation; and toreport further to the Cabinet, if necessary.
(4) Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange for the ministerial Committee on Housing to consider, in more detail, the application of the proposals for restraint of rent increases.AgricultureFarm price review for1968(previous reference:CC(68) 11thConclusions,Minute 4)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the first secretary of State (C (68) 48) reporting the position reached with theNational Farmers&apos; Union (NFU).The First Secretary of State said that the Minister of Agriculture,having found that it would not be possible to reach agreement withthe NFU on the basis of a total award of  50 million, had, with his consent, explored the possibility of reaching an agreed settlementwithin the ceiling of  524- million which the Cabinet had imposed.The Committee on Agricultural Policy, under his chairmanship, had agreed at their meeting on 26th February that the Minister ofAgriculture should be authorised to offer the abolition of the standard quantity for wheat as well as an increase of Is. 6d. per cwt. TheCommittee, while agreeing to an increase in the guaranteed price forbeef of 12s. 6d. per cwt., did not agree with a proposal by the Ministerof Agriculture that he should also give an assurance that the newhigher price would not be reduced for the next two reviews.The Prime Minister said that the President of the NFU had called on him on the previous evening and had suggested that an agreed settlement should be possible at about  58 million providedone or two relatively minor points could also be settled. He had given the President of the NFU no encouragement whatever to thinkthat the Government would be prepared to consider so large an award.The Minister of Agriculture said that the negotiations had been difficult. The farmers were facing cost increases of  68^ million sincethe last review and had originally asked for an award which fullyrecouped these additional costs. They had pointed out that thebenefits from the last review, which had been deliberately generous inorder to encourage increased production and import saving, hadbeen largely eroded by exceptionally large cost increases since thatreview. He had told them that in the present economic situation,bearing in mind the Governmenfs prices and incomes policy and the cuts which had been necessary in public expenditure, the farmersmust absorb a substantial part of the additional costs. In the lightof his discussions he considered that it would not be possible toreach an agreed settlement at  524 million but that agreement mightwell be possible at  55 million. The addition was required forassistance to livestock rearing, particularly on hill farms, including those in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. If the guaranteed price of milk were raised by id. to a 1+d. a gallon this would produce the extra  24 million required without any additional call on theExchequer: it would lead to an increase to 104-d. a pint in the retail price of milk from 1st June next instead of 1st July. If this were agreed, he would propose to redistribute somewhat the remaining 524- million in order to increase the hill cow and beef cow subsidies.
An agreed settlement would thus cost relatively little nothing to theExchequer but would have a disproportionately favourable effecton the farmers&apos; general attitude and, therefore, on agricultural output.The Secretary of State for Scotland and the Secretary of Statefor Wales, supporting the proposals of the Minister of Agriculture,emphasised the importance of stimulating livestock rearing as a means of using relatively poor land for import saving.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that an importantprinciple was at stake. An award of  524- million would involve anincrease of  40 million in public expenditure or 0-3 per cent overthe increase of 3f per cent for 1968-69 which had been announcedafter the public expenditure cuts in January. An increase in family allowances as well would raise the figure to 4 - 3 per cent; and therewere further requests on the way. The Government must hold theline. Last year&apos;s agricultural settlement had been recognised by the farmers and others as unusually generous; and  52^- million shouldbe the absolute limit for 1968-69.In discussion it was suggested that failure to reach an agreed settlement would not, in itself, affect the level of future agricultural production. Indeed, the NFU representatives might themselvesprefer to be seen by their constituents to be in&apos;disagreement fromtime to time about the level of the awards. On the other hand, it was argued that agricultural production had levelled off in recent yearsand that the recovery expected as a result of last year&apos;s rathergenerous review would not materialise unless the Government were now prepared to offset somewhat more of the substantial increases infarmers&apos; costs since then.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the total award should not exceed  52-J- million and endorsed the decisions of the Committee on Agricultural policy that the standard quantity for wheat should be abolished and that nofurther assurances should be given about beef prices in future years.They recognised that this decision would put the Minister ofAgriculture in a difficult position; but a number of other ministers had also recently had to accept difficult decisions because of the overriding need to restrain public expenditure.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Agriculture to limit the total awardto  52^ million in the farm price settlement for 1968.The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the First Secretaryof State (C (68) 47) about the compensation for losses from theepidemic of foot-and-mouth disease.The First Secretary of State said that the Agricultural PolicyCommittee had been unable to reach agreement on a proposal bythe Minister of Agriculture relating to compensation for farmerswho had suffered losses resulting from the epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease.  Compensation was based on the market value of the
cattle at the time when they were slaughtered: cattle prices had increased by 25 per cent since the early weeks of the epidemic, andconsequently farmers affected in the early stages had found theircompensation insufficient to re-stock at the market prices nowprevailing. They had also suffered by being put out of business forseveral months by the restrictions on re-stocking. The Minister ofAgriculture had proposed that their compensation should be brought up to the level received by farmers whose stock had been affectedlater. He estimated that the cost would be between  800,000 and 900,000. It was relevant that existing compensation was subject total, a fact that was said to be causing resentment among the farming community; that farmers who had suffered losses had already beenhelped by ploughing grants to encourage a switch to arable farming and a grant for replacing dairy cattle by &quot; dry stock &quot;, at a total costof  500,000; and that it was open to farmers to insure againstfoot-and-mouth disease, though few did so.It had been argued against the proposal that to depart from theexisting basis of compensation would be dangerous, that in equitythe farmers who had benefited from the rise in prices should meetthe cost of compensation for those who had suffered from it and that farmers who had been paid compensation early had been able toobtain some return on the money before re-stocking. On the otherhand, it had been said that a departure from the usual formula was justified by the exceptional length of the epidemic, that a levy wouldnot be practicable, and that the return on the compensation paymentswas negligible. There had been some support in the Committee fora middle course, which he recommended to the Cabinet, that additional compensation should be paid, but only to the extent of 500,000, some of which would return to the Exchequer in tax.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there was no justification for providing the amount of assistance from theExchequer which the Minister of Agriculture had proposed. the equitable way of helping the farmers whose stock had been affectedin the early stages of the epidemic was to encourage the industry tointroduce a self-balancing levy scheme to which the exchequer could make a contribution on a pound-for-pound basis up to, say, 250,000.In discussion it was pointed out that the Cabinet, having only recently taken painful decisions in order to reduce public expenditure,should be reluctant to agree to proposals for further subventions tothe farmers in addition to the help which had already been given tothem in compensation and by other measures. A levy system mightnot prove practicable, and would possibly be no more acceptable tothe farmers than the levies proposed to finance training schemes andthe Meat and Livestock Commission. Nevertheless, in view of theprofits which some farmers had been able to make from the sale of cattle for re-stocking, this offered the most equitable method of assisting the farmers for whom additional help was sought.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that further assistance from the Exchequer must
Foot-and-mouth disease:Meat ImportBan(previous reference:CC (67) 69thConclusions,Minute 6)be strictly limited and should be given only in the context of a levysystem to which the farming community would make an equalcontribution. The Minister of Agriculture should therefore discuss with the National Farmers&apos; Union the introduction of such a scheme,to which the Exchequer should contribute on a pound-for-poundbasis up to  250,000. If the farmers were unwilling to co-operate inthese proposals, the responsibility for failing to help those who had suffered at the beginning of the epidemic would rest on the industry itself.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Minister of Agriculture to enter into discussions with the National Farmers&apos; Union on the basis indicatedin the Prime Ministers summing up.The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the First Secretaryof State (C (68) 49) about future policy in relation to meat imports.The First Secretary of State said that he had been considering,with the Ministers directly concerned, future policy in relation tomeat imports. It would be necessary for the Minister of agriculture to announce on 4th March whether the ban on imports frompotentially dangerous sources, temporarily imposed on 4th december last, should now be maintained or removed. The Ministers directly involved had been unable to reach agreement about this or to find any suitable compromise. He had formed the opinion that thebalance of the arguments, which were set out in his paper, weighed infavour of lifting the ban now, though he recognised that theGovernment would certainly then be subjected to criticism whenthe next outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease occurred. We had hitherto accepted that the risk involved in importing Latin Americanmeat was acceptable because of the countervailing advantages. he believed that this was still the case and that the consequences of continuing to ban imports from Latin America would be serious both for our export trade and for the cost of living.The Minister of Agriculture said that he did not regard theproposal to maintain the ban on imports as a decisive change from existing policy: it should be remembered that we had bannedimports of Argentine pig meat since 1961 because it had been responsible for outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in this country.The recent, unparalleled, epidemic had been a severe shock to british agriculture. If another major outbreak occurred after the presentimport ban had been lifted it would have the most serious consequences for agriculture, and for the Government. The UnitedStates (in common with many other countries) banned imports of meat from the Argentine while enjoying a substantial export tradewith her. It seemed extremely doubtful whether the argentine government would in fact retaliate if the ban were maintained.Argentina had a large favourable balance of trade with us, coveringmany other products in addition to meat, which they would not wishto place in jeopardy.   He therefore recommended that the ban
should continue at least until the Committee under the chairmanship of the Duke of Northumberland, which had recently been established to review future policy for dealing with foot-and-mouth disease, had reported. The Committee could be asked for an interim report onmeat imports within a matter of a few months.In discussion it was suggested that, since the NorthumberlandCommittee would not be examining the full economic and political implications of restricting imports but only the animal health aspects,its report would not be likely to assist the Government in reaching a decision. Moreover, the longer the ban was maintained the moredifficult it would be to remove it. We should be breaking a firmundertaking to the Argentine Government if we maintained the banfor even another few months; and there were good reasons for believing that such a breach of faith, combined with the loss of avery important traditional market and the consequences forArgentine trade elsewhere of the aspersions cast on Argentine meat,would bring a sharp reaction. The new Argentine Government werebringing the economy under control for the first time for many yearsand were also pursuing a deliberate policy of transferring a substantial part of their purchases from the United States to Western Europe.Argentina therefore offered us the prospect of an expanding market;and some very important Government contracts were under negotiation with British manufacturers now and others were in theoffing apart from substantial private trade. The cost of foot-and-mouth disease over the last 17 years had averaged some  2 million ayear. A substantially larger export trade than this was at stake. Wehad closed an important market in South Africa to our exportersthrough Government intervention; and we could not afford to dothe same in Latin America.On the other hand it was urged that, if the Government lifted theban and there was then another major outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, the political consequences would be liable to be serious.Argentina already had a highly favourable balance of trade with us and was therefore in a weak position to retaliate. The Governmentof the Irish Republic were seriously concerned at the risks involvedfor their farmers if we re-admitted Latin American meat. A serioussetback for Irish agriculture would not only affect our exports to theIrish Republic, which were many times larger than those to theArgentine, but would also lead to serious shortages of meat here.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thereport by the Chief Veterinary Officer of the Ministry of Agriculturehad suggested that Argentine lamb was probably responsible for therecent epidemic. It would therefore be reasonable, and defensiblein relation to the Argentine, if the Government were to continue toban imports of mutton and lamb from the Argentine until theNorthumberland Committee had reported. The Government wouldthen be able to consider the general policy further in the light of theCommittee&apos;s report; but meanwhile a decision to restrict imports oflamb would be in line with the decision taken by the then Governmentin 1961 to ban imports of pig meat from the Argentine because an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease had been traced to this source.
The Minister of Agriculture should therefore announce to the Houseof Commons on 4th March that the Government intended to maintainthe present ban only on imports of mutton and lamb from theArgentine and that this ban would be reconsidered, together withour general policy towards meat imports, in the light of the reportby the Northumberland Committee. The Minister of agriculture ahould also try to arrange technical discussions with the argentine government about ways and means of reducing the risks of infectionfrom Argentine meat generally. The report by the Chief VeterinaryOfficer should be published as a Command Paper as proposed bythe Minister of Agriculture.The Cabinet (3) Invited the Minister of Agriculture:(i) to inform the House of Commons on 4th March thatthe temporary ban on imports of meat, imposed on 4th December last, would be lifted immediatelyexcept in respect of Argentine mutton and lamb;(ii) to try to arrange technical discussions with theArgentine Government about the possibility of reducing the risks of infection from importedArgentine meat;(iii) to arrange for publication as a Command Paper on 4th March of the report by the Chief VeterinaryOfficer about the origin of the recent epidemic offoot-and-mouth disease.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,29th February, 1968.
