Oversea AffairsApproachto Europe(previous reference :CC(68) 11thConclusions,Minute 2)People&apos;republic ofthe southern yemen(previous reference :CC(68) 13thConclusions,Minute 3)The Foreign Secretary said that the situation in the southern yemen looked dangerous. The court trying the former FederalMinisters had held secret and open sessions. The charges accusedthe former Ministers of co-operating with us and were so framed as to put us in the dock as well. Letters from Members ofParliament (one a former Minister) had been quoted in court as evidence. He had done everything he could to bring home to thePresident of the People&apos;s Republic of the Southern Yemen,Qahtan-al-Shaabi, the dangerous situation which would arise if deathsentences were passed and carried out. He had also invited theSecretary-General of the United Nations to use his good offices; butthere was no question of delaying the admission of the southern yemen to the United Nations since she was already a member. Itwas not certain that any death sentences would be carried out; butif these men were executed for collaborating with us while we were responsible for the government of the territory, it would beCONFIDENTIAL1. The Foreign Secretary said that the Cabinet would be discussing future foreign policy comprehensively, and in particularfuture relations with Western Europe, at their meeting on Tuesday,27th February. He would not therefore comment at this stage onthe substance of recent developments. His colleagues would however wish to know that the Prime Minister and he had haduseful discussions on 19th and 20th February with the Dutch PrimeMinister, Mr. de Jong, and the Foreign Minister, Dr. Luns, with whom they had found themselves in general agreement. They hadshared a scepticism about the value of the Franco/GermanDeclaration which had been issued in Paris at the conclusion of theFederal German Chancellor^ visit on 16th February. There were at present no concrete proposals underlying the Declaration.Despite their common scepticism they had agreed with the DutchMinisters that the Declaration should not be dismissed out of handand that it should be made clear to the German Government thatthe onus now rested on them to produce some substantive proposals;if they managed to do so the British Government would be ready toexamine them. Meanwhile, they also shared with the DutchMinisters the conviction that the Benelux proposals offered thefirmest and most hopeful basis for developing economic and politicalcollaboration in Europe after the veto. Since the meeting withthe Dutch Ministers, he had heard from the Italian Foreign Minister,Sr. Fanfani, who had expressed strong disapproval of the german attitude in Paris and who continued to support the benelux proposals. He had also discussed the Franco/German declaration on the previous day at some length with Herr Duckwitz, StateSecretary at the German Foreign Ministry, who had confirmed thatthere were no substantive proposals underlying it. He had not yetheard the outcome of discussions which Dr. Luns had had on theprevious day with the Federal German Foreign Minister,Herr Brandt.
impossible for us to continue aid or even perhaps to maintaindiplomatic relations with the Southern Yemen. It would not benecessary immediately to discontinue aid since the instalments dueup to the end of March had already been paid. But negotiations for future aid should begin shortly and any indication that none wouldbe available might create a situation in which it would be necessaryto evacuate the British community. The Defence Secretary had made the necessary naval dispositions; and an operation could bemounted at any time.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Foreign Secretary.LegislationCommonwealthImmigration(previous reference :CC (68) 13thConclusions,Minute 4)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary on immigration legislation (C (68) 39).The Home Secretary recalled that the Cabinet had deferred adecision on the restriction of the immigration of citizens of theUnited Kingdom and Colonies pending consultation with theGovernments of Kenya, India and Pakistan and examination by officials of the number of Asian immigrants from Kenya who couldbe admitted if it were decided to legislate. He said that, despite the difficult administrative and other problems that would be involved, he remained of the opinion that it was essential and urgentfor us to legislate to restrict the flow of immigrants from Kenyato this country who were now arriving at a rate of from 200 to300 a day. If this rate of entry were to continue, the pressures onthe social services would be such that large additional expenditure would be required, particularly on education and housing, and ourrace relations policy would be in jeopardy. Further examinationhad shown that the measures which were to be taken againstclandestine immigration and to restrict the right of entry of the dependent children and fathers of immigrants were unlikely to reduceimmigration by 5,000 annually as indicated in his memorandum; thereduction was more likely to be 1,000 to 2,000. Consultations withthe Government of Kenya had shown that they were not willing totake any action publicly to reassure Asians who were not citizens of Kenya about their future; and, although there were indications that the Government of Kenya might be prepared, in their own interests, to take some action administratively to reduce the pressure on these people if we were to deprive them of the automatic rightof entry into this country but at the same time allow a reasonablenumber to enter annually, this would not stem the flow of immigrants.Nor were the Governments of India and Pakistan ready to givepositive help with the problem. We should therefore legislate soas to deprive citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies who didnot belong to this country, not of their citizenship but of the automatic right to enter this country, and at the same time fix a rateof entry for them that was reasonable in relation to the problem itself,to our own social and economic difficulties and to the level of
immigration generally. Wide support could be expected in thiscountry for a policy on these lines and, although there would beobjections in other Commonwealth countries, they would in factunderstand our difficulties.He suggested that we might appropriately allow 1,000 headsof households to enter annually which, allowing for dependants,might mean a total entry of perhaps 5,000; the necessary arrangements could be made quickly in Kenya for operating a quota system. Although there was a case for at least some of part of the quota to be deducted from the total number of vouchers issued tocitizens of independent Commonwealth countries and to the dependent territories and Malta, the resulting reduction in totalimmigration would not, in the short run at any rate, make this step worth while, given the problems that it would cause for ourrelations with Commonwealth countries and in the administrationof the voucher scheme. If his proposals were approved he wouldmake a statement in Parliament later that day and the necessaryBill would then be tabled. He would also announce then theproposals to deal with clandestine immigration, with restrictionson the right of entry of the dependent children and fathers of immigrants and with the compulsory medical examination of thewives and children of immigrants.The Commonwealth Secretary said that it was clear that therewas no prospect of persuading the Government of Kenya to take any action publicly that would help to solve our problem; and thatthe administrative action that the Government might take toencourage non-citizens who were valuable to the economy of Kenyato stay there would not adequately reassure them. It was alsoclear that people who were not citizens of Kenya who left and thenattempted to return would not be readmitted; nor were the attitudesof the Governments of India and Pakistan helpful. Nevertheless,despite the problems that the flow of immigrants from Kenya posedfor us, it would be both wrong and self-defeating to deprive these people of their right to enter this country freely. We should bebreaking our pledges to them; our action would be contrary tocustomary international law and to our whole tradition in this field;and in practice we should find it impossible, on political as well as on administrative grounds, to refuse entry into this country to people who had nowhere else to go. We should be forced to make concessions to people who arrived without authority and were unableto return; and these concessions would be widened progressivelyso that all who wished to enter would have to be admitted. Theresult would be that we should incur odium without solving theproblem; we should therefore decide not to legislate in the matter.In discussion the balance of opinion in the Cabinet was strongly in favour of legislation to extend our immigration control so as toinclude citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies with no substantial connection with this country. Although the moral and legal objections to this course, and the problems which it would
raise for us internationally and administratively, were recognised,these were thought to be outweighed by the consequences for thesocial services, in terms of additional expenditure, and for ourrace relations policy, if the flow of immigrants from Kenya was allowed to continue unchecked. It was also accepted that thereshould be a special quota for these people and, on balance, that itshould be wholly additional to the total of vouchers normally issued to Commonwealth immigrants. It was argued that a quota of 1,000heads of households would be unduly restrictive, since it could beexpected to reduce the flow of immigrants from Kenya well below what had been normal&apos; before the recent crisis. There was some support for a figure of 2,500 but it was agreed that, initially at anyrate, a figure of 1,500 would be right. It was suggested that the criteria for selecting entrants should not, in this instance, be thosewhich were normally applied under the voucher scheme but shouldbe related to the pattern of migration that was resulting from the actions of the Government of Kenya.In further discussion it was argued that there would be advantage if the proposed legislation, which would be restrictive in nature,were to provide also for an appeals procedure on the lines recommended by the Departmental Committee on immigration appeals (the Wilson Committee) even if it would not be possibleto implement these procedures quickly. It was agreed, however, bothon financial grounds and because any further widening of the scopeof the proposed Bill would be likely to prevent its early enactment,that it should not provide for an appeals procedure. No more couldbe said at this stage than that this would not be dealt with duringthe present Session.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were, on balance, agreed that legislation should be introducedimmediately to extend our immigration control to include citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies with no substantial connectionwith this country. The necessary Bill should be tabled that afternoon; the need to secure its passage as a matter of urgencyprecluded the prior notification of Commonwealth Governments.The Bill should also include the proposals which the Cabinet had approved at their previous meeting to deal with the clandestine entry of immigrants, with restrictions on the right of entry of dependent children and with the compulsory medical examination of immigrants&apos; wives and families. The Home Secretary would makea statement in Parliament later that day about the proposals, andannounce also the administrative action that was to be taken to restrict the right of entry of the dependent fathers of immigrants.There was also agreement that, provisionally, the quota for citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies not belonging to this country should be 1,500 annually (plus dependants) and that this quota shouldbe additional to the number of vouchers normally issued to commonwealth immigrants, although further consideration of thenumbers might be necessary in the light of reactions in parliament and elsewhere.  Further consideration should be given urgently by
confidential parliament 3.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Lord President indicated that, in view of the cabinets decision that day to introduce legislation to restrict the flow ofAsian immigrants from East Africa who were citizens of the UnitedKingdom and Colonies, arrangements would be made to take theSecond Reading of the Immigration Bill on 27th February and theremaining stages on 28th February, in order that the House ofLords might consider the Bill on 29th February and its passage besecured with the minimum of delay.ThirdLondonAirport(previous reference :CC (67) 64thConclusions,Minute 3)confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Presidentof the Board of Trade and the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment (C (68) 37) about the third London airport.The Minister of Housing said that a major difficulty had arisen in pursuing the Cabinefs previous decision that the third london airport should be sited at Stansted. The next step was to securethe passage through the House of Lords of a Special DevelopmentOrder (SDO). When this was discussed last summer, it was thoughtthat the passage of an SDO could be secured if the Order were introduced in the autumn. However, opinion in the House of Lordshad hardened and it was now clear that an SDO, whenever it was laid, had negligible chances of being passed.the Home Secretary, in consultation with the commonwealth secretary and the Minister of Labour, to the criteria to be used forthe admission of immigrants from Kenya.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that legislation should be introduced immediately toextend our immigration control to include citizens of theUnited Kingdom and Colonies with no substantialconnection with this country.(2) Agreed that there should be a special annual quota of 1,500for citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies with no substantial connection with this country.(3) Invited the Home Secretary to announce in the Houseof Commons that afternoon the main lines of the government&apos;s proposals.(4) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with theCommonwealth Secretary and the Minister of Labour, togive further consideration to the criteria to be used inallocating this quota.
There had been a number of other developments since the cabinets previous consideration of this matter. Consultations withthe local authorities concerned about the proposed realignment ofrunways at Stansted had shown that this change of plan had in no way mitigated opposition to the Stansted project in the localitiesaffected. Proposals had recently been put forward for theconstruction of an international airport together with port facilities on reclaimed land off Foulness and had aroused substantial interestin the Press and elsewhere. Further, it was now estimated that trafficcapacity at the Heathrow airport could be increased in the early1970s to an extent which would defer by two more years (i.e., until1976) the date by which a third London airport would be needed.In all the circumstances, the President of the Board of Tradeand he agreed that the right course would now be to reopen thedecision on Stansted and to full inquiry into the location of the third London airport. A decision on this had becomeespecially urgent because the Council on Tribunals proposed to issue a statement that day recommending that he should exercise hisdiscretionary power under existing legislation to institute an inquiry into the effects on the areas concerned of the proposal to realignthe runways at Stansted. There was some doubt whether theCouncil was acting within its proper jurisdiction in making thisrecommendation; there were important constitutional implicationswhich he would wish to explore further with the Lord chancellor and the Law Officers.The Town and Country Planning Bill, which had received its second Reading in the House of Commons, made provision for theestablishment of planning inquiry commissions with the specialfunction of investigating planning applications of precisely the scale and nature of the airport project. This provision had been generally welcomed and suggestions had been made in Parliament that this machinery should be used to examine the Stansted project. he proposed that this course should be followed. It would not bepossible formally to constitute a planning inquiry commission untilthe Bill was enacted, but he proposed that an ad hoc commission should be established before then to carry out preliminary work and examine all the relevant documents. When the Bill had receivedRoyal Assent, the British Airports Authority would be invitedto make a planning application for the Stansted airport, which hewould call in. The ad hoc commission would then be formallyconstituted as a planning inquiry commission, and should be directed to inquire at large into the location of the third airport. He proposed,if the Cabinet approved his recommendation, to announce thedecision in Parliament that day.The President of the Board of Trade said he fully supported the proposal for an inquiry. He had, however, strong reservations about the form of inquiry proposed by the Minister of Housing.Though the revised estimate of traffic capacity at Heathrow hadremoved some of the urgency, it was still important to avoid delay in reaching a firm decision. A planning inquiry commission would take
too long. Three stages would be involved: first, the commission would carry out a general examination before selecting a number of sites for further inquiry this would take at least a year; second,there would have to be. separate local inquiries in respect of eachof the selected sites, and since these could not be held simultaneouslythis stage would probably take a further year; third, reports from thelocal inquiries would come back to the commission which would then have to consider its final recommendation. It would be preferable to set up a commission of inquiry unrelated to the machinery ofthe Town and Country Planning Bill, with instructions to recommenda single site. Such a body should be able to complete its work in about a year less than would be taken by a planning inquirycommission. If, however, the Cabinet were not ready to decide theform of the inquiry immediately, the statement that day should saythat this was still under consideration and should offer consultations with the Opposition about it. As all previous major statements on this matter had been made by the then President of the Boardof Trade, and since aviation and defence policy were involved aswell as planning issues, it would be desirable that any statement should be made by himself.In discussion it was argued that an inquiry at this stage, whatever its form, would involve too much delay even after taking accountof the estimate of increased capacity at Heathrow. When theCabinet had previously considered this matter, they had beeninformed that an inquiry might take up to three years and there was still no evidence to invalidate this estimate. After completion ofthe inquiry a further six years would be needed for constructionwork before the new airport could come into operation. If thereforethere were to be an inquiry it was unlikely that the airport would beoperational in time to cope with the expected increase in traffic. Itwould take less time to secure the passage of an SDO (or a hybridBill) through the House of Lords.It was, however, the general view that an inquiry could resonably be expected to complete its work in two years and thatthis delay would be acceptable. It was important to avoid a clash with the House of Lords in view of the repercussions on the current negotiations for reform of that House. Nothing short of an authoritative inquiry would satisfy opinion in Parliament and amongthe public that the Government had made the right choice. an inquiry should therefore be commissioned.There were divided views on the form which the inquiry shouldtake. In favour of a planning inquiry commission, it was argued that there would be great presentational advantages in relating thedecision to reopen the choice of site to the new provisions of theTown and Country Planning Bill; if the decision were not so related,it would be difficult to avoid the impression that the Governmenthad yielded to pressure from the interests opposed to the choice of Stansted. It would be wrong to adopt a procedure which omittedlocal inquiries into any alternative sites which might be proposed,
since it would be essential to examine exhaustively the repercussions on the localities affected. On the other hand, it was argued that ifthe Government related their decision to the new machinery of theTown and Country Planning Bill, this would be. criticised as atransparent device to disguise a change of mind. If theGovernment announced their intention to use the machinery of theBill, they would be accused of taking for granted parliamentary approval of the BilPs provisions. They would also be open to criticism if they made appointments to an ad hoc commission, whichwould later be reconstituted as a planning inquiry commission, andincurred expenditure in that respect before the enactment of the Bill.It would be necessary to amend the Bill to ensure that such a procedure could not subsequently be challenged on legal grounds.The charge might also be made that the Government were adopting the procedure of a planning inquiry commission in order to avoid further Parliamentary intervention.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) It was unsatisfactory that significantly different estimates should be brought forward at this stage on such a basic feature as the traffic capacity of Heathrow. The President of the Board of trade would investigate tie reasons for this; it was possible that part ofthe explanation lay in developments in flight-control techniques.(b) The Governmenfs decision should not be attributed publiclyto difficulties in securing the passage of an SDO through the Houseof Lords. It might also be desirable to make it clear that the government&apos;s decision was in no way a response to therecommendation by the Council of Tribunals, and to say that the council&apos;s recommendation raised constitutional issues which wouldhave to be further considered.(c) The proposals which had recently been made for theconstruction of an international airport at Foulness envisaged alsothe creation of port and industrial facilities there. It would probablybe undesirable for the inquiry to go into all these matters. Thisshould be borne in mind when the terms of reference were formulatedand the Minister of Transport should be consulted.(d) It would be necessary to consider carefully the nature of theevidence which would have to be presented to the inquiry on behalfof the Government. It would be important to avoid any suggestionthat the Government expected the inquiry to recommend Stansted.It would also be necessary to avoid the submission of conflictingevidence by different Government Departments: from this point ofview, the case was not on all fours with the presentation ofGovernment evidence to the Royal Commission on LocalGovernment, since in the present case the Government had previouslyreached a decision on the subject of the inquiry, which they were nowreopening. It would be preferable for evidence by Departments to be strictly confined to factual material, which would need to be concertedamong them.(e) The reductions in the defence programme which had beenagreed since the Cabinefs previous discussion would not alter the
Social ServicesPrescriptionCharges -Exemptions(previous reference :CC(68) 4thConclusions,Minute 3)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the first secretary of State on exemptions from prescription charges(C (68) 38).The Prime Minister said that he had been asked to receive adeputation by Mr. Pavitt, M p, and other signatories to a petitionopposing the reintroduction of prescription charges.   In particularconsiderations which had led to a decision in favour of Stansted.It would, however, be necessary to present to the inquiry evidence on defence matters which for security reasons it would not be possibleto publish. The inquiry could be expected to be held in public, butit would be open to the commission to sit in private where securityconsiderations so required. It would also be possible for thecommission to refrain on grounds of security from publishing someof the evidence submitted to it.(/) In view of the need for impartiality on the part of thecommission, it might be well received if it were to be headed by alawyer of the rank of High Court Judge.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed to the setting up of an inquiry into the location of thethird London airport. This should be announced in Parliament that day by the President of the Board of Trade, who should take accountof the points made in discussion and should consult the Minister of housing and the Government spokesman in the House of Lords onthe terms of his statement. The Cabinet were not yet ready to take adecision on the form of the inquiry; the statement should say that theGovernment were still considering this and should offer to consult theOpposition about it. The statement should say that, one possibleform of inquiry would be a planning inquiry commission as providedfor in the Town and Country Planning Bill, but should avoidprejudging the issue. The First Secretary of State should convene a group of the Ministers concerned to consider, in the light of anyconsultations which might be arranged with the Opposition, the formthe inquiry should take, its terms of reference and composition, andthe problems which would arise in the presentation of evidence by government Departments.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that there should be an inquiry into the location ofthe third London airport.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to announce their decision as indicated in the Prime minister&apos;s summing up.(3) Invited the First Secretary of State to convene a group of theMinisters concerned to consider the problems relatingto the inquiry referred to by the Prime Minister in his summing up.
they were likely to seek an assurance that the charges would beintroduced only as a temporary measure, and the Cabinet should consider what reply might be given on this point.The Minister of Health said that a number of the arguments advanced by the petitioners were invalid. His Department had not received any very large number of letters of protest against the^introduction of the charges, and it now seemed likely that satisfactory arrangements could be made for exemptions. Thescheme would thus be very different from the scheme operated bythe previous Administration and would make it no easier for any future Government to introduce further charges into the national health Service. It would, however, be desirable to avoid any commitment as to the future of the prescription charges and it mightbe said that, when the economy improved to the point at whichsubstantial additional resources could be made available to the health Service, the Government of the day would no doubt applvthose resources in the light of the priorities obtaining at the time.In discussion there was general agreement that commitment on the future of the prescription charges should be avoided and thatthe issue should be handled on the lines suggested by the Ministerof Health.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet agreed that the future of the prescription charges should be left open. He would himself settle the terms of the replyto be given to Mr. Pavitt in consultation with the First Secretaryof State, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Lord President andthe Health Ministers.The Cabinet (1) Took note with approval of the summing up of this part oftheir discussion by the Prime Minister.The Minister of Health said that the White Paper on public expenditure had indicated that he would discuss with the medical profession a system for exempting particular categories of patientwhen prescription charges were reintroduced and that theGovernment had in mind those over 65 or under 15, expectant and nursing mothers and the chronic sick. It had become clear in thecourse of his negotiations with representatives of the General medical services Committee of the British Medical Association that the doctors were unlikely to agree, except as a strictly interim measure,to identify the old and the young by signing special prescriptionforms, both because of the additional work involved and becausethey feared it would harm the doctor-patient relationship. They had proposed instead that the chemists should identify those entitledto exemption on the basis of a card, similar to a credit card, embossedwith the patienfs identifying particulars which would be stamped bythe chemist on the prescription forms (a &quot; card system &quot;). Thesecards would be issued by Executive Councils on application by thoseentitled to exemptions. The doctors would, however, have to supply
CC 14 (68)Executive Councils with the necessary certification in relation toexpectant and nursing mothers and the chronic sick, and it now seemed possible that they would agree to do this provided that an arrow definition of chronic sickness was adopted; it might belimited, for example, to those who were bedf: st or housebound,those suffering from diseases on a very limited list and those likelyto require continuous medication for the foreseeable future. such arrangements might be supplemented by more general provision whereby other patients might purchase exemption cards entitlingthem to exemption for a specified period; on the basis of the numberof prescriptions issued to the average patient the charges might be  for three months&apos; exemptions or  3 for a year. Arrangements onthese lines would cost about  1 million to introduce and could notbe brought into operation for 8-12 months; about 700-800 extrastaff would be temporarily required. The arrangements would be unwelcome to the chemists, to whom some additional remunerationmight have to be conceded in due course. None the less such arrangements would constitute a practicable and acceptable systemof protecting the categories that the Cabinet had earlier decidedshould be exempted, and offered adequate protection against fraud.It was unlikely that any alternative could be found acceptable to the doctors, whose co-operation was essential to the interim arrangements and for continued identification of the chronic sick in the longer term.Although the arrangement to enable people to purchase exemption for a period would not avoid making a charge on them for whichlegislative provision would have to be made, such an arrangement would be valuable in avoiding hardship for a wide variety of people who needed prescriptions fairly frequently but could not be brought within the narrow definition of chronic sickness contemplated, or anyother satisfactory definition. Provision would also be made for the supplementary Benefits Commission to refund the cost ofprescriptions, including any payment for exemption over a period, tothose on supplementary benefit or whose incomes were brought belowsupplementary benefit level; an advance could be made where thiswas necessary.If the doctors and chemists agreed to arrangements on theselines and if the doctors were assured that they would be introduced as soon as possible, it was likely that the doctors would also be persuaded in the interim to identify on prescription forms the individuals entitled to exemption; such interim arrangements mightoperate from the beginning of June but could not include provisionfor the purchase of exemption for a period.The First Secretary of State said that the Social services committee had accepted that the proposed arrangements were practicable and the best that were likely to be possible if the essentialco-operation of the doctors was to be secured; and they were agreedthat the Health Ministers should seek to reach agreement with the doctors and chemists accordingly so that an appropriate statementmight be made at the time of the Budget.   In particular, the
Committee had concluded that provision for the purchase of exemption cards, coupled with a narrow definition of the chronicsick entitled to complete exemption, offered the best solution to the difficult problem of the chronic sick. The Committee were, however,firmly of the view that prescription charges should not be reintroduced until the interim arrangements for exemptions could bebrought into operation at the beginning of June. They also considered that children should be exempted up to their 16thbirthday, notwithstanding the Cabinets earlier decision that the exemption should be limited to those under 15, since childrendid not leave school until after their 15th birthday. Finally, although there was no absolute link between the date of the proposed increase in the National Health Service contribution and there introduction of prescription charges, the two were connected andthere should be as short an interval as possible. He suggestedtherefore that the introduction of the increased National health service and national insurance contributions should be deferred until29th May.In discussion there was general support for the arrangementsfor exemption proposed by the Minister of Health, as the onlyarrangements likely to be accepted by the doctors; pressure of publicopinion would make it unlikely that the chemists could maintain a refusal to co-operate. The possibility of a cheaper &quot; card system &quot;,using existing medical cards, might, however, be further considered,although earlier study had indicated that their use would offerinsufficient protection against fraud.In further discussion the following main points were made:(a) Consideration was being given to the possibility of extending the proposed &quot; card system&quot; for exemption to those receivingsupplementary benefit and those with incomes below supplementary benefit level, who were previously entitled to a refund of prescription charges.(b) It would be impracticable for the local offices of the Ministryof Social Security to deal with claims for refund of prescription charges by those over 65 and under 15, on the scale that would occurif the introduction of prescription charges was not deferred until thearrangements for exempting these classes came into operation.(c) While it might be undesirable presentationally to relate theage of exemption for children to existing school-leaving age, and while the establishment of a single school-leaving age would increasethe numbers who left school between 15 and 16, the Governmenthad already announced that children would be exempt only up tothe age of 15, and to increase the age of deferment by a year would cost  1 million a year.(d) Deferment of the increase in the National Health service contribution would require similar deferment of the national insurance contribution increase at a combined cost of  1^ million aweek. For this reason it would be desirable to increase the contribution from 6th May, which was the earliest practicable date.
CC 14 (68)(e) Time might not permit the addition to the Health ServicesBill of a provision enabling persons to purchase exemption cards,and the provision might have to be included in the Finance Bill.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet were agreed that the reintroduction of prescription charges should be deferred until the interim arrangements for exemption could be introduced on the basis that this would bepossible in the first week of June. They had, however, concluded that it would be undesirable to reduce further the yield from thecharges by increasing the age limit for exemption of children andtherefore adhered to their earlier conclusion that children should be exempted up to their 15th birthday; similarly the increase of national health Service and national insurance contributions should not be deferred but should come into operation from 6th May. Subject tothese points, the Cabinet agreed that the Minister of Health should seek to reach agreement with the doctors and chemists on the linesof the arrangements set out in C (68) 38 in time to enable anannouncement to be made in connection with the Budget. If itappeared that agreement would not be reached or could not be implemented at the beginning of June, he should bring the matterback to the Cabinet.The Cabinet (2) Agreed that prescription charges should not be reintroducedin advance of arrangements for exemptions, on theassumption that such arrangements would operate in thefirst week of June; that children should be exempt frompayment of prescription charges only up to their 15thbirthday; and that National Health Service and national insurance contributions should be increased from6th May.(3) Invited the Minister of Health, in consultation with theChief Secretary, Treasury, to consider further thepossibility of using medical cards to identify those entitledto exemption.(4) Subject to conclusions (1) and (2),. invited the Minister ofHealth to seek to negotiate with the representatives of the doctors and chemists arrangements for exemption on thelines set out in C (68) 38.(5) Invited the Minister of Social Security to consider whetherthe arrangements for exemption could be extended to persons in receipt of supplementary benefit or whoseincomes were below supplementary benefit level.
LegislationAge of majority(previous reference :CC (67) 63rdConclusions,Minute 5)confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the first secretary of State (C (68) 32) on the age of majority.The First Secretary of State recalled that the Cabinet, when they considered the report of the Committee on the Age of Majorityunder the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Latey (the Latey Committee),had on balance been in favour of the principal proposals of themajority of the Committee that the age of full legal capacity shouldbe reduced to 18, but had deferred a final decision pending debates in Parliament and the consideration by the Home Affairs Committeeof the implications for the age of voting and the wages of young people of reducing the age of majority.The debates had not thrown much light on the question, though there had been support, mainly from the Governments side of bothHouses, for the recommendations of the majority of the LateyCommittee. On wages, it was estimated that if pressure to pay adultrates to 18-year-olds occurred and were successful the potentialcost would be  100 million, or 0-5 per cent of the national wages and salaries bill; but it seemed unlikely that this would in fact be theresult. The wages of non-manual workers were for the most parttied to an incremental scale which already took account of age upto and beyond 21, and in manual occupations the age at whichapprenticeship was completed was likely to be more important thanthe age of majority, though a reduction in the latter would give some support to existing pressure for shorter apprenticeship.Experience in Scotland, where the age of majority was 21, but minorshad long enjoyed certain rights not paralleled in England, suggestedthat a reduction of the age of majority would not necessarily leadto pressure for the payment of adult rates at 18. Some members ofthe Home Affairs Committee had thought that any risk of pressure for increased wages should in the present situation be avoided, butthe majority had thought that the risk was not in itself a sufficientground for rejecting the recommendations of the majority of theLatey Committee.On the voting age, the Home Affairs Committee had beeninformed that a succession of public opinion surveys suggestedgreater public readiness to accept a reduction in the age to 18, but,while the 18 to 21 age group seemed to support the Governmentand Opposition Parties in fairly equal proportions, there were indications that a substantial percentage would not exercise the voteif they had it. The Home Affairs Committee considered that acceptance of the Latey Committee&apos;s recommendations would not commit the Government to reducing the voting age to 18, and thatthe two issues could be considered separately.In discussion it was suggested that there was little public interestin the age of majority, and that by introducing legislation to reducethe age the Government would expose themselves to criticism forusing scarce legislative time which might have been devoted to more valuable measures. A reduction in the age of majority might wellstimulate pressure for a reduction of the voting age to 18; but thefact that the Speakers Conference had rejected this age in favour
confidential . The Prime Minister said that the Minister of Technology had drawn his attention to an article in the Observer of 11th Februaryabout the Concorde aircraft, which appeared to be based onconfidential information. This could not be other than damaging interms both of its impact on our relations with the FrenchGovernment at this juncture and of its effect on the morale of those engaged on the project. Members of the Cabinet should thereforetake particular care to maintain complete discretion about our intentions as regards the Concorde; and they should also warn theirjunior Ministers accordingly.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Ministers statement.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,22nd February, 1968.CabinetSecurity ofMinisterialDiscussions(previous reference :CC (67) 56thConclusions,Minute 3)of 20 would make any such pressure easier to resist, and acceptanceof the Latey Committee&apos;s recommendations on the age of majorityneed not be deferred until the Cabinet had reached a decision on theage of voting.In further discussion it was pointed out that among the ancillaryrecommendations of the Latey Committee which would require futher consideration was the recommendation that infancy should cease for fiscal purposes at 18. This would have undesirableconsequences in the taxation field and might prove more difficultto resist if the Committee&apos;s principal recommendations were accepted.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet, in the light of their further consideration, were now preparedto accept the recommendation that the age of full legal capacityshould be reduced to 18. The proposal that infancy should cease forfiscal purposes at the same age should now be examined by theHome Affairs Committee; the reduction of the age of voting shouldbe considered with the other recommendations of the speakers conference on Electoral Law; and proposals should be brought tothe Cabinet in due course.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the age of full legal capacity should be reducedto 18.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to give furtherconsideration to the proposal of the Committee on theAge of Majority that infancy should cease for fiscalpurposes at 18, and to bring his conclusions before theHome Affairs Committee.(3) Invited the Lord President to arrange for the Sub-Committeeof the Home Affairs Committee on Electoral Reformto consider the recommendations of the speakers conference, and to bring proposals before the Cabinet.
