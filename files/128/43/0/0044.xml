CC 44 (68)confidential. The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet would wish to congratulate the Home Secretary on the successful handling of theVietnam demonstration in London on the previous Sunday,27th October, which had both vindicated the Home Secretary&apos;advice that the demonstration should not be prohibited anddemonstrated the efficiency and good sense of the MetropolitanPolice.SECRET*2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was increasingly disturbed by the strength of consumer demand and the threat which this posed to the Governmenfs economic strategy.There were signs that activity in the economy generally was nowgrowing strongly and while this was in many respects welcome itappeared to be too dependent on increasing consumption. It was now clear that personal consumption in the second half of the year would be considerably higher than had been forecast at the time ofthe Budget. With exports rising sharply and better prospects for investment there was every reason to expect that we should bemoving into a period of high pressure of demand in the early part of next year. It was important that the Government should, so far aspracticable, anticipate developments of this kind; and early action to moderate the growth of consumer demand was in his view now required. He did not favour the use of the purchase tax regulatorsince this would suggest that the Governmenfs general economic strategy was no longer working. He considered that a tightening ofthe hire purchase (HP) regulations would be the most appropriateinstrument. He had deliberately avoided using this measure in theBudget so that it would be available if needed later on. It wouldhave an immediate though modest effect on demand, and as this would disappear after about six months, it would be particularly appropriate for dealing with the situation up to the next Budget, when theprospects for the latter half of 1969 would be much clearer. he accordingly proposed that the HP regulations should be amended sothat on motor cars the deposit would be increased from 33y per cent to 40 per cent and the period of repayment reduced from 27 months to 24. Comparable changes would be made for the other affecteditems, though he was still considering whether furniture should be excluded.In discussion it was argued that the case for taking action now had not been made out. The tightening of HP regulations would increase unemployment and was thus at variance with the very recent decision to spend  10 million on winter works. The general view,however, was that some action to moderate the growth of consumption was called for. But it was argued that a decision shouldbe postponed until the middle of November when furtherinformation about the likely progress of the economy would become
available. This might well indicate a need for more drastic actionthan the Chancellor was proposing. For example, there might wellbe a case for using the regulator, which would not only have a largereffect on demand but would also, by increasing taxation, provide theGovernment with more room for manoeuvre on public expenditure.The use of HP regulations in the present situation was in any caseopen to objection on other grounds. Its effect would be concentrated on a narrow range of industries which were not suffering fromshortage of capacity. In particular it would penalise the motor industry at a time when its profitability was very low and when therewas no real evidence that exports were being frustrated by the pressure of home demand; and it would reinforce the feeling ofinsecurity in the industry which was a potent cause of unofficial strikes.On the other hand it was strongly urged that experience showed the dangers of failing to take moderate action to affect demand in good time. There could be no doubt that consumption was risingstrongly and there was a growing expectation that some restrainingaction would soon have to be taken. There would be no advantage in postponing a decision, which would simply mean that when theGovernment did eventually take action they would appear to havebeen pushed into it by pressure of outside opinion. If, in the event,the tightening of HP regulations failed to restrain the growth of consumption to the extent required, further corrective action couidbe taken. The scope of the new regulations should, however, befurther considered with a view to excluding furniture, which was animportant element in the expenditure of young married couples.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that on balance the Cabinet agreed that the hire purchase regulations shouldbe tightened on the lines proposed by the Chancellor. Anannouncement should be made on Monday, 4th November; and inthe meantime the Chancellor of the Exchequer should consider withthe President of the Board of Trade the possibility of excludingfurniture other than carpets from the operation of the new regulations.The Cabinet-CD Agreed that the hire purchase regulations should be tightenedon the lines indicated in the Prime Ministers summing up.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith, the President of the Board of Trade, to consider thepossibility of excluding furniture other than carpets fromthe operation of the new regulations.(3) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to announce onMonday, 4th November, the Governments decision toamend the hire purchase regulations.
ParliamentaryAffairsDebate on the address:Voting Age(previous reference:CC (68) 43rdConclusions,Minute 1)devolution to Scotlandand Wales(previous reference:CC (68) 43rdConclusions,Minute 1)confidential. The Chief Whip recalled that the Cabinet had asked him on24th October to give further consideration to the question whethera free vote should be permitted on the reduction of the age of votingto 18. He had concluded that about two-thirds of the government&apos;s supporters were in favour of reducing the voting age to 18, but, since there was no guarantee that Members sympathetic to the proposals would attend and vote, he proposed that a two-line Whip should beissued to Private Members and a three-line Whip to Ministers. after discussion it was agreed that a firm two-line Whip should be issued to both Private Members and Ministers.The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Home Secretary(C (68) 119) on the proposal to establish a Commission on theConstitution, and a further note (C (68) 120) covering the proposed terms of reference for the Commission revised in the light ofdiscussion by the Ministers primarily concerned.The Home Secretary recalled that the Cabinet at their previous meeting had asked him to set out the arguments in favour of theestablishment of a Commission on the Constitution and of theinclusion in its remit of Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands andthe Isle of Man. This he had done in C (68) 119, but the terms ofreference proposed in that paper had been revised as a result ofdiscussion on the previous day by a group of Ministers under thechairmanship of the Prime Minister. He was convinced that, sincethe terms of reference in this form would enable the Government totake any action which seemed necessary in respect of NorthernIreland while the Commission were sitting, it would be wrong to exclude Northern Ireland from their consideration. It would,however, be necessary to consult the Northern Ireland Government,who were unlikely to decline to be included in the remit, and theGovernments of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. Becauseof the necessity for consultations both with these Governments andwith the Opposition Parties in the United Kingdom Parliament, theproposed reference to the Commission in The Queen&apos;s Speech on theOpening of Parliament spoke of the Governments intention to beginconsultations on the appointment of a Commission on theConstitution.The Prime Minister said that a group of the Ministers primarily concerned had considered the Home Secretary&apos;s paper on the previous day and had concluded that it would be right to recommend the Queen to announce the proposals in the Speech on the Openingof Parliament. They had been concerned to ensure that theCommission would be able to start from the Reports expected earlyin the New Year from the Royal Commissions on Local Governmentin England and in Scotland (the Redcliffe-Maud and WheatleyCommissions), and that the Government would not be precluded from acting on those Reports and in respect of the problems ofNorthern Ireland while the Commission were sitting. The terms ofreference annexed to C (68) 120 seemed sufficiently dynamic to9559
secure both objectives, and he would make it clear during the debate on the Address that the establishment of a Commission would not bea means of avoiding decisions within the Commission^ field. Itwould be necessary in any event to reach a Government view on theproblems before the Commission, since the Scottish and WelshLabour Parties would have to give evidence to the Commission andwould look to the Government for some advice in doing so.In discussion it was suggested that the primary objective of theGovernments policy should be to prepare reasonable and attractiveproposals for the countries and regions of the United kingdom during what remained of the lifetime of the present Parliament. Itwould have been an advantage if some proposals could be producedbefore a Constitutional Commission was established so as to rebutthe suggestion that the appointment of a Commission was no morethan a delaying device; but it was unrealistic to suppose that theGovernment could produce satisfactory policies within a matter ofmonths. They might not be able to do so before the end of the parliament, but in that case it would still be advantageous to have established a Constitutional Commission. The Commission, byhearing evidence in public, would compel the nationalist parties to declare their policies and would constitute a valuable means of promoting public understanding both of the extent of devolution atpresent, particularly in Scotland, and of the probable consequences of separatist policies. The risk that the special interests of thevarious parts of the United Kingdom might be overlooked in anattempt to work out a pattern of government of general applicationcould be obviated by enabling the Commission to work throughPanels reinforced by the appointment of Assistant Commissioners to reflect the opinion of the part of the United Kingdom underconsideration by a particular Panel; and if the terms of reference were sufficiently dynamic there would be no need to exclude english regions, because developments arising out of the Redcliffe-MaudReport would go ahead and these developments would themselves have a bearing on the problems of Scotland and Wales which it wouldbe wrong to attempt to exclude from the Commission^ thinking.In further discussion of the proposed terms of reference thequestion was raised whether the omission from the original draft ofthe reference to &quot; the form of the constitution &quot; would preclude theCommission from considering the desirability or otherwise of a written constitution. If, as seemed probable, this possibility would remain open to them, it might be advisable to ensure that evidence was submitted on the dangers inherent in the introduction of a written constitution. A written constitution would destroy the sovereignty of Parliament and put obstacles in the way of rapidaction by a Government desiring to introduce change; it would tendtowards the preservation of individual rights and privileges and against the interests of the community as a whole. Critics of theGovernment might also suggest that the proposed reference inThe Queen&apos;s Speech to &quot; the central institutions of government&quot;meant that the way would be open for an attack on the monarchyand the advocacy of republican government. This was not, however,
CC 44 (68)the intention, as could be made clear to the Commission at a later stage. There would in any event be a further opportunity for theconsideration of the terms of reference in the light of the consultations before the Commission were appointed.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that The Queen should be recommended to refer in her Speech on the Opening of Parliament to the government&apos;s intention to begin discussions on the appointment of a Commissionon the Constitution. The authorities in Northern Ireland, theChannel Islands and the Isle of Man should be informed of the intentions shortly before The Queen&apos;s Speech was delivered; and asimilar communication should be made to the Chairmen of the royal commissions on Local Government in England and in Scotland,respectively. The terms of reference could be considered further inthe light of the consultations, and it would be desirable to appoint a Committee of Ministers to consider questions arising on theappointment of the Commission.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that The Queen should be recommended toestablish a Commission on the Constitution, with termsof reference covering the countries, nations and regions of the United Kingdom and the relationship of theCentral Government with the Channel Islands and the isle of Man.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would:(i) Recommend The Queen to include in her Speech onthe Opening of Parliament an appropriate referenceto consultations on the establishment of a constitutional Commission.(ii) Arrange for a Committee of Ministers to considerquestions arising on the appointment of theCommission on the Constitution.(3) Invited the Home Secretary, the Secretary of State forScotland and the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment to notify the appropriate authorities inNorthern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle ofMan and the Royal Commissions on Local Governmentin England and in Scotland, respectively, of the government&apos;s intentions before The Queen&apos;s Speech was delivered.The Queen&apos;s The Minister of Transport said that he would be subject toSpeech on      considerable criticism because The Queen&apos;s Speech contained not he Opening of    r , ,   ,Parliament      reference to legislation on the reorganisation of the ports.   The(Previous       intention was, however, to publish proposals in a White Paper in the reference:      near future, and it would help to allay the suspicions of theCC (68) 4lst    Governmenfs supporters if The Queen were recommended to includeConclusions, jn her Speech on the Opening of Parliament a statement that the minute 5)
secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of technology (C (68) 109) on progress in reaching agreement with theFrench on criteria for the Concorde project; and a memorandumby the Attorney-General (C (68) 114) assessing the legal positionfollowing the latest negotiations.The Minister of Technology said that, following the discussion by the Cabinet on 1st August, he had consulted the foreign secretary, the President of the Board of Trade, the Chief Secretary,Treasury, and the Attorney-General with a view to drawing upcriteria in the light of which we should wish to see the future of the concorde project determined, and to which we should seek to obtainthe agreement of the French. The criteria on which they had decidedwere:(i) An  upper limit  of  600   million  (at   1966  prices) on development costs which if it looked like being exceededwould call into question the wisdom of continuing withthe project and would free either Government from an automatic obligation to continue.(ii) Firm orders by 31st December, 1969, from four majorairlines of which one must be an American airline.As a result of his discussion with the French Minister of Transport,M. Chamant, on 24th September, and of subsequent correspondence,the French had now put forward the proposals set out in Annex Cto C (68) 109. It was unlikely that M. Chamant would be willing torecommend his Government to go further than these proposals,although they fell short of our criteria in several important respects.While M. Chamant accepted the criterion of firm orders by the end of1969, he held that if there remained any hope of firm orders neither side should be entitled to withdraw but only to discuss with the other the continuation of the project. The French version of the criterionon development cost could not be invoked until the end of 1969; itwould not automatically release each Government from theobligation to continue but would only authorise the responsible ministers to propose to their Governments an amendment to the 1962Agreement which would so release them. His memorandum(C (68) 109) discussed the five possible courses which were now openAircraftIndustryThe ConcordeCriteria :The NextSteps(previous reference:CC (68) 37thConclusions,Minute 3)Government would bring forward proposals for reorganising the ports under public ownership. This could then be elaborated in the debate on the Address.After brief discussion, the Prime Minister said that it would bedifficult to secure the addition of a wholly new passage to the queen&apos;s Speech at so late a stage, and, since the Leaders of theOpposition Parties had to be given a copy of the Speech during the afternoon, they would become aware that there had been an additionat the last minute. In view of this, the best course would be for himto refer during the Debate on the Address to the governments intention to publish a White Paper.
to us in the light of M. Chamanfs proposals. Immediate unilateralcancellation would be even more hazardous now than before hisexchanges with the French. If we engaged in further discussion, orcorrespondence, to define our interpretation of M. Chamanfsparagraphs and to defend such freedom of action as we alreadypossessed, the French might withdraw their compromise proposals and we could well be in a worse position in relation to possibleunilateral action than we were now. He therefore recommended thatwe should settle with the French on the basis of the position that had now been reached.The Attorney-General said that the French had been skilful inneither rejecting the concept of criteria (which would havestrengthened our legal position), nor committing themselves towithdrawal from the project if the criteria were not met. While itwas regrettable that the criteria proposed by the French would not take effect until the end of 1969, he took the view that an acceptanceof these proposals would represent a gain. He therefore favouredacceptance, as recommended by the Minister of Technology, with the proviso that we should tell the French that our agreement was without prejudice to the right of the parties in international law to terminate where there was a fundamentaly altered situation.In discussion it was pointed out that acceptance ofM. Chamanfs proposals would in effect commit the UnitedKingdom to the project until 31st December, 1969, by which time the greater part of the expenditure on development wouldhave been incurred; for all practical purposes, we should therefore be committing ourselves to completion of the project.The proposals made no contribution to our domestic problem of reducing public expenditure. The proposed limit on the cost ofdevelopment was  600 million, of which the United Kingdom&apos;s sharewould be  300 million. If cancellation was deferred until the end of1969, we should save only  40- 50 million of this total of  300 million.If we were to cancel unilaterally in January, 1969, the saving wouldbe about  125 million; and if cancellation took place in the middleof 1969, the saving would be about  85 million. However, thesesavings did not take account of the heavy damages we might have topay if judgment went against us in the International Court. If wewere now to accept M. Chamanfs proposals, we should aim to preserve the maximum freedom of action, including the possibilityof unilateral cancellation early in 1969. For this purpose, it wouldbe desirable to include the proviso proposed by the Attorney-general in any acceptance of the French proposals. At the same time we might consider reducing the technical, financial and commercial risks which were inherent in the project by inviting the United States tojoin the consortium. However, though partnership with the UnitedStates would greatly increase the project&apos;s chances of success, it was unlikely that the French would consent to such an arrangement.Furthermore, it was probable that neither of the American companies concerned would be willing to participate in a project in which theFrench had design leadership, although they might subsequently have
some interest in the development of a &quot; stretched &quot; version. Workon the project in the coming 12 months, including flight tests, mightreveal a number of technical problems, including engine noise andthe sonic bang, but the effects of these on the development cost andon airline orders would be safeguarded by the proposed criteria.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that on balance the Cabinet agreed that M. Chamanfs proposals should beaccepted, but it should be made clear that our acceptance was withoutprejudice to the right of the parties in international law to terminatewhere there was a fundamentally altered situation. The Attorney-General should prepare a draft letter On these lines for the Ministerof Technology to send M. Chamant; the letter should be circulated tothe Cabinet for information. The desirability of inviting the UnitedStates companies to participate in the Concorde project should beconsidered separately by the Steering Committee on economic policy.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed to accept the criteria proposed by M. Chamant, withthe proviso that this should be without prejudice to theright of the parties in international law to terminate wherethere was a fundamentally altered situation.(2) Invited the Attorney-General to prepare a draft letter of acceptance from the Minister of Technology toM. Chamant.(3) Invited the Minister of Technology to bring the question of inviting American companies to collaborate in the concorde project before the Steering Committee onEconomic Policy.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,29th October, 1968.
