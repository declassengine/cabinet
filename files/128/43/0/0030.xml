SECRET*i. The Prime Minister invited the Cabinet to consider the implications of certain public speeches which had recently been madeby the Minister of Technology and the Home Secretary. The formerhad been concerned to express his views on the dangers of a declinein Parliamentary Government and the possibility of adoptingalternative means of consulting the electorate, e.g., by means of a referendum. The speech had attracted a certain amount of public attention; and it had therefore been necessary to make it clearpublicly that it did not represent a statement of Government policyin this matter. The incident could perhaps serve as a warning to ministers that, while they were entitled to their personal views on matters of public concern, they must have regard, in any publicexpression of them, to the limits prescribed by the doctrine of collective responsibility. This doctrine, however, appeared to havebeen more seriously challenged by a recent speech by the HomeSecretary, in which he had indicated that the compulsory powers insupport of the prices and incomes policy for which the Governmentwere currently seeking the approval of Parliament should not extend beyond 18 months and must thereafter be replaced by a voluntarypolicy. This statement called in question the Governments decision that at the end of 18 months they would need to consider afreshwhether or not to propose an extension of the compulsory powers by further legislation; and to that extent it not only embarrassedthem in their management of the Parliamentary debates on the present bill but also created the impression of an uncertain and dividedCabinet.The Home Secretary said that his remarks had represented a deliberate and considered statement of his judgment on this matter.He had supported, and continued to support, the present Bill; buthe was not prepared to commit himself any further. The position at the end of 18 months was, in his view, completely open, since theCabinet had decided no more than that, if an extension of the compulsory powers proved to be necessary, it should be sought bymeans of a fresh Bill rather than by reliance on the Expiring laws continuance legislation. In fact it would not be possible to renew the compulsory powers for a further period, since permanent legislation for the control of wages would divide the Labour Party,perhaps irretrievably; and in terms of the morale of the government&apos;s supporters throughout the country it was more advantageous torecognise this fact now than to leave the Governments intentionsobscure and ambiguous. He had been at pains to send the text ofhis speech to the First Secretary 24 hours in advance; and there had therefore been an opportunity to take exception to it, if necessary.The First Secretary of State said that the text had not in factreached her Department until noon of the day on which it was delivered and even then in a manner which meant that it was not brought to her attention.   There had therefore been no time to* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.9209A 2
consider it with any care. It was now being exploited, particularly by the Opposition in the House of Commons, to create theimpression that the Government were being less than candid withtheir own supporters; it had thrown doubt on their firmness of purpose; and it would be used to exacerbate the latent disaffectionin industry which was the most dangerous threat to the success ofthe prices and incomes policy.In discussion it was generally agreed that the speech would beconstrued as challenging the Governments policy on prices and incomes in respect of a point to which public opinion, both at homeand abroad, attached considerable importance. It would be regardedas, in effect, closing one of the options which the Government had deliberately decided to leave open; and the constitutionalimplications of such action could not be ignored. Moreover, in so faras it suggested that the Government might be weakening in their purpose, it could have unfortunate effects on international confidence in sterling.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that itwould be impossible for him to say, if he were challenged, that theHome Secretary&apos;s speech represented the Governments policy onthis matter; and it would probably be necessary, therefore, torestate, firmly and clearly, the Governments intentions as regardsthe duration of compulsory powers in the terms in which he had himself stated them in his address to the Trade Union Group of theParliamentary Labour Party and they had thereafter been enunciatedon the Second Reading of the Prices and Incomes Bill.SECRETCabinetSecurity ofMinisterialDiscussions(previous reference:CC (68) 20thConclusions,Minute 1)*2. The Minister of Transport expressed his disquietabout two articles discussing the Governments policy onreorganisation of the ports which had appeared in the The Guardianand the Financial Times on the previous day. These suggestedthat there had been a detailed disclosure both of the course of thediscussion on this subject in the Steering Committee on economic policy on 27th May and of the memoranda which had been before ministers on that occasion. The disclosure could not, therefore,have been the result of carelessness or inadvertence. On the contraryit must be regarded as a deliberate attempt to arouse public opinion in order to exert pressure on the Government in the formulation oftheir policies; and, if this interpretation was correct, it represented a serious breach of confidence from which he could not too stronglydissociate himself.In discussion there was general agreement that the circumstances in which the information in question had been disclosed to the Pressshould be investigated forthwith.* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET

The Prime Minister said that there was some reason to suppose that demonstrations might be organised over the Whitsunholiday at the Combined Defence Experimental Establishment atPorton and the United States Air Force Base at Wethersfield. TheCabinet would agree that, as on previous occasions, the HomeSecretary should be responsible for co-ordinating arrangements todeal with any incidents which might occur. He would have the full support of the Cabinet in any action which he might have to take inorder to deny entry into the United Kingdom to certain foreign nationals who had been implicated in the recent disturbances abroad.PublicServicesReduction ofMinistry ofPublicBuildingsand Worksdirect labourforceCONFIDENTIAL5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president (C (68) 75), to which were attached memoranda by theMinister of Public Building and Works on his Department&apos;s direct labour force and a letter from the First Secretary of State, and amemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C (68) 77).The Lord President said that at their meeting on 22nd May,the Home Publicity Committee had before them proposals by theMinister of Public Building and Works for reducing his directlyemployed labour force. Although the Committee&apos;s terms of referencelimited them to the publicity aspects of the problem, they had found it impossible to discuss these without also considering the policy involved. The Committee&apos;s discussion had revealed that there were still substantial differences of opinion on the policy and the PrimeMinister had accordingly directed that the matter should beconsidered by the Cabinet.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the report of theCommittee appointed to review the cost of executing maintenanceworks services by directly employed labour (the Mann Committee)The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for animmediate enquiry into the circumstances in which information about the Governmenfs policy on there organisation of the ports appeared to have been disclosed to the Press.
had shown that in many cases it was substantially higher than thecost of employing contractors. The Ministers proposals, which hadbeen worked out in close consultation with the Treasury, would yield net savings of about  3 million a year and in view of the need to contain the growth of public expenditure it would be quite wrong to go back on them. He accepted, however, that the government must follow the code of conduct for redundancy prepared by theDepartment of Employment and Productivity; and that there shouldbe full consultation with the unions concerned, on the basis of theMann report. He proposed that publication of the Mann report should be withheld until consultations with the trade union had been initiated; that the report and the Ministers proposals to reduce theforces should be presented to the unions simultaneously; and that apublic announcement should be delayed until after the unions hadbeen fully consulted.The Minister of Public Building and Works said that he accepted that the direct labour force, in its present form, was uneconomic andthat substantial savings would have to be made. Efficiency variedgreatly as between the different depots, some of which were fullycompetitive while others were grossly inefficient. No direct labour force could succeed without good management and he had set in train the action necessary to improve the quality of managementwhich would be required in whatever units remained afterredundancies had been declared. Criteria for the future employmentof direct labour had been agreed between his Department and theTreasury and he accepted that these must be applied. It would,however, be essential to secure the goodwill and co-operation of thetrade unions and he would want to discuss with them the best wayof dealing with the problem. He did not propose to publish theMann report, but he would make it available to the unions andwould impress on them the need to raise the efficiency of the direct labour force and to secure substantial savings in its cost. In his view the best way to achieve this would be to conduct a careful review ofeach of the 300 depots involved. If he were authorised to conductthis review and to consult with the unions on the lines he had outlinedhe could guarantee that after 12 months he would be able to reportsubstantial results.In discussion it was argued that the proposals of the Minister ofPublic Building and Works were in direct conflict with the code of conduct which, after consultation with the National Joint AdvisoryCouncil, the Department of Employment and Productivity would bepublishing next month. The code of conduct laid down that before a final decision to close a factory or substantially reduce a labour force was taken by management there should be full consultationwith the unions; and management must first satisfy itself that therewas no satisfactory alternative. If the prices and incomes policy was to succeed it was essential to secure the willing co-operation ofthe trade union movement in a drive for greater productivity. Ablunt announcement of a reduction in the Ministry of Public building and Works direct labour force would be bitterly opposed by theunions; strike action would have to be expected as a result and there
confidential. The Foreign Secretary said that during his recent visit to moscow he had spent a day in discussions with the Soviet ForeignMinister, Mr. Gromyko. Their talks had covered four main questions Vietnam, the Middle East, Germany and Mr. GeraldBrooke.The discussion on Vietnam had been largely a restatement ofits own position by each side. He had been concerned to emphasise the need for North Vietnam to accept that a complete cessation of bombing was possible provided the United States had some assurance that it would not result in their troops being put in a moreunfavourable position than before. A formal declaration would notbe necessary, provided the action of the North VietnameseGovernment was visible on the ground. They had had some discussion of their role as Co-Chairmen of the Geneva Conferencebut it was recognised that a conference lay some way ahead.OverseaAffairsForeignSecretary&apos;visit to moscow(previous reference:CC (68) 29thConclusions,Minute 2)would be adverse repercussions on the direct labour forces employedby local authorities. At the very least the proposals should be modified so as to allow for a reduction in redundancies ifimprovements in efficiency were secured. There was a good case for publishing the Mann report, with its estimates of the difference in the cost of executing work by direct labour and the cost of employing contractors, from which the unions could see for themselves that unless substantial improvements in efficiency were achieved redundancies would be inevitable.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed on balance that the Mann report should not bepublished. The Minister of Public Building and Works should,however, make it available to the unions and discuss with them thebest way of dealing with the problem which it revealed. The precise form of action to be taken thereafter could be determined in thelight of these discussions, provided that it met the essentialrequirement that the net saving in public expenditure which hadbeen agreed by the Ministry of Public Building and Works and theTreasury must be achieved on the agreed timescale. The Ministerof Public Building and Works should not make a statement on thematter in Parliament but should report to the Ministerial Committeeon Industrial Policy at regular intervals. He should keep theChancellor of the Exchequer and the First Secretary of Stateinformed of the progress he was making and he should consult the ministerial Committee on Home Publicity on any publicity aspectsof the problem.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Public Building and Works to be guided by the Prime Ministers summing up and to reportprogress to the Ministerial Committee on Industrial policy at regular intervals.
foreign secretary&apos;visit to BonnOn the Middle East, Mr. Gromyko had taken the predictableline that Israel was the aggressor and should therefore withdraw.In return he had pointed out that the United Nations Resolutionhad balanced the demand for IsraePs withdrawal against the cessation of Arab belligerency, and that one of these elements could not bedealt with in isolation. He had urged the importance of giving thefullest support to the Special Representative of the United Nations,Mr. Gunnar Jarring. Mr. Gromyko had suggested diplomaticconsultation between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union onthe idea advanced by the United Arab Republic of a stage-by-stagesettlement, which the Israelis had so far opposed for fear that itmight commit them to immediate concessions with no certainty ofan acceptable settlement at the end of the road. He had agreed tothis suggestion on the understanding that it would not interfere withMr. Jarring&apos;s task. It had now been arranged that the talks shouldtake place in New York; and the necessary instructions were being sent to Lord Caradon, the United Kingdom Representative at theUnited Nations.On Germany, he had urged that the Soviet Union shouldrespond constructively to the efforts of the Federal Government toimprove its relations with Eastern Europe. Mr. Gromyko had taken a hard line; but had given the impression that he wished to maintain a dialogue with Bonn. Mr. Gromyko had not referred to a european security Conference; the Soviet Union appeared to be preoccupiedat the moment with problems of Eastern Europe. There had,however, been a brief discussion of the proposed Non-ProliferationTreaty.As regards Mr. Gerald Brooke, it was clear that there was no prospect of clemency. Within the next few weeks, however, aConsular Convention with the Soviet Union would be ratified andthis would enable Mr. Brooke to receive consular visits. There was some indication in the talks that a visit might even be permittedbefore the Convention was ratified.The Foreign Secretary said that on his way back from Moscowhe had visited Bonn and had had discussions with the federal german Foreign Minister, Herr Willy Brandt. He had restated our attitude on membership of the European Economic Community(e.c.). The Federal German Government attached great importanceto their proposal for a trading arrangement between the community and the candidate countries, which they were still discussing withthe French Government. He had made clear that we would consider such an arrangement provided the offer came from all six membersof the e.c., that it was linked with our entry into the community and that it was in conformity with the General Agreement on tariffs and Trade. The Germans were at present preoccupied with theproposed trade arrangements and were not therefore giving attentionto the Benelux proposals. In discussion with Herr Brandt he had referred to the forthcoming meeting of the North Atlantic Council atReykjavik and hoped the Germans would agree to a discussion at themeeting of mutual force reductions in Europe and a reference to this
FranceRhodesia(previous reference:CC(68) 29thConclusions,Minute 2)Gibraltar(previous reference:CC (68) 28thConclusions,Minute 6)9209Bquestion in the communique. He had also urged the GermanGovernment to consider giving economic aid to Malta and, in viewof the proposed visit to Spain of the German Chancellor, HerrKiesinger, had explained our position on Gibraltar. He had suggested that the Chancellor might emphasise that the recentSpanish closure of the frontier with Gibraltar had made any kind ofa settlement less and not more likely. Herr Brandt had agreed toget in touch with him again on this subject before the Chancellorsvisit to Spain.The Foreign Secretary said it was clear that the recent studentunrest and industrial strikes in France had been spontaneous. Butthe political parties were now moving into the front of the picture.The French Government had reached a surprising settlement withthe trades unions on substantial wage increases; but it remained to be seen whether this would be accepted by the workers and whatits economic consequences would be. His latest report from Pariswas that the French Government was in a state of disintegration.It was possible that President de Gaulle would resign that day; and probable that he would do so before the referendum fixed for16th June. It was hard to say what would happen thereafter. Butthe present situation was explosive; and the possibility of anextremist Government could not be excluded.The Foreign Secretary said that the Security Council of theUnited Nations had the previous day passed unanimously aresolution imposing further mandatory sanctions on Rhodesia. Theresolution was one which we could accept and defend. In hisexplanation of vote, the United Kingdom Representative at theUnited Nations, Lord Caradon, had made clear that we could not accept the use of force or an economic confrontation with SouthAfrica; and that we rejected violence as a means of solving the rhodesian problem. This last point was important since theOpposition might argue that one clause of the new resolution was an incitement to violence.The Prime Minister said that great credit was due toLord Caradon for his successful handling of this difficult problem,and the Cabinet would wish to send him a message of congratulation.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that the necessary orders to enable the United Kingdom to carry out the provisionsof the United Nations resolution would be laid before parliament as soon as possible after the Whitsun recess.The Commonwealth Secretary said that his visit to Gibraltarthe previous week had been successful in helping to restore confidence in the Colony. There had been a real danger of a breakdown of law and order resulting from the psychological impact of the recent Spanish closure of the frontier. His proposal toappoint a high-level British industrial mission to work out measures designed to reduce Gibraltar&apos;s dependence on Spanish labour, andhis assurance that all Gibraltarians who wished to come here would
Nigeria(previous reference:CC (68) 28thConclusions,Minute 6)be able to do so under the terms of the Commonwealth ImmigrantsAct had served as safety valves. He had agreed that talks withGibraltar Ministers would be resumed next month. meanwhile the situation was quiet.The Commonwealth Secretary said that Port Harcourt had now been captured by the forces of the Nigerian federal government, thus cutting off the Eastern Region from the outside world by sea and, apart from an emergency airstrip, by air. Thepeace talks between the two sides which had begun in Kampalaunder the auspices of the Commonwealth Secretary-General,Mr. Arnold Smith, were continuing. The Government were underincreasing criticism for continuing to provide arms to the federal government. But after careful consideration he was satisfied thatall the arguments were in favour of continuing our present policyof permitting carefully controlled supplies. We could only hope to exert our influence in favour of peace through the federal government, and that influence would vanish if we stoppedsupplying arms. Such a decision would, moreover, be anencouragement to the Eastern Region to go on fighting and would put at grave risk the considerable British interests in Nigeria. now that Port Harcourt had fallen, steps could be taken to get the oilflowing again. The oil companies were hoping to send inrepresentatives very shortly to assess the damage. But it wouldprobably take at least six months before oil began to flow.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretaries.LegislationElectoralReform(previous reference:CC (68) 29thConclusions,Minute 1)SECRET7. The Cabinet considered a note by the Home Secretary(C (68) 74) covering a report of the Sub-Committee on electoral reform on the recommendations of the Speakers Conference on electoral Law, and a memorandum by the Home Secretary (H (68) 76)setting out statistics of the potential electorate in mid-1970 on theassumption that the age of voing was reduced to 18.The Lord President recalled that the Cabinet, in their discussionof electoral reform on 16th May, had invited him to bring beforethem the report of the Sub-Committee on Electoral Reform whichhad considered, under his chairmanship the report of the speakers conference on Electoral Law. The Cabinet had expressed a wishto see any available information about the response of public opinion to the proposals to reduce the age of voting. Little material was available, but he had arranged for a paper which he had preparedfor the Home Affairs Committee in January to be annexed toC(68) 74, and he had subsequently sent to members of the cabinet a note on the results of a Gallup Poll taken in March 1968 which showed that, of the adults questioned, 56 per cent were in favour of retaining the age of 21; 17 per cent preferred 20; and 25 per cent
preferred 18. The figures for the potential electorate in mid-1970showed that, if the age were reduced to 18, the proportion of those under 21 in the total electorate would be 6T in England and Wales(5-8 in Wales) and 6-8 in Scotland.The evidence submitted by the Labour Party to the speakers conference had advocated a voting age of 18, but the speakers conference by a large majority had recommended 20. There werepowerful arguments in favour of 20, and the Sub-Committee on electoral Reform had originally been disposed to accept thisrecommendation. But they had considered the matter. further inthe light of the announcement of the Governments decision toreduce the age of a legal majority to 18 and had concluded that itwould be difficult to defend a distinction between the age at whichyoung people were considered fit to exercise the franchise and theage at which they might marry and enter into contracts. On balance,therefore, the Sub-Committee recommended that the age of 18 shouldbe adopted. This appeared to be in line with the realities of thesituation and also took account of the need, which had beenillustrated by the events of recent weeks, to give young people anincreased sense of responsibility.In discussion it was suggested that if the age of voting were reduced to 18 there might be advantage in bringing the provisioninto effect by a Resolution of both Houses of Parliament timed tocoincide with the reduction of the age of legal majority. It waspointed out, however, that there was no necessary connection betweenthe two: they had always been different in Scotland. Moreover adecision would have to be made in the spring of 1969 if the registerpublished in March 1970 was to include the voters enfranchised by areduction in the qualifying age. Some doubt was expressed aboutthe wisdom of reducing the age as far as 18, since it was doubtfulwhether the public in general wished to see such a reduction andthere was some reason to think that a considerable proportion of thenew voters would support the nationalist parties. The balance ofopinion, however, was in favour of reducing the age to 18.The Cabinet then considered the remainder of the points towhich the report of the Sub-Committee on Electoral Reform had drawn particular attention.The Lord President said that the Sub-Committee recommendedthat the single electoral register should be retained; that therecommendation of the Speakers Conference that the publication ofthe results of public opinion polls and of betting odds within 72 hoursof the poll should be rejected; and that the hours of polling shouldbe extended to 10-00 p.m. On broadcasting, the speakers conference had recommended that the provisions of Section 63 ofthe Representation of the People Act, 1949 as to election expensesshould not apply to broadcasting, subject to a proviso that a broadcast from a particular constituency should be exempt only if all candidates agreed to take part. The Sub-Committee proposedthat the exemption should apply if all candidates agreed to the
broadcast even though some of them did not wish to take parvthemselves. The Sub-Committee considered that there was a strongconstitutional case for rejecting the recommendations of the speakers conference that party labels on ballot papers should continue to be prohibited. They were considering what would be involved among other things, it would be necessary to register political parties andit was proposed to consult the Opposition parties on the necessary machinery.In discussion it was pointed out that the adoption of party labelsmight place the Labour Party at a disadvantage in Scotland andWales, where, if the title &quot; Scottish &quot;-or &quot; Welsh &quot;-Labour party were adopted the public might be confused. It was agreed, however,that the balance of advantage lay in the use of party labels ifappropriate arrangements could be worked out.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that on balance the Cabinet agreed that the age of voting should be reducedto 18; and that the other recommendations of the Sub-Committee on electoral Reform should be accepted. It would be necessary toprepare the legislation as a matter of urgency for introduction at thebeginning of the next Session, and the Sub-Committee should ensurethat this work was put in hand.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the age of voting should be reduced to 18.(2) Approved the remaining recommendations of the Sub-Committee on Electoral Reform.(3) Invited the Lord President to arrange for the Sub-Committeeon Electoral Reform to consider urgently any outstandingmatters with a view to the preparation of a Bill for introduction at the beginning of the 1968-69 Session.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,31st May, 1968.
