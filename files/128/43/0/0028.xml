confidential parliament 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Prices and incomes BillParliamentaryTacticsSECRET3. The Cabinet were informed that, as a result of a review bythe Parliamentary Committee of the Parliamentary tactics andtimetable to be adopted in relation to the forthcoming legislation on prices and incomes, it had become clear that, if the Bill was to reach the Statute Book by mid-July, a very intensive effort would berequired, particularly during the Committee Stage in the House ofCommons; and it might well be necessary for the Government tomove a timetable motion for this purpose. Moreover, even if thisenabled the Bill to leave the House of Commons without undue delay,there could be no certainty that the debates in the House of lords would be concluded by mid-July. On the other hand, if the Bill hadnot received the Royal Assent by that point, the Government mightface a very embarrassing situation towards the end of July, since the standstill which was currently in operation in relation to the wages of municipal busmen would then expire before the powers providedby the new legislation had been brought into effect.   The only8993a 2CONFIDENTIALParliamentary 1. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that the new committee Parliamentary Committee had now been constituted and wouldhenceforward meet regularly at approximately weekly intervals. Itwas not intended in any sense to supersede the Cabinet itself but was designed to prepare the way for the Cabinet&apos;s consideration of items of business which were of particular importance or political significance by conducting a preliminary review of such topics inorder to define the issues on which the Cabinet as a whole should concentrate. For this purpose its deliberations and conclusionswould, of course, be reported regularly to the Cabinet.The Committee had so far met twice; and its discussions onrace relations and prices and incomes policy, which the cabinet would need to consider during the present meeting, had been ofconsiderable value. It had been particularly opportune that theCommittee had been able to discuss the Parliamentary tactics inrelation to the recent report by the National Board for Prices and incomes on local authority rents and, as a result, to authorise theMinister of Housing and Local Government to make a statement on this subject in the House of Commons which had been generally welcomed as a timely and constructive move. The episode had provided an excellent example of the potential value of theParliamentary Committee&apos;s method of work.
method of anticipating this risk would be an amendment of the Billdesigned to enable the Government to renew a standstill withretrospective effect; and this would be politically unacceptable. Itwas therefore essential that every effort should be made to ensurethat the Bill would in fact receive the Royal Assent not later thanmid-July.In discussion there was general endorsement of this conclusion.The Bill would be a contentious item of legislation; and, however much the Government might seek to rally their supporters byemphasising those of its features which might be unacceptable to theOpposition (e.g., in relation to the control of rents, dividends, etc.),its other provisions, which would give the Government powers of compulsion in relation to increases in wages, would be liable to provoke considerable resentment among members of theParliamentary Labour Party. Indeed, there were some grounds forsupposing that a significant number of them might be tempted to abstain from voting in critical divisions on the Bill; and this couldinvolve the Government in some political embarrassment. there could be no question of the Governments reversing their policy atthis stage; but it would be essential that they should present a united front in the House of Commons and should give a strong lead totheir supporters. For this purpose all Ministers should arrange,without regard to other engagements, to be present at all theimportant stages in the debates. In addition, they should warn theirjunior Ministers and Parliamentary Private Secretaries that theywould be expected to support the Bill and to vote, when necessary,in its favour. They should also take every appropriate opportunityto impress on backbenchers with whom they were in contact theimportance of ensuring the full support of the Parliamentary LabourParty for this essential element in the Governments economic policy;and they should be prepared to remind them, if necessary, of theprospect which the Labour Party might face if this policy failed asa result of the inability of the Parliamentary Party to accept asufficient measure of discipline to ensure that the Bill was enacted.Particular care should be taken to ensure that both the ParliamentaryParty as a whole and the Trade Union Group were made aware ofthe great political significance of this legislation.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Privy Seal and the Paymaster-General toconsider, in consultation with the Chief Whip and theChief Whip, House of Lords, how best to ensure that theforthcoming Bill on Prices and Incomes would reach theStatute Book not later than mid-July.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation with theChief Whip, would arrange for all Ministers to beappropriately reminded of their duty to be present in person at the critical stages in the Parliamentary debates on the Bill and to instruct their junior Ministers and parliamentary Private Secretaries that they would beexpected to support the Bill and, when necessary, to vote in its favour.
CONFIDENTIALRace 4.   The Home Secretary said that he had informed theRelations Parliamentary Committee earlier that morning of the conclusions(Previous       reached on the previous day at a meeting of the MinisterialReference *CC (68) 4th Committee on Immigration and Assimilation. As regardsConclusions, immigration it seemed likely that, despite the operation of the minute 2) Commonwealth Immigration Act, the total numbers of commonwealth Commonwealth immigrants this year would, as in 1967, be betweenimmigration 50)000 and gQ^OO. This was a higher rate of entry than we could accept permanently, but the Committee had decided against any reduction, for the present at any rate, in the number of vouchers tobe issued to Commonwealth immigrants or to Asians from Kenya;they had also decided against any changes in the broad basis onwhich dependants were allowed to accompany or join voucherholders. Officials had, however, been instructed to examine certain aspects of the arrangements under which dependants, such as fiancees,were allowed to enter and other possible means of reducingimmigration, for example by discriminating in favour of unmarriedindividuals in the issue of vouchers. A major difficulty in formulatingpolicy in relation to immigration was the dearth of reliable statistics,on which to assess the likely future trend of immigration, particularly of the dependants of voucher holders and immigrants who had entered before controls were imposed in 1962. It had been assumed that by now the number of dependants entering would have begun to decline, but there was as yet no sign of this. Efforts were beingmade to improve our information and officials had been instructedto examine what rate of immigration from the new Commonwealththis country could absorb in the light of the best assessment that could be made of the prospective entry under existing rules. officials had also been instructed to make an examination of the problems of housing, education, health and employment in the areas whereimmigrants were concentrated and to make recommendations on what additional programmes were needed; any such, programmes,which would be brought before the Cabinet, would have to be framedand presented as relating to the general needs of crowded urban areas and not to immigrants as such. He asked that the ministers responsible for education, housing and health should each make available two officials to work with his own on these problems as a first call on their time.On the political aspects of race relations, it was essential that a major effort should be mounted to educate public opinion, makinguse of the resources of the Central Office of Information and of the television and radio networks. It would also be necessary, in his view, to handle the further stages of the Race Relations Bill in a(3) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with theLord Privy Seal, to arrange for the Parliamentary LabourParty and the Trade Union Group to be made fully aware, by appropriate means, of the great political importance which attached to the enactment of the Bill.
manner which would offer the best prospect of securing a broadnational consensus. To this end he would, for example, be preparedto consider some relaxation in the provision which would compelfirms with as few as 10 employees to abide by the employmentprovisions of the Bill. But, both for political reasons and in thelong-term national interest, there could be no departure from themain principles of the Bill and the areas which it covered. the leader of the Liberal Party, Mr. Jeremy Thorpe, had suggested thatthe Select Committee which he (the Home Secretary) had proposed should deal both with the Government assistance necessary in themain areas affected by immigration and also with the rate at whichimmigrants into this country could be absorbed. The first of these suggestions could not be accepted since the Government must retain control of expenditure, but he would be willing to accept the secondsince this was a matter on which broad agreement should be sought.In discussion , there was general agreement on the need toobtain more reliable statistics on immigration and emigration. Therewas support for the view that a continuing rate of immigration fromthe new Commonwealth as high as 50-60,000 annually into thiscountry was more than could be absorbed successfully although itwas pointed out that until the recent controversy had arisen, this rateof entry had not been causing undue difficulty. AlthoughCommonwealth immigrants were making a valuable contribution tosome aspects of our national life, for example in hospitals andtransport, there was no agreed view on the net result of their presencefor the social services as a whole. There would be advantage in seeking through the proposed Select Committee on Race Relationsa national consensus on the rate of immigration that could be absorbed annually; but the Committee should not deal with theamount of assistance to be made available to areas where there were large concentrations of immigrants. There should be no question ofdeparting from the main principles of the Race Relations Bill,although concessions on matters of detail could be considered.It was essential to the success of our race relations policy thatthere should be a greater public understanding of the problems thatwe faced and of the relevance of the measures that we were taking todeal with them. There was at present a widespread, thoughunwarranted, fear in the country of being overwhelmed byimmigrants. A major publicity campaign was necessary and it was important that information should be made available direct to the&quot;mmigrant communities themselves if the risk of their adoptingextreme attitudes was to be avoided. A revised brief covering all aspects of the race relations problem would be available from theLord Presidents Office before the weekend and the Prime Ministerand the Home Secretary would make major speeches on the subject.Measures that had already been taken would alleviate the housingproblem in the areas affected but additional expenditure would berequired if sufficient schools were to be made available. Provisionof these should not cause resentment, however, as places for whitechildren were in some cases not available in the areas concernedbecause of the influx of immigrant children.
CabinetSecurity ofMinisterialDiscussions(previous reference:CC (68) 20thConclusions,Minute 1)secret. The Minister of Technology drew attention to recentindications of the continuing briefing of the Press about allegeddisagreements within the Cabinet. The latest example was an article in the Sunday Telegraph of 28th April; but similar material had appeared in the Spectator and there had earlier been articles in theFinancial Times which appeared to be directed to undermining theposition of the First Secretary of State and the Chief Whip.The Prime Minister said that the systematic briefing which seemed to lie behind the articles in question transcended the limits of normal criticism; and, in so far as it might be thought to derive from an informed source or sources, it was unduly damaging to theGovernment and tended to undermine the principle of collectiveCC 28 (68)The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet accepted that for the present there should be no reductionin the numbers of vouchers issued to Commonwealth immigrants orchanges in the main principles on which dependants or voucherholders were admitted. Nor should there be any departure from themain principles of the Race Relations Bill. It would be acceptable,however, for the terms of reference of the proposed Select Committeeon Race Relations to be widened so that there could be discussion ofthe numbers of immigrants that we could absorb. A major effort toeducate public opinion on the race relations problem should bemounted. This Government had provided greater resources for thesocial services in the areas in which immigrants had concentrated than had the previous Administration. An examination should, however,be made by the Home Secretary, in consultation with the other ministers concerned, of what further assistance was needed for these areas and, as the Home Secretary had requested, staff should be madeavailable to assist him in this work. It would be important that any additional programmes should be of general application in the areas concerned and should not discriminate in favour of immigrants assuch. Any new programmes would have to be financed within thePublic Expenditure Survey Committee ceilings on expenditure bydiverting resources from elsewhere and proposals should be brought before the Parliamentary Committee and the Cabinet.The Cabinet (1) Took note with approval of the Prime Ministers summing upof their discussion.(2) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the other ministers concerned, to arrange for the preparation and submission to the Parliamentary Committee and to the Cabinet of proposals for additional assistance to areas in whichimmigrants had concentrated on the lines indicated by thePrime Minister in his summing up of their discussion.

He had therefore asked the Lord Chancellor, with theassistance of a few Ministers not immediately concerned, to investigatethese cases.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ statement.confidential. The Foreign Secretary said that the Security Council had passed a resolution on 27th April requesting Israel not to hold amilitary parade in Jerusalem to celebrate the 20th Anniversary of her independence. We had supported this resolution on the ground thatthe proposed parade would be provocative. Israel had disregardedthe Security CounciLs request; and Jordan was now asking forfurther discussion in the Council with a view to censuring Israel.The United Kingdom Representative at the United Nations, LordCaradon, would do all he could to avoid developments which might endanger the prospects of the conciliation mission of the special representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations,Mr. Gunnar Jarring. In view of israels refusal to abide by theSecurity Council resolution he would not himself be attending theIsrael Ambassadors reception that day on the occasion of Israel&apos;independence Day. There was however no reason why other membersof the Cabinet should not attend; and the Minister of State forForeign Affairs, Mr. Goronwy Roberts, would do so,Mr. Jarring was still trying to work out an arrangementacceptable to the United Arab Republic (UAR), Jordan and Israel,which would include israels acceptance of the Security council resolution of 22nd November and provide for separate meetings in new York between Mr. Jarring and representatives of the Arab states on the one hand and Israel on the other. King Hussein of Jordanhad agreed to support such an arrangement if the UAR would doso. But the UAR had not yet committed itself, nor had Israel.President Nasser had recently made a public speech saying that a resumption of hostilities was inevitable. IsraeLs attitude, as reflected in a recent letter to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, wasin doubt. He proposed to take the opportunity of a forthcoming visit to this country by the Israeli Foreign Minister, Mr. Eban, to urgehim to support Mr. Jarring&apos;s proposals.The Foreign Secretary said that discussion was still proceeding inthe Security Council on a resolution on Rhodesia. The Afro-AsianGroup had dropped their insistence on the use of force; but they were still pressing for the inclusion of provisions which it would be difficult,and in some cases, impossible for us to accept. Much would dependon the attitude in the Security Council of the representatives of Brazil,Paraguay and Denmark. He had recently spoken to the DanishForeign Minister, who had not been as forthcoming as he had hoped;but Denmark might be more helpful if there were a danger of deadlockin the Council. He would be consulting the Ministers principally concerned on what further concessions we might make to reach agreement in the Council.
Vietnam(previous reference:CC (68) 26thConclusions,Minute 3)PeopledRepublicof theSouthernYemen(previous reference:CC (68) 23rdConclusions,Minute 2)The Foreign Secretary said that, except for some defence equipment, our interim aid of  12 million to the southern yemen would have been completely expended by the end of thismonth. He proposed that the last instalment should be paid unlessSouthern Yemen defaulted on its obligations. Negotiations on further aid were now taking place in Aden. We had offered amaximum of  If million which was much less than the southern yemen Government had asked for; and we must accept that thenegotiations might break down.In discussion it was suggested that if we failed to reach agreementthere might be a complete breakdown of law and order in southern yemen with consequent risks to British lives and property.In discussion reference was made to an interview with Mr. IanSmith which had been published in the Sunday Telegraph on 28thApril. Mr. Smith&apos;s attitude closely reflected the line he had taken with the Commonwealth Secretary during the latter&apos;s visit to Salisburyin November 1967. It was clear that there were serious divisionswithin the ruling Rhodesia Front Party as a result of the recent reportby the Constitutional Commission which had come down strongly against the principle of apartheid. It was on this account unwelcome to the Right wing of the Rhodesia Front, some of whom had alreadyformed a separate party. The intransigent line now taken publiclyby Mr. Smith was probably intended as a counter to extremistpressures against him within the Rhodesia Front.The Foreign Secretary said that over the Easter week-end hehad instructed our Ambassador in Washington to put to the UnitedStates Government our view that it would be unwise to appear to befrustrating the prospect of early peace talks with North Vietnam byarguing about the meeting-place. He had taken the opportunity to repeat this view to the United States Under-Secretary of State,Mr. Katzenbach, during his recent visit to London for the council meeting of the Central Treaty Organisation. He had the impression that the United States Government were fairly confident that agreement on a meeting-place would be reached; and confidentialcontacts were already taking place between them and the north vietnamese Government. Although the United States had proposed16 different meeting-places and North Vietnam only two, the UnitedStates should be careful to avoid losing international goodwill byappearing to be responsible for delaying peace talks.In discussion it was suggested that in order to break the deadlockwe might possibly join with the Soviet Union, as the other Co-Chairman of the Geneva Conference, in proposing that the peacetalks should be held by mutual agreement in both London and moscow. It was pointed out that we should first need to know moreabout the Soviet attitude. At present it appeared that the soviet union was afraid of taking any initiative which might be unwelcome to North Vietnam.
british honduras(previous reference:CC (67) 53rdConclusions,Minute 2)BermudaGibraltar(previous reference:CC (67) 57thConclusions,Minute 2)Nigeria(previous reference:CC (67) 68thConclusions,Minute 2)The Prime Minister said that he would consider with the foreign secretary the desirability of discussing this aspect of the problem inthe Defence and Oversea Policy Committee.The Foreign Secretary said that he had made available to theHouse of Commons the report of the United States mediator.Mr. B. M. Webster, on the dispute between the United Kingdom andGuatemala over British Honduras. The report was more favourable to British Honduras and less favourable to the Guatemalan claimthan had been expected. The Government could not express a view on its recommendations until we had consulted the Government ofBritish Honduras. At the request of the Guatemalan ForeignMinister, Senor Arenales, he had delayed the publication of the reportfor a few days so that discussions could take place in New Yorkbetween Senor Arenales and the Minister of State for ForeignAffairs, Mr. Mulley. As a result of those discussions theGuatemalan Government had not, as had been expected, denouncedus for publishing the report, although the report itself had been thesubject of attacks in the Guatemalan Press.The, Commonwealth Secretary said that the Government ofBritish Honduras were anxious to avoid rejection of the report. Butit had been attacked by the Opposition and there had already been some minor disturbances.The Commonwealth Secretary said that order had now been restored in Bermuda after the race riots which had taken place overthe week-end. There had been no loss of life, although several personshad been injured and there had been some damage to property. Therehad been no further rioting since the arrival of the Royal Navy frigateand British troops. But the situation was still delicate. Bermuda wasabout to hold its first elections. It seemed possible that the riots hadbeen provoked by outsiders who had arrived in Bermuda for theelection campaign; and the Governor had appointed a Commissionof Inquiry. It was important to restore as soon as possible conditionsin which the election campaign could proceed freely.The Commonwealth Secretary said he had information thatSpain might shortly try to close the frontier between Spain and gibraltar against tourists and Gibraltarians. He did not favour asuggestion which had been made for retaliatory action against Spanishlabour entering the colony.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the prospect of bringing the two sides in the Nigerian civil war to the negotiating table had greatly improved. The Prime Ministers recent confidential message to the Head of the Federal Military Government, General Gowon, had contributed to this improvement. It had led to the visit to london by the Nigerian Federal Commissioner for External Affairs who had said that the Federal Government were prepared to negotiate withoutpreconditions. There had been reports that President Kenyatta of kenya might be asked to mediate. But it was doubtful if he would be acceptable to the authorities of the Eastern Region.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Foreign Secretary and theCommonwealth Secretary and of the points made in discussion.
industrial affairs pay claims in theShipbuildingandEngineeringIndustriesSECRET 11CC 28 (68)SECRET7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the first secretary of State and Secretary of State for Employment and productivity (C (68) 70) about pay negotiations in the shipbuilding and engineering industries.The First Secretary of State said that the Cabinet would wish toknow the latest developments in three related sets of negotiations inthese crucial sectors.As regards manual workers in the engineering industry, theEngineering Employers Federation (EEF) had made an offer to the confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions (CSEU)including increases in minimum earnings levels spread over a three-year period and improvements in the guaranteed week, in return forundertakings by the unions on productivity and training. The CSEUhad demanded further concessions from the employers, notably ageneral wage increase, as a prerequisite for any negotiations onimprovements in productivity.As regards manual workers in shipbuilding, the Shipbuilding andRepairers&apos; National Association had made an offer to the CSEU which went beyond that of the EEF, notably in providing for small generalwage increases in May 1969, and May 1970, in return for detailedundertakings on productivity and training. The CSEU would be giving their reply to the employers that day.As regards draughtsmen, the EEF had now made an offer to theDraughtsmen&apos;s and Allied Technicians&apos; Association (DATA) of improvements in national minimum scales in return for undertakingsdirected to higher productivity. It would be difficult to reconcile theemployers&apos; offer with incomes policy. DATA had accepted it subjectto the deletion of certain of the productivity conditions and theemployers were still considering the Association&apos;s reply.She had met representatives of the CSEU before the Conferenceof the Executive on the previous day. While there had been somecomplaints at her intervention at this stage, in general the CSEUrepresentatives had accepted it. They had put to her their objectionsto the employers&apos; offer for engineering workers: in their view, theemployers were unreasonably demanding extensive concessions on productivity in return for improvements in minimum earnings levelswhich were justified on their own merits under the incomes policycriterion relating to low-paid workers. She had made it clear thatshe was concerned at this stage simply to clarify the position and wasnot intervening in the negotiations. She had emphasised the incomes policy criteria by which the Government would have to judge the outcome; the CSEU representatives had taken the line that their responsibility was to pursue negotiations and that the applicationof the criteria to whatever settlement resulted was not a matter for them. She had suggested that they should consider thepossibilities of a combination of concessions within the confines ofthe incomes policy, and had indicated that there might be scope onthis basis for improvements in addition to increases in minimumearnings levels if sufficiently firm assurances of concessions on productivity were forthcoming.
She had seen representatives of the EEF later on the previous day. It was clear that they did not regard the negotiations as havingreached deadlock and they had agreed to explore the possibility ofa combination of concessions such as she had suggested to the CSEU.It had been learned during her meeting with the employers that theConference of Executives of the CSEU had passed a resolution calling for a one-day national stoppage in engineering on 15th May andthreatening a ban on overtime and other sanctions if the confederation^ demands were not met. The resolution had, however,expressed willingness to meet the employers at any time and she had urged the EEF representatives to make a quick and friendlyresponse to this; they had not yet done so and her Department werein touch with them with a view to persuading them of the desirabilityof an early resumption of negotiations.The negotiations with the draughtsmen raised difficult issues.While the employers&apos; offer ostensibly affected only minimum earnings,the increases would probably spread to draughtsmen on higher rates,and the productivity conditions were unsatisfactory. The employers were susceptible to pressure because of the draughtsmen&apos;s key role in production, and she had warned them of the danger of taking atough line with the manual workers but making over-generousconcessions to the draughtsmen.She would keep in touch with the Home Secretary about theneed for a meeting of the Official Committee on Emergencies toconsider what action might be required if we were faced withwidespread stoppages of work.The Cabinet-Took note of C (68) 70 and the statement by the First Secretaryof State.IndustrialPolicyHotelDevelopmentIncentivesScheme: draft white PaperSECRET8. The Cabinet considered a note by the President of the Boardof Trade (C (68) 71) to which was attached a draft White Paper on aHotel Development Incentives Scheme.The President of the Board of Trade said he had informed theHouse of Commons on 20th March of the Governmenfs intention tointroduce a scheme of assistance by means of grants and loans towardsthe capital cost of providing new hotel accommodation and theextension and improvement of existing hotels. He had undertaken to publish a White Paper giving further details. The draft attached tohis note took account of comments on earlier drafts by the MinisterialWorking Party on Industrial Investment and by the Committee on home Publicity. In view of the lapse of time since the announcementof the Governmenfs proposals, it was desirable that the White paper should be published as soon as possible.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that when the steering committee on Economic Policy had approved the proposals nowembodied in the draft White Paper, they had done so on theunderstanding that expenditure under the new scheme would be balanced by savings from the withdrawal of assistance under the Local
Employment Acts to projects in the services sector. However, whenthe Committee on Environmental Planning had considered this attheir meeting on 22nd April, they had not felt able to approve thewithdrawal of assistance but had remitted the matter for further study.Until the withdrawal of assistance had been approved, he could not agree to publication of the White Paper.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the text of the draft White Paper on assistance tohotels but agreed that the question of withdrawing assistance underthe Local Employment Acts to projects in the services sector shouldbe resolved by the Steering Committee on Economic Policy before theWhite Paper could be published. The Steering Committee should accordingly consider this issue at their meeting on 7th May.Meanwhile, in order to avoid delay in publication, the printing of theWhite Paper should go forward.The Cabinet-.(1) Agreed that the White Paper on a Hotel DevelopmentIncentives Scheme annexed to C (68) 71 should bepublished, subject to the condition mentioned by thePrime Minister in his summing up.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for the steering Committee on Economic Policy to consider attheir meeting on 7th May the withdrawal of assistance under the Local Employment Acts to projects in theservices sector.Cabinet Office, S.W.J,2nd May, 1968.
