CC 17 (68)secret. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of future policy on productivity, prices and incomes, and of the memoranda on thissubject by the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs (C (68) 45)and by the President of the Board of Trade (C (68) 46).The Secretary of State for Economic Affairs said that, with theMinister of Labour, he had discussed future prices and incomes policy in general terms with representatives of the Confederation ofBritish Industry (CBI). In particular, he had put to them the concept of a ceiling on increases in earnings. They had reacted unfavourablyto this; they felt that once a ceiling figure was promulgated, thiswould be tantamount to inviting trade unions to press forsettlements not less than this figure; they also doubted whether a ceiling could be enforced. They advocated a purely qualitativeapproach, relying solely on the application of criteria for wage increases. Although the CBI in general favoured a tougher incomes policy, experience had shown that reliance on criteria without anyceiling on earnings would not in practice prevent substantial wage increases. He doubted whether the views which the CBIrepresentatives expressed represented their final judgment orreflected the general opinion of employers.There had been no collective discussions with representativesof the Trades Union Congress (TUC) since before the Conferenceof trade union executives on 28th February. He had, however, withthe Minister of Labour, had a private talk with the general secretary of the TUC since then. Mr. Woodcock&apos;s attitude hadbeen predictable: he continued to oppose any further legislation asa matter of principle, and advocated a voluntary policy.In discussion it was suggested that there were recent indications that opposition to a more stringent incomes policy among theGovernments supporters in Parliament was less intransigent than had previously been supposed. As regards the attitude of the tradeunions, however, it should not be inferred from the reactions ofthe TUC General Secretary that they would be prepared to acquiesce reluctantly in such a policy. More important was the factthat two of the major unions had opposed the tuc&apos;s voluntaryincomes policy outright and would clearly be even more strongly opposed to a policy enforced by extended statutory powers. It was extremely doubtful, in view of the attitude of these unions andothers who supported them, whether the TUC machinery for vettingwage claims could continue to function.The extent to which the Government could gain acceptance inParliament and elsewhere for a stricter incomes policy would be liable to depend significantly on the extent to which other formsof income, particularly dividend payments, were subjected tocorresponding restraint. It was therefore difficult to form a finaljudgment between a more and a less rigorous prices and incomes policy in advance of the forthcoming Budget.  On the other hand,
it was clear that a strict incomes policy was essential if wage increases were not to get out of control and if we were to prevent the erosionof the benefits of devaluation. Moreover, the relation between fiscal policy and wage movements should not be exaggerated: the level of wage settlements depended primarily on bargaining factors in theparticular circumstances of the industry or firm in question andwere not appreciably influenced by fiscal measures which did notbear directly on the negotiating situation. For these reasons it wasnecessary to take decisions on future prices and incomes policy ontheir own merits.In further discussion there was some support for the view thatthe case for extended statutory powers had not been made out. Theexercise of such powers in the past had yielded only marginal results in terms of wage movements. New powers of the kind which hadbeen proposed by the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs were likely to lead to a major confrontation with the trade unions, possiblyinvolving extensive strikes. It was doubtful if the proposed powers would in fact be enforcible or could be so framed as to survivechallenge in the Courts. An alternative to fresh legislation wouldbe to renew the powers in Part II of the Prices and Incomes Act,1966, by Order for a further year after their expiry in August 1968.These powers, which had not yet been fully used, enabled theGovernment to introduce statutory notification of wage and price increases; and it was for consideration whether the government need go further. This would, in particular, avoid the acute difficultieslikely to arise if, as had been proposed, the Government were to take power to defer wage and price increases for up to 12 months,acting on their own initiative and without reference to the national board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI). If the Government were toexercise such powers of their own motion, the Departmentsconcerned would require substantial additional staff; and even thenthey would not have the necessary resources to discriminate between different wage claims or settlements with an assurance of fairness.Against this, it was argued that extended statutory powers were essential in the present situation. Government pronouncements,both in Parliament and in consultations with the TUC, had in no way pre-judged this issue. Merely to rely on a renewal of thepowers in Part II of the 1966 Act would mean continued reliance on a policy which was basically voluntary; but the situation had now changed in that the TUC, following the recent Conference,could no longer be expected to prosecute such a policy effectively.It was difficult to make a precise assessment of the course of wagemovements under a voluntary policy, since most of the trade unionconferences at which wage claims were habitually formulated hadnot yet taken place this year. But settlements in recent monthshad shown average increases in national rates of 6-8 per cent,which would imply larger increases in earnings when account wastaken of wage drift. It was particularly significant that the average increase in hourly wage rates during January had amounted to2 per cent. The situation was dominated by the wage claim in theengineering industry, where the union&apos;s opening bid would represent
CC 17 (68)an addition of some 17 per cent to the industry&apos;s wage bill, thoughclearly even the unions were not expecting to obtain this increase infull. In general, the indications were that in the absence of a stricterincomes policy the increase in incomes per head over the next12 months could be 8-10 per cent or even more. In this situation there was a strong case for additional statutory powers on the lines proposed by the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs. Whilethe exercise of these powers would present formidable difficulties,the concept of a ceiling on wage increases would considerably ease the problem since, although the criteria for wage increases would still apply to increases below the ceiling, the process of vetting claims and settlements in this area could be less stringent than the vetting ofsettlements which exceeded the ceiling. While it would be highly desirable for the Government to exercise their powers of delay onlyin conjunction with references to the NBPI, the number of claims orsettlements exceeding the ceiling would be so great that the board would be swamped if all these cases were referred to them. It wastherefore essential that the Government should be able to exercisethese powers without reference to the NBPI. But a possiblecompromise would be to empower the Government to enforcedelays only for a limited period of, say, two or three months ratherthan for the full 12 months before making a reference to the Board.It was generally accepted that, if the ceiling on wage increasewere fixed at 34: per cent, the increase in practice would almost inevitably exceed this. Some Ministers argued that averageincreases in the region of 5 per cent were the very least that couldbe expected and that to fix a ceiling of 3J per cent was asking forthe impossible. The gap between such a figure and the lowestaverage increase we could expect in practice was so great that thepolicy would not be credible. Moreover, with price increases ofsome 5 per cent expected following devaluation a ceiling of 34: percent would be taken to imply a cut in real wages which might imply that the policy would not command the necessary degree of acceptance. It would be better to face these facts and to fix the ceiling at a figure of 4 per cent or 44: per cent, making clear thatthe Government intended to hold the line firmly. This would greatlyreduce the risk of confrontation with the trade unions and the results in terms of wage increases would not be greatly affected.On the other hand it was argued that, if the ceiling were fixed at 4 per cent or 4\ Per cent and this led to increases of this orderin national wage rates, the resulting increases in earnings would be quite unacceptable. Moreover, the figure of 34: per cent had beengiven to the TUC before the Conference on 28th February as anestimate of the kind of increase which the country could affordin present circumstances; and the figure had also been given inParliament in relation to what had been said to the TUC. TheGovernment were now widely expected to propose a ceiling of34; Per cent; and to bring forward a higher figure at this stage would prejudice any hope of co-operation from the CBI, which was essential to the success of the policy, and would also be liable to
have a disastrous effect on confidence abroad. If a ceiling ofVi per cent could be made reasonably effective, this should reducethe increase in incomes per head by about \\ per cent below what it would otherwise have been; and this would be a crucial gain inour present economic circumstances.The Cabinet turned to consideration of future policy on prices.It was argued that the absence of effective control over price increases during past phases of the prices and incomes policy hadbeen a major factor in undermining support for the policy amongthe Governmenfs supporters and the trade unions. This would apply with even greater force over the coming months, as price increases following devaluation were more widely felt. Against this,it was pointed out that, since the Government took office, therehad been only one half-year in which prices had increased morethan wages. The Government had acted effectively in confining anumber of recent price increases to the amount justified by increased costs following devaluation and by eliminating any allowance for meeting the cost of wage increases. There was considerable scope for strengthening the policy on the incomes side by taking similar action in respect of future price increases. Onthe whole, the present constant watch and early warningarrangements in respect of price movements were working well;and it would be important to avoid prejudicing this by indiscriminateapplication of statutory notification of price increases.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that,despite the inter-relation between prices and incomes policy and anyfiscal measures which might be found to be required in relation toother forms of income, it was essential that work should proceed on the formulation of prices and incomes policy in the interim.The Cabinet should therefore resume their discussion at their next meeting in order to seek to reach decisions on prices and incomes policy, which could be finally ratified at the appropriate pointthereafter. He would be addressing a meeting of the parliamentary labour Party on the following day and would say that theGovernment considered that further measures in Parliament inpursuance of the prices and incomes policy would be necessary:this would avoid pre-judging a decision as between renewal of theexisting statutory powers by Order in Council and the introductionof fresh legislation.The Cabinet (1) Took note with approval of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(2) Agreed to resume their consideration of future productivity,prices and incomes policy on Thursday, 7th March.
secret. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the First Secretaryof State (C (68) 50) and by the Minister of Social Security (C (68) 51)on assistance to low paid workers.The First Secretary of State said that it was essential to find a means of helping the families of low paid workers both in orderto implement the Governments repeated promises that they wouldbe protected against the effects of devaluation and also to sustain,against a background of rising prices, the more stringent incomes policy now proposed. Any attempt to help these families byexempting low wage earners from the general restrictions proposed would prejudice the success of the incomes policy because of the pressure to maintain differentials. The Social Services Committeehad accordingly considered possible alternative methods. Thepossibility of combining a system of personal housing allowanceswith a recast system of subsidies for local authority housing wasbeing considered as part of a longer-term review of housing subsidies and housing finance generally, but the Committee had concluded that it would not be possible to help low paid families by thismeans within the period for which such reinforcement of the incomes policy was necessary. The extension of the rate rebatescheme did not affect the families in question and it would not be practicable to require local authorities to introduce a uniform rent rebate scheme. A centrally administered scheme of means-testedhousing allowances would be unlikely, apart from the objections,to be acceptable to the trade unions as a reinforcement of the incomes policy. The Committee had therefore concluded that helpcould be provided for low-income families this year only through an increase in the rate of family allowances. They had been advised that, partly as a result of the additional work consequent onadjusting income tax allowances to take account of the 7s. increasein family allowances to be introduced in April, the most serious difficulties would be caused for the Inland Revenue if there were any attempt to associate a further increase of family allowanceswith further reductions of income tax allowances in 1968-69 (a &quot; giveand take &quot; arrangement) although this might be done as part of thelarger &quot; give and take&quot; operation which was proposed for 1969-70in relation to existing family allowances. It would, however, bepossible for the cost of an increase of family allowances in 1968-69to be partly offset by savings which could be made in that year in national insurance expenditure by abolishing the payment of benefit for the first three days of sickness or unemployment and by restricting the payment of unemployment benefit to occupational pensioners. The first increase would save initially  15 million in afull year and more later and the second  4 million in a full year.While the Chief Secretary, Treasury, had reserved theChancellor^ position as regards both the timing and the amountof any increase in family allowances, the Committee had concluded that an increase of 5s. would be justified against the background
of a likely increase in prices of over 5 per cent, the greater part ofwhich might have occurred by the autumn. They further concluded that the increase should be made in October when supplementary benefit would also be increased, since there would be criticism ifincreased family allowances were paid before additional provision was made to meet hardship among the elderly. On this basis a 5s.increase of family allowances would cost some  30- 32 million in1968-69 net of social security offsets and of tax at present rates;this would be further offset by the proposed savings on national insurance expenditure which, if brought into operation as soon aspossible, might amount to   10-  12 million in that year. The netextra cost would thus be very small in relation to the sums that were at stake in the field of incomes policy. In 1969-70 and subsequent years the cost of the family allowance increase would be more than offset by reductions in income tax allowances on a &quot; give and take &quot;basis, in addition to the continuing reduction of  19 million a year in national insurance expenditure.The Minister of Social Security said that there was no satisfactory alternative to assisting the low-income families by anincrease of family allowances. Such families were not assisted byfiscal measures of redistribution and tended to be in the employmentsto which wage restraint was most firmly applied. In any event togive them exceptional treatment under the incomes policy would boththreaten the success of that policy and be unsatisfactory in itself,since wage increases paid no regard to the extent of family responsibilities. In the context of the Governmenfs measuresgenerally, it was not a valid objection that family allowances werenot generally popular; there were in any case indications that thisunpopularity would be substantially reduced by the introduction ofthe &quot; give and take&quot; arrangements. While it might appearinconsistent to make a further increase of family allowances in theautumn, not accompanied by &quot; give and take &quot; arrangements, thisapparent inconsistency could be justified because of the practicaldifficulties and in the light of an intention to apply &quot; give and take &quot;arrangements to the further increase in April 1969.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he accepted on balance that family allowances should be further increased; but tomake an increase unaccompanied by &quot; give and take &quot; arrangementsafter applying &quot; give and take &quot; arrangements to the increase madein April 1968 with the intention of extending it in the followingApril would give an impression of vacillation. Further, a 5s. increaseof family allowances in October offset only by the proposed reductions of national insurance expenditure would cost anadditional  20 million in 1968-69 bringing the increase inGovernment expenditure in that year above the 5 per cent limitalready announced and would damage confidence overseas in our economic policies. Any increase in family allowances should not lead to any net increase in social security expenditure in the current year. However, further consideration by the Chief Secretary,Treasury, had shown that, if an increase of family allowances takingeffect in October 1968 were limited to 3s., it would be possible to
introduce &quot; give and take &quot; adjustments of income tax allowanceswhich over the whole financial year would offset the increase paid for the last six months of the year. While this would have the disadvantage that tax allowances should be reduced before the family allowance increase became payable, he would be prepared toaccept a 3s. increase of family allowances on this basis. taken together with the reductions in national insurance expenditureproposed by the Minister, there would be no net increase in public expenditure. The only alternative possibility acceptable to himwould be a 5s. increase in family allowances from April 1969 withconcurrent &quot; give and take &quot; arrangements.In discussion it was suggested, in view of the difficulty of ensuring a sufficient increase in family allowances, that it might be preferable to relax the proposed limitation on pay increases inrelation to the lower paid. There was, however, considerable support for the view that there was no practical alternative to assisting thelower-paid families through an increase of family allowances, becauseof the risk to the incomes policy if they were excepted from thegeneral limitations on pay increases. In particular, to give assistancethrough family allowances would ensure that the proportionateaddition to a family&apos;s income was greatest in the case of the lowestpaid and the largest families. While an increase of family allowanceswas unlikely to affect wage negotiations themselves, it couldinfluence substantially the attitude of the TUC and of theGovernments Parliamentary supporters to the prices and incomes policy. From this point of view, an increase of 5s. was the leastthat would be effective and should not be deferred beyond October1968. On the other hand, it was pointed out that, because of the size of the adjustment to income tax allowances which would haveto be made at the beginning of the financial year under &quot; give and take &quot; arrangements, it would not be practicable to introduce anincrease of family allowances of as much as 5s. during 1968-69, nor could such an arrangement avoid some net increase of expenditure.It was suggested that, assuming that his wages increased up to the permitted ceiling of 1\ per cent, a 3s. increase in family allowances would ensure that the income of a man with four children earning 13 a week would fully keep pace with the likely increase in prices,quite apart from the 7s. increase in family allowances that wouldbe made in April. While this 7s. increase had been given in orderto increase the standard of living of the lower income family andshould not be subsumed in the further increase that was necessaryto maintain that standard, the two increases could be presented asreasonably generous treatment of the families concerned in present economic circumstances.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed on balance that family allowances should beincreased by 3s. a week in October, with a corresponding adjustment of income tax allowances on a &quot; give and take &quot; basis, which would operate over the whole financial year. In addition, the cabinet approved the proposals of the Minister of Social Security to abolish
payment of benefit for the first three days of sickness and unemployment and to restrict the right of occupational pensionersto receive unemployment benefit.The Cabinet-Agreed that legislation should be introduced to increasefamily allowances by 3s. a week in October 1968 with anassociated adjustment of tax allowances for 1968-69 under&quot; give and take &quot; arrangements, and to abolish payment of sickness and unemployment benefit for the first three days of absence from work; and that the right of occupational pensioners to receive unemployment benefit should be restricted.Cabinet Office, SWA,5th March, 1968.
