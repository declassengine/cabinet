CC 32 (68)SECRET*1. The Prime Minister said that it was disturbing that there appeared to have been a disclosure to the Press of the course ofrecent Ministerial discussions about the reform of the House ofLords. In so far as this must be inferred to be the result of ministerial indiscretion, it was greatly to be regretted, since it was calculated not only to deprive the Government of their tacticaladvantage in relation to the Opposition but also to cast doubt on the government&apos;s unity of purpose in this context. He would have toconsider how he should now pursue the matter.The Cabinet Took note.confidential. The First Secretary of State said that, having established a court of inquiry to consider the dispute at Ford&apos;s Dagenhamfactory about the grading of women sewing machinists, she hadbeen able to secure the agreement of the trade unions concerned toa return to work, on the condition that the court should consider attheir first meeting on 27th June whether details of the job evaluationscheme applied to the sewing machinists should be made availableto the court and to the unions. She hoped that in consequence thewomen would return to work by 1st July at the latest.The Cabinet were informed that the decision by theAmalgamated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen(ASLEF) to begin working to rule had not so far appreciablyaggravated the dislocation caused by the work to rule and ban onovertime imposed by the National Union of Railwaymen (NUR).British Rail were giving priority to commuter and freight-linerservices, and commuters, though delayed, had been able to get toand from work. Freight-liners, which were largely devoted to exports, were also running fairly normally. Only a small proportionof the country&apos;s freight was carried by rail, and there was no reasonto expect that food supplies or the operation of essential services would be affected. Traffic by road, though heavy on the south-eastern approaches to London, was continuing to move satisfactorily.In discussion it was suggested that, in view of the decision taken by ASLEF, the Minister of Transport would be expected tomake a statement in the House of Commons. There was some risk that a statement indicating the success of British Rail . in maintaining commuter and freight services, though reassuring to thepublic, might suggest to the unions that their action should bedirected towards disrupting these particular services. The BritishRail Board &apos;s priorities had already been made clear, however, bytheir own statements. The opportunity could usefully be taken to* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET9116 A -
make clear the facts of the dispute and, in particular, to emphasise the substantial increase in pay for the lowest-paid workers which british Rail had already offered. On the question of government intervention in the dispute, it was important, on the one hand, toencourage British Rail to face their financial responsibility withoutrelying on Government assistance, and, on the other, to bring home to the unions that industrial action could lose the railways the long-term benefits which the Transport Bill was designed to secure forthem. The Government should not, however, appear to be indifferent to the inconvenience inflicted on the public, and it might well benecessary eventually to help the two sides to find some face-savingformula for agreement.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Minister of Transport should make astatement in the House of Commons that afternoon on the lines indicated in their discussion, and that they should not rule out thepossibility that the conciliation machinery of the Department ofEmployment and Productivity might eventually be used to find a formula for agreement, though it would be appropriate to interveneonly at the request of British Rail and on the clear understandingthat there could be no departure from the principles of the prices and incomes policy.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Transport, after consultation withthe First Secretary of State, to make a statement in theHouse of Commons later in the day on the lines indicatedin their discussion.FultonCommitteeReport onthe CivilService(previous reference:CC (68) 31stConclusions,Minute 5)SECRET*3. In their resumed discussion the Cabinet had before them anote by the Prime Minister (C (68) 79) to which were attached thereport of the Committee on the Civil Service (the Fulton Committee)and a memorandum by the Official Head of the Home Civil Service.There was wide support for the view that when the report was published the Government should make a positive statementannouncing their acceptance in principle of the three main recommendations. Great care should, however, be taken to avoid further damage to the morale of civil servants, many of whom wouldresent the criticisms in Chapter I of the report. The report should be presented as part of a planned programme of modernisation in whichthe work of the Royal Commissions on Local Government and the interdepartmental Committee on Local Authority Personal services were important elements.The following points were also made:(a) The report did not give enough emphasis to regional needs.It was important that recruits to the Service should spend sometime in the regional and local offices of Departments in their early years.* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,25th June, 1968.(b) A thorough examination would be undertaken of thepossibility of &quot; hiving off &quot; areas of Civil Service work from centralgovernment to autonomous boards or corporations, on the lines recommended in the report.(c) The Committee&apos;s observations on the machinery of centralgovernment would attract widespread attention and the statement should make it clear that the Government were aware of the needfor a thorough review.(d) The case for adopting the new grading structure based onjob evaluation, as recommended in the report, was very strong butit would not be at all easy to put into operation.(e) Additional manpower and expenditure arising from thereport would have to be contained within very strict limits. great care must be taken to ensure that, in the transitional period duringwhich the new Civil Service Department was taking over from theTreasury, effective control of staff numbers and costs was maintained.(/) Every effort should be made to offset increases in staffarising from new policies and services by reductions in other directions. A thorough review of the staff required, under existing policies, for certain traditional functions of Government would shortly be instituted.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that he should announce, on the day on whichthe report was published, the Governments acceptance in principleof the recommendations relating to a Civil Service Department, a civil Service College and a unified grading structure. He would pay particular attention to the need to avoid further damage to CivilService morale. He would make it clear that the speed with whichthe Committee&apos;s recommendations could be implemented would be governed by the need to contain the extra expenditure involvedwithin the agreed public expenditure programme; and he would not give any undertaking about the date on which the Civil service department would be set up.The Cabinet-Took  note,  with  approval,  of  the  Prime  Minister^summing up.
