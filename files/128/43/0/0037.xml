ParliamentMotion onthe Conductof the leader of theOppositionCC 37 (68)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business provisionallyarranged for the remaining weeks of the Session in October. the timetable would depend to some extent upon the progress which theHouse of Lords were able to make with Government business during their extra sittings on 7th and 8th October.The Prime Minister said that the Leaders of the two houses of Parliament and the Chief Whips were to be congratulated on thesuccess of their efforts to secure the passage of a heavy programmeof Government measures. He had taken the opportunity of expressing to the First Parliamentary Counsel, Sir Noel Hutton, onhis recent retirement, the Governmenfs appreciation of the mannerin which Parliamentary Counsel had discharged the heavy burdenof drafting which had been laid upon them in the current Sessionof Parliament.The Prime Minister said that a Motion stood on the order paper in the name of Mr. George Willis censuring the Leader ofthe Opposition for seeking to involve the Lord President of theCourt of Session in the work of the committee which the Leader ofthe Opposition was setting up to examine his proposal for a scottish Assembly. The Ministers concerned should consider duringthe Recess, in consultation with the Lord Chancellor as appropriate,what action it would be necessary to take if this Motion or a formalMotion of Censure remained on the Order Paper when the Houseresumed.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord Privy Seal, the Secretary of State forScotland, the Attorney-General and the Lord Advocate, inconsultation with the Lord. Chancellor as appropriate, toconsider what action ought to be taken if either the existingMotion or a formal Motion of Censure were on the order paper when the House of Commons resumed sitting.OverseaAffairsCzechoslovakia(previous reference:CC (68) 36thConclusions,Minute 2)confidential. The Foreign Secretary said that there was little information available about the meeting which had begun on 29th July at CiernaNad Tisu in Czechoslovakia between the Presidium of the central committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and thePolitburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. such reports as there were suggested that the meeting was going fairlywell from the point of view of Czechoslovakia. But the soviet union was in a difficult position and could not make majorconcessions without appearing to suffer a diplomatic defeat. We hadto be very careful about what we said to the Soviet Union on this issue. He had decided that it would be unwise for him to raisethe question with the Soviet Ambassador or to instruct our ambassador to Moscow to do so.   But he had arranged for a9141
message to be conveyed informally to the Soviet Ambassador to theeffect that there were at present several promising possibilities for improving East/West relations, but that it would be impossible tofollow them up if things went wrong in Czechoslovakia. Subsequentlythe Soviet Ambassador had come to see him on 30th July to inform him of a proposal by the Soviet Union and other communist countries to establish an international communications organisation,called Inter-Sputnik, membership of which would be open to allother countries. The Ambassador had not made any reference to czechoslovakia. But the Foreign Secretary had taken theopportunity to repeat the message which had already been conveyedinformally to the Ambassador. The Ambassador^ reaction hadbeen cautious and defensive and he had laid emphasis on the needsof Soviet military security, with particular reference to Germany.Similar approaches had apparently been made in other capitals; andit was clear that their purpose was to elicit world reaction on the czechoslovak issue.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.AircraftIndustryConcorde(previous references:CC(68)2ndConclusionsandCC (68) 10thConclusions,Minute 5)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of technology (C (68) 90) on the future of the Concorde aircraftproject. They also had before them a note by the President of theBoard of Trade and the Minister of Technology (C (68) 95) on theresults of the sonic bang tests carried out over Southern england in July 1967.The Minister of Technology said that, after 5\ years ofdevelopment, the two Concorde prototypes were almost ready to fly, work was proceeding on two pre-production aircraft, andinitial orders had been placed for the materials and tooling requiredfor the production programme. The firms forecast a first flight inNovember, but officials considered that a date in January orFebruary 1969 was more probable. The aircraft would not flysupersonically before the summer of 1969, and was not expectedto be in service before the latter part of 1972. The project was still beset by technical problems, notably those relating toperformance (in terms of range and payload), engine noise and sonicboom; these would not be resolved for at least a year, and after several months of flight testing. If all went well, the total extramuraldevelopment costs might be in the region of  550 million at 1966prices, but the figure could rise to as much as  700 million at 1966prices. The United Kingdom had already spent  120 million on the project. This would increase to  145 million by the end of 1968,and  180 million one year from now. As to the market prospects,total sales were estimated to be in the range 70-165 if there were only a partial restriction on overland supersonic flight; but if all such flights were banned, the total sales would probably drop to55-135.   If sales were as high as 165, foreign exchange benefits
exceeding  1,000 million gross (undiscounted) would be earned;with the more realistic figure of 120 sales, the corresponding balanceof payments benefit (undiscounted) would be  740 million. With120 sales, the implied subsidy would be in the range 9-29 per cent.If we were now to cancel the project by unilateral action, we shouldalmost certainly have to refund the French Government  140- 230million, as a result either of a direct settlement or of an award bythe International Court of Justice. In view of these uncertainties,the prospects for the project could not be effectively assessed; butthe leaders of the British firms involved, whose professionalreputations were at stake, were optimistic, and officials of theMinistry of Technology also took the view that it would be unwise to cancel the project at this stage, when we had a 5-year lead overthe United States.There were four possible courses of action :(1) To continue with the project as an act of faith. This couldnot be advocated.(2) To decide unilaterally to cancel now and to announce thedecision immediately. This would be mistaken, as the project might still prove to be a success, and it would inany case expose us to the payment of damages nearly as great as the cost of continuing.(3) To decide to cancel now, and to plan a strategy of withdrawl leading to cancellation at the end of the year.This course would be hazardous since there would be aserious risk of leakage, and the fact that a decision hadbeen reached several months before we announced thefact to our partners might ultimately have to be disclosed,e.g., in evidence to the Public Accounts Committee. Itwould also require us to involve our French partners in further expenditure which we knew would be fruitless.(4) To seek agreement with the French to(a) criteria relating to development costs and firm orders;and(b) joint consideration on whether to continue with the project if it appeared that the criteria were unlikely to be satisfied.Course (4) would make it possible for us to assess the prospects of cancellation without damages and to provide for the possibilityof technical and commercial success. If this course were favoured,he would hold discussions with M. Chamant, the French Ministerof Transport, and propose a reappraisal of the situation by the concorde Economic Prospects Committee.The Attorney-General said that if, in the event of cancellationby the. United Kingdom, the issue were referred to theInternational Court of Justice, we should have to prove that therehad been a fundamental change in the circumstances surroundingthe project, sufficient to justify a unilateral withdrawal and of such
a nature that it could not have been contemplated at the time ofthe original agreement. Because the technical and marketprospects, though uncertain, did not seem poor enough to justifycancellation, such a case would have to be based on the continuinggrowth of the development costs. Even on costs, however, ourposition was delicate because the previous Government had resistedthe inclusion of a break clause in the knowledge that the project was highly speculative; and the present Government had on several occasions agreed to continue the project with the knowledge of mounting estimates, and this implied a commitment to continue at these higher figures. We should now have to lay down a financiallimit beyond which we would decline to continue. From the pointof view of probable success in the International Court,  600 millionmight be a reasonable figure for this purpose.In discussion it was pointed out that the cost of Course (4)recommended by the Minister of Technology, would exceed that ofCourse (3) by  50 million in 1969-70. This saving was badly needed to provide an adequate contingency allowance in the public expenditure programme, without which it would be extremelydifficult to accommodate the various new items of expenditure whichwould inevitably arise. However, if we were not to cancel the project now, we should direct our attention in the months ahead tothe best means of withdrawing from, rather than of continuing with,the project. If such contingency planning led to a satisfactorystrategy for withdrawal, a decision to cancel at the end of the yearcould then be implemented without delay; and this modifiedCourse (3) would not be open to the objections stated by theMinister of Technology. The chances of success had deterioratedsince the Cabinet reviewed the project in January: the technicalprogramme was behind schedule and these delays might mean that action under Course (4) could not be taken until the end of 1969, upto which time we should be continuing to spend on the project atthe rate of about  1 million a week. If Course (4) were to beadopted, it was essential that the criteria should be strictly adhered to, and that a marginal failure to meet them should not be allowedto postpone the decision to cancel. If the French Governmentwere unwilling to accept the criteria, either in principle or in the specific terms which we considered reasonable, we should cancel the project unilaterally without delay.It was argued that no decision on the future of the project should be announced before the aircraft had made its first flight;any earlier decision would make us more vulnerable to the risk of damages. When the flight tests had shown whether the technical problems could be overcome, the criteria proposed in Course (4)would take effect. The criteria which we should propose to theFrench would require very careful consideration. If we were to propose that the limit of development costs should be  550 million,when it was known that this was regarded by the United kingdom as a conservative estimate, the French would take this as beingtantamount to cancellation. A limit of  600 million should not beopen to this objection.  The second criterion of firm orders from
four major airlines was satisfactory; but it was for consideration whether it would be useful to add a third criterion about enginenoise. If engine noise were not kept within acceptable limits, themarket prospects for the aircraft would be considerably reduced.This point might, however, be subsumed in the criterion relatingto firm orders.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that on balance the Cabinet took the view that we should seek theagreement of the French Government to criteria, relating to development costs and firm orders, in the light of which we couldsubsequently decide whether or not to proceed with the concorde project. If it became clear that the criteria or anyone of them would not be fulfilled, we should then withdraw. If the FrenchGovernment rejected the concept of criteria, or objected to the criteria we considered reasonable, we should cancel at that point;but the Minister should report the situation so that the Cabinet mightratify the decision. In order that such cancellation might beeffected expeditiously and with the minimum risk of damages, thenecessary contingency planning should now be put in hand to develop the best strategy for withdrawal. The limit to be set on development costs should be  600 million at 1966 prices; but this should also beevaluated in terms of current prices and the latter figure should beused for the public presentation of our case in the event of a unilateral cancellation on our part. The criteria should be drafted by the Ministry of Technology in consultation with the Treasury,the Foreign Office, the Board of Trade and the Law Officers&apos;Department, who should also consider whether a limitation onengine noise should be included as a third criterion. If theDepartments concerned were unable to agree, the matter shouldbe reported to the Cabinet. Until cancellation was imminent, itwas accepted that the Ministry of Technology would work for thesuccess of the project and should be seen to be doing so.The Cabinet (1) Agreed to seek the agreement of the French Governmentto criteria on development costs and firm orders, in thelight of which the future of the Concorde project couldbe determined.(2) Agreed that the United Kingdom should take immediate action to withdraw from the project if and as soon as itwas clear that the criteria or any one of them would notbe met, or if the French Government rejected either the concept of criteria or such specific criteria as the UnitedKingdom Government considered reasonable.(3) Invited the Minister of Technology, in consultation with theForeign Secretary, the President of the Board of Trade,the Chief Secretary, Treasury, and the Attorney-General,to arrange for the preparation of suitable criteria on thelines indicated in the Prime Minister^ summing up.
(4) Invited the Minister of Technology to arrange for a discussion of the project with the French Minister ofTransport, M. Chamant, taking account of the points made in discussion and in the Prime Ministers summing up.EuropeanAirbus(previous reference:CC (68) 33rdConclusions,Minute 4 (5))The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of technology (C (68) 91) about the continuation of the projectdefinition stage of the A 300 European Airbus.The Minister of Technology said that much of the expected increase in world air traffic over the next decade was expected tobe carried by aircraft in the airbus category. The A 300 EuropeanAirbus was therefore deliberately designed to meet a real future needand to keep Europe in the main stream of large civil aircraftdevelopment. The immediate issue was whether we should withdraw from the project now, or continue with the project definition stage,to which we had agreed with our French and German partners,until it was completed in four months&apos; time. Although the project,as now defined, did not look economically viable and certain of the criteria incorporated in the Memorandum of Understanding hadnot been met, we should give the firms a chance to put forward more acceptable proposals. We should, however, lay down certain criteriawhich would have to be met if we were to continue further; wemust insist that the production cost be cut by at least 10 per cent;that performance guarantees for airlines be improved; that an assured market for 75 aircraft, underwritten by Governments, be guaranteed; and that the recovery of the Governments investmentbe on the basis of a fixed margin, reducible only in conjunction with areduction of manufacturers&apos; profit to secure particular sales. If we withdrew now, not only would the French and german governments hold us responsible for wrecking an important andpromising project, but future prospects of collaboration in europe would be considerably undermined. If at the end of the projectdefinition stage no improvement in cost, performance and marketwere made, we should have sound economic arguments which wouldenable us to withdraw from the project without odium.In discussion it was pointed out that estimated costs of the project had grown more quickly than those of any other aircraftproject, including the Concorde. It seemed unlikely that the criteria we laid down would be fulfilled, and it would be bettertherefore to cancel the project now rather than spend a further 2 million to complete the definition stage. However, to withdrawnow with no plausible case would cause a great deal of acrimonyand probably prevent our being associated with the AdvancedCombat Aircraft project. In any case, it was possible that under present circumstances the French might decide to announce their withdrawal from the Airbus project, and we should not make any move until we had studied the situation which would result. Inaddition our withdrawal from the Airbus now might prejudice our negotiations over Concorde.
The Cabinet UnitedKingdom/United StatesAdvanced LiftEngineProgramme(5) Agreed that, subject to the criteria outlined in C (68) 91being strictly met, we should agree to defer for a furtherfour months the decision whether or not to go ahead.The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of technology (C (68) 92) on the continuation of the UnitedKingdom/United States Advanced Lift Engine Programme.The Minister of Technology said that the programme wasbegun two and a half years ago with the object of developing andproving an advanced technology engine suitable for installationin a VTOL production aircraft. Although there were no directapplications at present, the engine could be used either as a directlift engine, as a booster for civil aircraft or as a large fan enginefor inter-city VTOL transport aircraft. The development of the engine was being undertaken jointly by the Rolls-Royce company and the Allison Division of General Motors. Although the technicalwork was divided equally our share of the costs was only 30 per cent of the whole and Rolls-Royce were prepared to subscribe 20 percent of the total United Kingdom share if the programme went through to completion. The present programme would come to anend in May 1969 and should prove the technical feasibility of an advanced lift engine of this type. However more work was requiredto complete the programme, including tests to prove performance and mechanical integrity, so that the companies concerned couldsell the concept to potential customers on a firm basis. continuation of the programme was estimated to cost about half that envisagedearlier, before the projected United States / German AVS fighter aircraft was cancelled, and would help to cement the developingrelationship between Rolls-Royce and Allison, with ,the possibilityof increasing our chances of penetrating the United States market in aero-engines. There was thus a strong case for agreeing that the advanced lift engine programme should continue on the reduced scale proposed until the end-April 1970 at a total cost to the UnitedKingdom of  5-5 million, to which Rolls-Royce would contribute 1 million.In discussion the view was expressed that in the light of the cabinet&apos;s previous discussion on the Concorde it would be appropriate to allow the advanced lift engine programme to continue.The Cabinet-(6) Agreed that the United Kingdom/United States advancedlift engine programme should continue on the reduced scale proposed until the end of April 1970.9141B
DispersalPolicy(previous reference:CC (67) 21stConclusions,Minute 2)InlandRevenueComputerCentreCONFIDENTIAL4. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (C (68) 89) and by the Secretary of State for economic Affairs (C (68) 94) about the location of the InlandRevenue computer centre for southern England.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the choice for the site for the computer centre lay between the Portsmouth/Southampton area and Plymouth. Neither area was in a development area though Plymouth was near one. A decision infavour of Plymouth would cost an additional  1 million and woulddelay completion of the Inland Revenue centralisation programme and its substantial economies by five years; meanwhile the InlandRevenue would be obliged to operate both manual and automatedsystems a costly and inefficient arrangement. There was also avery real risk that the Inland Revenue Staff Federation would not co-operate in the implementation of the new scheme as a whole ifnone of the proposed new centres were situated in the south-east.In this connection he would point out that the fullest regard hadbeen paid to regional policy in planning the location of the centres.The tax work from the London area was being transferred to centres in Manchester and Edinburgh; and other centres were being planned for East Kilbride, Bootle and Tyneside (all in development areas),Cardiff and Leeds/Bradford. For these reasons he invited hiscolleagues to agree that the computer centre for southern england should be located in the Portsmouth /Southampton area.The Secretary of State for Economic Affairs invited theCabinet to confirm the decision, which had been reached aftermost careful consideration by the Ministerial Committee on environmental Planning, that the centre for southern england should be located in Plymouth. The considerations of regional policy were so overwhelmingly in favour of Plymouth that theyshould override the admitted practical difficulties for the InlandRevenue from this choice. The level of unemployment in Plymouthwas considerably higher than in Portsmouth /Southampton. TheGovernment had recognised the importance of attracting industrial and office work to Plymouth as an urban centre to be developed for the south-west as a whole and had undertaken to take every opportunity of moving Government work there. In Portsmouth,on the other hand, a shortage of office staff was developing andthe popularity of the area was demonstrated by the very rapidrecent rate of growth of rateable values for offices in Portsmouth ascompared with those in the rest of the country and in Plymouth inparticular. The Government had recently made clear that the growth of the south Hampshire area would be based on existing industry-or industry tied to the south-east and would not be allowed to attract industrial and office expansion which would otherwise be suitable for the development areas. Plymouth was in any event an attractive town and he found it difficult to believe that the small number of key Inland Revenue staff who would be required totransfer to the centre in ten years&apos; time could not be found,particularly in view of the 10-14 per cent annual rate of staff
confidential. The Home Secretary said that he had thought it right toraise in Cabinet the question of the removal of the spoil tips atAberfan because, while the decision taken in the previous weekthat the cost of removing the tips should be shared by theGovernment and the National Coal Board (NCB) subject to theprovision of  0-25 million by local interests, had initially been welcomed in Wales, it had subsequently been misinterpreted to mean that the Aberfan Disaster Fund would be expected tocontribute the whole of the  0-25 million, and this might deprive the Government of the public support attracted by the decision thatthe tips should be removed.The Minister of State, Welsh Office, said that of the threelocal committees concerned, the Aberfan Parents Committee andthe Tip Removal Committee were now against the proposed arrangement, and it was expected that the Disaster FundCommittee, which was meeting on the following day, would also by a majority reject it. This would place the Secretary of Statefor Wales in a difficult position because the original intention hadbeen that he should raise a new fund in Wales which would be matched pound for pound by money saved from the Welsh Officeallocation of funds for 1970-71. In view of the reaction in Aberfanit was unlikely that it would be possible to raise this fund, and thepublic were now asking why the removal should not be financedunder the Derelict Land Scheme, for which a grant of 85 per centwas available. In view of the fact that a tip in the Rhondda Valleyhad been removed under this scheme the public would find itdifficult to understand why it was inappropriate to the circumstancesAberfan(previous reference:CC (67) 52ndConclusions,Minute 1)wastage. As for the additional cost involved in the choice ofPlymouth,  1 million was a relatively very small price to pay forthe creation of an additional 2,000 jobs on the edge of a development area. The provision of office as well as factory work in development areas was of growing importance in order to provide balancedregional economies while the opportunities for providing office workon the present scale were few and infrequent.In discussion some Ministers considered that the loss of efficiency, additional cost and staff difficulties involved in siting thecentre at Plymouth outweighed the regional policy considerations infavour of such a choice while others considered that they did not.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that on balance the Cabinet favoured the choice of Portsmouth/Southampton.The Cabinet Agreed that the Inland Revenue computer centre for southern England should be located in the Portsmouth/Southampton area.
of the Aberfan tip. The situation would be improved if it could bemade clear that the initial expenditure by the NCB and theGovernment was not dependent on local contributions, so that thework could at least begin notwithstanding a possible refusal by the disaster Fund Committee to contribute at this stage.In discussion it was pointed out that, while the Derelict LandScheme could not be used because it could not be said that theremoval of the tip was necessary to attract industry to the area,it would be possible to use powers under the Local government act, 1966 which attracted a 50 per cent grant to which would beadded rate support grant on the remaining 50 per cent if the localauthority would co-operate; but they were understood to be unwilling to do so. In view of the not ungenerous Governmentoffer and of the sums which the NCB were prepared to put into theremoval or landscaping of the tips, public opinion both in other areas of Wales and in the country generally might well be criticalif the Government yielded to pressure to contribute a further 0-25 million to the proposed scheme. On the other hand, it mustbe recognised that opinion in Aberfan was now highly emotional,that nothing short of the removal of the tips would be acceptable,and that it might well be thought that this had a higher prioritylocally than some of the amenity schemes contemplated by the disaster Fund. In this situation the best course might be to seek to dissuade the Committee of the Disaster Fund from reaching adecision on the scheme before the Secretary of State for Wales, whowould be returning at the weekend from an official visit to Brunei,had had an opportunity of discussing the situation with theCommittee. The Secretary of State should then seek to persuade the Committee to match pound for pound the  0-25 million whichthe Government were prepared to contribute.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, whilethe Cabinet appreciated the special problems created by the abnormalstate of public opinion in Aberfan, they were reluctant to agree thatthe Government should contribute a larger sum to the removal ofthe tips than that announced by the Secretary of State for Wales on26th July. The Minister of State, Welsh Office, should therefore seek to persuade the Committee of the Disaster Fund that they shouldtake no decision on the scheme until they had discussed it with theSecretary of State for Wales on his return to this country.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of State, Welsh Office, to proceed asindicated in the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,2nd August, 1968.
