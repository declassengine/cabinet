CC 33 (68)secret. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.*2. The Prime Minister recalled that on 25th June he had referred to an apparent disclosure to the Press of the course ofrecent Ministerial discussions about the reform of the House of Lords.His subsequent enquiries had satisfied him that there had been nodeliberate disclosure to the Press by any member of the cabinet and that the Press reports in question had derived from exchangesbetween a Government spokesman and the Opposition in the Houseof Lords about the consequences which might follow if theConservative majority in the Upper House were to frustrate thecompletion of the Governmenfs business in the current Session ofParliament.The Cabinet Took note.confidential. The Foreign Secretary said that he had visited Reykjavikfrom 23rd to 25th June to attend the Ministerial Meeting of theNorth Atlantic Council. In the course of the meeting he had had private talks with the United States Secretary of State,Mr. Dean Rusk, who seemed to be far from well and had been in adepressed mood about the international situation. He thought thatthe stresses in the Communist world were such that we should belucky to get through September without a crisis. On the other hand,he said that the Soviet Government had informed the United StatesGovernment that they would be ready &quot; before long &quot; for talks aboutoffensive and defensive ballistic missiles. They had also discussed the situation in the Middle East where Mr. Gunnar Jarring, theSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General of the united nations, was making very slow progress. It had been possible sofar to prevent either side going back to the Security Council. Butthere was always the risk of a major border incident which the arab states would insist on taking to the Council. With a view to makingmore rapid progress Mr. Rusk and he had therefore agreed thatBritish and United States officials should discuss the possibility of persuading the Iraeli Government to take a more positive line than hitherto in the negotiations with Mr. Jarring. On Vietnam,Mr. Rusk was generally optimistic about the possibility of making progress in the talks which were now proceeding in Paris betweenthe United States Government and the Government of north vietnam.In the course of the meeting he had also attended the normalquadripartite dinner with the United States Secretary of State,the Federal German Foreign Minister, Herr Willy Brandt, andM. Seydoux, the French Permanent Representative to the north atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO).   They had discussed the* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET
Greece:(previous reference:CC (68) 9thConclusions,Minute 2)Visit of theGreek Ministerof ForeignAffairsNigeria(previous reference:CC (68) 31stConclusions,Minute 3)situation created by the recent East German measures affecting access to Berlin; and had reached agreement on a statement which had indue course been accepted by their other NATO colleagues andembodied in the communique.At the full Council meeting the most important development hadbeen the agreement to issue a declaration on mutual and balancedforce reductions, which was intended as a signal to the Soviet Unionthat if the Soviet Government were thinking of force reductions,NATO were ready to discuss them. The declaration was of special importance to the United States Government, who hoped that itwould enable them to resist pressure in Congress for the unilateralwithdrawal of United States forces from Europe.Although the French representative at the meeting had made no difficulties over the statement on Berlin, he had, to the annoyanceof Signor Lupis, the Italian representative, raised objections to thesection of the communique dealing with recent Soviet activity in theMediterranean and had refused to agree that the word &quot; Soviet&quot;should be mentioned. This difficulty had been overcome by referringin this part of the communique to &quot; Ministers of the countries taking part in the Defence Planning Committee &quot;, which excluded France,It seemed probable that this device might be increasingly used on defence questions where the French Government were unwilling to collaborate with their NATO allies.The Foreign Secretary said that he had received a call from theGreek Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Pipinelis, on 21st June. Hehad left Mr. Pipinelis in no doubt about our views on the present form of government in Greece. Mr. Pipinelis had assured him ofthe Greek Governments intention to publish a Constitution, to seekits approval by referendum and then to proceed to elections. Hehad told Mr. Pipinelis that much would depend on the form ofthe Constitution; and that the Greek Government could improve their international standing by releasing some of their political prisoners and affording the rest better treatment. An encouragingfeature of the situation was that the Greek Government seemed tohave made good progress in their recent talks with the TurkishGovernment about Cyprus. Talks were also going on between thetwo communities on the island.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the Minister of Statefor Commonwealth Affairs, Lord Shepherd, had now returned fromNigeria. His visit had been an outstanding success. The upshotwas that the Federal Military Government of Nigeria had agreedto send a fully authorised representative to London for talks witha view to the resumption of the cease-fire negotiations between thetwo sides which had been broken off in Kampala at the end ofMay; and Chief Enahoro had already arrived here. The Biafranauthorities had also agreed to take part in talks; but had not yetsent a representative to London. The Federal Government were ready to accept an external peace-keeping force to ensure the safety of the Ibos as part of the arrangements for a cease-fire; but stillinsisted that the cease-fire must be on the basis of &quot; one Nigeria&quot;.
-    251SECRET 5CC 33 (68)Lord Shepherd had explained to the Federal Government the dangerof unnecessary civilian casualties; and General Gowon, head of theFederal Military Government, had promised that bombing by theFederal forces would be confined to military airfields and that theFederal forces would not invade the Ibo heartland.   The federal government had also agreed to provide a land route for relief supplies to reach Biafra and to receive a representative of the PrimeMinister to organise relief.   They had reluctantly agreed that therepresentative should go to Biafra as well; but they feared that sucha visit might be construed as a form of political recognition, andtherefore attached the greatest importance to his being someonepublicly associated with relief and not a political figure.The Cabinet-Took note of the statements by the Foreign Secretary andthe Commonwealth Secretary.SECRETPublic 4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ChancellorExpenditure, of the Excriequer about public expenditure in 1968-69 (SEP (68) 62).1968-69The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the proposals for savings, totalling  81+ million, in the Annex to his memorandumwere substantially less than the Ministerial Steering Committee onEconomic Policy had decided were necessary at their meeting on12th June. They were in his view the absolute minimum which theGovernment could contemplate, in view of the commitments whichthey had made in January. His proposals would not offset thetotal overspending already foreseen in 1968-69, nor would they provide contingency allowances for the inescapable additions as yet unforeseen which were certain to come. It would be essential in future years to provide such an allowance. Questions had been raised about the 1968 Farm Price Review; the &quot;clawback&quot; of family allowances; and investment grants. It had been pointed outthat a footnote to the table in the White Paper on Public Expenditure(Cmnd. 3515) published in January 1968 had made clear that thelevel of public expenditure in 1968-69 to which the Governmentwere committed specifically excluded any increases in agricultural support resulting from the 1968 Farm Price Review. Since thatReview had in fact added  31 million to the estimates of total public expenditure in 1968-69 it could be argued that this additional expenditure need not be offset. He accepted that this argument had some validity but it did not avoid the need to secure the saving of  81^ million which he was now proposing: they would nodoubt need in due course to pray the footnote in aid of the substantialoverspending which would still remain after his proposed savings hadbeen made. Secondly, it had been argued that expenditure on family allowances should be shown net of the additional tax revenue&quot; clawed back &quot; from standard rate taxpayers. But the total of family allowances had to be found, like other public expenditure, bytaxation; and the full cost was a part of the total of public expenditure to which the Governmenfs commitments in January
Civil Defence(previous reference:CC (68) 3rdConclusions)related. Thirdly, he proposed that they should defer until theautumn a decision on whether or not to reduce the number ofquarters&apos; payments of investment grants in 1968-69. A reduction would reduce the Governments borrowing requirements; and theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), on which we must continue to rely heavily for credit and with which there would shortly be further consultations, might consider that such a reduction was moreimportant than the adverse consequences for industrial investment.He proposed therefore that they should decide about the paymentof investment grants in 1968-69, in the light of the reactions of theIMF, before the end of September.In discussion it was suggested that the proposed loans for the aluminium smelters did not involve additional public expenditurethough they were recorded as such. The loans would go, via the aluminium companies, to the Central Electricity Generating board to finance construction of generating stations which would otherwise have been financed to the same extent with loans advanced directly by the Government. More generally it was argued that it wasmisleading to include in public expenditure the cost of, for example,share acquisitions by the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation(1958-59) without taking into account the value of the assets which hadbeen acquired in exchange. It was pointed out, however, that theGovernments January commitment related to the level of public expenditure in 1968-69 determined in accordance with existing government accounting conventions, and that these had in fact alsoproduced a &quot; paper &quot; not a real reduction of  53 million in defence expenditure following the cancellation of the F-lll aircraft. It was for consideration, however, whether in future years the total of public expenditure should not include Government loans to nationalised industries: if this were done the aluminium loans would not countas additional public expenditure.It was suggested that in present economic conditions, whenunemployment was rising and the overspending foreseen could bemet by additional borrowing and not by additional taxation, therewas no case for saving more than  81 \ million. The problems posedby an increased borrowing requirement should be balanced againstthe needs of the present economic situation.The Cabinet then considered the proposals in the Annex toSEP (68) 62.The Minister of Agriculture said that while it would be possibleto sell stocks of sugar and flour at a rate sufficient to produce between 1^ million and  2 million in 1968-69, he did not think that it wouldbe possible to find more than another  2 million to  2-1 million bythis means in 1969-70 without the scale of these sales from civil defence stocks becoming apparent to the trade and leading to political embarrassment.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that a saving of between  1  million and  2 million should be made in 1968-69 by sales of civil defencestocks.
CC 33 (68)The Minister of Transport said that he would reluctantly acceptthe proposed reduction of  8 million for England on theunderstanding that he was left with discretion on how this savingwas to be divided between central Government and local authorities&apos;expenditure.In discussion of the implications of the proposed reductions inEngland, Scotland and Wales it was agreed that it would be more appropriate to make a reduction of S\ million for Wales and thatthe implications of all these cuts in road expenditure should indue course be reported to and considered by the Committee on environmental Planning.The Cabinet-(2) Agreed to savings of  8 million,  1 million and t\ million for 1968-69 for England, Scotland and Wales respectively.It was suggested that in addition to the savings proposed underthis heading there was a case for rescinding the fuel tax rebate. but since this required legislation it could not be done in 1968-69 andshould be considered for 1969-70. The scale of expenditure on theChannel Tunnel might also be examined in connection with the review of expenditure in 1969-70.The Cabinet (3) Agreed to the proposed saving of t\ million on civil aviationservices in 1968-69.The Minister of Technology said that he agreed to the proposed reduction of  2 million for technological support. If the airbus were cancelled the saving would in fact be  3 million in 1968-69 andnot  5 million since the estimate for this expenditure had alreadybeen reduced. But it was not possible to decide now whether ornot the airbus should be cancelled. Criteria had been laid downlast year by which the project should be judged in a joint evaluationwith the French and German Governments. The studies on whichthis evaluation depended had been completed and he hoped that thejoint evaluation would take place in July.The RB-203 engine had already been cancelled. the shipbuilding Industry Board might well have plans to spend morethan  12 million in 1968-69 (including expenditure on a shipbuildingmerger in Scotland and a scheme for rationalising enginemanufacture) and there was therefore a risk that he would have toask the Board, later in the year, to reduce their planned expenditure,in which case a public announcement could hardly be avoided.In discussion about the airbus, it was suggested that in viewof the extraordinary cost escalation, the unwillingness of Lufthansato commit itself to a purchase of the aircraft and the rumoured
desire of the French Government to withdraw from the scheme, it seemed very likely that they would not have to proceed with the airbus.The Cabinet (4) Agreed to a saving of  2 million in 1968-69 on technologicalsupport.(5) Agreed that the appropriate saving should be provisionallyscored in 1968-69 on the assumption that the airbuswould in fact be cancelled.(6) Agreed to the saving of  1 million in 1968-69 in respect ofthe RB-203.(7) Agreed to a reduction of  1-1 million in assistance toshipbuilding in 1968-69.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there was a danger that expenditure by the 1958-59 would exceed the provision in the public expenditure Survey for 1968-69 by a substantial amount. he accepted that the 1958-59 was doing economically valuable work but unless some ceiling were set on its expenditure, the whole of the savings in other directions could be swallowed up by this one item.A possible course would be to limit expenditure by the 1958-59 to 45 million in 1968-69 and  35 million in 1969-70, on theunderstanding that it would be open to them to enter intocommitments in excess of these limits, provided that payments underthese commitments were deferred until 1969-70.The Cabinet-(8) Invited the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, with theChief Secretary, Treasury, to discuss with the industrial reorganisation Corporation the implications of theCorporation^ expenditure for the borrowing requirement of the Exchequer, and the feasibility of a ceiling on industrial Reorganisation Corporation expenditure onthe lines proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,and to report the outcome to his colleagues.The Cabinet-(9) Agreed that expenditure on Research Councils should bereduced by  1 million in 1968-69.It was accepted in discussion that the proposed saving of 1 million would involve acute difficuties. It should however bepossible to secure savings (in addition to those on the strategic foodstockpile) of not less than    million.The Cabinet-(10) Invited the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food toagree with the Chancellor of the Exchequer a revisedtotal of expenditure on his Vote with a view to securingsavings of not less than  -  million in 1968-69.
CC 33 (68)The Minister of Housing said that the cuts proposed in thisblock were altogether disproportionate. In particular, the proposed reduction by 5,000 in housing starts in England and Wales, whichwould become publicly known, would run counter to the prioritywhich the Government were pledged to give to housing, would bearbitrary in its incidence as between local authorities, would adversely affect the priority housing areas and the development areas, andwould rule out any action to mitigate housing shortage in areas with a large immigrant population. The proposed saving on LocalEnvironmental Services would be difficult to achieve in view of previous cuts, and a reduction of  7 million in expenditure by theLand Commission would mean a two-thirds reduction in theCommission^ activities. The maximum savings which should besought from his Department were a reduction of  20 million inlending by local authorities, and a saving of  5 million on other expenditure by means which should be left to his discretion.In discussion, the general view was that the savings proposed inSEP (68) 62 on local authority lending and on Local environmental services were justified. A saving of  7 million on expenditure bythe Land Commission would be excessive, but a substantial saving,perhaps of  5- 6 million, should be possible. Having regard tothe general progress of the housing programme, some reductionin housing starts in 1968-69 was justified, but there were strong arguments for a reduction of somewhat less than 5,000.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet agreed that lending by local authorities in Englandand Wales should be reduced by  30 million and  2J million respectively, and that savings should be made from other expenditurein the block under discussion (excluding local evironmental services in Scotland) totalling  8^ million. The Minister of Housing, withthe Secretary of State for Wales, should bring before his colleagues in the following week proposals for achieving this.The Minister of Housing said that he wished to record hisdissent.The Cabinet-(11) Agreed that the following savings should be made in1968-69:(i)  30 million and  2  million on local authority lendingin England and Wales respectively.(ii)  \  million  on  local  environmental  services  inScotland.(iii)  8^ million from the aggregate of expenditure on housing investment and local environmental services in England and Wales and expenditure bythe Land Commission.(12) Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government tobring forward proposals for securing the savings as in(11) (iii) above.

The totalmight be raised to  3^ million by deferring implementation of therecommendations of the Departmental Committee on Legal Aid in criminal Proceedings (the Widgery Committee), on which he would wish to consult further with the Lord Chancellor.The Cabinet-(13) Invited the Home Secretary to report further in thefollowing week in the light of consultation with the LordChancellor.The Cabinet-(14) Agreed that savings of  1 million should be made underthis head in 1968-69, the means to be determined by theSecretary of State for Education and Science.(15) Invited the Secretary of State for Education and Scienceto report on the desirability of withdrawing free school meals for the fourth and subsequent children in the family, so that this could be considered in conjunctionwith the public expenditure programme for 1969-70.The Cabinet (16) Agreed that savings totalling  \ million in 1968-69 shouldbe secured from the increased charges proposed inSEP (68) 62.The Cabinet (17) Agreed that expenditure on Accommodation should bereduced by  1^ million in 1968-69,(18) Agreed that expenditure on Government publicity services should be reduced by  \ million in 1968-69.The Cabinet-(19) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to report on possible savings under this head in 1969-70.The Cabinet-(20) Agreed that expenditure on Overseas Aid and other overseas Services should be reduced in 1968-69 by 4 million and  1 million respectively.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,27th June, 1968.
