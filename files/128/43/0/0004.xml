secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the first secretary of State (C (68) 12) reporting the conclusions of the HomeAffairs Committee on the proposed legislation on race relations.The First Secretary of State said that the Home AffairsCommittee had considered in particular whether the Race relations bill should apply to the sale of owner-occupied houses, whether itshould apply to the Crown and to the police and whether assessorsshould assist the courts in proceedings under the Bill. TheCommittee had examined these questions on the basis that thepurpose of the Bill was to educate public opinion, foster attitudes oftoleration, and support those who were willing to adopt such attitudes;and that consequently the presentational aspects of the Bill were ofparticular importance.The First Secretary of State said that the Home AffairsCommittee were convinced that because housing was recognised as one of the immigrants&apos; greatest problems it must be one of the centralfeatures of protective legislation; and since half the houses in Englandand Wales were privately owned, what was done here would beregarded as a touchstone of the Government^ sincerity. At the sametime, people needed to be reassured that the Bill could not be usedoppressively against owner-occupiers or to compel the vendor of a house to accept a bid from a coloured purchaser when he had innocentand justifiable reasons for not doing so. In the view of theCommittee, the solution lay in applying the Bill to owner-occupiers,while guiding the Race Relations Board (RRB) in the exercise oftheir power so as to confine legal proceedings under the Bill to casesof flagrant discrimination. The conciliation machinery should give avendor an opportunity to explain his reasons for refusing an offerfrom a coloured person and should accept as a valid reason that, forexample, the house had been sold to a friend or someone with aspecial claim, or that the coloured would-be purchaser was knownas a landlord of overcrowded houses, although there would have tobe grounds for this assertion distinguishable from prejudice.In discussion it was pointed out that complainants would not beable to secure an injunction to prevent or delay the sale of a house;this would infringe individual liberty and might cause hardship. TheBill might have little practical effect save in flagrant cases, but itSECRET1. The Cabinet were informed that arrangements had beenmade to recall the House of Commons on Tuesday, 16th January,when the Government^ economic measures would be announced.The Second Reading of the Transport Holding Bill would be takenlater that day. Debates on the economic measures would take placeon 17th and 18th January; business on 19th January would be as already announced. Further consideration would need to be given,after the Foreign Secretary&apos;s return, to the best method of reinstatingin the programme the debate on foreign affairs which had been promised for the first week after the Recess.
would have a valuable influence on public opinion; it would helphouse agents to refuse to discriminate themselves or to act for clientswho wished to discriminate; and it would discourage conspiracybetween neighbours to prevent a sale to a coloured purchaser.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Race Relations Bill should apply to the saleof houses by their owner-occupiers.Application The First Secretary of State said that the Home affairs to the Crown Committee had been divided about the merits of binding the Crownunder the Bill. There was no dispute about the function of the bill as a measure to lead and educate opinion, nor about the consequentneed for the Government to set the example of its own submission to be bound by law. The difficulty lay in presentation. It had beenargued that in binding the Crown the Bill would have to make so many reservations and exemptions that, far from demonstrating theGovernments commitment to the principles of the Bill, the provision would appear discriminatory; and that it might be preferable toleave the Crown exempt and make instead a declaration that theGovernment would abide by the principles and purpose of the Bill.The Committee had concluded by a narrow majority that if the Bil!was intended to give legal form to the Governments philosophy of race relations such a statement would not suffice; the Government,and hence the Crown, must be willing to be legally bound, though there would be room for special arrangements to be made to safeguard the recruitment arrangements of the Civil Service, the diplomatic service and the Armed Forces, and further consultation was neededabout the position of the Royal Household and Royal Duchies.The Home Secretary said that the Crown&apos;s standing in relation tothe Bill differed according to the role it performed. As an employer,that is in the recruitment of staff, the Crown need assume noprivileges not given to other employers, save as regards the nationality and security rules, and he was in favour of allowing the RRB full powers under the Bill. As a provider of services, there was similarlya case for binding the Crown so that complaints about public servants in their dealings with the public could be dealt with by conciliation.His only doubts concerned the Crown as employer in questions ofinternal discipline, where the application of the Bill would provide an avenue for complaints by coloured people, about, for example,lack of promotion, which would not be available to their whitecolleagues.The Secretary of State for Defence said that there was a similarproblem in the Armed Forces. The Army Act and the correspondingActs of the other two Services contained provision for the redress of grievance. The Service authorities thus had both statutory obligationand statutory power to deal with grievances and it was pointless tobring in new legislation to over-ride or overlap what was alreadythere. The RRB should not be permitted to pronounce on casesdecided by the Service Boards nor to act as a court of appeal from them, particularly when officers had an ultimate right of appeal toThe Queen.   He would be prepared, by informal consultation, to
keep in touch with the RRB over the implementation of the principlesof the Bill, and to let them make representation before the procedure was completed but not to determine the issue.In discussion it was agreed that there was neither objection ofprinciple nor serious administrative difficulty in applying the Bill to crown servants in their relations with the public, for example in theadministration of social security or of the driving test, and that itwas desirable to do so. Similarly, it could be accepted thatrecruitment into the Civil and Diplomatic Services and the armed forces should be covered by the Bill subject to the preservation of nationality rules and other security measures; but security problems would arise not only in the public services themselves but among the employees of firms holding defence contracts for which specific provision would have to be made.It was suggested that in matters of internal discipline the case for bringing Crown servants unreservedly within the scope of the bill was the same as the broader case for binding the Crown that the impact of reform in race relations would be strengthened by theCrown&apos;s participation and weakened by withholding from the Billsome area of Government activity on grounds of convenience. Itwas wrong to fear excessive or irresponsible intrusion by the RRBinto the affairs of the public services. The Board had gained areputation for good sense and responsibility. Moreover the Billshould be seen as a long-term measure concerned with coloured people born in this country rather than with recent immigrants. Onthe other hand, it was argued that it would be wrong to allow the RRBto interfere in Ministers&apos; exercise of their statutory duties. TheServices&apos; disciplinary Acts and the civilian staff regulations gave fullscope for redress of grievance. It would be clumsy to duplicate theexisting law and inappropriate to open an avenue of appeal outsidethe Services (particularly where this was at present prohibited) forcomplaints of racial discrimination which would not be open for anyother kind of grievance.It would, however, look very odd to bind the Crown as a providerof Services but exclude it as an employer. It was not clear why if a complaint reached the RRB the Board should not forward it to theDepartment concerned for the normal procedures to be followed. Ifthe Board were not satisfied with the outcome they could not reverse the decision but could report the case to Parliament where it could,if necessary, be taken up with the Minister. The Board need not beextended until the existing machinery had dealt with the complaint.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet were agreed that the Bill should apply to the Crownboth as a provider of services and as employer, subject to provisions to safeguard the nationality and security rules and to furtherconsideration of the position of the Royal Household and the RoyalDuchies. On the question of the application of the Bill to the armed forces a further attempt should be made to work out an arrangement which would ensure the operation of the existing statutory machinerybut would not exclude the consideration of a complaint thereafter by
the RRB. If however this proved impossible it would be open tothe Secretary of State for Defence to revert to his proposal that the armed Forces should be exempt in respect of their machinery fordealing with grievances and discipline.The Cabinet (2) Agreed that the Race Relations Bill should bind the Crown,subject to exemptions in respect of nationality and securityrules and to further consideration of the position of theRoyal Household and the Royal Duchies and of the armed Forces in respect of their existing statutoryprocedure for dealing with grievances and discipline.(3) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with theappropriate authorities, to consider further the positionof the Royal Household and the Royal Duchies.(4) Invited the Home Secretary to consider further inconsultation with the Secretary of State for Defence andother Ministers concerned, the application of the Bill tothe Armed Forces on the lines indicated in the PrimeMinisters summing up.The police The First Secretary of State said that the majority of the HomeAffairs Committee agreed with the Home Secretary&apos;s proposals thatthe Bill should apply to the police except in respect of theiroperational dealing with the public. The Committee had recognisedthat the police were vulnerable to allegations of racial prejudice, andwere regarded with suspicion by many coloured people, so that therewas a case for opening their actions to inquiry by the RRB in orderto give the immigrant community confidence in the police discipline.They considered, however, on balance that the statutory policedisciplinary code was adequate to deal with complaints by membersof the public provided that racial discrimination was made a specificoffence under the code.In discussion it was pointed out that the arrangements for considering complaints against the police involved investigation akinto that of allegations of crime and formal proceedings similar to thoseof a court. It would be difficult to accept the intervention of theRRB in these proceedings. Moreover, there would then be a different,or additional, means of dealing with complaints of racial discrimination against the police from that available for dealing withother forms of complaints. If weight was to be attached to the argument that the police were judges in their own cause, theprocedure for dealing with complaints of all kinds should bere-examined.On the other hand, it was observed that the arguments aboutdiscipline in the public services were being reversed in their applicationto the police. Moreover, the relations between the police and thepublic were one of the most sensitive areas in the problem of race relations and if complaints against the police were to be exempt thiswould be the only exempted service.  There would undoubtedly be
The Cabinet (5) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the Secretaryof State for Scotland, to consider the question of theapplication of the Bill to complaints against the police onthe lines indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up.(6) Agreed that the Bill should apply to the police in other respects.Merchant It was pointed out that a special problem arose in relation toNavy the Merchant Navy in which there was difficulty in getting seamenof different races to live and work together and the practice had grown up of recruiting homogeneous racial groups.The Home Secretary said that he recognised that there was a case for making special provisions to permit this arrangement to continue.Assessors The First Secretary of State said that the Home AffairsCommittee had agreed by a majority with the Home Secretary&apos;proposal that when proceedings under the Race Relations Bill were brought before a designated county court the judge should have theassistance of two assessors appointed from a panel approved by theLord Chancellor. The judge would remain solely responsible forthe decision of the case, but the presence of assessors experienced inproblems of race relations would give confidence to immigrantcomplainants before the court.The Lord Chancellor said that although there was provisionalready for the employment of assessors in county courts, they were very rarely used. Their introduction in this context would have no practical value except as a gesture to improve race relations. he accepted it in that light, although with reluctance because of the inevitable implication of a lack of confidence in the courts.In discussion the Cabinet agreed to the introduction of assessorson the understanding that the Government should be prepared to reconsider the proposal if it were strongly opposed in Parliament. Itwould cause more difficulty in Scotland than in England and Walesbecause the sheriffs had wider jurisdiction and correspondingly greaterstanding than county court judges; but apart from this there were noreasons for different treatment of proceedings in Scotland and similar arrangements should be made.CC 4 (68)political advantage in applying the Bill here though it might be right that the RRB should not have power to override the statutoryprocedure.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for scotland should consider, in consultation with the police, whether a means could be devised of applying the Bill to the police in their operationalduties in a manner analogous to that indicated in his summing up onthe question of the application of the Bill to the Crown, in respect ofthe armed forces.
The Cabinet (7) Agreed, subject to the points made in discussion, to theemployment of assessors in county courts hearingproceedings under the race relations legislation.Procedure The Prime Minister said that preparation of the Race relations bill should now be urgently pursued. Drafting should if possibleconform to the wording of United Nations Conventions against racial discrimination. Outstanding questions arising from the cabinets discussion and in course of drafting should be resolved by the HomeAffairs Committee.The Cabinet (8) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the speedypreparation of the Race Relations Bill as indicated bythe Prime Minister.(9) Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange for the HomeAffairs Committee to consider as necessary any outstanding issues on the Race Relations Bill.public expenditure :Post-DevaluationMeasures(previous reference:CC (68) 3rdConclusions)Health and welfare(previous reference:CC (68) 2ndConclusions)secret. The Minister of Health said that he had been asked by theCabinet at their meeting on Friday, 5th January to examine further with the Chancellor of the Exchequer the extent to which capitalexpenditure on local health and welfare should be held down between1968-69 and 1970-71. The Chancellor had proposed a reduction by 20 million over the period and he had originally offered instead a figure of  12 million. After further consideration he would now propose that the reductions should be  3 million,  5 million and 6 million in 1968-69, 1969-70 and 1970-71 respectively, making atotal of  14 million over the period.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had not had anopportunity of considering in detail the revised proposals by theMinister of Health. He therefore proposed that he and the Ministerof Health should now seek together to reach a firm and final agreement on these cuts.prescription charges(previous reference:CC (68) 2ndConclusions)The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister ofHealth to consider further, and if possible reach agreement on, the extent of the reductions in proposedcapital expenditure on local health and welfare services between 1968-69 and 1970-71.The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofHealth on prescription charges (C (68) 14).The Minister of Health said that the memorandum set out theproblems and the cost of exempting from prescription charges the elderly, children under 16, the chronic sick (other than the elderly) andexpectant and nursing mothers. Depending on the definition adopted
for the elderly and for the chronic sick, it had been estimated that thetotal cost of exempting all these categories would be between  22^million and  27^ million, that is approximately half the additional revenue expected from the introduction of a prescription charge of. 6d. per item with the exemptions only for those who were formerlyrelieved of the charge. Before detailed consideration was given tothe possibility of proceeding by way of exemptions from a prescriptioncharge, he asked that his original proposal might be given furtherconsideration. His colleagues would recall that he had earliersuggested that the health service contribution should be increasedby Is. a week instead of reintroducing prescription charges. Thiswould raise the same sum  50 million a year as the Chancellor^original proposal for prescription charges with limited exemptions.There would be no need to provide for exemptions from the increasein the health service contribution since the elderly, children and otherhardship categories were not in any event required to make the contribution. The Chancellor had raised two objections to his proposal. First, that it reduced taxable capacity in a way which there introduction of prescription charges would not; and second, thatthe failure to reintroduce a prescription charge would have an adverseaffect on confidence at home and abroad. Since however the cabinet were now prepared to consider an increase of 6d. a week in the health service contribution in order to meet the cost of widerexemptions, it appeared to him that the Chancellor^ first obection had not been accepted as decisive;, and he urged that the clear andmanifest advantages of raising the sum required by an increase inthe health service contribution, instead of by prescription charges,should not be over borne because the Press were seeking to make an issue of confidence out of the means by which the Governmentachieved its objectives. The health service contribution had remained unchanged since 1961 at 3s. 4d. a week and an increase nowto 4s. would no more than offset the reduction in the value of moneysince 1961. An increase of 9d. a week would provide  371 million which was substantially more than the proposed prescription chargeof 2s. 6d. offset by the exemptions for the categories set out inparagraph 2 of his memorandum. The reintroduction of prescription charges with exemptions on the scale proposed would require at least,000 additional staff and, even if the doctors were persuaded toco-operate effectively, would involve considerable administrative difficulties.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had understoodthat the Cabinet had already decided in favour of prescription chargeswith exemptions. In their previous discussion he had explained why he could not accept an increase of more than 6d. a week in the health service contribution to pay for desirable exemptions, if these were practicable. Since then he had learned that, because of the presentposition of the National Insurance Fund, it might be necessary inany event this year to raise the national insurance contributions by6d. or a Is. a week and this powerfully reinforced his objection to any increase in the health service contribution in excess of 6d. per week.
As for the proposed additional exemptions, he accepted that men andwomen over 65 should be exempt, as proposed in paragraph 3 of thememorandum. It seemed to him doubtful whether it was necessaryto exempt children under 16 and there were obvious difficulties, as thememorandum made clear, in defining satisfactorily the chronic sick,a high proportion of whom would, in any event, fall in the exemptcategories of the elderly and those on supplementary benefit or withincomes at or below supplementary benefit levels. He could see nostrong grounds for exempting expectant and nursing mothers, but thecost of doing so was small and if it were thought that this exemptionwould help in the presentation of the scheme he would not oppose it.He proposed that the Government, in the statement of cuts in public expenditure, should announce that.a prescription charge of 2s. 6d.per item would be introduced in the spring with exemptions for thosewho had been relieved of the prescription charge when it was previously in force; and that the Government would meanwhileconsider, in consultation with the medical profession, measures toextend the exemptions as soon as possible to the elderly and the chronic sick.The Minister of Social Security said that she supported inprinciple the proposals of the Minister of Health to increasecontributions rather than to introduce prescription charges. Howeverboth the alternatives at present being considered involved some increase in the health service contribution, which was a flat-rateelement of the national insurance contribution. If, for example, anadditional  45 million a year were raised by increasing earnings-related national insurance contributions, this would require anadditional 4d. a week from those earning  15 a week and Is. Id.a week from those earning  30 a week. If it were decided thatprescription charges should be reintroduced, she agreed that the elderly, children, expectant and nursing mothers and the chronic sickshould all be exempted, although the Ministry of Social Securitywould not be able to help to identify the last category and it would therefore be necessary to work out a practicable scheme for themwith the doctors. She had within the last few days been advised that  the position of the  National Insurance Fund  was not satisfactory, and unless it were improved by a resumption of economic growth it might be necessary to increase the national insurance contributions in the autumn of this year. The timing of any increasein contributions on this account would be affected by the proposals toraise contributions to pay for all or part of prescription charges sinceboth should be done in one operation.In discussion the following points were made:(a) It was suggested that women should be exempted fromprescription charges at the age of 60 instead of 65 on the principlethat only those at work should be expected to pay and womenreached the statutory age of retirement pension at 60. On the otherhand it was pointed out that women over 60 generally enjoyed betteihealth than men and there was no reasonable case for thisdiscrimination in favour of women.
(b) It was suggested that the ease for exempting children wasnot particularly strong but that, if it were accepted, exemption shouldnot be given beyond the age of 5 or, at most, the present statutoryschool leaving age of 15. The present exemption of children fromdental charges was not strictly analogous since this was a long-termpreventative measure intended to preserve children&apos;s teeth throughout their lives. On the other hand it was urged that failure to exemptchildren would bear particularly hardly on families earning abovethe supplementary benefit level but below the average wage. In any event exemption for children should be based on a specific age andnot on compulsory school attendance.(c) It was suggested that the chronic sick could readily be identified by doctors from their records as persons having a continuous record of sickness extending over a stated period. But itwas pointed out that this would require the co-operation of doctorswhich could not be guaranteed in advance of consultation with them.Alternatively, doctors could give persons requiring regular supplies of drugs a prescription for, e.g., three months supply but this wouldbe a matter for the discretion of the individual doctor.(d) A prescription charge of say 5s. an item, not applied to theneedy categories indentified in C (68) 14, would raise  50 million ayear without the need for any increase in the health service contribution. But, it was argued, this would impose a very heavycharge on some of the sick in order to pay for the medicines of therest.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the balance of opinion was in favour of the reintroduction of aprescription charge of 2s. 6d. per item in the spring, with immediateexemptions, for those who had been exempted when the charge was last imposed. Arrangements should be worked out, in consultationwith the medical profession, for the exemption as soon as this was practicable of men and women over 65, children under 15, expectantand nursing mothers and the chronic sick. The employee&apos;s health service contribution should be raised by 6d. per week to offset these additional exemptions. The announcement should make it clear thatthe reintroduction of prescription charges would be on this basis.The Cabinet (2) Approved the reintroduction of prescription charges on thebasis indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up,The Chance/lor of the Exchequer recalled that in their earlier discussion of his proposal that housing approvals in England andWales should be reduced by 15,000 in 1968 and 1969 the Cabinet had invited him to consider a further reduction of 5,000 in England andWales and the extent to which reductions should be sought inScotland. Having done so he had concluded that further reductions should not be made in England and Wales; and had agreed to lowerfrom 3,000 to 1,500 the reductions to be sought in Scotland.In discussion it was accepted that an additional reduction of5,000 in &quot; starts &quot; for England and Wales should not be sought.  It
Rate Rebates(previous reference:CC (68) 2ndConclusions)School Meals(previous reference:CC (68) 2ndConclusions)was pointed out that with the reduction of 15,000 already agreed itwould be impossible to maintain that the target of 500,000 housescould be achieved by 1970 or to convince the public that failure toreach this figure was primarily attributable to Conservative localauthorities.The Cabinet (3) Agreed that a reduction should be made in local authority housing approvals in England and Wales of 15,000 ineach of the years 1968 and 1969 and that thecorresponding figure in Scotland should be 1,500.The First Secretary of State said that the Ministers concerned were satisfied that raising the amount of rate rebates was not an effective or practicable way of helping the poorest families; butvarying the income limits for eligibility for rebates, so as to restore theoriginal scope of the scheme, would go some way to redeeming the government&apos;s pledge to protect the most vulnerable sections of thecommunity in that it would restore the eligibility of householders justabove the supplementary benefit level.In discussion it was suggested that while it would be possible toincrease the income limits in England and Wales in April if an order,which would be subject to affirmative resolution, were laid shortly after Parliament reassembled, it would be more convenient for theincrease to take effect in October in England and Wales with acorresponding increase in November in Scotland. Owing to thedifference in the period over which income was calculated for thepurpose of assessing eligibility, this would put Scottish ratepayers ata disadvantage; but a change taking effect in the autumn would be inconformity with the policy of giving help when the increase in pricesreached a significant level.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet agreed that the income limits for rate rebates shouldbe raised by  1 to  9 for a single householder and  11 for a married couple with the addition of  2 for each child, and should take effect from October in England and Wales and November in Scotland.The Cabinet (4) Approved the raising of the income limits of eligibility forrate rebates by the amounts and at the time indicated inthe Prime Ministers summing up.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he accepted that itwould be inopportune at the present time to announce a further increase in the charge for school meals to take effect in April 1969and in the light of other savings now agreed in the educationalservices he was prepared to withdraw this proposal, while reservinghis right to bring the matter back to the Cabinet later in the year ifnecessary. The proposal should therefore not be included in theGovernment^ statement.The Cabinet (5) Agreed that the Governmenfs forthcoming statement shouldmake no proposal for a further increase in the charge for school meals.
family allowances(previous reference:CC (68) 2ndConclusions)The Minister of Social Security said that the pledge to protectlow-income families had been the Governments first commitmentfollowing devaluation. She welcomed the Chancellor of theExchequer^ decision to apply the &quot; give and take &quot; approach to the7s. increase, and this approach could bring the true cost of a further3s. increase down from  35 million to  9 million. The 1968-69Estimates would be published before the necessary Bill was introduced and so would not reflect the cost of the increase. Thealternative, which had been suggested in their previous discussion, of paying a child allowance by way of supplementary benefitnotwithstanding that the father was in full-time work, would be administratively burdensome even as an interim measure, and, onceintroduced, might prove difficult to terminate. If a further increaseof family allowances was not possible without compensating reductionof other social security expenditure, she would, in order to ensure thatthe Government^ commitment to low-income families was fulfilled,be ready to accept deferment of the 7s. increase and abolition ofmaternity grant except for the first child of a family. In addition,adoption of the recommendations of the National Insurance AdvisoryCommittee to prevent people in receipt of occupational pensions fromclaiming unemployment benefit would save  4-^ million in the second half of the year.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he could not acceptexpenditure resulting from a further general increase of family allowances in 1968-69. The estimates would show a substantial increase over those for the previous year, even after the proposedsavings had been made, of 10-8 per cent, or 8-04 per cent after allowing for increased prices. The cost of a further increase in familyThe First Secretary of State said that the Governmentscommitment to protect the most vulnerable sections of thecommunity against hardship resulting from devaluation hadspecifically included families on low incomes. This pledge couldbe completely fulfilled only through a further increase in family allowances, additional to the 7s. increase that would take effect inApril, with associated tax adjustments to ensure that the benefit was concentrated on those with low incomes (a &quot; give and take&quot;approach). The increase in Supplementary Benefits, on which theCabinet had already agreed, would not help those with low earnings and those affected by the wage stop, nor could they be sufficientlyhelped through enlargement of the rate rebate scheme. An increaseof 3s. would be necessary by the autumn if the family income of thelow wage earner with three children was to rise proportionately to the forecast increase in prices. The Chancellor of the Exchequer hadalready agreed to apply the &quot; give and take &quot; approach to the 7s.increase due to take effect in April and this should be extended tothis further 3s. increase. Although the full cost of this would be reflected in the Estimates, the true cost, as reduced by the associatedtax adjustments, could be made clear when the increase was announced.
allowances would have to be announced even if it was not includedin the published Estimates for 1968-69. The forecast movement ofprices would justify an increase of family allowances of no more than is. by the autumn and the matter could be reviewed then. Thearrangements for applying a &quot; give and take &quot; approach to the 7s.increase could not now be adapted to a further 3s. increase whethergiven in April or in the autumn, or to a deferment of the 7s. increaseitself. A further selective increase in family allowances in 1968-69could therefore only be made on a means-tested basis.In discussion it was suggested that the 7s. increase in family allowances would itself make reasonably sufficient provision in thelight of the forecast increase in prices, subject to review in the autumn.On the other hand it was pointed out that this increase had been announced before devaluation and could not now be claimed to take account of price increases resulting from it. It was suggested that further consideration should be given to the possibility of reducing expenditure on other social security benefits sufficiently to offset the continuing cost of a further increase in family allowances and itwas pointed out that the Government were not committed to make afurther increase by any specific date. The alternative possibility of a housing allowance which was currently under examination should alsobe considered.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat, while not ruling out the possibility of a further increase of family allowances later in the year, the Cabinet were agreed that no proposalto increase these allowances should be included in the Governmentsforthcoming statement. This should however refer to the intention toadopt a selective approach to the 7s. increase. The Chancellor of theExchequer, in consultation with the Minister of Social Security, should examine further the possibility of making reductions in other social security expenditure sufficient to offset the continuing cost of a further increase in family allowances. The Cabinet should. consider thematter again in the light of this examination and the alternativepossibility of a housing allowance which was under examination bythe Minister of Housing and Local Government, but in the meantimethere could be no commitment.The Cabinet (6) Agreed that the Governments forthcoming statement shouldmake no reference to a further increase in family allowances.(7) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Minister of Social Security, to consider the possibilityof making reductions in social security expenditure to offset the continuing cost of a further increase in family allowances.(8) Subject to Conclusion (7), agreed to consider later thepossibility of a further increase in family allowances.
Rate support grant(previous reference:CC (67) 67thConclusions,Minute 4)The Minister of Housing said that it was proposed in C(68) 5that the Government should announce now that they would not accept as eligible for rate support grant in 1969-70 a total of local authority expenditure more than 3 per cent in real terms above the amounteligible for grant in 1968-69. The Chancellor of the Exchequer had also proposed that there should be no upward adjustment of the rate support grant in 1968 to take account of increases in prices and wages in that year. To limit the increase in the expenditure eligible for grant for 1969-70 to 3 per cent would mean that the increase in the grant of 154 million which was now envisaged for that year would bereduced to  82 million, leaving a requirement to cut eligibleexpenditure in that year by  72 million. Of this, the specific cutswhich the Cabinet had already approved in various fields of localauthority expenditure would account for about  47 million, leaving 25 million to be found by further economies. This would probablymean that local authorities would have to place severe restrictions onthe recruitment of staff and the main impact of this would be felt in the various forms of personal services provided by local authorities,where the increase in staff was greatest because of the increasing number of children and old people. There would inevitably be somefall in the standard of provision in the local services falling within theresponsibility of the Home Secretary, the Secretary of State for education and the Minister of Health. It would be necessary to consult the local authorities immediately after the announcement, andit would be desirable for those of his colleagues whose responsibilities would be affected to participate in the consultations. It would be wise to avoid being completely specific about the limitation on the grant for1969-70: the announcement might say that the increase in the grant for that year would not be allowed to exceed an increase in the region of 3 per cent; this would leave room for some marginal adjustment inthe light of consultations with local authorities. Subject to this, he supported the proposals by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that the expected increasein the rate support grant in 1969-70 was less for Scotland than for england and Wales. To limit expenditure eligible for grant to anincrease of 3 per cent in 1969-70 would cause difficulties in some areas of Scotland, but should nevertheless be practicable.In discussion it was argued that the proposals by the Chancellorof the Exchequer did not go far enough. They would not involve any reduction in the rate support grant in 1968-69. To rely solely onexhortation would not necessarily secure adequate reductions in localauthority expenditure in that year; moreover to the extent thateconomies were secured, but the rate support grant was not reduced,some of the grant would become available for spending by localauthorities in fields not affected by specific cuts, or could be used toallow some reduction in rates. To proceed in this way would be particularly undesirable as regards expenditure on roads. The bulkof local authority expenditure in this field was on maintenance andthe improvement of minor roads and considerable sums were spent on road lighting and car parks; there was much more justification for cuts
in this expenditure than in central Government expenditure on the strategic road network which was vital to the economy. The right course therefore was to introduce legislation to effect a reduction inthe amount of rate support grant for 1968-69, possibly of the orderof  100- 150 million.On the other hand it was argued that it would be wrong to contemplate enforcing a cut of these proportions. This would imply a more severe limitation on the increase in the rate support grant for1969-70 than that proposed in C (68) 5. To proceed on this basis would produce an unacceptable deterioration in the general standardof services provided by local authorities. If the Government adopted the proposal by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to make noadjustment in the grant to compensate for price increases in 1968,this would be equivalent to a cut in the grant of  40- 50 million.Even this would be severe, bearing in mind that half of the relevant expenditure was on education, that expenditure on road maintenancewas important to the economy of many rural areas, and that the localauthorities would have to absorb considerable cost increases, forexample increases in teachers&apos; salaries.In further discussion it was suggested that the right course wouldbe to adopt the proposals made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,but to supplement them by requesting local authorities to securesavings in 1968-69 of specified amounts in expenditure on roads, andpossibly also on other blocks of expenditure to be designated, such asschemes of urban redevelopment; and to inform local authorities thatthe amount of expenditure which the Government would accept aseligible for rate support grant in 1969-70 would be limited in two ways: first, it would be limited to a 3 per cent rise in real terms over1968-69 as proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer; second,it would be further reduced by the amount of the savings requested by the Government for 1968-69. Local authorities would be unlikely to ignore a request for savings in that year if they knew that theirrate support grant for the following year would be reduced by acorresponding amount. The amount of savings in 1968-69 and the fields in which they were to be made would need further consideration,but substantial savings should certainly be requested in expenditureon roads, which might be of the order of  30- 40 million. It would,however, be important to safeguard the position of the development areas. In particular, road communications were vital to theireconomy and there was a case for placing greater emphasis in futureon expenditure on road communications serving the development areas, balanced by savings on other forms of assistance to them.Accordingly, in requesting specific savings for 1968-69 theGovernment should make it clear to local authorities that development areas should be excluded from these economies.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet endorsed the proposals by the Chancellor of theExchequer that no adjustment be made in the rate support grant in1968, and that the total expenditure to be accepted as eligible for grant in 1969-70 be limited to an increase in the region of 3 per centin real terms over the corresponding figure for 1968-69. They agreed
that these measures should be supplemented by a request to localauthorities for specific savings in 1968-69 in expenditure on roads andpossibly other designated blocks of expenditure, on the basis that theamount of the savings requested would be deducted from the totalof expenditure eligible for rate support grant in 1969-70. TheChancellor of the Exchequer should now consider with the ministers concerned the amount and nature of the savings for 1968-69 whichthe Government should request. Any implications which this mighthave for the decisions the Cabinet had previously taken on cuts inthe roads programme generally could be examined when the Cabinetcame to consider the balance of the whole package of measures.The Cabinet (9) Endorsed the proposal in paragraph 64 of C (68) 5 for limiting the increase in expenditure eligible for rate support grant in 1969-70, subject to announcing that thepermissible increase would be &quot; in the region of &quot; 3 percent, rather than 3 per cent precisely.(10) Agreed that there should be no adjustment of the rate support grant to compensate for rises in prices and wages in 1968.(11) Agreed that the Government should request local authoritiesto make specific savings in 1968-69 in expenditure on roads and possibly other designated blocks of expenditure,and that the amount of these savings should be deducted from the total of expenditure accepted as eligible for grant in 1969-70 as under Conclusion (9) above.(12) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider withthe Ministers concerned the amount and kind of savings which the Government should request in pursuance of conclusion (11) above.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,12th January, 1968.
