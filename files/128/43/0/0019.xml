ParliamentRhodesia(previous reference:CC(68) 18thConclusions,Minute 2)confidential. The Commonwealth Secretary said that there was someParliamentary pressure for an early statement on Rhodesia. He had promised that one would be made as soon as possible, and there mightbe advantage in making it on the following day so as to inform parliament of the Governments attitude in advance of the speecheswhich the United Kingdom representative at the United Nations(Lord Caradon) would be making in the forthcoming debate in theSecurity Council.In discussion it was suggested that the pressure for a statementcame mainly from Members who would be satisfied that the matter was in the hands of the United Nations and with the commonwealth secretary&apos;s assurance on the previous day that in presentcircumstances there could be no question of resuming contacts withthe illegal regime. It would be unwise to make a statement until theGovernment were in a position to make a firm and definiteannouncement of policy, and, in view of the embarrassment in whichwe might be placed if Parliamentary discussion preceded the debate in the Security Council, it would be preferable that no statement should be made for the time being.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that itwould be convenient to the Cabinet to discuss the matter again attheir next meeting, and that no statement should be made in themeantime.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion at their next meeting.SECRETPrices andIncomesFuture policy on Productivity,Prices and incomes(previous reference:CC(68) 18thConclusions,Minute 4)2. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of future policy on productivity, prices and incomes on the basis of memoranda by theSecretary of State for Economic Affairs (C (68) 45, 54 and 56) andby the President of the Board of Trade (C (68) 46).The Secretary of State for Economic Affairs said thathis memorandum (C (68) 56) dealt with the major points relating tothe effectiveness and administrative feasibility of the proposed policywhich had been raised at the Cabinefs previous discussion. Thememorandum first considered the extent to which it would benecessary to introduce statutory requirements for notification of wage increases, whether at national or local level, and price increases.There was already power in Part II of the Prices and Incomes Act,1966, to impose such requirements, but he hoped to avoid the need to exercise it. It had not been used during the periods of stand still and severe restraint in 1966 and 1967; employers who were concerned about wage settlements in breach of the policy had reported them tothe Ministry of Labour, and the statutory powers to delay increases8843a 2
had then been brought into play as appropriate. There was always the possibility of collusion between employers and workers to reach a settlement in breach of the policy without reporting it, but it was unlikely that any flagrant case would escape the notice of theDepartments concerned. It was intended to continue on this basisduring the next phase of the policy, and this should reduce theadministrative problems to manageable proportions. If, however,employers proved to be less co-operative than in the past, statutorynotification could be introduced selectively. The system of vettingclaims and settlements would thus be broadly confined to those whichthreatened to contravene the policy, and it would not be necessary forevery settlement to be reported. Controls over price movementswould be operated on the same basis, and this would meet much ofthe concern previously felt by those of his colleagues with responsibilities for prices.As regards the nature of the statutory powers, the crucialproposal was that the maximum period of delay which could be imposed on a price or wage increase should be extended to 12 months.If this were accepted, it would ensure that increases could be deferredat least until a period some 18 months after devaluation, by which time there was a reasonable prospect that we should have emerged from the worst of our economic difficulties.The other powers which he proposed were less crucial to the effectiveness of the policy. He still favoured the prohibition ofretrospective payment of wage increases following the imposition ofa standstill, but he recognised that this would be difficult to enforcesince it would always be possible for an employer to disguise aretrospective payment in such a way as to escape the exercise of thestatutory powers. The proposal for a ban on retrospective wagepayments was related to the question of the duration of the statutory powers generally. If the powers were to be renewable annually foran indefinite period, it should be feasible to use the power to deferincreases as a means of effectively preventing retrospective payments,and the need for a statutory prohibition of such payments would thenbe diminished.He further proposed that the powers to delay excessive increases should be framed by reference to the rate of remuneration of the employees concerned in a particular settlement, rather than by reference to the award or settlement from which the increaseoriginated. The existing powers were on the latter basis, but had proved for this reason to be difficult to administer. It was not alwayseasy to define the relevant settlement in a statutory order, and evenif this could be done it was always open to the parties to reach a freshsettlement which was the same in substance but different in form,and so to defeat the purpose of the statutory order. His proposal would not change the nature of the power, but would allow it to beexercised more effectively.He had further considered the feasibility of providing that thestatutory powers should be exercised only in conjunction with a reference to the National Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI), and
had discussed with the Chairman of the Board whether this would place an undue burden on the Board. This problem could best be assessed by analysis of the three kinds of reference with which the nbpi would have to deal. First, there would be cases where therewas dispute whether the increase resulting from a particular settlementdid or did not exceed the ceiling figure; secondly, there would be caseswhere a settlement exceeded the ceiling figure and where it was quite clear that this could not be justified on the ground of increased productivity; it should be possible for the NBPI to deal quickly withthese two kinds of reference. Thirdly, settlements above the ceilingfigure which there was a case for regarding as exceptions justified onthe grounds of increased productivity would require full investigation by the NBPI. In general he was satisfied that to tie the exercise of statutory powers to reference to the NBPI would not cause unduedifficulties and he recommended this course.In discussion there was general agreement that, given theintention to avoid so far as possible imposing statutory notification of price and wage increases, the administrative burden would bemanageable. It was argued, however, that it would be undesirable for the Government to be compelled to refer to the NBPI settlementsclearly in excess of the ceiling with no shadow of justification for making an exception. For the Board to have to deal with considerable numbers of cases of this kind would reduce its standingwith the public and with industry. It would moreover be morereassuring to opinion overseas if the Government were seen to beprepared to resist excessive increases without relying for support onthe NBPI. On the other hand, it was argued that there were greatpresentational advantages in tying the exercise of statutory powers to reference to the NBPI, and that even where settlements were clearly in breach of the policy it was frequently of great value to theGovernment to have the support of the Board in resisting them.It was suggested, however, that the danger of overloading the nbpi would be greatly reduced if the Government could secure agreement on a voluntary basis, with parallel statutory provision foruse if necessary, to a period longer than the one month provided underPart II of the Act of 1966 during which an increase would be deferred pending a decision whether to refer it to the NBPI. This would givethe Departments concerned more opportunity to persuade the partiesto an excessive settlement to revise it so as to conform with the policy.It was unlikely that the trade unions would agree to the period beingextended to as much as three months, but it might be possible to get agreement to a period of two months.It was suggested that the policy would command a wider degreeof acceptance if, when a settlement in excess of the ceiling was referred to the NBPI, the Board were able to allow the increase up tothe ceiling figure but to defer payment of the remainder of the increase for 12 months. This would amount to treating the ceiling figure as anorm, but it was in any case likely to be so treated in practice andthe policy would recognise the realities of the situation. On the otherhand it was argued that it would be disastrous to give any impression
that a ceiling of V2 per cent was in fact a norm. It would be essentialto continue to emphasise the importance of the existing criteria for wage increases below 3^ per cent; while some relaxation of the criteriamight be inevitable once a ceiling was imposed, it would be aretrograde step to lead trade unions to suppose that increases of3-J- per cent could be granted irrespective of the merits of the claim.Moreover, if the NBPI were always to allow an increase of 3\ per centin the case of settlements in excess of that figure, trade unions wouldhave nothing to lose by pressing excessive claims and the load on the nbpi would become unmanageable. Excessive settlements shouldincur the penalty of rejection of the whole increase, so that the onlyrecourse of the parties concerned would be to reach a fresh settlement in conformity with the ceiling and the criteria.It was argued that it would be unwise to include in the legislationa prohibition on the retrospective payment of wage increasesfollowing the imposition of a standstill. Such a prohibition would bebitterly opposed by the trade unions as interference with free collective bargaining. It could not be effectively enforced, and the need for itwould be greatly diminished if there were power to delay wage increases for up to 12 months since employers in any case were unlikely to concede retrospective payments for such a long period. On theother hand, the tendency, already apparent, for trade unions to press for retrospective payments could be expected to increase. Thequestion of a ban on retrospective payments was closely linked tothe duration of the statutory powers. If the powers were to be validonly for a limited period, then in the absence of a ban on retrospectivepayments, the expiry of the powers would release pent-up pressure for wage increases with results which could be gravely damaging for themanagement of the economy. If, on the other hand, the proposedpowers were to be renewable annually for an indefinite period, itshould be possible to limit retrospective payments by exercising thedelaying powers. Apart from other advantages, it would be morereassuring to foreign opinion to take powers which would be valid foran indefinite period but did not include a ban on retrospectivepayments than to legislate only for a limited period but to includesuch a ban.There was support for the view that to take powers which wouldbe renewable annually for an indefinite period was in any case justified on its own merits. It was increasingly clear that a purely voluntarypolicy for prices and incomes was unlikely to be adequate in the foreseeable future and there was some recognition of this by therepresentatives of both sides of industry. While it should still remain the Governmenfs aim to rely on a voluntary policy increasingly as time went on, it would be necessary if such a policy was to be effectiveto maintain statutory powers to reinforce it when necessary. a convenient course would be to make the powers renewable annually by a simple procedure; for example, if they were expressed initiallyto expire after 18 months they could be renewed by the Expiring laws continuance Act. By this means it might be easier, than by order under the Prices and Incomes Act, to renew some of the powers butnot others, thus giving a greater flexibility.
In further discussion the following points were made (a) A ceiling figure of 3\ per cent should be interpreted to mean that the aggregate increase in the earnings of those affected by aparticular wage settlement should not be increased as a result of thesettlement by more than per cent; there was no question of attempting to limit to 34. per cent the increase in the earnings ofeach individual worker concerned.(b) It was for consideration whether the ceiling figure for wage increases should be embodied in a statutory order. There was support for the view that it would be preferable to announce the figure, with appropriate emphasis, in the Budget Speech and in the subsequentWhite Paper. The figure could then be adjusted at a later stage as circumstances warranted without the need for an amending order.(c) There was general agreement with the proposal in paragraph of C (68) 45 that where in the public services pay was determined onthe basis of comparison with wage and salary movements in theprivate sector over a period of two years or more, the ceiling figure should be applied at an annual rate since the date of the last increase,but that where this would result in an increase of more than 3% percent the increase should be staged that is, it should be paid ininstalments which would not be back-dated. The same principle should be applied where similar circumstances arose in the private sector.(d) The policy might be open to the criticism that it discriminatedagainst the public services, since the only exception to the ceiling for wage increases related to increased productivity and the opportunities for this in the public services, though not negligible, were less than in private industry. It would be necessary to present the policy in theWhite Paper in the manner best calculated to minimise such criticism.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thediscussion had shown general support for the main proposals on incomes policy set out in C (68) 45, as clarified and modified inC (68) 56. The Cabinet were not yet ready, however, to form a view on the related questions of the duration of statutory powers and theinclusion of a prohibition on retrospective wage payments following the imposition of a standstill. It would be helpful if the Secretary ofState for Economic Affairs, in consultation with the Chancellor of theExchequer, the Lord President and the Attorney-General, would circulate a further memorandum on the duration of the powers. Thisshould examine the proposal that the powers should be valid in thefirst instance for 18 months and renewable thereafter by the expiring laws Continuance Act; and if this proposal were found to havedisadvantages, should consider the alternatives. The Cabinet wouldalso need to give further consideration to the question whether the ceiling figure for wage increases should be embodied in a statutory instrument, and to outstanding issues of prices policy. All these issuesshould be considered at their meeting on 14th March with a view to ratification of the final decisions at the Budget Cabinet on 18th March.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer would announce theGovernments proposals in outline in his Budget Speech on19th March; and the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs wouldelaborate them when he spoke in the Budget debate on Thursday,21st March. The Secretary of State, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Labour, should consider further the timing of consultations with the confederation of British Industry (CBI) and the Trades Union Congress (TUC).The best course might be for representatives of the TUC to be seen on the morning of 19th March, but it would only be possible at thattime to give them a limited indication of the proposals. They mightbe given a fuller account on the evening of 19th March after theBudget Speech. It would be preferable not to see representatives ofthe CBI on 19th March; but there should be consultation with them,at which the Chancellor of the Exchequer should be present, and, ifappropriate, further consultation with representatives of the TUC on20th March before the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs spokein the debate. It would also be desirable before this to consult theNational Staff Side of the Civil Service Whitley Council.The Cabinet (1) Took note with approval of the Prime Minister^ summing upof their discussion.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs (i) in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the Lord President and the Attorney-General, to circulate a memorandum on the duration of theproposed statutory powers, on the lines indicatedin the Prime Ministers summing up, forconsideration at their meeting on Thursday,14th March;(ii) in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Minister of Labour, to arrange for consultations with the CBI and the TUC on thelines indicated in the Prime Ministers summing up.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for consultation with the National Staff Side of the CivilService Whitley Council.(4) Agreed to resume their discussion on 14th March.CONFIDENTIALNational 3.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ChancellorLottery of the Excnequer (C (68) 53) on tne introduction of a national lottery.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there were indications that a growing majority of the public would welcome a nationallottery. The House of Commons had recently given a SecondReading to the National Lottery Bill, promoted by Mr. James Tinn,
CC 19 (68)by a majority of 69 to 17; and although the number of votes recordedwas relatively small, the majority was widely representative of theGovernments supporters in the House, with the exception of thosewho were opposed on religious grounds to any form of gambling. Itwould be difficult, however, to base further action on a vote of this size, and he accordingly sought the views of his colleagues on thequestion whether he should test Parliamentary opinion on theintroduction of a lottery by seeking to insert in the Finance Bill atReport Stage a clause to remove the present legal obstacles tothe promotion of a lottery. If, on a free vote, the House acceptedthe principle, a substantive Bill could be introduced in the following session.There would no doubt be some opposition from public opinion,particularly in Scotland and Wales, on moral grounds, and it might be suggested that the promotion of a national lottery conflicted with theGovernments policy on gaming, or that the Government were seekingby this means to escape from the realities of their serious economic position. On the other hand, many people would prefer a lottery asa means of raising revenue to the imposition of even higher taxation,and criticism might be reduced if the decision on principle were takenby a large majority in Parliament on a free vote.It was desirable that a substantial proportion of the proceeds of a lottery, which on an optimistic estimate might amount to 50 million a year, should accrue to the Treasury; and thehypothecation of the remainder presented difficulties, since it mightconflict with the rational ordering of priorities on expenditure.Nevertheless, there would be public support for the hypothecation ofsome of the revenue to purposes which were not primarily theGovernments responsibility and were not sufficiently catered for by public finance. If the Cabinet agreed that Parliamentary opinion should be tested in the way he had proposed he would put in handfurther studies on the problem of hypothecation and would indicate to Mr. Tinn that a Government proposal would be submitted toParliament shortly.The First Secretary of State said that the Home AffairsCommittee had been in favour by a majority of establishing a nationallottery, and hence of testing Parliamentary opinion in the manner proposed. They thought that a majority of the public, even inScotland and Wales, would now support a lottery in principle,particularly if part of the revenue were used to support activities not primarily the Governments responsibility, such as the promotion ofsport, the enjoyment of the countryside, and the arts.In discussion it was recalled that the Government when in opposition had criticised the introduction of Premium Bonds; therewould be resentment among some sections of their supporters if theFinance Bill were used to pave the way for the introduction of anational lottery. The country already had extensive facilities forgambling, some of which the Government were now trying to bringunder control, and this was an inappropriate time to consider theintroduction of a national lottery.CONFIDENTIAL8843 B
On the other hand, there was support for the proposal that parliamentary opinion should at least be tested on a free vote, thoughit was pointed out that if the idea of a lottery was supported inprinciple it would be necessary for the substantive Bill to be aGovernment measure and this might put some members of theGovernment in a difficult position.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theonly issue on which it was necessary at this stage for the Cabinet toreach a conclusion was the proposal that Parliamentary opinion should be tested by an amendment to the Finance Bill. On balance the Cabinet supported this proposal and agreed that Ministers should exercise a free vote. It might be necessary to consider later, if parliament supported the proposal in principle, whether the substantive Bill could be drafted by the Government but introduced by a Private Member. In the meantime a study of hypothecationshould proceed, and the Home Secretary should be consulted on theprovision to be inserted in the Finance Bill.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, as a means of testing Parliamentary opinion onthe principle of a national lottery, an amendment toremove the legal obstacles should be considered on a free vote at the Report Stage of the Finance Bill.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer (i) to prepare the necessary provision in consultationwith the Home Secretary;(ii) to indicate to Mr. James Tinn that the government intended to submit proposals to Parliamentshortly;(iii) to arrange for a further study to be made of theproblem of hypothecating the revenue from anational lottery.CONFIDENTIALCommercialPolicy(previous reference:CC(67) 21stConclusions,Minute 4)acceleration of kennedy round TariffReductions4. The Cabinet considered a note by the President of the Boardof Trade about a possible British offer to accelerate tariff reductionsresulting from the Kennedy Round (C (68) 55).The President of the Board of Trade said that the United states administration were now considering the imposition of an importsurcharge of probably 5 per cent. They were expected to take afinal decision about this in the week beginning 18th March. during their recent consultations with European Governments the americans had, however, hinted that a unilateral and immediate implementationby the European Economic Community (e.c.) of the Kennedy Roundtariff reductions, which were due to take place over the next five years,might well avoid the need for an import surcharge or other Americanrestrictive trade measures. The Federal German Government, despite
some opposition from the French Government and the european commission, had obtained agreement in the e.c. to an urgent studyby the Commission of a proposal to make such a unilateral and immediate reduction in the common external tariff. Since then wehad heard that the Scandinavian countries would probably beprepared also to accelerate tariff reductions agreed in the kennedy round provided that the United Kingdom and the e.c. did the same.In these circumstances he proposed that the Government should nowinform the United States Administration of British willingness to implement our own Kennedy Round tariff cuts in full by 1st January,1969 (or whatever subsequent date might eventually be agreed),provided that at least the member States of e.c. and the european free Trade Association (EFTA) and, if possible, Japan alsoaccelerated their tariff reductions to the same extent; that the UnitedStates Government did not introduce an import surcharge or otherrestrictive trade measures; and that the United States government undertook to proceed with their own Kennedy Round tariff reductions in accordance with the originally agreed timetable and todo their best to get legislation through Congress during this yearabolishing the American selling price system.These proposals had been endorsed on the previous day by the ministerial Committee on Commercial Policy. Because of Frenchopposition within the e.c. it was most improbable that our conditions for implementing the offer would be met. If that proved to be thecase we should nevertheless have earned substantial goodwill, withoutcost, both in the United States and in Germany and Scandinavia. Ifcontrary to our expectations we found ourselves obliged to accelerateour tariff cuts, the cost to our balance of payments would be aboutthe same as the cost of a United States import surcharge of 5 per cent,but the impact of accelerated tariff reductions would come later when we were better able to afford them.In discussion it was suggested that the level of United kingdom imports was still uncomfortably high and showed no signs of falling.We should therefore be taking a substantial risk in committing ourselves to early tariff reductions before we were satisfied that our balance of payments was soundly based. Moreover, an offer ofassistance to the United States by the United Kingdom, in her present economic situation, might not be easily understood here and wouldaccord ill with unpalatable decisions to reduce demand with the objectof improving our own balance of payments. On the other hand, itwas argued that an offer to accelerate United Kingdom tariff reductions would be a lesser evil for our own balance of paymentsthan a United States import surcharge of 5 per cent. Moreover, itwas most improbable that we should be called upon to implement the offer because of French objections in the e.c.; but we should nevertheless earn substantial goodwill with the United states administration and Congress, which might be expected to helpgenerally in containing the powerful protectionist pressures in theUnited States.   While some Commonwealth countries might be

expected to complain if we made such an offer without consultation,meaningful consultations would not be possible if the offer were tobe made in time to have any effect; and Canada, which wouldprobably be most affected by reductions in our tariff, had beenprotected to some extent from the adverse effects of the recent UnitedStates measures. Nevertheless the Departments concerned couldconcert arrangements so far as possible to consult or to notify,as appropriate, other interested Governments.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that, although the proposals made by the President ofthe Board of Trade involved some risk for our balance of payments,they should be accepted as the lesser evil in the circumstances which now faced us.The Cabinet-CD Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in consultationwith the Foreign Secretary, to arrange for the UnitedStates Government to be informed that the Governmentwere prepared to accelerate tariff reductions, agreed in the kennedy Round, on the conditions set out in paragraph of C (68) 55.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in consultationwith the other Ministers concerned, to arrange for consultation or notification as appropriate with other interested Governments and with the european commission.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,12th March, 1968.
