ParliamentaryAffairs- FutureBusinessReportof theParliamentaryCommitteeCC 52 (68)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the week after the Christmas Recess.The Lord Privy Seal reported that the House of Lords, having no further business to transact before Christmas, would adjourn forthe Recess that day.The Prime Minister reported that the Home Secretary hadencountered considerable opposition to the provisions of the representation of the People Bill permitting the use of registeredparty labels on nomination papers and ballot papers at a parliamentary election, and had undertaken to reconsider the matter before the Report Stage on 18th December. He had had to ask theParliamentary Committee at short notice to agree to the withdrawalof the registration scheme and the substitution of permission to useany label, subject only to limitation of length. Since the Cabinet had decided in principle that the use of party labels should be permitted,the Parliamentary Committee considered that it was not open to themto return to the present position and had approved the proposed amendment. In view of the necessity to table amendments quickly,he had agreed that, in the Home Secretary&apos;s absence, he would reportthe decision to the Cabinet.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Ministers statement.oversea affairs vietnam (previous reference:CC(68) 49thConclusions,Minute 2)Nigeria(previous reference:CC (68) 50thConclusions,Minute 3)secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theprocedural argument at the Paris Conference on Vietnam was still continuing on whether the talks should be &quot; two-sided &quot;, which wouldobscure the status of the National Liberation Front (NLF), or&quot; four-party &quot;, which would equate the status of the NLF with thatof the other participants. There would probably have to be a meetingof deputies on this issue; and it was now unlikely that substantivediscussions would begin until January, by which time the successorto the United States representative, Mr. Harriman, might have beenappointed.Meanwhile, the North Vietnamese were continuing their attacks in the Demilitarised Zone. Viet Cong morale was reported to be low,and it was also reported that the North Vietnamese were anxious tointerfere with pacification in South Vietnam. There were alsoindications of a possible general offensive by the North Vietnameseand Viet Cong in South Vietnam. It was unlikely, however, thatthis would include such action as the bombardment of cities, whichmight lead to the breaking off of the Paris talks.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that he had notyet seen the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs(Lord Shepherd) on his return from Lagos. Progress on a cease-firehad been halted by the insistence of the Biafran leader, colonel ojukwu, on the withdrawal, as a precondition, of Federal forces9709
East /WestContacts(previous reference:CC (68) 38thConclusions,Minute 1)from the Eastern region; and the best hope of further progress now seemed to lie in discussion at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos;Meeting.In discussion the point was made that, while the Emperor of ethiopia had given a warm welcome to the recent British initiativesand the Nigerian Federal Military Government had at least notrejected them out of hand, any further advance had been frustratedby the intransigence of Colonel Ojukwu. However, the possibility should still be kept in mind of a Ministerial visit to Biafra. TheFederal Government had reservations about this, but had not imposedan absolute ban on it.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;sstatements.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that he considered it important to maintain the line which he had takenboth previously in the Cabinet and at the Ministerial Meeting of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation, namely that normal contacts with the Soviet Union and her Allies for business purposes shouldcontinue, but that we should go slow on contacts which had nopurpose beyond the promotion of general goodwill.In discussion the point was made that it was desirable to avoid creating the impression that we were acting out of pique or indulgingin petty pin-pricks which could be exploited to our propagandadisadvantage.The Cabinet (2) Took note of the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;sstatement.SocialServicesNationalSuperannuationand social insurance:Draft white paper(previous reference:CC (68) 45thConclusions,Minute 5)confidential. The Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary of State for social Services (C (68) 128) to which was annexed a draft white paper on National Superannuation and Social Insurance.The Secretary of State for Social Services said that the draft white Paper set forth the proposals for an earnings-related pensions scheme which had been approved by the Cabinet on 31st October(CC (68) 45th Conclusions, Minute 5). A previous draft had been circulated to the Ministers concerned and changes made to meet theviews expressed; so far as he knew there were no points of substanceoutstanding. He wished however to draw attention to what was said in paragraphs 41 and 42 about fatherless families and inparticular to the proposal to appoint a committee to consider thegeneral position of one-parent families. The White Paper would notbe complete without some reference to this problem, which had so fardefied all attempts to find a solution that could form an integral part of the main proposals. He believed that what was said in these
He proposed to publish at the same time as the White Paper a shorter account of the proposals for popular consumption and wasin consultation with the Paymaster General about this. Any suchdocument was. likely to be attacked as political propaganda, but hethought that it should be possible to produce a version which wasproof against this charge by repeating what was said in selectedparts of the White Paper with only minor changes of wording.On the timing of publication he proposed that they should make all preparations to publish on Tuesday, 21st January, although he recognised that a final decision could not be taken until the impact of the December trade figures was known. He had agreed to review the position on about 10th January with the Chancellor of theExchequer.In discussion the Cabinet first considered the terms of the draft white Paper and the following main points were made (a) Paragraphs 41 and 42. It was agreed that this discussionof the problem of fatherless families should stand part of theWhite Paper.(b) Table 2, page 21, and Table 3, page 25. These Tablesillustrated the effects of the proposals on employees&apos; contributions and benefits at April 1968 levels of earnings and compared themwith the effects of the present scheme. By assuming for the purposethat the scheme had come into effect 20 years before and was thusfully mature in April 1968 it had been possible to avoid making anyassumptions about the level of future earnings which could havegiven a foothold for political attack. There was a general welcomefor this ingenious device.(c) Paragraph 177. As drafted this might give rise to thecharge that the Government expected living standards to rise by no more than 2 per cent per annum. The paragraph should be put ona purely hypothetical basis; it might say that if over a given (butunspecified) period living standards, say, doubled, the rise inworkers&apos; living standards would be whatever the appropriate figure was.  The word &quot; burden &quot; should be used more sparingly.In further discussion the Cabinet considered the timing of publication; emphasis was laid on the need to avoid any clash withthe publication of the proposed White Paper on Policy for industrial relations. Consultations on the latter were not yet complete, butthe draft should be ready for consideration by the Cabinet in thefirst few days of January and if then approved its publication wouldprecede that of the White Paper on National Superannuation and social Insurance by an adequate margin. It therefore appeared that21st January would be a suitable date for the latter, assuming theeconomic situation to be favourable.IVIHIJ   KJ1    1 VJLVi.

The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the draft White Paper, subject to the redraftingof paragraph 177 on the lines indicated in discussion. They also agreed that printing should proceed with a view to publication on21st January, if in the judgment of the Chancellor of the exchequer the economic situation permitted when the December trade figures were known.The Cabinet (1) Approved the draft White Paper annexed to C (68) 128,subject to the redrafting of paragraph 177 on the lines indicated at (c) of their discussion.(2) Agreed that the White Paper be published on 21st January,subject to the agreement of the Chancellor of theExchequer when the December trade figures were known.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services to consult with the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forScotland about the terms of reference and composition of the proposed committee on one-parent families.(4) Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services and theFirst Secretary of State to arrange for the preparation oflegislation to give effect to the proposals in the white paper.EnvironmentalPlanningCentralLancashireNew Town(previous reference:CC (65) 7thConclusions,Minute 5)confidential. The Cabinet considered a note by the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster covering a note by the Chairman of the official committee on Environmental Planning (C (68) 129) on a new townin Central Lancashire.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that in February1965 the Cabinet had decided in principle that a new town should beestablished at Leyland / Chorley. Since then officials had considered a report by consultants evaluating the effect of the proposed newtown on North-East Lancashire and had made recommendations for action in the light of the views of the North-West economic planning Council (which strongly supported the Leyland/Chorleyproject) and of the local authorities concerned. Therecommendations, which he endorsed, were that the Governmentshould announce its decision to proceed with the new town proposal and to make a draft designation order; to accept the case for an improved road link between the Calder Valley and the M6; to commission pilot schemes of area improvement in- North-east lancashire; and to invite the local authorities concerned to prepare a sub-regional plan for North-East Lancashire.The Minister of Planning and Land said that the proposed newtown would make a major contribution to the long-term overspillneeds of the North-West and to the industrial revival of the wholeregion. There would be very little public expenditure on the newtown during the period of the current public expenditure survey,and the Ministry of Housing and Local Government would in any
CC 52 (68)case order their priorities so as to contain it within their agreedprogrammes. The main local authorities concerned had made it clear to him at a recent meeting that they were not opposed to the newtown in principle, though the authorities in North-East Lancashirewere concerned that there should be proper safeguards for their area.They had all emphasised the need for an early decision, and he proposed that the decision to make a draft designation order, to befollowed by a public enquiry in the spring, should be announced onThursday, 19th December.In discussion the need to reassure the local authorities in north-East Lancashire that the new town would not prejudicenecessary development in their areas was strongly emphasised. Itwas widely believed in North-East Lancashire that a decision to go ahead with the new town would in practice mean that funds werenot available for parallel development in neighbouring areas, whichwere already suffering from depopulation and slow industrial growth.The acceptance of the new town by the authorities in North-east lancashire was conditional on the taking of positive steps tosafeguard their needs. It would be very damaging to the Governmentto announce the draft designation order without at the same timegiving definite undertakings that the specific needs of North-east lancashire would be met. In particular, any public announcement about the new town should contain a firm starting date for theimprovement of road communications with the M6. Theannouncement should also contain a reference to the decision tocarry out pilot operations in area improvement in North-east lancashire; and should make it clear that consideration would begiven in the context of the report of the Committee on IntermediateAreas (the Hunt Committee) to the possibility of making availablehigher grants for clearing derelict land and for urban renewal in north-East Lancashire.On the other hand it was argued that to give an unqualifiedcommitment of the kind proposed about the improvement of communications for a single area would represent the negation of planning. The road programme had been severely cut and all roadprojects must be decided on the basis of careful appraisal of theircosts and benefits and of an objective determination of priorities.The need for an improved road link between the Calder Valley andthe M6 was accepted in principle, and a feasibility study had been set in hand, but it was not possible at this stage to say when the project should start or what precise form it should take. The impact of the new town would in any case not be substantially felt until the1980s.In further discussion it was pointed out that the new town was intended to exert a revitalising influence on the whole of northernLancashire. It would fail in its purpose and lead to a waste of socialcapital if it acted as a magnet to draw people away from theNorth-East Lancashire towns. This pointed to the desirability of improving road access from North-East Lancashire to Manchester
and other parts of the region in parallel with the development of thenew town. The report of the Hunt Committee would have important implications for the whole area, and it would be desirable to reassesspriorities for example as between the improvement of communications and urban renewal for North-East Lancashire inthe light of its findings.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that there should be an early announcement ofthe Governmenfs decision, as part of their regional strategy for theNorth-West, to proceed with the proposed new town at Leyland/Chorley and to make a draft designation order. The announcement should make it clear that the Government accepted the case for an improved road link between the Calder Valley and the M6; and itshould state that they would commission the preparation of pilotschemes of area improvement in North-East Lancashire and would invite the local authorities concerned to prepare a sub-regional plan for North-East Lancashire. The announcement should also refer tothe Governmenfs intention to hold discussions with the localauthorities in North-East Lancashire, when the report of the HuntCommittee was published, on the best way of meeting their needs in the light of the timetable for the development of the new town.The Cabinet (1) Approved the recommendations in the note attached toC (68) 129.(2) Invited the Minister for Planning and Land, in consultationwith the Minister of Transport and the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, to announce their decision on thelines indicated in the Prime Ministefs summing up.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,17th December, 1968.
