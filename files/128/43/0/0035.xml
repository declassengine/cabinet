CC 35 (68)confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C (68) 85) to which was attached a draft White paper on the review of the law governing Parliamentary elections.The Home Secretary recalled that at their meeting on30th May the Cabinet had approved the recommendations of theSub-Committee on Electoral Reform which, under the chairmanship of the Lord President, had considered the report of the speakers conference on Electoral Law. The White Paper summarised theGovernments conclusions on the major Issues raised in the report but did not attempt to argue in detail the merits of each conclusion.The White Paper would also publish for the first time therecommendations of his Electoral Advisory Conference, dealingwith details of administration and procedure, and would say thatthe Government accepted those recommendations with certain minor exceptions.The White Paper left open the question of the administrative arrangements necessary to permit the use of party labels on ballot papers. These were now being worked out by the Sub-Committeeon Electoral Reform and would have to be discussed with theOpposition parties. The Opposition would also be approachedabout changes in the arrangements for local government electionswhich would be effected in the Representation of the People Billbut would not appear in the White Paper. They were non-controversial apart from a proposal to abolish the right, enjoyed by only a few people, to vote and to stand for election in areas where they did not live but where they owned land or occupiedrateable premises.The Parliamentary Committee, in considering the draft white paper, had suggested that the proposal to increase candidates&apos;deposits from  150 to  250 should be reviewed. At  250 the depositwould not be enough either to conform with the change in thevalue of money since the amount was fixed in 1918 or to deterfrivolous candidates; and it might prove to be a controversialproposal which offered little practical advantage.In discussion it was agreed that a comparatively small changein the amount of candidates&apos; deposits would have little effect, andthe increase would be seen in some quarters as an attempt by thelarge parties to put obstacles in the way of independent candidates.In the absence of any compelling reason to the contrary, therecommendation of the Speaker&apos;s Conference that the amount ofdeposit should be left at  150 should be accepted.In further discussion of procedure it was agreed that the white paper should be published before Parliament rose for the summer recess and that a statement should be made at the time of publicationthat there would be a debate in the House of Commons immediatelyafter the recess. That would allow a suitable interval before thesecond reading of the Representation of the People Bill.9119
confidential parliament 2.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.House of Lords The Paymaster General reported that the House of Lords wereTimetable making good progress with Government business. He proposedthat they should rise on 1st August, but it would remain impossibleto find time to pass the Divorce Bill unless the Session wereprolonged for at least a week after 25th October. The race relations, Gaming and Medicines Bills were likely to receive their third Reading before 1st August, but, since the House of commons would not by then be sitting, they could not be given Royal Assentunless it were thought desirable to recall the House of Commonsfor a short formal sitting for this purpose.In discussion it was suggested that the Bills in question, shouldbe examined to see whether there was need for them to operatebefore the resumed sittings in October: if so, the possibility ofrecalling the House of Commons for a formal sitting confined tothe notification of Royal Assent should be further examined.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord Privy Seal and the Paymaster general to consider, in consultation with the Ministers concerned,what Bills would receive Third Reading in the House ofLords in the week after the adjournment of the House ofCommons and whether there would be advantage in arranging a formal sitting of the House of Commons sothat they could receive Royal Assent at once.Prices andIncomesPay of .MunicipalBusmen(previous reference:CC (68) 29thConclusions,Minute 5)secret. The First Secretary of State said that the standstill imposed on the increase of  1 a week which had been agreed in December1967 for the municipal bus industry would lapse on 26th July unlessshe gave notice, as soon as the Prices and Incomes Bill receivedthe Royal Assent, of her intention to extend it for a further five months. It was now expected that the Bill would receive royal assent on the following day. In order to extend the standstill, itwould be necessary to give notice in the Official Gazette on 10thor 11th July.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed to accept the recommendation of the speakers conference that the amount of a candidate^ depositshould remain at  150.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the White paper on Electoral Reform to be published before the summer recess and, in consultation with the Lord Privy Seal, to announce it in a statement indicating that there wouldbe a debate when the House resumed.
She had discussed with both sides of the National joint industrial Council (NJIC) for the road passenger transport industryboth the standstill on the agreement of December 1967 and anagreement concluded by the NJIC in June 1968 for a bonus of10s. a week for acceptance of the principle of one-man operationof buses. The employers maintained that the two agreements should be taken together and that the increase of  1 a week should include the 10s. bonus for one-man operation. The trade unionsargued that the agreements were separate and that the 10s. bonusshould be in addition to the  1 increase; this interpretation seemedto be more in line with the recommendations of Report No. 63 bythe National Board for Prices and Incomes. However, she had discussed the situation with the Ministers mainly concerned, andthey were agreed that no offer beyond the  1 a week should becountenanced, in view of the repercussions on incomes policy generally and in particular on the proposed agreement for anincrease of  1 a week for London busmen which, unlike the proposed settlement for the municipal busmen, was linked with productivityconcessions by the unions; this agreement was to be submitted to a union delegate conference on 15th July.The Government had deliberately refrained from taking a powerto prevent retrospective payment of an increase following the expiry of a standstill. If the unions were to secure retrospective paymentof the 30s. increase which they claimed on the expiry of an extendedstandstill at the end of 1968, the resulting percentage increase in basic pay would be substantially greater than if they secured a  increase paid immediately with retospective effect. A few localauthorities had committed themselves to make retrospectivepayments on the expiry of the standstill; but the main body of theemployers took the view that if the standstill, which had alreadylasted for seven months, were prolonged for a further five months,they would not be able to afford retrospective payment at the endof such a long period.In these circumstances, it was essential to give notice to extend the standstill. However, if it were so extended and no other action was taken, there was a serious risk of strike action by the busmen,despite the desire of the unions to avoid a confrontation with theGovernment. This would raise difficult issues as regards theapplication of penal sanctions under the prices and incomeslegislation. It would also give rise to renewed controversy inParliament when the Order extending the standstill came to be debated, as it would be, at the end of the Parliamentary session inOctober.The right course therefore was for both the Government andthe employers to make statements at the time notice was given toextend the standstill, indicating that the employers had offered, withthe Governmenfs approval, an immediate increase of 10s. a week on basic rates, linked to undertakings by the unions to begindiscussions on productivity guidelines and the introduction of atiered wages structure, together with a 10s. bonus for acceptance of
one-man bus operation; that if the unions were prepared to accept this offer, the standstill would be revoked; but that if they were not,the employers would not be prepared to concede retrospectiveincreases on the expiry of the extended standstill. This would ineffect constitute an appeal to the busmen over the heads of theirunions, and there was some prospect that it might succeed. The 10s.increase in basic rates could be justified primarily on the ground thatthe busmen had already suffered a standstill lasting seven months,and it was wrong that this should now be prolonged under newpowers which were not in existence when the relevant settlementswere reached.In discussion it was argued that it would be preferable to extend the standstill without any further attempt to secure agreement to anincrease of  1 a week. The proposed increase on basic rates couldnot be justified under the criteria of the incomes policy. If the standstill were extended, the latest reactions from the employersshowed that there was little risk of full retrospective payments onits expiry. On the other hand, it was argued that to adopt thiscourse would increase the risk of strikes and raise acutely the questionof using penal sanctions. The provision in the Prices and incomes bill which made it possible to extend the standstill on the busmen&apos;sincrease had been strongly criticised in Parliament on the groundthat it unfairly singled out these workers; the Government hadcountered this by saying they would do their best before the existingstandstill expired to secure an acceptable settlement which would remove the necessity to extend it; and it would be essential for theGovernment to be able to demonstrate that they had done this by making public their endorsement of the offer of the  1 a weekincrease.It was further argued that it would give an appearance ofindecision for the Government to give notice to extend the standstill,and subsequently to revoke it. It would be preferable to make a finalattempt to secure the agreement of the unions to the  1 a weekincrease, and if this failed to extend the standstill unequivocally. Itwas pointed out, however, that there was insufficient time to followthis course if the extending Order were to come into effect beforethe expiry of the existing standstill.It was pointed out that if a statement about the offer of a  1a week increase were published before 15th July, this would prejudice the chances of acceptance of the agreement for Londonbusmen at the union delegate conference on that day. It would therefore be preferable to defer any such statement until after15th July, but to make it clear in guidance to the Press when thenotice to extend the standstill was published that discussions withthe parties on a possible settlement which would conform withincomes policy were still going on, and that the Government wouldbe prepared not to proceed with the extension if such a settlement could be reached.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) It would be of crucial importance, from the point of viewboth of opinion overseas and of the internal management of the
economy, to administer the incomes policy firmly over the next fewmonths. There was some danger that the recent settlement on therailways might be taken as a sign that the policy was beginning to weaken. It would be helpful if Ministers could in the near futurehave a full discussion of the strategy to be followed on prices and incomes policy during the coming months, in order to assess the major contingencies likely to arise and the best means of dealingwith them.(b) Ministers and selected backbenchers on the Government sideshould be given briefing material covering the recent settlements onthe railways and at the Ford Motor Company, together with thenegotiations on busmen&apos;s pay, to help them in dealing with public criticism of incomes policy.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that notice should be given to extend the standstill on busmen&apos;s pay. They authorised the First Secretary of State toissue a statement describing the offer of a  1 a week increase,including a 10s. bonus for acceptance of one-man bus operation,which had been made to the unions, and making clear that theGovernment would be ready to lift the standstill if this offer were accepted. She should encourage the employers to issue a statementmaking clear that they would not be prepared to pay increasesretrospectively on the expiry of an extended standstill. However,in order to avoid repercussions on the settlement for the Londonbusmen, no public reference to the offer to the municipal busmenshould be made until after Monday, 15th July; but the Press shouldbe briefed, when the notice to extend the standstill was published, tothe effect that discussions with the parties were still going on withthe object of reaching a settlement acceptable under the incomes policy and so enabling the standstill to be withdrawn. The prices and Incomes Committee should at an early date consider the strategy for incomes policy over the coming months and their conclusions should be reported to the Parliamentary Committee, in view of theParliamentary implications, and subsequently to the Cabinet.Briefing material on recent wage settlements and on busmen&apos;s pay should be made available to Ministers and to selected Governmentbackbenchers.The Cabinet (1) Invited the First Secretary of State (i) to proceed with the extension of the standstill onthe pay of municipal busmen and to takeaccompanying action as indicated in the PrimeMinister^ summing up;(ii) in consultation with the Lord President, to arrangefor briefing material on recent wage settlements tobe made available to Ministers and selectedGovernment backbenchers.
(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for the ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomes toconsider future strategy on incomes policy, and to report their conclusions to the Parliamentary Committee andsubsequently to the Cabinet.CONFIDENTIALHealth 4.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theAdministrative Minister of Health (C (68) 82) covering a draft Green Paper on the structure of administrative structure of the medical and related services inthe medical and Trelated services England and Wales.in England and       Th  Minister of Health said that the proposals in the GreenWales: Draft ^ ., ,    , .    , .      .Green Paper Paper for possible changes in the present tripartite structure of the health Service were tentative: the object of publishing them wasto provide a basis for consultation and public discussion in orderthat the problem of organising the Health Service might be seen inthe context of the proposals expected later in the year from the RoyalCommission on Local Government in England (the Redcliffe-MaudCommission); and the Foreword emphasised that no decisions wouldbe taken until this process had been completed.   He proposed to publish the Green Paper at the same time as the publication of theReport of the Interdepartmental Committee on Local Governmentand Allied Personal Social Services (the Seebohm Report) and to announce the publication by means of a Written Answer, but notto make a statement upon it.The Lord President said that the Social Services Committee had considered a draft of the Green Paper, and had examined inparticular how far the Government would be committed by its publication and whether the Green Paper should leave open thepossibility of bringing the Health Service within the structure of localgovernment. They had concluded that it would not be inappropriate for the Green Paper to express the personal views of the responsible minister about the reorganisation of the service, provided that it did not exclude other possible solutions.In discussion there was general agreement that the Green Paperoffered a valuable means of opening the subject to public discussion,and that it was not necessary in advance of consultation and of consideration of the Redcliffe-Maud Report for the Government totake any decisions or to be committed to any particular view aboutthe future of the service. At a later stage it would be necessaryto balance the desirability of devolution to local bodies against theneed for centralised control of a service responsible for a majorblock of public expenditure. In the meantime, however, itwas important not to put forward proposals such as those inparagraph 59 of the draft on the possible composition of Area boards and the place of local authorities in the new structure on which those concerned might be encouraged to insist in subsequentdiscussion. Paragraph 59 went too far in proposing that aconsiderable proportion of the members of Area Boards should be
nominees of local authorities, who in this context would representthe consumer and have no responsibility for financing the service.The composition of the Boards would have to take account ofthe demand among the Governments own supporters for somedemocratic element in the control of the service; but it must alsocommand the support of the medical profession. It might bedesirable to include persons possessing managerial skills and representatives of nursing and other staff. The Boards would,however, be responsible for policy rather than day-to-day management, which would be undertaken by people with appropriatetraining in management who were now being recruited.In further discussion it was suggested that, in order to avoid creating expectation of a particular composition of the Boards while leaving these various possibilities open, paragraph 59 should be redrafted on the following lines:In general it would be desirable to provide for flexibility inthe size and composition of the membership of Boards, androom should be left for evolution. In order to bring directexperience of the practical problems of the services and to assistwith the task of remodelling patterns of care, some members with broad professional knowledge of medical and related services would be needed, though it would not be desirable forthese to be nominated to represent special interests. In areascontaining medical schools the Minister might appoint on the nomination of universities one or two additional members. Inaddition, it would be important to make arrangements to ensurethat appropriate account was taken of the interests of localauthorities. It is for consideration how this could best be done,and this is a matter on which comment would be particularlyvaluable.Paragraph (v) of the foreword should also be amended to draw attention to the financial difficulties in the way of bringing theservice within the local authority structure. For the third sentence of the paragraph there should be substituted:It would not be appropriate to try to anticipate, in detailed discussion in this Green Paper, the effect of changes which might result from the Royal Commission^ Report. But it must berecognised that a unified administration of health services underlocal authorities would raise major issues in relation to financing the integrated services, and one should certainly bear in mind the acknowledged difficulties of increasing local revenues and theproblem of reconciling the continuing independence of localgovernment with continuing and increased support from theExchequer; such issues would call for extensive furtherconsideration.In the fourth sentence of the paragraph the words &quot;including members of the local authorities nominated by them &quot; should be omitted.
The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Green Paper should be published, with the amendments which had been agreed, as a contribution to the democratic discussion of the future structure of the medical and related services in England and Wales. The paper would not commit the Government to any particular solution, and indeed the cabinet could not properly reach any conclusions in advance of the discussion and consultation on the Green Paper and of their consideration ofthe Reports of the Redcliffe-Maud Commission and the SeebohmCommittee. The Paper should be published at the same time as theReport of the Seebohm Committee in the week before theParliamentary recess and announced in a Written Answer but without any formal statement on behalf of the Government. Itwould be appropriate for the Minister to explain the nature of the green Paper to the Lobby on the date of publication.The Cabinet-(1) Approved, subject to the amendments agreed in their discussion and to any consequential amendments, thedraft Green Paper appended to C (68) 82.(2) Invited the Minister of Health to arrange for the publicationof the Green Paper on the lines indicated in the PrimeMinister^ summing up.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,9th July, 1968.
