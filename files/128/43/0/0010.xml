SECRET &quot; &quot;3CC 10 (68)secret parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.OverseaAffairsSeizure ofUnited Statesship by theNorthKoreansSECRET2. The Foreign Secretary said that according to his information the seizure by North Korean patrol boats of the United States ShipPueblo, which was engaged in intelligence tasks, had taken place onthe high seas outside any possible definition of territorial waters. Asa maritime Power we had a strong interest in the strict observance ofinternational law with regard to freedom of navigation on the high seas. He had therefore authorised the Foreign Office spokesman tosay, in reply to questions, that we deplored the seizure of a vessel in international waters. It could be that the seizure of the Pueblo was intended to bring pressure on the United States in relation to theVietnam war. He had been in touch with the United StatesGovernment and had been assured that their intention was to&quot; play it cool &quot;.The Prime Minister said that he had not raised this questionduring his recent visit to Moscow; nor had the Soviet Governmentraised it with him.In discussion it was emphasised that the issue at stake wasfreedom from interference for ships on the high seas, in which wehad a vital interest, and that from this point of view the intelligencefunction of the Pueblo was not relevant.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Foreign Secretary.Mauritius The Commonwealth Secretary said that he had received a message from the Governor of Mauritius that all was now quiet inthe island after the recent disorders. Trouble had however brokenout on the island of Rodriguez, a dependency of Mauritius 350 miles away, where the police station had been attacked; and a Royal Navalvessel was due to arrive at Rodriguez that day. He wished to paytribute to the speed with which the defence forces had responded tothe. Governors call for help in restoring order.Approach to europe(previous reference:CC(68)9thConclusions,Minute 2)The Cabinet (2) Took note of the statement by the Commonwealth Secretary.The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs (C (68) 28) to which was attached the full text, and a summary, of recent Benelux proposals for continuingcontacts and collaboration between members of the european economic Community (e.c.) and other European States including those which had applied for membership.8753
The Foreign Secretary said that he would like to report the Idevelopments which had occurred since the Cabinet had discussed fthe European situation on 18th January, and to secure the approval Iof the Cabinet to carry further the action he had taken in fulfilment of their decision of 20th December, 1967 (CC (67) 73rd Conclusions,Minute 3). He had had a frank, full and genuinely friendly&apos;discussion on 19th January with the Foreign Minister of the german federal Republic, Herr Brandt, and had found that there was asubstantial measure of agreement between them about their objectives. He had explained to Herr Brandt why Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment were sceptical about the possibilities of achievingsatisfactory results in the further discussions which the Germansintended to pursue with the French Government: in particular hehad explained why we could not accept solutions of a type whichwould impose obligations without rights on the United Kingdom.But he had also made clear that the British position was not one of&quot; all or nothing &quot;, and he was glad to see that the spokesman of theGerman Ministry of Foreign Affairs had made it clear in a statement,issued the previous day, that the German Government were satisfiedthat this was not the position which we were adopting. He had told [Herr Brandt that he did not wish to discourage the Germans from pursuing their own approach with the French but he suggested thatthere was no reason why a meeting or meetings between membersof the e.c. and the United Kingdom should not take place at thesame time. Herr Brandt had now so rearranged his affairs that hewould be able to attend the meeting next week of the Council of western European Union (WEU), when all the Foreign Ministers ofthe WEU Powers would be able to have an informal discussion aboutthe post-veto situation at the usual dinner on Monday night,29th January. He would also be able, in one way or another, tohold discussions on Tuesday, 30th January, with the Five either asa whole or in separate groups.The Foreign Secretary said that the Benelux proposals, whichwere now before the Cabinet, had been delivered on 19th Januarytoo late for him to discuss them with Herr Brandt. They represented a compromise between the position of the Dutch Government, whohad stepped back from their previous policy of freezing all futured development within the e.c., and their Benelux partners, who hadtaken a step forward in calling for consultations between, on theone hand, the Six, the Five or even some of the Five and, on theother hand, the United Kingdom and other European States. Wewere therefore being offered the opportunity of continuing Europeanconsultations and collaboration, without being required to accept atthis stage any obligations or commitments. Acceptance would thus be consistent with the Cabinefs decision, at their meeting on20th December, 1967, about future collaborative action, and wouldnot prejudice the results of the comprehensive review of future foreignpolicy which the Cabinet had decided upon at their last meeting.He therefore commended the Benelux proposals as a valuabledevelopment which had resulted from our efforts, following the veto,
CC 10 (68)to explore the possibilities of collaborative action with the Five. the benelux Governments had in his view found a way in which theUnited Kingdom could participate in, and exercise a degree of influence on, the future development of the Community, which was our objective. He was confident that the Italian Government would support the proposals and first provisional indications from her majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Bonn suggested that the Federal GermanGovernment might also be prepared to support them. He proposedtherefore that he should inform the Foreign Ministers of the Five,when he saw them next week, that Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwelcomed and accepted the Benelux proposals, and that he should encourage the Benelux Governments themselves to try to secure their acceptance by other members of the e.c. and other european states. The Minister of Technology would be making a speech tothe Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe on 29th january and the Foreign Secretary suggested that it would be appropriate forthat speech to contain a welcome for and acceptance of the benelux proposals. It was of course impossible at this stage to say whetherthe Germans, or even the French, would accept the Benelux proposals in their existing or some modified form. If both Germany andFrance refused to be associated with the proposals then obviouslythey would be of less value to us and continued pursuit of them would then need to be reviewed. But it was not necessary for us atthis stage to decide whether or not we should later wish to be associated with whatever might emerge from the proposals the benelux Governments had put forward. Indeed, unless we gave the proposals at this stage every encouragement we should not onlyseverely disappoint our friends in Europe but also kill the prospects of new European consultative and collaborative arrangements beforeGermany and other European countries concerned had had anopportunity to decide their attitudes. He therefore sought theauthority of the Cabinet to inform the Governments of the BeneluxPowers and the other European Governments concerned that her majesty&apos;s Government welcomed and accepted these proposals.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The proposal for European political consultations, atitem (iv) in the summary of the Benelux proposals annexed&apos; toC (68) 28, was addressed to all European States and not merely tothe Community and applicant States. In this respect it appeared togo further than the other three proposals and it was not clear why it had been so extended. Moreover this proposal could create special difficulties for Germany because of a possible conflict with the franco-German Treaty. Again, it was by no means self-evident thatwe should wish to be tied to prior consultation with the Benelux orother European Governments about, for example, the bilateral discussions on European security which the Prime Minister had justagreed we should hold with the Soviet Government. It was pointedout, however, that it was important that the opportunities for politicalconsultation in Western Europe should be set as wide as possible to include Sweden and Switzerland for example so as to avoid the
risk of any new division of Europe; that there was no necessaryconflict here with the Franco-German Treaty; and that the benelux proposals would not require us to consult with other european governments if we did not wish to do so. The Benelux governments had simply stated their intention to consult together in future on important questions of foreign policy and had invited other european states to associate themselves with this development.(b) The President of the European Commission, M. Rey, had recently made clear his dislike of any development of consultation and collaboration between the United Kingdom and some only ofthe Six, because of its disruptive effects within the Community. it seemed doubtful whether it was advisable to welcome proposals ofwhich the Commission publicly disapproved. It was pointed outhowever that the Benelux proposals were addressed to all the member States of the Community, and that M. Rey&apos;s remarks hadbeen addressed to earlier initiatives which had looked to collaborativeaction restricted to the Five and the applicant States. In any event we should always bear in mind the continuing dispute within theCommunity between the Commission and the member Governments:the Commission were jealous of any developments in Europe whichmight prejudice the authority they claimed; but in this they wouldnot necessarily have the support of member Governments. M. Rey&apos;remarks should be considered against this background.(c) The proposal for a European Institute of Technology, whichhad aroused considerable interest in Europe, had originally in thePrime Minister^ speech at the Guildhall in November 1967 beenmade dependent on the opening of negotiations for the enlargement of the Community. It was necessary to consider, following the veto,whether we wished to continue to advocate the establishment of suchan Institute. It was suggested that, while it was not necessary totake a decision about this before the comprehensive review of our foreign policy in February, there was a good prima facie case for proceeding with the proposal to establish a European Institute of technology, and also with any bilateral or multilateral projects which were advantageous to us. If we did so, however, we should need to make clear that we still believed that Europe would not benefit fully from technological collaboration without the enlargement of the Community, and also that our future collaboration with othercountries in technological matters would not be restricted to themembers of the Community: we were already developing suchcollaboration with other countries including the Soviet Union.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that the Foreign Secretary should indicate, athis forthcoming discussions with the Foreign Ministers of the Five,that we welcomed and accepted the Benelux proposals for futureEuropean collaboration. The Minister of Technology should alsowelcome and accept these proposals on behalf of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment in his speech to the Council of Europe on 29th January.The Minister of Technology should also reopen discussions with the confederation of British Industries (CBI) who originally proposed the establishment of a European Institute of Technology, to discover
primeministers visit to theSoviet Union(previous reference:CC (66) 34thConclusions,Minute 2)whether the CBI still favoured its establishment and whether theywould be willing, if asked, to work out the practical implementation of this project with their European counterparts. The cabinet could then consider, as a part of their comprehensive review offoreign policy, whether this initiative should be pursued. If so itmight be better that it should be pursued by the CBI, at any rateinitially, rather than by the Government.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform the Governments ofthe Benelux countries and of other European countries concerned that Her Majesty&apos;s Government welcomed and accepted the Benelux proposals for future Europeancollaboration.(2) Invited the Minister of Technology(i) to welcome and accept the Benelux proposals onbehalf of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the courseof his speech to the Consultative Assembly of theCouncil of Europe on 29th January;(ii) to  reopen discussions  with  the CBI  about  theproposed European Institute of Technology, on thelines indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up.The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of the outcome of the visit which he had paid to the Soviet Union on 22nd to 24th January.His discussions with the Soviet leaders had been conducted inan atmosphere which for the most part had been friendly andco-operative; but the Soviet attitude had considerably hardenedwhen it came to the point of agreeing a form of words on Vietnamfor the purposes of the communique. In informal discussions he had done his best to persuade them that recent statements by thePresident of the United States, President Johnson (particularly his speech at San Antonio in September and his State of the Unionmessage to Congress in January) indicated that the United StatesGovernment would be willing to stop bombing North Vietnam ifthey had some assurance that such action would be promptlyfollowed by a willingness on the part of the North VietnameseGovernment to embark on productive discussions in good faith andto refrain from taking advantage of the intermission in the bombingto strengthen their military position in South Vietnam. It was also possible that the statement by Mr. Trinh, the Foreign Minister of north Vietnam, on 30th December indicated a certain willingness,however guarded, by the Government of North Vietnam to respond to President Johnson&apos;s initiative. He had therefore done all he could to persuade the Soviet leaders to co-operate with us in promotingcloser contacts between the parties to the dispute in Vietnam bypublicly urging them to take advantage of the opportunities for negotiation which these statements clearly provided. But, althoughthe Soviet Government had listened attentively to our representations,
they had maintained their intransigent attitude towards the UnitedStates Government and had tried very hard to persuade us to incorporate in the final communique a form of words which wouldhave clearly implied that the United States should cease bombingNorth Vietnam but should thereafter be excluded from any part inthe settlement of the dispute. We had succeeded in resisting Sovietpressure on this point; and we had also persuaded the soviet representatives that the communique should incorporate a referenceto the responsibility which the Soviet and United kingdom governments shared in the context of Vietnam in their capacities asco-chairmen of the Geneva Conferences of 1954 and 1962. To this extent our representations must be deemed to have made an impression on the Soviet Government, however careful they might beto conceal this fact.As regards other issues of international concern, we had been in broad accord with the Soviet attitude on the situation in the middle east, where the Soviet Government, although still opposing any concession to Israel, appeared to be genuinely relieved that the conflict between Israel and the Arab States had been halted by theResolution in the Security Council of the United Nations which we ourselves had sponsored. When the discussion had turned to europe and the problem of European security, however, they had shown considerable apprehension about the development of aneo-Nazi movement in Western Germany. They had warned us totake this menace seriously and had purported to be surprised that,despite this renewed danger from Germany, we still felt able toremain a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)in which the Federal German Government played so prominent apart. In reply the Prime Minister had emphasised the defensivenature of NATO and had said that, if the Soviet fears of a revival of German militarism had any foundation in fact, they provided the strongest justification for our continuing support of NATO, since itwas only within an organisation of this kind that German ambitionscould be contained. He had felt able, however, to endorse the furtherSoviet suggestion that the Governments of the United Kingdom andthe Soviet Union should consider commissioning some preparatorystudies on the scope and character of a possible conference on european security, subject to the proviso which he had been atpains to emphasise that they could not arrogate to themselves a monopoly of concern and responsibility in this matter and that each government must therefore be free to consult its allies at all stages.In this way we should be able to prevent the United Statesinvolvement in the defence of Europe from being put in jeopardy.The discussions on topics of exclusively Anglo-Soviet concernhad, for the most part, been more relaxed and constructive; and theSoviet leaders had shown genuine interest in the expansion of tradeand technological collaboration between the two countries. Theyhad also expressed the hope that the organisations responsible for economic planning in the United Kingdom and the Soviet Unionrespectively would remain in close contact, since the preparation ofthe next Soviet five-year economic plan a process which would
secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president (C (68) 25) about the Legislative Programme for the current session. *The Lord President recalled that it had become clear by theprevious November that unless Parliament were asked to sit beyondthe end of July the Legislative Programme approved by the cabinet could not be completed. The Cabinet had asked the future legislation Committee to consider whether any Bills should be deferred to the next Session, and, if so, which. The Committee hadtaken into account that there was a good economic case for restoringto the Programme a shortened Restrictive Trade Practices Bill andthat it might be necessary to add further Bills on Immigration, air corporations and Family Allowances. It had since transpired that air Corporations could wait until the next Session and in the lightof the Governments decisions on economic measures, a FamilyLegislativeProgramme,1967-68(previous reference:CC (67) 64thConclusions,Minute 1)8753bCC 10 (68)start in about a year&apos;s time might offer scope for a furtherenlargement of Anglo-Soviet trade, provided that the soviet authorities knew in good time how far it would be worth their while to look to the United Kingdom rather than to e.g., Japan, for industrial goods.The one exception to the generally satisfactory outcome of these discussions on bilateral topics had been the case of Mr. GeraldBrooke. The Prime Minister had rejected the suggestion thatMr. Brooke should be exchanged for the two Soviet spies Kroger,who were now serving prison sentences in this country, on the groundthat the two cases were in no way comparable. He had not sought to dispute the Soviet claim that Mr. Brooke had been properly triedand condemned by a Soviet court on a criminal charge; but he had insisted that Mr. Brooke&apos;s sentence had been out of all proportion tohis offence indeed, he had been little more than the innocent butnaive tool of an irresponsible emigre organisation and British publicopinion was unable to understand why, in these circumstances, heshould have been treated with such severity. The episode waspoisoning Anglo-Soviet relations; and the Prime Minister had therefore thought it right to address a strong plea for clemency to theSoviet Government, for which he had found an appropriate occasionduring his formal visit to Mr. Podgorny, the Soviet Head of State.There had been no noticeable softening of the Soviet attitude in thismatter; but there had perhaps been a slight indication byMr. Podgorny that, provided that the Soviet Government were notsubjected to what they regarded as unjustified pressure by the british press, they might be prepared in due course to give furtherconsideration to the release of Mr. Brooke.The Cabinet (4) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers statement.
Allowances Bill would probably not be necessary. On the other hand,Immigration might well be required and a Miscellaneous ProvisionsBill would have to be introduced shortly to give effect to theGovernment^ proposals for reducing public expenditure.Nevertheless, if the proposals of the Future Legislation Committeewere adopted in their entirety and no further additions had to be madeto the Programme, it was just possible that Parliament might be ableto rise on 28th July. If, however, these conditions were not fulfilledthere would have to be an additional period of 10-14 days sitting.The Future Legislation Committee had proposed that the Post Office,Vehicle Registration, London Transport, Mines and Quarries(Amendment) and Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) II bills should be deferred, though with some reservations about london transport since postponement might impose further charges on theExchequer. They also proposed that Bills on Hovercraft, national theatre and Baltic Claims should be taken by the Second reading committee procedure instead of on the floor of the House and thatif it became necessary to defer, in addition, the Immunities and privileges Bill the provisions of that Bill which it was essential topass in the current Session to take account of the change in the status of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) should beintroduced as a separate measure by the Second Reading Committeeprocedure. Since only a limited number of Bills could secure a passage by this means, Bills in the Second Pleading Committee list should be introduced on the principle of &quot; first come, first served &quot;.In discussion the following points were made:(a) It was for consideration whether the Revenue Bill abolishing the Selective Employment Tax rebate and the export rebate shouldbe combined with the Miscellaneous Provisions Bill.(b) The postponement of the Post Office Bill would meandeferring the vesting day for four or five months, but this was acceptable.(c) While it would clearly not be possible to pass both london transport and Vehicle Registration, and there was a case forexcluding both, further consideration should be given to the questionwhether one should be retained, and if so which. It was desirable notto defer Vehicle Registration because the existing system was becoming increasingly overloaded and deferment would delay the planning necessary to bring the new registration arrangements intooperation in 1971. Moreover, it had been announced that the newcentre for registration would be in Swansea and there would be considerable local disappointment if the prospect of moreemployment in that area were deferred. On the other hand, the postponement of London Transport might mean that the exchequer would have to continue to pay grants to meet the London transport board&apos;s deficit longer than would otherwise be the case and there wasa risk that the Greater London Council would resile from their agreement to take over the Board&apos;s functions.(d) Although work on securing the safety of pit tips was being undertaken in advance of legislation, in view of the explicitrecommendation of the report of the Tribunal on the Aberfan disaster
that legislation should be introduced, it would have an unfortunate effect on public opinion in South Wales if Mines and Quarries weredeferred. If the Bill were introduced in the current session it wouldprobably be uncontroversial and it might therefore be taken throughthe Second Reading Committee procedure.(e) There was no objection to the deferment of Law Reform(Miscellaneous Provisions) 11, but one consequence would be thatthere would be greater pressure for the inclusion of law reformmeasures in the programmes for the remaining Sessions of the parliament.(/) It was arguable that National Theatre should be deferred until the next Session as a measure of economy. If it were placedin the list for the Second Reading Committee however it could betaken either this Session or early next Session in the light of whatever decision might be reached on its timing.ig) It was desirable to include Immunities and Privileges in thecurrent programme not only to provide for the changed status of theECSC but to enable the Government to implement an agreement about the immunities to be accorded to the headquarters of theInternational Maritime Consultative Organisation (IMCO) inLondon.(h) If an Immigration Bill were required, as now seemed probable, it would be necessary to take it through Parliament very quickly in order to avoid a rush of immigrants to enter the country before new barriers were introduced.(/) The Theft Bill, for which it had been intended to use theSecond Reading Committee procedure, had, by an error, been introduced in the House of Lords before the Opposition had been consulted and they had subsequently indicated that they were unwilling to agree to the use of that procedure. The Home secretary had however discussed the position with Mr. Quintin Hogg and itwas possible that the Opposition^ objection might be withdrawn.In general, however, a Bill intended for the Second reading committee procedure could not be given time on the floor of theHouse if that procedure were not adopted.(/&apos;) It was essential that in future Sessions major Bills should beintroduced at the beginning of the Session in order that the standing committees could be manned early; otherwise there would be a repetition of the serious difficulty experienced in the current Sessionof obtaining enough members to serve on Standing Committees afterthe Select Committees, service on which was considered more attractive, had been set up.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theLord President should discuss with the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Minister of Transport whether either the Vehicle RegistrationBill or the London Transport Bill could be left in the programme and consider in consultation with the Foreign Secretary whether theagreement about the IMCO headquarters necessitated the passage
of the Immunities and Privileges Bill in the current Session. It wasagreed that the Mines and Quarries Bill should be added to the listfor the Second Reading Committee. Subject to these points and tofurther consideration of the timing of the National Theatre Bill, theCabinet approved the proposals of the Future Legislation Committee.The Cabinet (1) Subject to the points made in the Prime Ministers summing up, approved the proposals in C (68) 25.(2) Invited the Lord President (i) in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Minister of Transport, to consider whethereither the Vehicle Registration Bill or the london transport Bill should be retained in the present session&apos;s programme;(ii) in consultation  with  the Foreign  Secretary, toconsider whether it was necessary that theImmunities and Privileges BiP should be passed inthe current Session.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider whetherthe Revenue Bill could be combined with the miscellaneous Provisions Bill.(4) Invited the Ministers responsible for Bills deferred from thepresent Session and for other major Bills likely to beincluded in the programme for 1968-69, to note theimportance of having their Bills ready for introduction atthe beginning of that Session.Prices andIncomesSalaries ofMembers ofNationalisedIndustries(previous references:CC (67) 62ndConclusions,Minute 3; and cc (67) 67thConclusions,Minute 5)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the chief secretary, Treasury (C (68) 3) on the salaries of members of the boards of nationalised industries.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, recalled that the Cabinet had invited him, after consultation with the Ministers concerned, to putforward proposals on the level of salaries to be paid in future to members of the boards of nationalised industries. He had helddiscussions with his colleagues about this, but it had not proved possible to put forward agreed proposals; his memorandum set outthe points of view which had been expressed. The essence of theproblem was that the level of salaries for comparable posts in private industry was broadly double the level of salaries of Board members in the nationalised industries. In this situation a number of alternative courses were open to the Government. First, they couldgrant the large increases in salaries in the nationalised industries which would be needed to make them comparable with salaries inthe private sector, and so enable them to compete effectively for theavailable managerial talent in respect of posts at both board and senior executive levels, where salary limits were determined by those
8753of board members. Second, the Government could agree to a modest increase in salaries of, say, 10 per cent; but this would havemost of the presentational disadvantages of a bigger increase andwould not go to the root of the problem; there was no support forthis course. Third, the Government could refer the issue to an outside body with the standing necessary to command support forits recommendations. The obvious body would be the national board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI), though some doubts had been expressed whether it would be appropriate for them to carry out this task since their recommendations might ultimately affect the pay ofthe members of the NBPI itself. Finally, the Government could take no action at present but leave the matter for further review in saysix months&apos; time. This was the course he recommended.In his view, at a time when wage earners generally were being asked to exercise restraint and in many cases to accept somedeterioration in their standard of living, it would be out of thequestion to introduce increases in salaries of the order of  200 aweek gross. Any increases in board salaries in the nationalised industries would have extensive repercussions on senior staff in theindustries and on the higher civil service. If the Government were torefer the issue to an outside body at the present time, they would be accused of shelving responsibility for a decision they ought themselvesto have taken, and their, action would be interpreted as favouringsubstantial increases in the salaries in question : this would be boundto have damaging repercussions on the Government^ incomes policy.The present situation was tenable: there had been a considerable gap between salaries in the nationalised industries and those in the private sector for the last 20 years, and where there was a need to secure theservices of a particular individual it was always possible to do thisby paying a salary ad hominem.In discussion there was general agreement that in the presentsituation there could be no question of granting immediate increases in board salaries. It was argued, however, that the right course wasto refer the issue to the NBPI, which would be preferable to a reference to an ad hoc body. There could be no doubt about theneed for a higher level of salaries in the nationalised industries.There was recurring difficulty in securing adequate replacements forchairmen and members of boards, and the creation of new bodiessuch as the National Freight Corporation and the National bus company would again raise this problem in an acute form. Therewas a constant loss of promising managerial talent to the private sector. Present salary levels were making it difficult to secure anymobility of management even within the nationalised industries themselves. The low level of board salaries was depressing the salaries of senior executives, creating severe anomalies and gravelydamaging morale in the industries generally. Payment of salariesad hominem was no solution since it left untouched the problem ofinadequate salaries below board level. A high level of salaries was essential if we were to secure efficient management in industries
which were vital to the performance of the economy as a whole.Higher salaries would be a more effective, and less costly, incentivefor management than any tax reductions. The gap between boardsalaries and comparable salaries in private industry had grown overthe years and, with the disclosures of directors&apos; salaries in the private sector under the new Companies Act, was increasingly becomingpublic knowledge. The problem should be tackled without delay and there should therefore be an immediate reference to the NBPI.Nothing would be gained by deferring this for six months since itwas likely that the objections to making a reference now would applyeven more strongly at that time. To enable the problem to be putin perspective and to make the reference more palatable to the tradeunions, the NBPI should be asked to investigate the salaries of topmanagement not only in the nationalised industries but also in theprivate sector. It would probably take the NBPI as much as nine months to carry out such a remit, and it would be open to theGovernment to delay action on the Board&apos;s recommendations whenthey were received.On the other hand there was substantial support for the viewthat a reference to the NBPI should not be made at the present time.It would be seen as a sign that the Government favoured highersalaries, but lacked the courage to take decisions which were properlytheir responsibility. The increase in Ministerial and judicial salaries in 1964 was constantly referred to in wage negotiations affectingmanual workers, and any impression that the Government favoured an increase in salaries for highly-paid posts would make it impossibleto secure wage restraint, to which there was already greater resistancethan at the time of the wage freeze in 1966. If the issue were referredto the NBPI, the Board would almost certainly recommendsubstantial increases in salaries; it would scarcely help if at the sametime they were to recommend a reduction of excessive salaries nowpaid in the private sector since such a recommendation would have little effect. If the NBPI recommended increases in salaries at this level, the confidence of the trade unions in the Board would be gravely undermined. The Government would not be in a positionto allow substantial salary increases in the nationalised industries atthe time the NBPI could be expected to report, nor indeed for some considerable time after that; and it would therefore be wrong inthese circumstances to make a reference now.In further discussion the following points were made (a) the level of pensions for board members was an important factor in recruiting and retaining the right people in the nationalised industries. There should be an immediate review within theGovernment of pension provisions for senior staff in these industries.(b) At present the Treasury were not prepared to allow paymentof the final increments in certain salary scales for senior staff in the nationalised industries. The position would be somewhat eased ifthese increments could be paid.(c) There might be a case for arrangements wherebyrecommendations on top salaries in the nationalised industriesbecame the responsibility of an impartial body.
AircraftIndustryConcorde:ProductionFinance(previous reference:CC (68) 2ndConclusions)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of technology (C (68) 27) on the legislative provision required for financing production of the Concorde aircraft.The Minister of Technology said that, following the Cabinefsdecisions on 5th January about the Concorde project, he had discussed with the Chief Secretary, Treasury, the Attorney-Generaland the Legal Adviser to the Foreign Office, the question of theconditions we should seek to agree with the French Government forcontinuance of the project beyond the spring or early summer of1969. Arrangements were in hand to communicate agreed conditions to the French. It had been decided that when the industrial expansion Bill was published, it should not include the clauseauthorising the provision of production finance for Concorde, sincethe additional financial commitment might have been ill receivedif it had been made public at a time when major cuts in public expenditure were being announced. He now recommended, however,in agreement with his colleagues, that the clause should be restored to the Bill at Committee stage. It was the opinion of the Law officers that, as preparations for production of the aircraft gained momentum,constitutional practice and proprieties required specific legislative powers to be taken.

It was suggested,however, that it would give rise to criticism in Parliament if the clausewere restored at Committee stage without adequate warning. Itwould be important at Second Reading to be completely candid withthe House about the Government^ intentions. It would be desirableat that stage to make it clear that the Bill was drafted so as to enableprovision for production finance to be included, to indicate the sumthat would be involved, and to say that negotiations were proceeding with the French and that a statement would be made at a later stage-on the floor of the House as distinct from a statement in Committee-as to the inclusion of the relevant clause.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the course proposed by the Minister of Technology;the Minister should however consult the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Lord President on a form of words foreshadowing therestoration of the clause on production finance to be used at SecondReading of the Industrial Expansion Bill.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the clause providing for production finance forthe Concorde project should be restored to the industrial expansion Bill at Committee stage.(2) Invited the Minister of Technology to consult the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Lord President on a form of words about the inclusion of the clause to be used on theSecond Reading of the Bill.ScotlandStormDamage(previous reference:CC (68) 9thConclusions,Minute 3)confidential.

TheGovernment financial assistance so far available amounted however to only  200,000. In the light of his previous undertakings to giveGovernment help and of the fact that it was difficult to ensure rapidrepairs so long as doubt persisted about responsibility for payment,this figure might be criticised as inadequate.
