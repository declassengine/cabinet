public expenditure:Post-devaluationmeasures(previous reference:CC (68) 2ndConclusions)Transport:Roads(PreviousReferenceCC (67) 67thConclusions,Minute 4)SECRET - -3-CC 3 (68)secret the Cabinet resumed their discussion of the post-devaluationmeasures proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in C (68) 5.The Minister of Transport said that the reductions in the roads programme proposed in C (68) 5 would represent a cut of nearly 10per cent. This followed successive cuts over the last two years whichhad been more extensive than cuts over the same period in other fields. While the roads programme could make a contribution, the cuts in the form proposed would fall on the wrong elements in theprogramme. Expenditure on roads by local authorities would under existing policies be greater in 1968-69 than expenditure by the centralGovernment. Local authority expenditure comprised work onsecondary roads and also a far greater element of maintenance thancentral Government expenditure: it was in these fields that therewas scope for economies, rather than on the strategic road networkwhich was vital for the economy. Local authority expenditure on roads was largely outside the Governments control and restrictionson the level of the rate support grant could not be relied on to ensurethat the proposed economies were obtained. Of the proposed reductions in her Departments programme for England in 1968-69,only a small proportion could be secured by economies on minorworks, and the effect would be that major schemes to the value of 110 million would have to be deferred in order to secure thenecessary saving in that year. If the cut were implemented it wouldnot be possible to start some of these schemes at all within the life of the present roads programme. A major part of the defermentswould affect development schemes and communications to the ports,which were vital to our economic effort. It would be particularly difficult to defend this at a time when there would be considerableParliamentary criticism of the wear-and-tear charge on heavy roadvehicles which would shortly be introduced. In order to redress thebalance between reductions in her Departments programme andthose in local authority expenditure, she proposed that the formershould be confined to a cut of  6 million in 1968-69 which wouldmean deferment in that year of schemes to the value of  20 million.At the same time, the Government should introduce legislation tocontrol the rate support grant in such a way as to ensure that theproposed 15 per cent reduction in local authority expenditure on roads was secured; this would produce a saving of  47-7 million in1968-69, and might also be so framed as to guarantee that the cutswhich the Government sought in local authority expenditure on other services would be secured.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that the scope for reductions in expenditure on roads by local authorities should notbe exaggerated; there were limits to the extent to which expenditure
on maintenance could be cut, and a greater part of local authority expenditure was on schemes which were already in progress. Theproposed cuts would have a serious effect on major roaddevelopment and on employment in the construction industry inScotland. The reduction proposed for Scotland amounted toone-fifth of the corresponding reduction for England, and was four times the size of the cut for Wales even though roads expenditurein Scotland was only double that in Wales. This was disproportionate,and the reduction in the Scottish programme should be smaller.The Secretary of State for Wales said that the distribution ofcuts in the roads programme should be related to the governments policies for enabling the development areas to make a balancedcontribution to economic growth. Road communications were ofthe first importance in attracting new industry to Wales, and it was essential to go ahead at least with modest schemes if economic development in Wales was not to be prejudiced. In judging whetherthe proposed cuts in the roads programme in Wales were in proportion with the cuts in Scotland and England, it was necessaryto bear in mind that the Welsh programme inherited from theprevious administration had been inadequate. He recognised,however, the overriding need to achieve economies which in theaggregate would amount to what the Chancellor of the exchequer proposed, and he was prepared to find the necessary total savings from the expenditure under his control, taking roads and all other services together, provided he was given discretion, in discussion withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, as to the way in which the total was made up: this would enable him, if it seemed desirable, tosecure somewhat smaller savings than those proposed on roads, withcorrespondingly greater savings on other programmes.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the cuts he proposed should not entail deferment of major schemes to the extentsuggested by the Minister of Transport.   Of the total cut in theprogramme for England of  15 million in 1968-69, it should bepossible to obtain some  6-75 million from savings on minor improvements and maintenance; slippage in the programme mightaccount for a further  3-25 million.   Deferment of new starts to Ithe extent of some  60 million in 1968-69 should be sufficient to make up the balance; this would represent some 20 per cent of the itotal of new starts planned for that year, which was reasonable having I regard to the rate at which expenditure on roads was increasing.  He Iaccepted that there was scope for considerable economies in localauthority expenditure, but the most practical method of securing these was to limit rate support grant in the way proposed in his memorandum.   In particular, if the grant were not adjusted at the recommend of 1968 to take account of price rises in that year, this should isecure savings of between  30 and  50 million in 1968-69; this would Ibe done v/ithout delays which would be involved in new legislation Ion the rate support grant and the attendant consultations with the local authorities.   He recognised that the cut proposed in the Iprogramme for Scotland seemed at first sight to be disproportionate Hand he would consider this further.   He was also ready to discuss I
with the Secretary of State for Wales some flexibility as betweensavings on roads and savings in other fields, on the assumption thattotal savings from all services in Wales would still be secured of theamount proposed in his memorandum.In discussion there was general support for the reductionsproposed in C (68) 5, subject to the points made by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer in respect of the cuts in Scotland and Wales, though itwas suggested that the reductions would involve the deferment of major schemes in 1968-69 to the value of some  70 million ratherthan the  60 million mentioned by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.In implementing the reductions, special regard should be paid to theimportance of road communications serving development areas,particularly those parts of the development areas which would be most affected by colliery closures.The First Secretary of State, summing up this part of thediscussion, said that the Cabinet approved the cuts proposed inC (68) 5 in the roads programme for England and Wales, subject tothe Secretary of State for Wales being free, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to make somewhat smaller reductions in expenditure on roads provided that the total proposed savings on roads and other services in Wales taken together were secured. TheChancellor of the Exchequer should consider with the Secretary ofState for Scotland whether a smaller reduction than that proposedin the roads programme for Scotland would be justified, and should inform the Cabinet of the result. The Cabinet would be consideringthe rate support grant at a later stage in their review and could then take account of the points affecting the grant which had been madein discussion.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider with theSecretary of State for Scotland the case for a smallerreduction in the roads programme for Scotland than that proposed in C (68) 5.(2) Approved the proposed reduction in the roads programme for Wales, subject to consideration of some flexibilitybetween the roads programme and other expenditure in wales, as indicated by the First Secretary of State in his summing up.(3) Subject to the Conclusions at (1) and (2) above, approved the reductions in the roads programme, including the reductions in expenditure by the local authoritiesproposed in C (68) 5.The Minister of Transport said that the Chancellor of theExchequer proposed to place limits of  10 million in 1968-69 and 20 million in 1969-70 on expenditure on the new grants to publicpassenger transport arising from the provisions of the forthcomingTransport Bill. It had been suggested that the reductions in expenditure which these limitations would imply would not be
severe because expenditure on the new grant would be less than hadbeen originally estimated; but this was only because the cuts in investment in the nationalised industries which had been announcedimmediately after devaluation had made it impossible to take up thefull allocation for the grants. The reductions in the roads programme which the Cabinet had just approved made it all themore important that schemes to facilitate the rapid transit of passengers in the conurbations should go ahead. But under theproposed limits, no funds would be available for such schemes in1968-69 and only some  3-5 million in the following year. Thiswould mean a serious delay in action to relieve congestion in the major cities. If the limit were increased to  25 million for 1969-70,this would enable at least some of the more important schemes toproceed.In discussion it was the general view that the limits on expenditure were justified, having regard to the cuts being made inother fields. It was recognised, however, that it would be desirableto minimise the effect of the cuts on schemes to relieve congestion inthe conurbations; it might, for example, be possible to do this by making bigger reductions in expenditure on grants for there-equipment of bus fleets.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet endorsed the proposals in C (68) 5 to limit the grants under this head to  10 million in 1968-69 and  20 million in 1969-70.It would be open to the Minister of Transport to decide how she would distribute the necessary reductions, taking account of thepoints made in discussion; she should inform the Cabinet of herproposals.The Cabinet (4) Approved the proposals in C (68) 5 for limits on new formsof assistance to public transport of  10 million in 1968-69and  20 million in 1969-70.(5) Invited the Minister of Transport to circulate a memorandum,as indicated in the Prime Minister^ summing up, on herproposals for distributing grants within the totals at (4).Channel Tunnel The Cabinet were informed that the bulk of the expenditureon the Channel Tunnel was expected to come from private sources.Expenditure in any case would not become substantial before 1971,and the Government would not be committed to a rising curve ofexpenditure in future years before they had considered the reportfrom the Anglo-French official team later in the year.The Home Secretary said that the proposal to reduce expenditure on Home Department services by  6 million in 1968-69and  12 million in 1969-70 was unrealistic. He was prepared toreduce capital expenditure on prisons by abandoning starts on newprisons, including the maximum security prison at Alvington; butallowing for this and for cuts which he proposed to make in expenditure on the fire service, the greater part of the economieswould have to be found from the police.   He proposed to have police(previous reference:CC (66) 36thConclusions,Minute 2)HomeDepartmentServices(previous reference :CC (67) 47thConclusions)
- - 7CC 3 (68)establishments, which at present differed substantially as betweenareas of apparently comparable size and circumstances, examinedon a scientific basis; but while he would attempt by persuasion tohold the numbers of the police at their present level, he had no legalpower to prevent a police authority from recruiting the number ofmen which they considered necessary to discharge their responsibilityfor the maintenance of law and order. He could not agree thatwith the number of indictable offences, and particularly of offences of violence against the person, still rising, the number of policemenshould be allowed to fall. The proposed reductions to  6 million and  12 million in expenditure for the next two years could not however be achieved without an actual reduction in the numbers ofthe police and he considered that more realistic figures would be 3 million and  8 million respectively.In discussion it was pointed out that in the public expenditurereview in July 1967 it had been hoped to obtain reductions undermiscellaneous heads, including the Home Department services, whichhad not in the event materialised; and the cuts in expenditure nowproposed were small in proportion to those asked for in other fields.With the improved pay and equipment now available to the police,recruitment had improved and it was important to ensure that policeestablishments were realistic. Large increases in the actual numberof men in. some forces might no longer be necessary.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet accepted the proposed cuts of  6 million and  12million in 1968-69 and 1969-70 respectively but would be preparedto consider the matter again if savings on this scale would necessitatean actual reduction in the total number of serving policemen. TheHome Secretary should therefore submit a paper urgently on possible means of finding the proposed savings in expenditure on the home department services without a reduction in the number of police. Heshould indicate the extent of his powers to control policeestablishments and actual numbers, and, if the powers were inadequate, the legislation which would be necessary to strengthenthem.The Cabinet (6) Accepted the proposed reduction in expenditure on theHome Department services of  6 million and  12 million in 1968-69 and 1969-70 respectively, subject to later consideration of a memorandum to be circulated by theHome Secretary on the lines indicated in the PrimeMinister^ summing up.The Home Secretary said that he accepted the proposal to putcivil defence on a care and maintenance basis with a consequentsaving of  14 million in 1968-69 and  20 million in 1969-70.The Secretary of State for Defence pointed out that the proposal would inevitably lead to the abolition of the home defence force,contrary to the undertaking which had been given in the debates on
Space Policy:. , - ,(previous reference:CC (67) 46thConclusions,Minute 3)the Reserve Forces Bill, and would consequently attract criticism.Nevertheless he accepted the proposal. The maintenance of civil defence in this country on the existing scale was not a significantelement in the deterrence of nuclear aggression.The Minister of Technology said that he accepted the proposal in paragraph 38 of C (68) 5 to cut the contingency provision for aircraft projects (other than Concorde) not yet approved, on theunderstanding that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would accept that a Supplementary Estimate might, in the event, prove necessary.It was arguable that if it were possible to withdraw from our commitment to the European Launcher Development Organisation(ELDO) this would be preferable to the discontinuance of the black arrow project, but although we had been able to limit our commitment to ELDO we had so far been advised that we could notwithdraw without breach of Treaty obligations. On the proposedcut of  10 million in 1968-69 and a further  10 million in the following year, he had already been able to save  6-65 million in 1968-69by reducing work in areas not directly related to the technologicalsupport of industry; but it would not be possible to obtain the further 3-35 million in this field without discontinuing projects which madea vital contribution to the country&apos;s economic performance ingeneral and were incidentally stimulating growth in the development areas in which some of the projects had been located.In discussion it was suggested that in view of the failure on two occasions of the French component of the ELDO launcher rocket,it would be worth considering again whether there was any possibilityof withdrawing from the project. There might also be room for afurther reduction of the expenditure on defence research undertaken by the Ministry of Technology, particularly in the aero-space field.Other contributions to the  10 million saving required under the heading of Government research and technological support might also be found without detriment to vital projects by a slowerdevelopment in regional and information services and by defermentof the new administrative office for the computer centre.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet agreed that the total savings proposed by theChancellor of the Exchequer should be made, but furtherconsideration should be given to the possibility of withdrawal fromELDO, which might provide savings either in addition to or in substitution for those which could be made by the discontinuance ofthe Black Arrow project, and to the possibility of finding savings on defence research rather than on projects directly related to industrialdevelopment.The Cabinet (7) Agreed, subject to further consideration of the possibility of withdrawl from ELDO, that the total savings proposedin paragraphs 38 to 40 of C (68) 5 should be found fromMinistry of Technology votes.
(8) Invited the Minister of Technology (a) in consultation with the other Ministers principally concerned and the Attorney-General, to submit amemorandum on the possibility in presentcircumstances of withdrawing from participation inELDO;(b) in consultation with the Secretary of State for defence to consider the possibility of obtaining some saving in expenditure on defence research to offset againstthe savings of  3-35 million still to be found in expenditure on Government research and technological support.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he recommended thatin 1968-69 payments of investment grants should be made in respectof expenditure incurred in four previous quarters instead of five as originally proposed. He did not recommend reducing to three quarters in 1968-69 because of the possibly serious adverse effects on industrial investment. He proposed no change from the original estimates for investment grants for 1969-70. Investment grants wereto a large extent a book-keeping addition to the total of public expenditure. The investment allowances, which the grants hadreplaced, had not figured in total public expenditure because theywere reductions in taxation. He intended to make this point clearwhen the cuts in public expenditure were presented.The Cabinet (9) Agreed that in 1968-69 payment of investment grants shouldbe limited to investment made in four previous quartersinstead of five as originally proposed.The Minister of Agriculture said that the contribution whichagriculture could make to import saving had been publiclyacknowledged by Ministers on several occasions since devaluation.It was not possible to decide now, in the absence of most of the relevant data, either the amount of public expenditure on agricultureat which they should aim in the next two years or the general principles which should be adopted in determining this amount. an interdepartmental official committee was now examining whether our objectives for agricultural production should be altered as aresult of devaluation. Their report, which was obviously crucial to decisions in this sector, would be available in two or three weeks andshould then be discussed in the Ministerial Committee on Agriculture.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he agreed that atpresent in this field no figure could be put into public expenditurein the next two years. But he pointed out that the estimate of  290million for agricultural support made in the previous summer had recently been revised to  318 million, without allowing for any increase as a result of the 1968 Farm Price Review. He proposedthat they should adopt two principles in the forthcoming Farm price review.  First, the farmers should be required to absorb at least
DevelopmentAreaExpenditureSelectiveEmploymentTaxAdditionalPayments andRegionalEmploymentPremiumhalf of the increased costs which by then would have been recorded,Second, that the total increase in the value of the guarantees shouldnot exceed the remainder of the cost increases. If the cost increasesamounted to, say,  40 million, and  20 million were absorbed by the farmers as he proposed, there would still be a net gain of something like  10 million for the farmers because productivity increases couldbe expected to raise their incomes next year by  30 million. He was ready to examine the general position further in the light ofthe interdepartmental report but the two principles which he hadpropounded should be accepted now. It must be recognised that wecould not afford disproportionate increases in public expenditure to save imports.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat no policy decisions or estimates of public expenditure in respectof agriculture should be announced in the forthcoming statement oncuts in public expenditure. There should be an opportunity for theCabinet to discuss the general principles underlying future agricultural policy and objectives before the Ministerial Committee on Agriculturereached the stage of making recommendations on the basis of the interdepartmental report by officials. The latter should provide,inter alia, estimates of the reduction in the current estimate of thecost of agricultural support for 1968-69 which would result from therise in sterling commodity prices following devaluation.The Cabinet (10) Agreed that the forthcoming announcement of reductions in public expenditure should contain no policy decisionor estimate of public expenditure in respect of agriculture.(11) Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange that theCabinet had an opportunity to discuss the general principles underlying future agricultural policy and objectives before the Ministerial Committee on agriculture made recommendations on this subject.(12) Invited the Minister of Agriculture to arrange that thereport by the interdepartmental committee of officials on future agricultural objectives contained estimates ofthe effect on the cost of agricultural support of increases in sterling commodity prices following devaluation.The Prime Minister said that there was general agreement withthe proposal by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to leave the present planned expenditure on assistance to development areas unchanged.There should, however, be a comprehensive review in due course ofthe existing measures of support for development areas in order toexamine, for example, whether savings might be made in some formsof expenditure and in some areas of the country in order to increasepayments, within the existing total, elsewhere. This further reviewof development area policy might heed to be made in conjunctionwith the review of Government policy towards the &quot; grey &quot; ares which would presumably need to wait on the report from TheCommittee appointed, under the chairmanship of Sir Joseph Hunt,to examine the underlying economic problems of the &quot; grey &quot; areas.
environmental services(previous reference:CC (67) 50thConclusions,Minute 3)OtherExpenditureThe Cabinet-(13) Agreed that present planned expenditure on assistance to development areas should remain unchanged.(14) Invited the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs toconsider the timing and scope of a comprehensive reviewof Government policy towards development and &quot; grey &quot;areas on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that the cuts proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in otherenvironmental services would involve reductions in England of  23million and  24 million in 1968-69 and 1969-70 respectively. these were the fourth set of cuts which the Government had made in this sector. Nevertheless he was prepared to accept them. Most of thepresent reduction would fall on public parks and baths.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that he had had no opportunity of considering what these proposals involved forScotland; but expenditure of this sort was very small in Scotland andin the circumstances he would find it difficult to accept cuts.The Secretary of State for Wales said he accepted theChancellor^ proposals. His main concern in this sector was thatclearance of pit tips should continue at a reasonable pace and hethought that this would still be possible.In discussion it was suggested that the reclamation of derelictland could make an important contribution at relatively small cost tothe attraction of new industries to development areas and to &quot; grey &quot;areas. At present local authorities in development areas received agrant of 85 per cent of the cost of such reclamation, but the grantselsewhere, including the &quot; grey &quot; areas, were limited to 50 per cent and an increase would require legislation.The Cabinet (15) Approved the reduction in expenditure on otherenvironmental services proposed in paragraph 53 ofC (68) 5.Railways Deficit Grant, Employment, Industry and Trade andFinancial Administration.common services andMiscellaneousExpenditure(previous reference:CC (68) 2ndConclusions)The Cabinet (16) Approved the proposals in paragraphs 55, 56 and 57 ofC (68) 5.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the largest item here was Northern Ireland expenditure which would be affected in come degree by the cuts in expenditure which they had agreed under otherheadings. There was continuing discussion with the NorthernIreland Government about the financial assistance provided to them.It would obviously be difficult to ask for, or to find, any substantialcuts from Northern Ireland at a time when it was proposed to
maintain unchanged the expenditure programmes for development areas in Great Britain. In any event, major changes in the amountof assistance provided would involve major political decisions.The Secretary of State for Education and Science said that hehad examined further, as requested by the Cabinet at their meetingon 5th January, the scope for further savings in university and research council expenditure. As a result of devaluation the callson the research councils&apos; income would rise by  2-2 million a year.He was prepared to accept in addition a cut of  1 million in their financial aid in 1969-70. He was also prepared to agree to areduction in capital expenditure by the universities of  T5 million and  5 million in 1968-69 and 1969-70 respectively. The reduction would be achieved by postponing starts on  20 million out of  30million of intended new capital expenditure. He did not expect thatthis postponement would lead to any reduction in universityadmissions but it would cause the universities to use their existing capital more intensively. There would be no cut in expenditure onthe Open University, but this expenditure would be very small in thenext two years. Finally, instead of holding expenditure by the arts council to  8 milion in each of the next two years, he proposed thatit should be  7-75 million in 1968-69 and  8-25 million in 1969-70.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Chief Secretary, Treasury, should examine now the possibilityof cuts in financial assistance for Northern Ireland other than supportof the development area type, for example assistance forenvironmental services. He would discuss in due course with theHome Secretary the evolution of existing political and financial relations between the Government and the Northern ireland government. There was general agreement that the further cutsaffecting the universities and the research councils, proposed by theSecretary of State for Education and Science, should be accepted.The Secretary of State for Defence should examine how farexpenditure on &quot; other military defence &quot; was already committed orwhether some savings might be made.The Cabinet (17) Took note with approval of the summing up by the PrimeMinister of this part of their discussion.(18) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to examine thepossibility of reductions in expenditure on NorthernIreland on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister andto report his conclusions to the Cabinet at their meetingon Friday, 12th January.(19) Agreed to a reduction of  1 million in 1969-70 in financial aid for research councils.(20) Agreed to reductions in capital expenditure by the universities of  1 -5 million and  5 million in 1968-69 and1969-70 respectively.(21) Agreed that the grants for the Arts Council should be 7-75 million and  8-25 million in 1968-69 and 1969-70.
(22) Invited the Secretary of State for Defence to examine whatscope there was for reductions in the expenditure shown under &quot; other military defence&quot; in paragraph 61 ofC (68) 5 and to report his conclusions to the Cabinet attheir meeting on Friday, 12th January.(23) Subject to (18) and (21) above, approved the proposals inparagraphs 58-62 of C (68) 5.The Minister of Public Building and Works said that hiscolleagues should appreciate the effect on the construction industry of the reductions they had approved in various fields. There wouldbe a very substantial reduction in the demands made on the industry by the public sector. If all the slack thus created were to be taken up by new industrial building, the latter would probably need to expand by some 30 per cent. If work for the private sector did not take up the slack, there was a possibility that substantialunemployment, perhaps of the order of 10 per cent, would develop in the construction industry by the autumn of 1968.In discussion some doubt was expressed whether unemploymentin the industry was likely to rise to this level. The reductions whichthe Cabinet had agreed represented in the main a holding back of increased demand on the industry which would otherwise have takenplace, rather than a reduction in the present level of demand. Bythe autumn of 1968 industry, particularly in the export field, shouldbe recovering strongly and a considerable increase in new industrial building could be expected. If there were a reduction in employmentin the construction industry, it seemed likely that those affectedwould readily find employment in other industries. However, itwould be helpful to the Cabinet to have an assessment of the implications for the construction industry of the reductions in public expenditure as a whole.The Cabinet (24) Invited the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, inconsultation with the Minister of Public Building and works, to circulate a memorandum on the implications of the proposed reductions in public expenditure for theconstruction industry.The Prime Minister said that they should now be in a positionto complete their review and take the necessary decisions about public expenditure cuts by Monday, 15th January. Accordinglyarrangements should now be made to recall the House of commons on Tuesday, 16th January, when the Governmenfs proposals wouldbe announced for a debate on the economic measures on the followingWednesday and Thursday and the deferment of the debate on foreignaffairs to the following week. The House of Lords should be recalled on 22nd January. Meanwhile they would continue the irreview at meetings on 11th and 12th January and, if necessary, on15th and 16th January as well.
