CabinetSecurity ofMinisterialDiscussions(previous reference:CC (68) 20thConclusions,Minute 1)CONFIDENTIAL*1. The Prime Minister said that, while he had been heartenedby the unity of the Cabinet in the face of the disturbing political andfinancial rumours which had been in circulation over the previousweekend, there had been certain allegations in the Press (apparentlyderived from recent Ministerial discussions on long-term economic strategy) which purported to reveal a serious breach between theMinisters primarily concerned. The Cabinet were well aware thatthere was no truth in these allegations: although the Ministers inquestion represented different interests, which were inevitablyincompatible from time to time, they were in fact working in closeaccord. It was no less disturbing, however, that he had beeninformed by several Ministers that a member of the Cabinet waslending his authority to a forecast that another financial crisis would occur in March, and that briefing of the Press and individual members of Parliament in a sense likely to destroy confidence in theGovernment had occurred on a considerable scale in the previousfew days. The Cabinet must realise that conduct of this kind was at variance with all the conventions of collective responsibility andloyalty between colleagues and that, if it continued, he would have no alternative, without further warning or further discussion, toreconstructing the Cabinet.NucleatePolicy:CivilApplicationsGas CentrifugeDevelopmentandCollaboration(previous reference:CC (68) 47thConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Technology and the Minister of State for Foreign and commonwealth Affairs (C (68) 124) on Nuclear Energy: CivilApplications. They were given a presentation by the Chairman ofthe Atomic Energy Authority, Dr. J. M. Hill, on the principles,relative costs and implications of producing enriched uranium by the gas centrifuge method rather than by the diffusion process at present used at Capenhurst, and on the state of development that had beenreached with the centrifuge process.The Minister of Technology said that a decision was required on whether to approve the Agreed Minutes on Gas CentrifugeCollaboration which had been adopted, ad referendum to governments, at a meeting between Dutch, German and british ministers held at The Hague on 25th November, 1968. There was already a clear European commitment to produce enriched uraniumfor civil nuclear power programmes which would not be alteredwhether or not we decided to collaborate with European countries oncentrifuges. The progress which it was believed that the Dutch and germans had made in centrifuge development offered us anopportunity to collaborate with them, thereby further improving theprospect of reducing the risks and costs of our own programme and improving our prospects of selling reactor systems.  If we did not9686A 2
work with the Germans and Dutch, they would go ahead bilaterallyas they had intended to do before we suggested tripartite collaboration.The Attorney-General had given his opinion that the proposedcollaboration would not be incompatible with our obligations underthe Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) provided that it was subject to appropriate safeguards. The Dutch and Germans regardedcollaboration with us on a gas centrifuge programme as a majorEuropean project which should be based on an enduring and equalpartnership and which should cover research and development, themanufacture of centrifuges, and the operation of centrifuge plants.He had stressed to Dutch and German Ministers that it was important for the collaboration to be primarily of an industrialcharacter, although he had accepted that political supervision wouldalso be necessary. He had also drawn attention to the fact that ourown large market for enriched uranium, unlike markets in Germanyand Holland, was under Government control, and he had made it plain that we would not be willing to co-operate on a basis which leftour market committed to the products of a tripartite organisationwhereas their markets were not. The declassification of centrifugetechnology need not arise in the proposed collaboration in the nearfuture. In view of Dutch and German opposition, he had not pressed our earlier wish to associate Italy with the proposedcollaboration, which v/ould therefore be confined to countries whichwere parties to a quadripartite understanding with the United Statesabout classification of centrifuge technology. There remained theissue of agreeing with the United States whether any information which we might wish to exchange with the Dutch and Germans owedanything to our earlier exchanges of information with the UnitedStates, but this seemed likely to be less difficult than had earlier been thought. He recommended that the Cabinet should approve the agreed Minutes of the meeting at The Hague, so that a tripartite meeting of officials could take place on 19th December in preparation for a Ministerial meeting in February next year.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that there wouldbe political advantages in co-operating with Holland and germany in an industrial venture which made sense commercially instead ofinvolving expenditure with no worthwhile return. Discussions withthe United States about the proposed collaboration had not so farcaused any difficulties; and it did not seem that the remaining problemabout classification should be insoluble. Anxiety that our proposedcollaboration would render our partners capable of producing nuclearmaterial which might be used in nuclear weapons was misplaced : they already had that capability. Indeed, our collaboration with them would be an improvement in terms of the NPT. We should therefore approve the Agreed Minutes.In discussion it was argued that insufficient information was yet available for us to commit ourselves, as the Agreed Minutescontemplated that we should, to a tripartite collaborative programmeextending to the operation of centrifuge enrichment plants. It mightbe to our advantage to proceed unilaterally, at least on the building and operation of such plants and the sale of their products. It would
therefore be preferable to proceed by stages in any collaborativearrangement and to retain our freedom of action. We must not get into a situation in which we had to contribute to the cost of building a centrifuge enrichment plant in Holland to supply us with fissile material instead of being able to build one ourselves. The AgreedMinutes should at least be amended to make it clear that we were interested only in an arrangement that was economically viable. Onthe other hand, it was argued that there was no prospect of reaching a collaborative agreement with the Dutch and Germans if they thought that we were concerned to gain knowledge of the work thatthey had done on centrifuges only in order to exploit it ourselves.All three Governments would be feeling their way as negotiationsproceeded in order to establish whether a collaborative agreement wasworthwhile to them.As regards classification of information about centrifuges, it wasagreed that we should resist any attempt to widen the proposedcollaboration beyond Holland and Germany. This was of importanceboth generally and for our relations in the nuclear field with theUnited States, who were particularly concerned to slow down the inevitable spread of information about the centrifuge. It was important that this should be done, at least until the NPT had gainedgeneral acceptance. Provided that we maintained close contact withthe United States about the proposed collaboration, it seemed likely that we should achieve our objectives without damaging our bilateralrelationship with them. It had to be borne in mind, however, thatit was open to the United States to flood the market with enricheduranium from their large stocks at prices below those which couldbe achieved economically in a centrifuge plant.In further discussion, there was general agreement that we oughtto attempt to persuade Germany to ratify the NPT, and that it shouldbe a condition of any collaborative arrangement that the parties to itshould undertake not to use the products for weapons purposes.Signature of the treaty should not be made a condition of collaboration, however, and the fact that Germany entered into acollaborative programme with us instead of going ahead alone or in collaboration with Holland would itself be some safeguard.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the Agreed Minutes of the meeting about GasCentrifuge Collaboration which had been adopted, ad referendum to governments, by Dutch, German and British Ministers at The Hagueon 25th November, 1968. In conveying our agreement to the dutch and German Governments, it should, however, again be stressed, inclarification of the Agreed Minutes, that we were prepared to collaborate only in arrangements that were commercially viable. Wemust also ensure that we secured our freedom to set up a gascentrifuge plant of our own in this country if we wished, andwe should bear this requirement in mind when the time came to exchange detailed technical information. It was important that weshould keep in close touch with the United States as negotiations
with Holland and Germany progressed and, for classification reasons,we should limit the proposed collaboration to these two countries,leaving for consideration at a later stage the possibility that othercountries might be associated in some way with it. We should press the German Government to sign the NPT and in this context usecould be made of the proposed gas centrifuge collaboration. But weshould not make their signature of the treaty a condition of this-collaboration. The Minister of Technology should keep theChancellor of the Exchequer closely informed of the costs likely to arise from the proposed collaboration and the sources of financethat were in mind.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.OverseaPolicyNigeria(previous reference:CC (68) 49thConclusions,Minute 2)SECRET*3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum (C (68) 126)by the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary. -The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the centralissue was that set out in paragraph 5 of his paper, namely the peril toAfrica as a whole of tribal secessions which could in the long run leadto the break-up of every African State. While we had other importantinterests in Nigeria 16,000 British subjects were resident there, andour economic stake was an important one the issue of territorial integrity, which had repeatedly been brought out in the House ofCommons and was the real reason why we were opposed to the rebellion, was the dominant problem. It had, however, been consistently under-estimated by public opinion. We were now facedwith a situation where deep feeling had been aroused in parliament and the country generally about the war and the starvation resultingfrom it; and it was necessary to show respect for that feeling. He didnot think there was any reason to believe that by altering our policy we could stop either the killing or the starvation. Indeed, the contrarymight be the case. So far as relief was concerned, the federal authorities had been helpful, whereas Colonel Ojukwu, the Biafranleader, had been the contrary. If we were now to reverse our policy,we might well forfeit Federal co-operation. The right course wastherefore to continue the policy we had been pursuing, side by side with an increased effort to get relief supplies into Biafra and secure a cease-fire. With this in mind, the Minister of State for Foreign and commonwealth Affairs, Lord Shepherd, had been sent to Lagos, andthe Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth Affairs, Mr. Maurice Foley, would shortly be leaving for Addis Ababa. It was important that these two missions shouldbe concurrent, since the prospects of a settlement would been dangered if the Emperor of Ethiopia and the Organisation for african Unity (OAU), which was considering a fresh initiative,
thought they were being by-passed. Lord Shepherd would attemptto secure the agreement of General Gowon, the Head of the FederalMilitary Government, not only to a land corridor for relief supplies(which he had already accepted) but to some form of international supervision of the corridor. This would be necessary to meetColonel Ojukwu&apos;s fears that the Federal Government might exploit the corridor for military purposes. Lord Shepherd would also broachwith General Gowon and his colleagues the possibility of a cease-fire.In this connection, the suggestion had been made of a Christmas truce.General Gowon would also be informed of the approaches beingmade in Addis Ababa. For his part, Mr. Foley would try to find out more about the OAU&apos;s planned initiative; would reassure theEmperor that it was not our intention to ignore the role which couldbe played by the OAU; would see whether the Emperor could suggest any ways of bringing pressure to bear on Colonel Ojukwu; and would urge the Emperor to do what he could to modify the present french attitude in regard to arms supplies to Biafra. With regard to apossible approach to Colonel Ojukwu, there had already been someindirect contacts. Colonel Ojukwu might be ready to meet a british minister, but only in Biafran territory. There were grave objectionsto this, and any meeting between a British Minister and colonel ojukwu could take place only if General Gowon&apos;s consent had previously been obtained. Consideration should therefore be givento what contacts at Ministerial level could be established with colonel ojukwu. In the foreign affairs debate on Thursday, 12th December,he would propose to explain the reasons for our policy, stressing thepoint in regard to secession made in paragraph 5 of his paper. Hewould then deal with the problems of relief and a cease-fire and refer to the missions undertaken by Lord Shepherd and Mr. Foleyrespectively. What he could add to this would depend on what progress Lord Shepherd and Mr. Foley could make in the next fewdays.The Prime Minister said that it would be advisable for theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s speech to lay strongemphasis on the relief aspect of our initiative. The fact that we werekeeping in touch with the OAU should also be stressed. If it were possible to secure a Christmas truce this might be extended until theCommonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting, which might play a usefulrole, especially since supporters of both sides would be present at it.The Nigerian question had aroused profound feeling in the country,in Parliament, and indeed in the Cabinet itself. It could give rise toa political and Parliamentary crisis of the utmost gravity. TheGovernment might be defeated in the House, largely by the votes ofits own supporters and perhaps even on a vote of confidence, withincalculable repercussions on sterling, on our whole economicsituation, and on the future of the Government itself. Even if theGovernment survived a crisis of this kind, to be forced to changedirection on a major issue of foreign policy like this would reduce the credibility of the Government in every sphere not least the economicone, in which vital decisions must shortly be taken.  The Nigerian
situation and the foreign affairs debate had to be seen against this background. In previous discussions on this subject there had been general agreement that while our policy had been right, it was not generally understood; and the Biafrans and their supporters in thiscountry had been more successful in impressing public opinion withtheir case. He was convinced that we had followed the right course.Not only was it essential, as the Foreign and commonwealth secretary had said, to avoid the progressive break-up of African states on tribal lines, but if we had not supported the Federal Governmentand supplied them with arms they would never have agreed to a&quot; mercy corridor &quot; or to the introduction of observers. To that extentour policies had increased, not diminished, the possibility of relief.Nevertheless, and however irrational it might be, there was a strong feeling of moral guilt in the Party and the country in regard to thesupply of arms to the Federal authorities. Some major initiative wasnecessary to i-egain the moral support of youth and progressiveopinion and to counteract the propaganda successes of the supporters of the Biafran point of view. If contact were to be established with colonel Ojukwu, it might be possible to make use of Lord Hunt ifhe could be released temporarily from his present duties. (The HomeSecretary indicated that this would be possible.)The Prime Minister added for the Cabinefs very confidential information that he had been considering as a contingent possibilitywhether, if the political and economic situation at home permitted it,he should himself go to see General Gowon and broach with him thepossibility of bringing the war to a close. He did not, however,propose that a final decision should be taken on this at this meeting.In discussion there was general agreement that the Nigerian issuepresented a major political problem on which the whole future of theGovernment might be at stake. It was pointed out that though muchdepended on presentation, the time had passed when the situation could be restored by speeches in the House of Commons. While itwas important to maintain the principle to which the federal government adhered of &quot; one Nigeria&quot;, it was clear that the relationship between the Ibos and the central authority could never be the same again. If there was to be a settlement, it would have tobe established, on the one hand how much central control the Biafranswould accept, and on the other how much local autonomy the federal authorities would tolerate. Consideration should be given to the rolewhich could be played by Commonwealth leaders, especially thosewho, like President Kaunda of Zambia and President Nyerere ofTanzania, had expressed their support for the Biafrans; this could bedone in the framework of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos;Meeting. It was argued that the only hope of securing a settlement would be by way of a general arms embargo to be brought intooperation, if necessary, even before a cease-fire had been secured, andeven though this would represent a major shift in our policy. It was unlikely that Colonel Ojukwu would settle for less, or that he wouldbe deterred from refusing a Christmas truce and the offer of a land&quot; mercy corridor &quot; by the fact that he would thereby be puttinghimself in the wrong in the face of public opinion. There was a danger
of our becoming involved in responsibility for a situation which inthe last resort we were unable to influence. This danger threatenedespecially any initiative involving the Prime Minister^ personalprestige; it might therefore be preferable, if a visit by him were decided upon, for his efforts to be confined to the promotion of acease-fire and increased relief.As against this, it was argued that British prestige and Britishinterests were already heavily committed and that the continuance ofthe present situation was doing no good to either. An initiative was required not only for humanitarian reasons and on grounds of foreignpolicy, but in terms of the internal political situation. A successfulinitiative would provide us with the opportunity of disengaging withcredit from a situation which could otherwise only drag on to ourdetriment. With regard to an arms embargo the point was made thatwe were supplying arms to the Federal authorities not for commercialreasons but because they were the legitimate government of Nigeria,and because if we had failed to do so we should have been unable to achieve even the present progress in regard to the establishment of a&quot; mercy corridor &quot; and the acceptance of observers. The latter had probably averted the risk of genocide. It was unlikely that either ofthe principal suppliers of arms to Biafra France and the soviet union would agree to, or enforce, an effective arms embargo. Anineffectual embargo would merely stop arms supplies to the federal government, while allowing supplies to the Biafrans to continue.The only likely result of attempting to secure an arms embargo inadvance of a cease-fire would be to alienate the Federal Government,drive them into the arms of the Soviet Union, and destroy any prospect of fruitful contacts let alone contacts at the highest level.As regards presentation in Parliament, it was urged that, whilethe prevention of disintegration of African States on tribal lines towhich the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had referred wasa cardinal point, there were other important considerations. In the debate on 12th December the Foreign and Commonwealth secretary might point out that the Government were just as anxious as theircritics to stop the killing and provide relief and that the moralconsiderations were not all on one side. While the arguments againstattempting to secure an arms embargo in advance of a cease-fireseemed to be decisive, the same would not apply in the circumstancesenvisaged in paragraph 19 of the Foreign and commonwealth secretary&apos;s memorandum, i.e., after contact had been established with colonel Ojukwu and between him and General Gowon. We should maintain our basic position and emphasise the efforts we were making with both sides.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that despite the obvious dangers, there were clear advantages in establishingcontact at Ministerial level with Colonel Ojukwu. To this end, hewas prepared to instruct Mr. Foley, after he had seen the Emperor of ethiopia in Addis Ababa, to proceed to some convenient point in west Africa from which he could arrange to meet Colonel Ojukwu.
This would of course have to be cleared with General Gowon; and appropriate instructions would have to be sent to Lord Shepherd inLagos. For the present he was inclined not to refer openly inParliament to the possibility of a meeting between Mr. Foley and colonel Ojukwu, though a veiled reference might be made to it. Withregard to the contingent possibility of his own visit to Nigeria, whether he would go at all would depend not only on how things went at homeover the next few days, but also on what the prospects of successseemed to be in the light of the discussions Lord Shepherd andMr. Foley would have in Lagos and Addis Ababa respectively. Forthe present he would prefer to leave open the question whether hewould make any reference in the foreign affairs debate to thepossibility that he might go to Nigeria himself or, alternatively, tothe possibility of a &quot; high level Cabinet mission &quot; to that country. Itwas extremely important that there should be no disclosure in london of the proposal which had been put forward in discussion of aChristmas truce. Between now and the foreign affairs debate on12th December the Whips should use their best endeavours to secureParliamentary Labour Party support for the Governments policy,stressing the delicacy of the situation, the gravity of the implicationsfrom a Parliamentary point of view, and the potentially disaterous efect in both contexts of an adverse vote.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary to prepare,for approval by the Prime Minister, appropriateinstructions to Lord Shepherd and Mr. Foley, and draftmessages to the Emperor of Ethiopia and GeneralGowon.(3) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary to be guided, in preparing his statement for the foreign affairs debate on 12th December, by the points made in thePrime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,11th December, 1968.
