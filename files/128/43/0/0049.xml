Soviet Union(previous reference:CC (68) 30thConclusions,Minute 6)Soviet Note on anglo-SovietRelationsThe Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth affairs said that though the Soviet note on Anglo-Soviet relations had apparently been intended in the first instance as a privatecommunication, the Russians had published it. The inference wastherefore that it was in reality a propaganda exercise. In presentcircumstances the Soviet Government probably wished to keep theiroptions open with the United States Administration and we werethe obvious target for a manoeuvre of this kind. The note would
The Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth affairs said that the United States had now met most of the procedural points raised by the North Vietnamese at the Paris talks. The discussions were expected to start, probably with a series of propagandaexchanges, next week when the South Vietnamese representativesarrived.The Cabinet (3) Took note of the statements by the Minister of State forForeign and Commonwealth Affairs.The Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth affairs said that the International Red Cross were making great efforts toobtain additional funds for relief in Biafra and that he hoped that wewould make a substantial contribution. It seemed likely that the food situation in Biafra would become very serious indeed in the early months of next year, and that there would be a severe shortage ofcereals because seed had been eaten. An attempt was being madeat the instance of the Government of the Ivory Coast to arrange fora British Minister to meet Colonel Ojukwu, the Biafran leader, and ifthis could be done, the Minister should also visit General Gowon, theHead of the Federal Government, in order to bring the two leaderstogether, but not to negotiate. A reaction was awaited from theFederal Government.In discussion the view was generally expressed that, although our policy in relation to the Niger-ian problems in particular the supply9661have to receive a reasoned reply. This was being drafted, and wouldbe despatched when the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;scomments had been obtained. Before leaving for the Indian sub-continent, the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had given instructions for a review of the whole held of contacts and relationswith the Soviet Union.In discussion, the point was made that the Soviet note was essentially a response to the British reception of the occupation of czechoslovakia. Despite the strong feelings that this had aroused,we should not over-react, and should maintain correct relationswithout indulging in petty pinpricks. Any other course would onlygive Soviet propaganda opportunities which would be exploited. Itwas noted that the Russians themselves appeared to wish to keeprelations on an even keel. In particular, they had not referred to anyof the contentious issues raised in the note during the course of thecurrent trade discussions.The Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth affairs said that he intended to advise the Foreign and commonwealth secretary to make a statement about the case of Mr. Anthony Grey,the Reuters correspondent in Peking, in the course of the following week.
of arms to the Federal Government could be justified in terms of politics and logic, this was less important than that some way shouldbe found of preventing the large-scale starvation that was in prospectin Biafra. Responsible opinion in this country and elsewhere was increasingly unwilling to accept that our policy was right; and it was essential that we should examine the possibility of new initiativesaimed at stopping hostilities or at reducing their scale, and atbringing relief supplies to Biafra. It had to be recognised that themain obstacle, both to a settlement and to the use of land routeswhich was essential to take adequate relief supplies into Biafra, wasthe intransigent attitude of Colonel Ojukwu, which both we andthe Federal Government of Nigeria had failed to bring home to publicopinion; and that this might continue to frustrate our efforts; but wecould not on this account allow matters to rest as they were.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement that our policy hitherto had been on the rightlines. It was however possible that some new initiative might benecessary. The main problems, in order of importance, werestarvation, arms supplies, and the bringing about of a cease-fire. Ashad been suggested in discussion, it might be possible to make someuse of the services of Lord Hunt: and consideration should be givento whether the Commonwealth should be brought in at the time ofthe Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Conference. The possibility should also be considered of holding discussions between thosecountries, including France and the Soviet Union, which were theprincipal suppliers of arms to the two sides. To bring the organisation for African Unity in at this stage would be counter-productive, as inthat event Colonel Ojukwu would not co-operate. A small meetingof Ministers should be held as soon as possible to consider what action could usefully be taken. The matter would then be further discussed in Cabinet.The Cabinet (4) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.ParliamentaryAffairsHouse ofLordsReform(previous reference:CC (68) 45thConclusions,Minute 2)SECRET*3. The Cabinet discussed future policy on House of lords reform. They had before them a note by the Lord Chancellor(C (68) 125) to which was annexed a draft Parliament Bill.The Lord Chancellor said that the Ministerial Committee on theHouse of Lords had approved the draft Bill annexed to C (68) 125.This differed in substance from the draft circulated to the Cabinet inOctober, under cover of C (68) 111, only in the inclusion of apreamble. The purpose of this was to link the Bill more closely withthose parts of the White Paper to which effect could not be given in egislation and to give a quasi-statutory authority to the conventions
about the composition of the reformed House, including the intention that Scotland and other parts of the United Kingdom should be adequately represented in it. On future progress his view was thatthe Bill should be introduced as soon as possible.The Ministerial Committee had also given further thought tothe remuneration of voting members of the reformed House, in viewof the opposition among the Governments supporters to the proposal that voting peers should be paid a salary. The Committee were disposed to recommend that the Government should resile somewhatfrom the position taken up in paragraph 52 of the White Paper. Itwas over four years since the last review of the pay of members ofboth Houses of Parliament; and the better course might be for theGovernment to announce that they intended to appoint an all-Partycommittee with a view to introducing any changes in remunerationin the next Parliament.In discussion the Cabinet first considered the question of the remuneration of members of the reformed House. There was astrong logical case for paying a salary to those who attended regularly;indeed without it there would be difficulty in finding worthyrepresentatives of Scotland and the more distant regions; but therewas no denying that this proposal had attracted a quitedisproportionate amount of criticism. To some extent this was becauseroot-and-branch opponents of the reforms had singled out thisparticular proposal as a convenient point to attack; but many of theGovernment^ supporters were genuinely concerned at the possibilitiesof abuse inherent in a situation where conferment of a life peeragewould carry with it a salary until retirement. Their indignationwas increased by the fact that the figure which had been canvassedappeared generous when compared with the remuneration ofmembers of the House of Commons, after allowance was made forthe expenses and uncertainties that the latter had to face. It was estimated that about one-half of the 41 Labour back-benchers whoabstained during the Commons debate on the White Paper had done so for this reason.There would therefore be advantage in preserving for the timebeing the present system of tax-free allowances for expenses incurredand making clear that the Government had an open mind on thewhole question of remuneration. It might be appropriate at a later stage to appoint a committee to review the whole subject or,alternatively, to refer it to the Prices and Incomes Board, but it wouldbe a mistake to make any announcement to this effect during thepresent Parliament.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet were agreed that they should not insist on theproposal to pay a salary to voting peers. Their conclusion was thatthe existing system of tax-free allowances should continue for thepresent; but they expressed no view as to what would be appropriate
in the next Parliament, and the time might then be ripe to review thewhole question of remuneration.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the proposal to pay a salary to voting peers shouldnot be pursued for the present.The Cabinet then discussed the proposed preamble to the bill and considered whether this gave adequate recognition to the special position of Scotland.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that he was not anxiousto place restrictions on the exercise of the Prerogative; but that, in his view, the preamble was not adequate and it was essential to include a clause in the Bill providing for Scottish representation. Without itthe Government would be extremely vulnerable to charges fromScottish Nationalists that the Bill was inconsistent with the Treaty of union which had guaranteed a minimum of 16 Scottish peers;although the relevant provisions of the Act of Union had beenrepealed by the Peerage Act 1963, which gave all Scottish peers thesame rights as United Kingdom peers, the provisions of the Treatywere still regarded as highly significant in Scotland. A clauseproviding for a minimum of 16 Scottish peers would produce no practical difficulty, since the actual number of such peers was likelyto be well above this figure.In discussion there was considerable support for the viewadvanced by the Secretary of State for Scotland. The majority ofthe Cabinet felt, however, that the risks associated with even alimited provision of this sort were too great to be accepted, and thatit would inevitably stimulate pressure from a variety of interests fortheir special position to be recognised.The Cabinet (2) Agreed that the preamble printed in the draft Parliament Billannexed to C (68) 125 should be retained and that noclause providing specifically for Scottish representations should be added to the Bill.In further discussion the Cabinet considered whether theGovernment should persevere with the Bill in face of determined opposition of a number of their supporters and, if so, what the timetable for the Bill should be. It was argued that it would be unwise to proceed with a Bill for which there was no enthusiasm on either wing of the Parliamentary Labour Party and which would be opposed at every turn by a substantial proportion of theGovernments supporters. A number of features of the proposals were open to serious objection and could be defended only as part ofan inter-Party bargain; but the Conservative front bench were in noposition to control their back-benchers, even if they were minded todo so. The Bill offered almost unlimited opportunities for opposition,and it had been made clear that they would be exploited to the full;while Ministers in charge of the Bill could expect to have to struggle
on with little or no help from their colleagues or support from back-benchers. The prospects were not favourable and a decision on whether to proceed should be deferred until January or February.On the other hand it was pointed out that the Government were committed to reform the House of Lords by their Election Manifesto,by the Prime Ministers statement of 20th June and by the terms ofThe Queen&apos;s Speech. They had always known that any proposalsfor reform of the House of Lords would be opposed by a hard coreof abolitionists; and to turn back now, in face of the opposition of40 to 50 of their supporters, after the White Paper had been approvedby substantial majorities in both Houses, would be a confession of weakness which would expose them to pressure from other determinedminorities. Granted that there was little enthusiasm for theproposals, that fact had not deterred the Government fromproceeding with other badly needed measures. Too much had beenmade of the difficulty of securing the BilLs passage; the Labourabolitionists and the Conservative dissidents were unlikely to makecommon cause, since they objected to different parts of the proposals.If the Government abandoned their proposals now, the Conservativepeers might be emboldened, as the end of the Parliament approached,to make freer use of their powers, perhaps to defeat the nationalisation of ports.Assuming that the decision was to proceed with the Bill, the choice lay between immediate introduction and introduction just before Christmas with a view to Second Reading shortly after the recess. The latter seemed preferable, given the difficulty of findingtime for a Second Reading before Christmas, and would allow theBill to reach the Lords in good time. Some minor amendment was needed to the provisions of the draft Bill as they affected special procedure orders, and this would allow any necessary changes to bemade before submission to the Legislation Committee.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that themajority view in the Cabinet was clearly in favour of introducing theBill shortly before Christmas with a view to a Second Readingshortly after Parliament reassembled. He welcomed the offer madeby the Secretary of State for Social Services to assist the HomeSecretary in the conduct of the Bill in the House of Commons and hoped that the Lord President would also lend his help during theCommittee Stage. He himself might speak on an appropriateoccasion.The Cabinet (3) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange, in consultation withthe Chief Whip, for the Parliament Bill to be introduced in the House of Commons before the Christmas Recess.
CabinetCo-co-ordination between theGovernmentand theNationalExecutiveCommitteeCONFIDENTIAL4. The Prime Minister said that the Parliamentary Committeehad considered at their meeting on 28th November the Press reports which had appeared that day on a statement by the general secretary of the Labour Party, Mr. Nicholas, about decisions takenby the National Executive Committee (NEC) at their meeting on27th November. The statement had carried the suggestion that theNEC or its sub-committees could call before them Ministers whosepolicies diverged from those endorsed by the Labour party conference. The Parliamentary Committee had agreed thatconstitutionally there could be no question of Party committeesrequiring Ministers to answer to them; Ministers were answerableonly to Parliament. On the other hand, since closer contact betweenthe Government and the Labour Party was desirable, it had beenagreed that Ministers should arrange to meet relevant committees butat a time and place of their own choosing. Since the meeting of theParliamentary Committee, the First Secretary of State had receivedwhat amounted to a summons from the Home Policy Committee, ofwhich she was a member, to explain to the Committee the policy on prices and incomes. The right way to deal with this would be for theFirst Secretary of State to offer to initiate a discussion on prices and incomes policy in the Home Policy Committee, but on an occasionwhich she should choose. It would be useful, however, in order tomake it clear that Ministers were taking the initiative in discussingtheir policy with Party committees, if other Ministers, whose policiescould not be said to be in conflict with decisions of the party conference, would similarly offer to meet the appropriate committees.If a Minister received a summons from a committee of which he wasnot a member, he might invite the committee to meet him informallyon his own ground and have a general discussion of policy, beingcareful to include topics other than those which the committee wishedto take up because the Governmenfs policy did not comply withdecisions of the Party Conference.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers statement.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.5th December, 1968.
