The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.The Lord Privy Seal said that unless a decision were taken immediately to provide Government time for three Private Members&apos;Bills Sunday Entertainment, Caravan Sites and Divorce they would fail to pass through the House of Commons in the current Session.In discussion it was urged that there would be criticism of adecision to provide Government time for the further discussion of the sunday Entertainment Bill, which had failed to attract sufficient support to secure a passage in Private Members&apos; time. There was,however, support for the view that the passage of all three Bills shouldbe facilitated.The Paymaster General said that it would be impossible for theHouse of Lords to consider these Bills without adding a furtherfortnight to the autumn spillover already proposed, and, in view ofthe dates already fixed for the Party Conferences, it seemed impossibleto do this without a postponement of the opening of the next Session.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were on balance agreed that Government time should beprovided for the further consideration in the House of Commons ofthe Sunday Entertainment, Caravan Sites and Divorce Bills. TheParliamentary Committee should consider how the timetable for theautumn could be arranged so as to enable the House of lords to consider these Bills also:The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to arrange for Government timeto be provided in the House of Commons for the furtherconsideration of the Sunday Entertainment, Caravan sites and Divorce Bills.(2) Invited the Paymaster General to bring before theParliamentary Committee. the question of extending theautumn sittings of the House of Lords to enable that house to complete consideration of the three Bills.parliament house of lords reform(previous reference:CC (68) 11thConclusions,Minute 3)SECRET*2. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that on theprevious day he had had a meeting with the Ministers principally concerned with the reform of the House of Lords to discusswhat attitude the Government should now adopt towards reform inview of the rejection by the House of Lords, by a majority of nine,of the Southern Rhodesia (United Nations Sanctions) Order 1968.It had been agreed that the Government should steer a middle course* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET
between an immediate reaction of a punitive character, which mightplay into the hands of the Opposition, and acceptance of the view which was currently being propagated by the Conservative Press thatthe incident was of little significance. The failure of the Oppositionmanoeuvre did not disguise the fact that it had been deliberatelydesigned to challenge the Government on a major question of foreignpolicy and to inflict a defeat so decisive as to compel the Governmentto appeal to the country. The Government could not ignore thepossibility that the next challenge might be made on an issue on whichthey could not rely on the support of Liberal and cross-bench peers,nor could they ignore the sharp reaction among their supporters inthe House of Commons. In view, however, of. the importance ofsecuring the passage of Bills now before the House of Lords, it wouldbe desirable to give that House an incentive to co-operate with theGovernment by keeping them in some doubt as to the Government&apos;intentions. He therefore proposed to make a statement in the Houseof Commons that afternoon that the Government would give effectto their intention to reform the House of Lords by introducing at anearly date radical and comprehensive legislation on the lines whichthey themselves now judged appropriate. He would indicate that theinter-Party consultations could not continue in present circumstances,but leave open the questions whether they would ever be resumed andwhether the legislation would deal with the composition of the Houseof Lords as well as its powers. The Lord Chancellor had arranged toreconvene his Committee of Ministers to consider what form the government&apos;s new proposals should take.In discussion it was suggested that a measure put forward by theGovernment would have to be radically different from the agreed proposals in order to meet the strongly held views of their own supporters. It was important to recognise that the crucial issue wasthe position which the hereditary peerage held in the power structure of the country. There was a risk that if the Government did not actquickly to deprive them of this position the development ofGovernment policies during the remainder of the Parliament would bedetermined by the fear that certain important measures could be frustrated by the House of Lords. Moreover, the public would belikely to support the elimination of the peerage from the political and social position which they held at present; and the fact that the peershad themselves provoked the present conflict gave the government an opportunity to achieve a radical solution.On the other hand, it was urged that the Government should notlose sight of the vital importance of achieving a healthy economy, withwhich the public at large were more concerned than with reform ofthe House of Lords. They should therefore do nothing to prejudice the prospect, now paradoxically improved, of securing the passage ofimportant Government Bills in the current Session; nor should they take the risk that, by seeking to impose a radical settlement by theuse of the Parliament Act, they would render impossible the achievement of the Governmenfs legislative proposals for theremainder of the Parliament. It would be preferable to devise a bill which would receive the tacit acquiescence of the Opposition, and it
CC 31 (68)might be possible, without renewing formal inter-Party consultations,at least to obtain the comments of the other Parties on such a Billinformally.As to the content of the legislation, it was urged that the agreed proposals, while reducing the powers of the House of Lords, wouldhave increased their influence, and that the opportunity should therefore be taken to revert to a measure dealing with powers alone.On the other hand, it was argued that the defeat of the Governmenton the Southern Rhodesia Order had illustrated the conclusion towhich the Ministerial Committee on the Powers of the House of Lordshad already been driven that it was impossible to deal with powers in isolation from composition. The Governmenfs defeat on this occasionhad been attributable, not to the powers of the House of Lords, but tothe existence of the in-built Conservative majority; and to curtail thepowers without removing the majority would risk a repetition of asimilar incident in future. The agreed proposals were attractive toa Labour Government precisely because they dealt with the centralissue of power. It was true that they also preserved some ofthe trappings of the existing House of Lords, but the social aspects ofthe hereditary peerage could be dealt with as a separate issue later.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that he should make a statement on the lines he had proposed, which, while indicating the serious view which theGovernment took of the situation created by the House of Lords&apos;rejection of the Southern Rhodesia (United Nations Sanctions)Order, and the impossibility of continuing the inter-Party consultationsin the present circumstances, would leave open the timing of theGovernments own measure and the question whether it would dealwith composition as well as powers. He would consult the LordChancellor on the precise terms of the statement, which should bemade also in the House of Lords. The Cabinet had been divided intheir views about the nature of the proposals which the government themselves should put forward. The Ministerial Committee under thechairmanship of the Lord Chancellor, which he proposed toreconstitute with a membership reflecting the variety of view withinthe Cabinet, should examine the question urgently with the considerations advanced in their discussion in mind; and any minister who wished to put proposals forward should communicate them tothe Lord Chancellor. The Committees recommendations should bebrought before the Cabinet as soon as possible.The Cabinet-(1) Took note that the Prime Minister-(i) in consultation with the Lord Chancellor, wouldprepare a statement on the lines which he had proposed;(ii) would arrange for a Committee of Ministers under thechairmanship of the Lord Chancellor to be constitutedimmediately to consider what proposals the Govern-ment might put forward for the reform of the Houseof Lords.
(2) Agreed   to   resume   their   discussion   in   the  light  of recommendations from the Lord Chancellors Committee.CONFIDENTIALOverseaAffairsYugoslaviaGermanyNon-ProliferationTreatyNigeria(previous reference:CC (68) 30thConclusions,Minute 6)3. The Foreign Secretary said that he had paid a useful visit to yugoslavia from 5th to 10th June. The views of the yugoslav government on the problem of East-West relations were similar toour own and they were not at present thinking in terms of animmediate conference on European security. President Tito had expressed special interest in the Middle East and support for theefforts of Mr. Gunnar Jarring, the Special Representative of theSecretary-General of the United Nations, to promote agreement. he hoped it might be possible for the two sides to agree on a timetable for the steps towards a settlement; and he had been unexpectedlyoptimistic about what the Arab States might be prepared to accept.The Foreign Secretary^ talks with the President had been greatlyeased by the helpful attitude of the Yugoslav authorities in the case ofMr. Philip Dobson, the British student who had been sentenced to6 years&apos; imprisonment by a Yugoslav court. He had seen the YugoslavMinister of Economics, who seemed to be facing economic problemssimilar to our own. He had also talked to British engineers at Skopje.The Foreign Secretary said that the East German authorities had now taken further measures to harass West Berlin. Their aim was clearly to achieve step by step a position where the statehood of east germany was generally recognised; and to frustrate the West german policy of getting on terms with Eastern Europe. The Western allies had decided to take certain limited counter-measures such as charges for travel documents and the withdrawal of some concessions to EastGermans. The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord Chalfont,had protested to the Soviet Ambassador in London about the east german restrictions; and he himself would be having further discussion on the subject with the United States Secretary of State,the German Foreign Minister and other colleagues in the course of theforthcoming North Atlantic Council meeting at Reykjavik.The Foreign Secretary said that there was a possibility that thetreaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, as commendedby the General Assembly of the United Nations in its Resolution of12th June, would be open for signature in London, Washington and rMoscow at an early date, perhaps 1st July.The Foreign Secretary said that the Federal Military Govern-ment had achieved an overwhelming military advantage. Theproblem was to ensure that brutal use was not made of it. TheFederal Government had already said that they had no intention of moving into the Ibo heartland. The Minister of State for Common-wealth Affairs, Lord Shepherd, had left for Lagos the previous daycarrying a letter from the Prime Minister to the Head of the FederalMilitary Government, General Gowon, urging on him, as the Prime!
SECRETLegislative 4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord Privy523&quot;&quot;     Seal (C (68) 81) on the le8islative Programme for 1968-69.The Lord Privy Seal said that the programme of legislationannexed to his memorandum had originally been constructed on theassumption that there would be 55 days available for government legislation during the Session, of which the two constitutional Bills House of Lords and Representation of the People would take 12.Given the large number of Bills left over from the present Session, thisleft little room for new legislation; and allowance had to be made forthe possibility that it might be desired to introduce an industrial relations Bill of medium length in the spring to implement some ofthe recommendations of the Royal Commission on Trades Unions and employers&apos; Organisations. The Parliamentary Committee had asked him to consider what additional time would be available for legislationif the Finance Bill were sent upstairs, the Christmas and Whitsunrecesses were each shortened by a week and there were a two-weekoverspill in the autumn; he had set out the results in the memorandum.Any saving from sending the Finance Bill upstairs would be bothCC 31 (68)Minister and he had done in a recent conversation with ChiefEnahoro, representing the Federal Government, the importance of agreeing to a cease-fire, of maintaining firm military discipline and of facilitating better food supplies to the beleaguered areas. The PrimeMinister and the Ministers directly concerned had also agreed that anannouncement should shortly be made of our readiness to contribute to a Commonwealth force. Our contribution would be limited to one battalion for a period of six months and would be conditional on a force being accepted by both the Federal Government and the Biafranauthorities, and on the participation of other commonwealth countries. The essential function of such a force would be to give theBiafrans the reassurance without which they were unlikely to agreeto a cease-fire. It had also been agreed that we should contribute 250,000 for relief purposes in Biafra; and a representative of thePrime Minister would shortly go to Nigeria to discuss relief problems.In discussion attention was drawn to the growing pressure, bothin and outside Parliament, for the Government to stop supplying arms to the Federal Government. In a recent debate in the House ofCommons the Foreign Secretary had undertaken to reconsider our policy if the Federal Government were to take brutal advantage of themilitary situation; and for the moment this seemed to have allayedParliamentary anxiety. It was also noted that public sympathy forBiafra was widespread in the country. It was particularly strongamong religious groups; but it had also been stimulated by the skilfulpublic relations of the Biafran authorities.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Foreign Secretary.
speculative and small and he had thought it better not to take accountof this. Moreover, it would in his view be a mistake to plan theprogramme on the assumption that the recesses would be cut to theminimum; this would leave no margin for contingencies and would invite a recurrence of this Session&apos;s difficulties. They must keep themaximum room for manoeuvre as regards both the coming session and that of 1969-70.In discussion there was support for the view that it would be unwise to plan the legislative programme on the basis of short recesses.It was suggested, however, that the strain on Members could bereduced by having more but shorter terms, which might incidentallyyield more Parliamentary time in total. If the House rose early inJuly, as the Select Committee on Procedure seemed likely torecommend, it might be possible to fit in an additional short termbefore the Party conferences, or alternatively the conferences might be moved to the Whitsun recess. There was a special problem in that thetimetables for the two Houses did not match; and there might be advantage if under revised arrangements they sat for different periods,though both would have to be sitting when Royal Assent was given toBills. For the present, however, the planning of the legislative programme must proceed on the basis of the system as it was. Asregards the Finance Bill it was doubtful whether much parliamentary time had been saved by taking the Committee Stage upstairs, becauseof the increased allowance which had had to be made for theRecommittal and Report stages. A better solution might be to takethe more controversial provisions on the floor and the lesscontroversial upstairs, but this could not be decided yet, and in themeantime it would be prudent to assume that no additional time would be made available in this way.In further discussion the view was expressed that the proposed programme gave too much time to political measures and too little to economic. Time might be saved by a greater use of omnibus Billsdealing with a range of changes in the law and of enabling Billsauthorising the Government to act by means of subordinate legislation. The number of the debates on the Estimates, particularly the Defence Estimates, might be reduced and the debate on the queen&apos;s Speech at the Opening of the Session could be curtailed to four days. Legislation should be planned in terms of a wholeParliament instead of Session by Session. This had been attemptedbut it was difficult to obtain agreement on the spacing of legislationover five years.In discussion of the specific proposals in the draft programme thefollowing points were made (a) Difficulties would result if Tourism were not passed by1969-70 because an undertaking had been given that payments wouldbe made in respect of works carried out after the spring of 1968. Itmight be possible, however, to reduce the length of the Bill.(b) Air Corporations was needed to authorise payments to the corporations in respect of aircraft they had bought.
(c) Failure to legislate on Merchant Shipping would be damaging to industrial relations; the Bill was economically important and was an integral part of the settlement recommended by the Court of inquiry set up after the seamen&apos;s strike. On the other hand, it wouldbe a long Bill and could not be drafted before the end of March: ifit were held back it might be possible to legislate at the same time ontrawler safety. An acceptable solution might be to introduce ittowards the end of the Session as an earnest of the government&apos;s intention of passing it early in the 1969-70 Session.(d) Ports was urgently needed for both political and economic reasons; the present uncertainty was extremely damaging and therewas pressure from many quarters, including trade unions, employers&apos;organisations and economic planning councils, for clarification of the government&apos;s intentions. Agreement had been reached on the policywhich the Bill should embody, apart from certain minor points, andit should be possible to introduce it before Christmas if thenon-statutory undertakings were excluded, and by February if theywere included. A possible alternative was to publish a White paper which would commit the Government to legislation early in the1969-70 Session; but this would not remove uncertainty because itwould be apparent that a General Election might supervene beforethe besting date. It did not, however, appear practicable to find thenecessary time for this Bill unless either Vehicle and Drivers&apos; Licensingor Transport in London were dropped; but they had already been deferred from 1967-68, and unlike Ports, would produce a saving inGovernment expenditure. In the circumstances the best course mightbe to publish a White Paper and to consider later whether therewould be advantage in introducing a Bill towards the end of the session with a view to passing it in 1969-70.(e) It was important that Gas should be included, since therestructuring of the industry was necessary to enable the supply of north Sea gas to be fully exploited. Delay would adversely affectthe morale of the industry. Drafting instructions could be given atonce.(/) Mines and Quarries ought to be included, either in the main programme or in the Second Reading Committee list, in view of the strong interest in Wales.  It was not suitable for a Private Member.(g) Cigarette -Advertising was desirable to fulfil the firm commitment given in 1967 to legislate in default of agreement by theindustry. Unless there were a firm prospect of legislation by 1969-70the industry would have to be told that the Government had abandoned their intention to legislate. But, subject to furtherconsideration of policy by the Home Affairs Committee, it might bepossible to find a Private Member to sponsor the Bill.(h) Three of the Bills in the Contingent List Tanzania, british north America Act, and British Honduras were likely to become essential.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet considered that the question of the length and number of
recesses should be examined in the light of the report of the SelectCommittee on Procedure. The Ministerial Committee on parliamentary Procedure should consider the report and also the suggestions that had been made in discussion for saving parliamentary time. Subject to this, the Cabinet approved Lists Al and A2, B(i),the Scottish List and the Second Reading Committee List appended to C (68) 81, on the understanding that Second Reading CommitteeBills would not take priority over Main Programme Bills and wouldbe introduced on a &quot; first come first served &quot; basis. They agreed thattime should be found for Industrial Relations if it were later decidedthat it was desirable to introduce a Bill in 1968-69, and for Tourism.Other Bills in List B(ii) should be introduced if time were available.Mines and Quarries should be introduced in 1968-69 through theSecond Reading Committee procedure. The Minister of transport should complete his consultation with colleagues on the proposals tobe embodied in Ports and should submit to the Cabinet a draft white paper in the light of which they could consider whether a Bill shouldbe drafted for introduction late in the Session with a view to its passage in 1969-70. Merchant Shipping should similarly be preparedfor introduction towards the end of the Session. The Home AffairsCommittee should consider further the policy on Cigarette Advertisingand, in particular, whether a Bill should be prepared for a private member, and should report their conclusions to the Cabinet.Since it was clear that the programme for the 1968-69 session would be heavy, it was the more important to avoid unnecessarycongestion during the summer by ensuring that major Bills were ready at the beginning of the Session. Bills that were not ready for introduction at the time specified by the Lord Privy Seal would therefore be dropped from the programme unless ministers collectively agreed that a special exception should be made.Ministers in charge of Bills should be careful to avoid making majoramendments involving changes of policy while the Bills were beforeParliament.The Cabinet (1) Approved the legislative programme appended to C (68) 81,subject to the modifications indicated in the PrimeMinisters summing up.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to arrange for the ministerial committee on Parliamentary Procedure to consider indue course recommendations of the Select Committee on procedure about the length and number of recesses, andthe proposals made in the discussion for savingParliamentary time.(3) Invited the Minister of Transport to submit a draft white paper on the reorganisation of the Ports to the cabinet when outstanding questions of policy had been settled.(4) Invited the Lord Chancellor to arrange for the Home AffairsCommittee to give further consideration to the questionof legislation on cigarette advertising and to report their conclusions to the Cabinet.
* Previously recorded as a Confidential Annex.SECRETCC 31 (68)SECRET*5. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Prime Minister(C (68) 79) to which were attached the report of the Committee onthe Civil Service (the Fulton Committee) and a memorandum by theOfficial Head of the Home Civil Service.The Prime Minister said that reform of the Civil Service was anessential element in the Governmenfs programme for modernisingour principal institutions. The Fulton report was an importantdocument and, in his view, a very good one; and the Governmentwould be pressed, as soon as it was published, to declare their attitude to its main recommendations. He proposed that he should announce,on the day of publication, the Governmenfs general acceptance ofthe report and in particular the proposals for a Civil service department, a Civil Service College and a unified grading structure.Their acceptance should, however, be qualified by a reference to thefinancial and staffing implications. The cost of implementing thereport in full would be considerable, even though the additional expenditure arising from the proposals on pay and pensions wouldbuild up gradually over a number of years. He would therefore makeit clear that, while the Government accepted in principle the Committee&apos;s recommendations on the structure of the Service,they were not committed to any precise timetable for implementation.On staffing, Ministers had decided in January that there should be no increase this year but it now appeared likely that despite reductions in a number of Departments there would be a net increase of 1,000by April 1969. The new Civil Service Department would therefore have to build up slowly and it must take as its first remit the task ofsecuring savings in other fields sufficient to provide the staff requiredfor its own operation. Plans were also being worked out and couldbe announced shortly after the publication of the Fulton report fora thorough examination of the use of manpower throughout theService and ways in which economies could be secured. the paymaster General would be responsible, under general directionfrom himself, for the work of the Civil Service Department and the implementation of the Fulton report.In discussion there was general support for the principle of thethree main recommendations in the report: but it was strongly argued that the Government should not at this stage give any undertakingsabout their early implementation. The creation of the new CivilService Department and the associated management changes would cost  1 million in 1968-69,  5 million in 1969-70 and over  11 millionthereafter. It would be hard to justify a commitment to additional expenditure of this order at a time when public expenditure in other fields was being severely curtailed. Moreover, the creation of theCivil Service Department would involve over 400 additional staff mostly highly qualified this year, rising to at least 3,000 in 1971-72.It was, however, impossible to say at this stage whether the new
Departments work would lead to offsetting reductions in the numberof civil servants as a whole; and to add to the staff of the Civil service in this way without being able to show that it would result in greatereconomy in the long run would attract severe public criticism. Therewould be wide support for the Fulton Committee&apos;s suggestion thatthere should be a comprehensive review of the machinery ofgovernment, without which substantial reductions in manpower were most improbable. The presentation of the report would in any caseneed to be handled with great care if unnecessary damage to the morale of the Service was to be avoided. The criticisms in Chapter Iof the report, which though not without foundation were over-simplified and lacking in balance, were likely to receive unduepublicity when the report was published. The Government should therefore allow time for more considered public discussionof the report before committing themselves to action on its recommendations.On the other hand it was argued that the report contained a seriesof positive proposals which would be welcomed by informed opinion,including many members of the Service, and could do much toimprove standards of administration and economic management. Inparticular, the proposal to replace the traditional Civil Service classesby a unified grading structure was a radical measure of far-reachingimportance and the Government should make it clear on publicationthat they accepted it.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet needed more time to consider the handling of the Fultonreport. In the meantime it was important to maintain strict securityon the matter.The Cabinet Agreed to resume the discussion at their next meeting.Cabinet Office, SWA,20th June, 1968.
