secret. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Secretary of State for Social Services said that, in accordancewith the decision of the Cabinet on 17th October, he and the lord privy Seal had shown the draft White Paper on the Reform of theHouse of Lords (annexed to C (68) 111) to Lord Carrington, the leader of the Conservative Opposition in the House of Lords.  LordSECRET*1. The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that at their meeting on 29th October the Cabinet had decided that the hire purchase regulations should be tightened and that an announcement to this effect should be made on Monday, 4th November. Since then there had been mounting speculation in the Press about the government&apos;s intentions and this made it necessary, in his view, tobring forward the date of the announcement. To delay it until4th November would mean that there would be intense speculationover the weekend, with damaging consequences for sterling, andthat pressure from the motor industry against the change would buildup. It would not be practicable to announce the decision that dayas copies of the new regulations could not be distributed to theprovincial offices of Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office in time. he proposed therefore that the decision should be announced inParliament on Friday, 1st November, and that in answer to questions about its timing it should be explained that the Government had intended to make the announcement during the Debate on the Addressbut that in view of speculation in the Press they had felt it necessaryto advance the date.In discussion it was suggested that the Government should not allow themselves to be deflected from their original decision by press reports. But the general view was that, whatever the motives andorigin of the reports might be, speculation was now so strong that itwould be dangerous to delay the announcement until after the weekend.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the decision to tighten the hire purchaseregulations should now be announced on Friday, 1st November, Inview of the damaging nature of the Press reports in question he would arrange for the leak procedure to be instituted.The Cabinet Invited the President of the Board of Trade to announce onFriday, 1st November, the Governmenfs decision to tightenthe hire purchase regulations.
Carrington had subsequently informed them that the Shadow cabinet had considered the draft and agreed that it reflected the proposalsfor the reform of the House of Lords agreed to by the Inter-party conference before the discontinuance of its meetings, subject only tothe removal of the reference in paragraph 49 to the consideration ofthe remuneration of voting peers by the National Board for prices and Incomes (NBPI). The reference in the draft White Paper couldbe removed, and the problem itself might perhaps be dealt with byasking the Chairman of the NBPI (Mr. Aubrey Jones) to preside overa separate Committee on the analogy of the Committee on the remuneration of Ministers and Members of Parliament, which hadsat in 1964 under the chairmanship of Sir Geoffrey Lawrence, whowas also the Chairman of the equivalent under the conservative administration of the NBPI. The Conservative Party had indicatedtheir willingness to enter into discussions on the conventional, as distinct from the statutory, elements in the proposed scheme for reform, and there was a good prospect that the proposals could becarried through virtually as an agreed measure. The Liberal party had also indicated that they were willing to accept the draft white paper as a statement of the proposals on which agreement wasreached in the Inter-Party Conference.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Conservatives appeared to have only two other reservations. They disliked the suggestion that aCommittee appointed to review the composition of the reformed house of Lords might advise the Prime Minister on the exercise ofhis power to recommend the appointment of peers; and they adhered to their view that the Parliament Bill should not take effect until thebeginning of the next Parliament.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statements by the Secretary of State for social Services and the Lord Privy Seal. -(2) Agreed that the White Paper on the Reform of the House ofLords should be published on 1st November, subject tothe deletion of the reference in paragraph 49 to theNational Board for Prices and Incomes.confidential. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that he had nothing of substance to add to his last report to the Cabinet onVietnam. The possibility of agreement was still in the balance, andthe conflicting reports of what the North Vietnamese representative in Paris had said to the Press did not significantly alter the position.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that he had been pressing the Israeli Government to say publicly that they accepted and would implement the Security Council Resolution, and also to define what they meant by &quot; secure borders &quot;. If they would do so,then talks between Israel and Jordan might become possible.

The Prime Minister said that the Rhodesian regime had beenasked to furnish in time for consideration at this meeting of theCabinet a statement of points arising out of the proposals made inHMS Fearless which the regime agreed to and which did not need further discussions; matters which they wanted to discuss on thebasis that they found them unacceptable; and points in the proposals on which they wished to ask for clarification or redrafting. the rhodesian reply had now been received and he invited the minister without Portfolio to comment.The Minister without Portfolio said that the request to the rhodesian regime had had the desired effect of clarifying their intentions on a number of important points. Although there were anumber of points of agreement, it was clear that there was a fundamental gap between the regime and ourselves explicitly on thesystem of appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, andon the cross-voting percentage, and implicitly on the legality ofpermanent preventive detention, on the arrangements for the test ofacceptability, and on the attitude towards African nationalist leaders.The immediate question was whether he himself should go to salisbury and if so when. He could not be in Salisbury during thecelebrations of the anniversary, on 11th November, of the illegal9558A 3United States Government had been taking action in the same sense.The position was a difficult one. There were differences in the IsraeliCabinet, many of whom distrusted President Nasser of the united arab Republic, and despised King Hussein of Jordan. There wasalso a large section of Israeli public opinion which saw no alternative to military force as a safeguard of israels security. This created a dangerous situation.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that he had seen the Argentine Foreign Minister, Dr. Costa Mendez, in New York, andthat some progress had been made. He hoped that it would bepossible to raise the status of the unilateral statements which it was intended should accompany the Memorandum of Understanding, andturn them into a formal Exchange of Letters. This could probablybe done, so far as the British statement was concerned, if it wereshortened and certain phrases to which the Argentinians tookexception were omitted. The details would be worked out in discussion with the Argentine Ambassador in London and he would report further to the Cabinet.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.
declaration of independence; and if reasonable time was to be left for discussions, these would have to start on Monday, 4th November ifthey were not to be postponed for a fortnight or more. There hadbeen enough in the regime&apos;s reply to warrant a postponement andfurther long-range discussion if we wished: but the balance ofadvantage appeared to be : in going to Salisbury now. TheGovernment would lose the advantages they had gained vis-a-vispublic opinion if they now laid themselves open to charges ofprocrastination. The Governor of Rhodesia held- strongly that theexchanges which had taken place since the meetings in HMS Fearlessshould now be followed up by face-to-face discussions. The objective of these would be to establish whether a basis existed for a settlementconsistent with our principles and the pledges we had made. If this proved impossible, the breach, if there was to be one, should come in circumstances in which it had been clearly demonstrated that theBritish Government had done their utmost to secure agreement but had been frustrated in doing so by profound differences of principle.Either way, the matter would have to be considered again by theCabinet before any final decisions were reached.        -&apos;The details of his brief would be considered at a meeting that afternoon of those Ministers most directly concerned; but hesuggested that the general line should be as follows:(i) There must be a strong and effective second safeguard to reinforce the &quot; blocking quarter &quot;. We should take ourstand in the first instance on the system of appeals to theJudicial Committee of the Privy Council.(ii) There should be no erosion of the cross-voting proposals putforward in HMS Tiger. A reduction of the cross-votingpercentage might seriously delay majority rule.(iii) We  could  not  countenance  any  attempt  to   legalisepermanent preventive detention.(iv) The Rhodesian regime should make a clear and positive offer to both the Zimbabwe African Peopled Union and theZimbabwe African National Union -that; if they would commit themselves to peaceful political activity, the banon them would be lifted.(v) Satisfactory assurances should be obtained from Mr. Smiththat he had abandoned the position that there would beno majority rule in his lifetime. We should be placed inan impossible position if we reached agreement with him and he then made further public declarations in this sense.The recent meeting of the Commonwealth Committee onSanctions had gone very much as expected. It was clear that therepresentatives of the African Commonwealth countries felt deeplyand that their misgivings were to some extent shared by therepresentatives of India. But there had been a considerable ifinarticulate &quot; middle &quot; body of opinion, which realised that ourattempts to seek a political settlement were in the interests of the
Africans. It would therefore remain very important to seek tomaintain the morale of Commonwealth African leaders and to keep them informed of developments. After his discussions in Salisburyhe would try, before returning to London, to see President Kaundaof Zambia, President Nyerere of Tanzania, President Obote ofUganda and President Kenyatta of Kenya. He proposed to take theJoint Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth Affairs (Mr. Maurice Foley) with him in order thatMr. Foley might visit some or all of these personalities if he himself had to return urgently to London.In discussion the point was made that Mr. Smith had come outcategorically against appeals to the Privy Council and the wholeprinciple of a second guarantee. In these circumstances, was there any basis for further discussion; and would not a breakdown be toour disadvantage? As against this, it was argued that before thediscussions in HMS Fearless, Mr. Smith had been equally intransigentover the blocking quarter. Whether there was any real flexibility in his position was a matter for speculation; but he was unlikely toshow his hand before negotiations began. Provided that we could show that we had done our utmost to secure a settlement, but hadbeen unable to do so within the six principles, a breakdown wouldredound to our advantage rather than Mr. Smith&apos;s. If Mr. Smithbroke on any of the points to which he was at present objecting, hewould receive little sympathy from any section of political opinion in britain. As compared with the present situation, the BritishGovernment had little to lose by a breakdown, and everything to gain by trying for a settlement. But the public presentation of thediscussions would need careful handling if confidence was to bemaintained, in Britain and elsewhere, in our determination not to yieldon essential points.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement that the balance of advantage lay in sending the Minister without Portfolio to Salisbury immediately. His detailedinstructions would be discussed with him that afternoon at a meetingof those Ministers most directly concerned. The House of commons would have to be informed as soon as possible; and this could best be done on Friday morning, 1st November, which would allow timeto inform Commonwealth Governments. Meanwhile, in theParliamentary debate on foreign affairs later that day, the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and the Minister of State for foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Mr. Mulley) should merely say that discussions were still proceeding but that it was hoped to makea statement on the following day. They could however, if questioned,say that Commonwealth Governments were being kept informed.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.
CONFIDENTIALServicesEarnings-RelatedPensionsScheme(previous reference :CC (6.8) 43rdConclusions,Minute 5)5. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of a memorandumby the Secretary of State for Social Services (C (68) 106) about theproposed earnings-related pensions scheme and of memoranda by theChancellor of the Exchequer on the effect of the scheme on thepensions entitlement of public service employees (C (68) 112) and onthe frequency of pension reviews under the scheme (C (68) 110).They also had before them notes by the Chancellor of the exchequer to which were appended notes by a group of Economic Advisers onthe general economic effects of the scheme (C (68) 117) and on thedesirability of building up a larger surplus in the early years by raisingemployers&apos; contributions (C (68) 121).jThe Secretary of State for Social Services said that the cabinet&apos;s previous discussions had shown substantial acceptance of theproposals set out in his memorandum (C (68) 106), but there was onemajor point of disagreement, namely whether benefits should be reviewed annually or biennially.  The arguments on both sides hadbeen   deployed   at   the   meeting   on   17th   October   (CC (68) j42nd Conclusions, Minute 6) and he did not wish to repeat all that he Ihad said then. The crucial point was that, once it was accepted that jthe Government could not commit themselves to full earnings Idynamism but only to ensure that benefits at least kept pace with!prices, there would be nothing in the scheme to attract existing!pensioners unless they were given the promise of annual reviews. He Ibelieved that an undertaking to review benefits annually was essential&apos;to the successful presentation of the scheme and it would have theadditional advantage that it would enable the Government to presentin a more favourable light their decision to confine the October 1969puprating of benefits to the increase necessary to cover the increased!cost of living. Moreover, an annual review was the only part of theproposals which could be implemented during the life of the present!Parliament.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he felt bound to resist&apos;the proposal for annual reviews not only because of the additional!cost but also because of the extent to which it would pre-emptSresources in the closing decades of the century. The cost would be^lformidable  150 million every other year after five years, rising to 550 million after 30 years; that was on the basis of full earnings^dynamism, but it would be unrealistic to assume that the Governmentcould hold benefit increases to strict price dynamism. Annual reviews^of pensions under the present insurance schemes would also involveMadditional expenditure on supplementary benefits and public serviceHpensions and possible repercussions on the pay of the Services; ancMall this would have to be found by retrenchment in other fields. Thel!danger of pre-empting too large a proportion of resources was perhaps; jeven more serious. The present proposals rightly looked a long waysahead, but the planning of the other social services was on a muchSshorter term basis. They must beware of committing now to pensionsflresources which, it might appear at a later stage, could have been jused to better advantage in developing other social services; it would :r
always be possible to move from biennial reviews to annual, but notin the reverse direction. The frequency of reviews was his main pointof concern about the proposals and if his view on this were acceptedhe was prepared to agree to the proposed 60 per cent/25 per centbenefit formula and to separate superannuation and social insurance funds.In discussion there was general agreement that annual reviewshad presentational advantages and that if the principle was notconceded the Government would be under pressure to providesomething more generous than a cost-of-living adjustment in theautumn of 1969; it would, however, be very much cheaper to do thisthan to incur a commitment to annual reviews. Moreover it seemed likely that the attitude of pensioners to the Government would be influenced more by the generosity (or otherwise) of the 1969 reviewthan by any promise of future increases, though the introduction ofa special cost-of-living index for pensioners would tend to focusattention on the relation between pensions and prices. Some membersof the Cabinet considered that the repercussions in other fields, suchas wage settlements, of a decision in favour of annual reviews mighthave been overstated, but the general feeling was that the principle would inevitably be extended to public service pensions and possiblyfarther.It was suggested that a possible compromise might be to plan thenew scheme on the basis of biennial reviews and full earnings-dynamism, but to concede annual reviews to existing pensioners.This might make it possible to avoid the extension of annualsettlements to other fields. Experience suggested, however, that theexistence of two separate classes of pensioner would be a continualsource of grievance. It would be better in putting forward theproposals to present them as a scheme for the future and for futurepensioners; existing pensioners could judge the Government on itsrecord.In further discussion the following main points were made (a) The separation of superannuation and social insurance funds would add to administrative costs, but would be justified by thepresentational advantages. A recent survey had shown that 60 percent of people wrongly regarded the National Health Service asmainly paid for out of national insurance contributions and only39 per cent thought that pensions came mainly from contributions.There was a great need to educate the public, and the institution of aseparate superannuation fund would help to spread the realisationthat contributions towards pensions were savings against future needs.(b) It was questioned whether it was wise to commit theGovernment to the idea of a constant attendance allowance whenneither the scope of the arrangements nor their cost could be defined.On the other hand it was pointed out that the absence of any such provision was the biggest single gap in social provision; a survey nowin progress would help to clarify the incidence of need, but enoughwas known to show that provision of this sort was both necessary and
practicable. The White Paper should say that the government accepted the principle, but would await the report of the survey before deciding what should be done.(c) The implications of the scheme for the armed services andother public service pensioners would have to be worked out in thecourse of negotiations with those affected. The White Paper would do no more than make clear that abatement would be allowed, thoughcomplete contracting out was impossible.(d) It was confirmed that the proposals would increase the totalcost to the Exchequer, not decrease it, despite the consequential saving on supplementary benefit.(e) It would be unwise to announce publication of the white paper in advance, in case deterioration in the economic situation should render publication on that date inopportune. The aim shouldbe to publish sufficiently early, in December to escape the distractionsof Christmas, though the first week in January would be a possible alternative if publication in the Recess were acceptable. To deferpublication until Parliament reassembled would leave too little timefor negotiation.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thegeneral feeling of the Cabinet was in favour of biennial reviews ratherthan annual, but with this exception they endorsed the proposals inC (68) 106, including the contribution and benefit formula and theproposal for separate superannuation and social insurance funds.Drafting of the White Paper should go ahead with a view to publication, if possible, in mid-December; the position should be reviewed later in the light of the economic situation. The White paper should contain a firm outline of the Governments proposals, but should not commit the Government to every detail; there should be room for discussion and negotiation, particularly as respects thetreatment of occupational pensioners; The Ministerial Committee on social Services should scrutinise the draft White Paper before submitting it to the Cabinet for final approval; and the Secretary ofState for Defence and other Ministers concerned should be consulted on any passage affecting public service pensioners.The Cabinet (1) Subject to the adoption of biennial pension reviews, approved the proposals for an earnings-related pension scheme setout in C (68) 106.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services to arrangefor the draft of a White Paper on the lines indicated in thePrime Ministers summing up to be considered by theSocial Services Committee with a view to its submission to the Cabinet before the middle of December.(3) Agreed to consider, when the draft White Paper was beforethem, whether it should be published in mid-December or later.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,31st October, 1968.
