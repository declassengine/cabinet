DISPERSAL OF 1.        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theGOVERNMENT Lord President of the Council about the Dispersal ofWORK FROM Government Work from London (C(74) 76).london the LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL recalled that theLabour Party, when in opposition, had criticised therecommendations in the Hardman Report as inadequate.It was therefore essential that the total number of postsdispersed should not be significantly less than the 31, 000recommended in the Report; but his own proposals envisageda much more satisfactory distribution of the dispersed postsso as to give the maximum benefit to the assisted areas, andin particular to Scotland, the North East, the North West andSouth Wales.    The Civil Service Department (CSD) were satisfied that the proposed programme, which would be spreadover a period of about ten years, was perfectly feasible.Intense expectations and interest had been aroused in the regions and it Was essential that they should not be disappointed.There had been consultations with departmental Staff sides and with the National Staff Side, and a recent meeting which hehad had with the latter had been cordial and constructive.    Ingeneral, dispersal on the lines proposed was likely to be acceptable to the Civil Service trades unions; but it would be important to ensure that the proposals were presented assympathetically as possible and that the transfer terms avail-able to the affected staff were kept under review.    TheGovernment were committed to make a statement before the recess; and he proposed to make an announcement in the Houseof Commons on 30 July on the lines of the draft annexed to his memorandum.In discussion, it was argued that it was essential that asubstantial number of posts should be dispersed to the assisted areas, and in particular to Scotland, where the localauthorities in the Glasgow area had the capacity and the willingness to accept a substantial measure of dispersal.Tactful handling of the Staff Side interests was essential;this was strongly borne out by the move of the Post OfficeSavings Bank to Glasgow ten years ago, which had initiallycaused considerable difficulty because of insensitive handlingbut had ultimately proved highly popular with the staff.    In fact,considerable good will could probably be expected from theNational Staff Side, having regard to the fact that more than half of the total number of Civil Servants were already workingoutside London.    It would, however, be essential that theCSD should give Departments affected by dispersal every possible help for example with the installation of the most satisfactory and up-to-date communications systems whererapid transmission of information was essential.1
In further discussion the following points were made:a. 8, 000 staff of the Ministry of Defence had alreadybeen dispersed from London.    It had been agreed that afurther 4, 500 should be moved to Cardiff and one thousand to a number of locations outside London.    Itwas necessary to secure the support of the Staff side to the rationalisation of research and development establishments, which was already involving the dispersal of one thousand posts from London and would shortly affect a further 1, 600 posts.    Moreover, theDefence Review was likely &quot;to lead to the loss of2, 000 - 3, 000 posts; in these circumstances theproposed dispersal of 6, 000 posts to Glasgow would be unacceptable.    It would involve serious operationaldifficulties; it would call for capital expenditureestimated at  31 million and additional annual costs of 15 -  20 million - a good deal of the latter wasaccounted for by the excessively high travelling costs which would become necessary following a move to Glasgow; and it would be totally opposed by the staff side, who would raise much less objection to a move tosome other location, such as Teesside, Merseyside orPlymouth.    As against this, it was argued that theproposal could be presented to the Staff Side in a morefavourable light; that the staff to be moved to Glasgowshould be chosen so as to cause the least administrativeinconvenience and confer the maximum cost benefit;and that the moves could if necessary be spread over aconsiderable period.b. It would be helpful if the Agricultural research council could move to Swindon rather than Merseyside.This would lead to the grouping together of a number of research councils and would thereby help careerprospects.    Moreover, most of the farms and experimental institutes being supervised by the council were in the south of England.c. The 985 Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO)staff proposed for dispersal were in small groups, mostof which were in fact unsuitable for dispersal -sometimes because they were engaged on dutiesspecifically related to London.    There were substantialobjections to moving the staff of the London PassportOffice to Merseyside, since this would reduce theservice available in London to a lower level than was available in any other capital city.    It would in any2
event be necessary to continue to provide a counterservice.    There would be the greatest difficulty in finding more than about 300 posts suitable for removal from London.d. There were weighty objections to moving the immigration and Nationality Department of the HomeOffice from Croydon, where it had moved only twoyears ago.   The Office at present handled about200, 000 personal inquiries a year.    Most of them came from people living in or near London, many of whom had an imperfect command- of English so that inquiriesby letter or telephone would not be satisfactory.    Halfof these inquiries required reference to personal filesand no communications system could provide for this.Moreover, it was important that there should be close contact between the Immigration and NationalityDepartment and immigration officers, most of whom were stationed at Heathrow, Gatwick and south coast ports, and who frequently had to deal with cases of thegreatest urgency.    It would not be practicable to move the main division to Merseyside and retain a counterservice in Croydonj and the proposed dispersal couldbe achieved only at the cost of a very serious declinein the standard of service offered to the public in whatwas a particularly sensitive area.    If posts from theHome Office were to be dispersed from London theyshould be found in some less sensitive part of theDepartment,e. It would be undesirable to come to a decision about the location of the Manpower Services Commissionuntil the completion of the study of this matter whichthe Commission itself was carrying out.    It would however be acceptable for any statement to indicatethat the Commission would be located outside London.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that several of the Ministers affected by the Lord Presidentsproposals had expressed very strong opposition to them.    TheCabinet appreciated the force of these objections but were satisfied that the total number of posts dispersed must be very close to the 31, 000 recommended in the Hardman Report andthat they must be distributed so as to provide the maximumhelp for the assisted areas.    They therefore approved the detailed proposals in paragraph 4 of the Lord presidents memorandum, subject to three modifications.    First, they3
accepted that it would not be practicable for the FCO to find as many as 985 posts for dispersal to Merseyside and agreed thata figure of 500 should be substituted.    The details should be worked out between the Foreign and Commonwealth secretary and the Lord President.   Secondly, it would be undesirable tomove the Immigration and Nationality Department of the HomeOffice from Croydon; instead, the Home Secretary, inconsultation with the Lord President, should identify one thousand posts elsewhere in the Home Office which could bedispersed from London to Merseyside within the next tenyears.    Thirdly, while it could be indicated that the 750 staffof the Manpower Services Commission (or failing that an equivalent number from the Department of Employment) wouldbe dispersed, the precise location could not be determined untilthe commission s own review had been completed.    TheLord President was authorised to make a statement in theHouse of Commons on 30 July announcing the Cabinet&apos;decision; the text appended to Ms memorandum should be amended to take account of the agreed modifications, andsome further verbal amendments would be desirable so as tomake it presentationally more acceptable to the Staff Side -in particular, it should indicate the long period over which themoves from London would be taking place.    The GSD should give Departments all possible help over consultations withStaff Sides, the presentation of the decisions to &quot;staff and theactual movement of staff when that stage was reached.    Theyshould also ensure that the most efficient communicationssystems were available to offices which were moved to the regions and that any research needed further to improve suchsystems was put in hand; and the Minister of State, CSDshould let him have a report on these matters.The Cabinet -1.      Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.2,      Inyited the Lord President of the Council to announce the Cabinet&apos;s decisions as indicated inthe summing up.3.      Invited the Minister of State, CSD to submit ja report to the Prime Minister on the lines indicatedin the summing up.4
2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C(74) 81) on public expenditure to 1978-79.They also had before them a memorandum by the Central policy review Staff (GPRS) (C(74) 79) on the economic framework forthe discussion of public expenditure; and a note by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C(74) 80), to which was attached the 1974 Report of the Public Expenditure Survey Committee(PESC).THE PRIME MINISTER said that in April the Cabinet had agree the procedure for the public expenditure review on the under-standing that this implied no commitment to a particular balance between public and private expenditure, nor to decisions on particular programmes.    They had also wanted to discuss theGovernment&apos;s economic strategy before taking decisions on expenditure.    Discussion of the medium-term strategy had been delayed by consideration of the Chancellor^ short-term economic measures: and it would clearly not be possible for the Cabinetto settle the individual public expenditure programmes beforethe Recess.    The main purpose of this discussion was therefore to have a broad review of the strategy for public expenditure andto settle the overall ceiling over the next four years as againstthe resources for private consumption: and to leave over thedetails of the individual programmes until the autumn.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the basicassumption underlying his paper was that the economy would growat about 3 per cent a year, equivalent to about  2, 000 million ayear at present prices.    Part of this, which he had put at 400 million would need to be devoted to increasing the rate atwhich the balance of payments deficit was being reduced.    Thisshould enable the non-oil deficit to be eliminated by about the endof 1975, and the oil deficit by 1978-79.    Even on this basis, wewould by then be paying  1, 500 miUion a year in interest charges on the accumulated deficit, and this would absorb about one-halfof the revenue from North Sea oil.    In order to maintain the assumed level of economic growth, and eventually to improve on it, it would be necessary to put about  500 million a year intoadditional investment, whether in the public or private sector.He had also assumed that  500 million a year would be absorbed by higher earnings.    This would permit an increase of l  percent a year, which would accommodate special claims such asequal pay, improvements in low pay, and efficiency payments,but would not otherwise provide for a general increase in thereal level of earnings, or allow for cases where the TradesUnion    Congress (TUC) guidelines were exceeded.    It would imply an increase in real private consumption (including thatfinanced by social security payments) similar to that experienced5
when the Government were last in office.    On these assumptions, 700 million a year would be left for increased public expenditure,equivalent to an annual increase of 2-f per cent in demand terms.This was in fact equal to the rate of increase which had emerged from the planning exercise embodied in the PESC report.    Itshould be sufficient to finance about half of the improvementsembodied in the Labour Party&apos;s election manifesto.He agreed with the analysis in the CPRS memorandum, includingthe comment that some of his assumptions were optimistic.There was a particular problem regarding defence, where, despite the cuts in prospect, it would prove difficult to hold expendituredown to the present level, which implied very substantial reductions in the long-term costings.    A higher growth in total public expenditure could only be obtained if real earnings rose moreslowly, than he had assumed.    However, as the assumed levelof Ij per cent a year was absorbed by special claims, this would imply an actual fall in the general real level of earnings, and he did not believe that workers on the shop floor would be preparedto accept ouch a situation over a four year period.If a growth rate of 2f per cent for public expenditure was accepted,any increase in one programme must come either from reductions in other programmes or from the contingency reserve.    the contingency reserve which Had been included in the PESC reportrose to  1, 000 million by the end of the period.    The claims on it, particularly from social security, already greatly exceededthis figure; and it would be unwise to commit it all at once.   he proposed therefore that only half of the reserve should be commit-ted at this stage, and the allocation of this would require further discussion.    He asked the Cabinet to agree with the recommenda-tions in paragraph 9 of C(74) 81, including the proposal that therate of growth of public expenditure should be held to 2f per centin demand terms.    He would then discuss with his colleagues the implications for particular programmes.    The Governmentnecessarily had to act under great economic constraint,   buthe believed that both the Labour Party and the country at largerecognised the present limited scope for increases in both private and public expenditure.In discussion, it was argued that the Governments wholeeconomic policy was critically dependent on the social contract.If the TUC were to persuade their members to adhere to this, 11provision must be made for the special claims of equal pay, thelow paid, and efficiency payments.    Some parts of public expenditure were, however, also important for the social contract,while others were necessary to achieve greater industrial productivity.    If expenditure had to be limited to the levelsindicated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, very serious
questions of priorities would arise between the differentprogrammes.    It seemed imperative, therefore, to find someway out of the constraints imposed by the conventional approach,which had been unsuccessfully adopted during the last LabourAdministration.    A more fruitful approach might be to concentrate on ways of getting greater increases of production.    Experienceduring the 3-day week indicated that remarkable improvementscould be obtained; and with more industrial democracy, and a social contract, even greater improvements should be attainable.On the other hand, the assumed growth rate of 3 per cent was already higher than the average achieved during the post-war period, and experience during that period had illustrated theimprudence of trying to spend the fruits of growth before they hadbeen obtained.    Improvements in productivity would, in any case,take time to mature, and in the meantime it was essential thatplanning should proceed on a realistic basis.In further discussion, it was argued that there was a danger of inconsistency between the decisions taken on public expenditure,and the measures of demand management taken in the shorterterm.    In order to deal with the prospect of rising unemploymentit might be preferable to increase expenditure programmes ratherthan taking measures like the recent reduction in VAT and theincrease in the regional employment premium, which had a lowerpriority than other expenditure on industrial assistance.    It wasalso undesirable to hold down the level of the major expenditure programmes, and then find it necessary to spend money on emergency programmes of winter works of lesser value tojthecommunity.    The action taken to manage the economy in the short-term deserved as thorough collective consideration as the medium&apos;&quot;term planning of public expenditure.    On the other hand, it was argued that most public expenditure did not provide a satisfactorytool of short-term economic management because increases, oncemade, could not readily be reversed.    Other measures thereforehad to be used as short-term regulators.    It might nevertheless be necessary to take some action during the coming months to help the construction industry which was facing a serious drop in activity.In subsequent discussion, the following points were made:-a.      More sophisticated analysis was needed of some ofthe expenditure figures, since different types of expendi-ture, eg expenditure on existing assets, transfer payments,etc. had different demand effects.    More information wasalso needed about the effect of public expenditure on thedistribution of income and wealth, and the incidence of theexpenditure between different social categories.    Forexample, subsidies to nationalised industries to enablethem to hold down their prices probably had the effect of
subsidising the better-off, as well as increasing the needfor capital investment.    It should be possible to redeploythe expenditure on such subsidies towards social expendi-ture, and possibly food subsidies.    The economiccategories of expenditure could also be misleading.   Forexample, Government assistance to private industryaffected the public sector borrowing requirement, while thegeneral category of investment included non-productiveexpenditure such as the construction of bingo-halls.Consideration should be given to measures for holdingback such non-essential expenditure, although it would notbe appropriate to introduce such measures at a time whenthe construction industry was-in difficulties.b. The Government would be open to criticism if public expenditure did not rise as fast as the gross national product.It might be worth considering whether this could be achieved by asking those with incomes above the average to accept areduction in their real level of consumption.    The amountof extra revenue which could be obtained from this sourcewas, however, very small.    For example, the confiscationof all incomes above  7, 000 a year would bring in only about   110 million.    Alternatively, if the threshold for thehigher rates of tax were lowered to 1^ times the averageincome, this again would only bring in about  110 million.Under the Chancellor&apos;s proposals, public expenditure would already be rising nearly twice as fast as private consumption.c. The programmes described in the PESC report wouldinvolve very substantial reductions, going even further thanthe cuts imposed by the previous Administration; and thedifficulties would be further intensified by demographicchanges.    In education, no provision could be made in1975-76 for nursery education or for the replacement ofobsolete school buildings; and there would need to be cutsin the programmes for handicapped children, non-advancefurther education, and higher education, as well asincreases in school meal charges.    In health and social services, many important projects would be deferred forup to three years.    The average life of the stock of hospital buildings, which would have been about 50 years under the programme envisaged by the previous administration, would be pushed up towards 60 years.There would also be a backlog in maintenance expenditureof about  100 million.    The housing programme was in serious trouble, and the cuts in transport expenditure hadbeen taken to the point where there was a danger ofcollapse in the transport services.    The cuts in water and sewerage would also be very damaging, and would impede the growth of housing.
d. On the other hand, the standards set for equipment and buildings in the education and hospital programmesseemed in some cases to be unduly lavish in the presentand foreseeable economic circumstances.    Unnecessaryconstraints were being imposed by increasingly expensivetechnologies.    It was arguable that it would be better to cut down on standards in order to enable more projects togo forward.   Similarly, many young couples might prefer to see a programme of cheaper housing rather than have to wait for years to obtain a house.i (e. The pressure on local authority rates was becomingvery serious, and attempts to restrain their expenditure bymeans of the rate support grant had been unsuccessful.   Asimilar pressure on the rates could be expected in scotland in 1975, when reorganisation took effect there.    TheGovernment&apos;s approach to local authorities on expenditurequestions should be consistent; it was wrong for theGovernment to be sending out circulars encouragingimprovements in a wide range of services at the same time as they were   exhorting authorities to restrain their totalexpenditure.f. Given the constraints on private consumption andpublic expenditure as a whole, the discussion of individual programmes must proceed on the basis that no expenditure should be regarded as sacrosanct, and any new proposals should be subject to particularly searching scrutiny.    Itwas unrealistic to suppose that there could be any escape from these constraints by going over to a siege economy.A solution would have to be found within the framework of a mixed economy, with a suitable blend of greater industrial efficiency and social idealism.g. If the Government were prepared to take the people into their confidence, there were reasonable grounds for believing that they would respond to a call to put first things first.    Itwould, however,be necessary to get a greater measure of understanding that increased social expenditure formed apart of the total standard of living of the community.   Itwould also be necessary to explain frankly the limitations on the real improvement in the standard of living duringthe coming years.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet had had a most valuable first discussion of the problem which faced them in a particularly difficult situation.   A numberof important points had been made.    For example, attention hadbeen drawn to the critical importance of the underlying growth in production, in which it had been suggested that spectacular
improvements might be obtainable.    Public expenditure planscould not be based on such an assumption, which even ifrealisable would probably not afford much help in the earlier years.The Secretaries of State for Employment and Industry should however circulate a joint paper indicating concrete steps whichthey considered would help to promote more rapid growth.    TheCPUS should examine the scope both for savings and for widerprovision through greater austerity in the standards of equipment and buildings financed from public sector programmes, includingthe possibility of low cost housing.    The Chancellor of theExchequer, in consultation with the CPRS, should also examinethe other points made in discussion: in particular, there shouldbe a study of ways of restricting less-essential constructionexpenditure in the private sector; and possibly of avoidingemergency 1 winter-work&apos; programmes which tended to distortpriorities between projects.    In the meantime the cabinet approved, as a general guideline, the overall target for public expenditure proposed in paragraph 9a of C(74) 81.    They also agreed that separate discussion would be needed of expenditure onthe matters listed in paragraph 9b and d of that paper, and theChancellor of the Exchequer should arrange this as necessary.As regards the other programmes, Ministers should reflect on theposition in the light of the Cabinefs discussion and the Chancellor^paper, and should then have bilateral talks with the Chancellorof the Exchequer.    In the light of these talks, the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer should circulate a further paper as early as possiblein September, summarising departmental proposals for additional expenditure and suggesting where any necessary countervailingsavings might be found.   At that stage, Ministers might wish to circulate papers of their own to Cabinet, but they should not do sountil after the bilateral talks had been completed.The Cabinet -1.      Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister.2.      Approved as a general guideline the recommendation in paragraph 9a of C(74) 81.3.      Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in thelight of his further bilateral discussions with ministers, to circulate a further memorandum tothe Cabinet as proposed by the Prime Minister in his summing up.10
4.     Invited the Secretaries of State for employment and Industry to circulate a jointpaper containing specific proposals for increasingthe underlying rate of economic growth.5.     Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Central Policy Review Staff to examine theother points made in discussion, as indicated bythe Prime Minister in his summing up.11
3.        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theLord President of the Council (C(74) 82) about government assistance to maintain employment at the factory of the formerInternational Property Development (Industrial) Ltd (IPD(Industrial)) at Kirkby.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that the ministerial Committee on Public Enterprise had agreed on11 June that IPD Industrial should be allowed to go into receiver-ship, and that a feasibility study should be undertaken to see if a viable scheme could be found for the use of the factory.   He hadbeen authorised to tell the Receiver that the Government wouldbe a potential buyer for the factory and should be given anopportunity to bid before it was sold to a third party; and to tell the unions, without commitment, that the Government were doing their utmost to find a way to enable employment to be providedfor the work force.    Consultants had been commissioned toprepare a feasibility study for the use of the factory; it was estimated that this would take about six months to complete.The Receiver had said he could provide employment for 450workers at the factory, to maintain the viable parts of IPD(Industrials former activity, but the work force had refused toaccept this and had sat in, insisting that jobs must be found foreveryone.He had proposed to the Ministerial Committee on IndustrialDevelopment (IDV) on 23 July that the Government should acquire the assets from the Receiver and engage the consultants to manage the enterprise to give employment to an additional 150 men for six months on a break even basis, while research for otherways of using the plant went on; and that the unutilised 500workers should be maintained on full pay.    The majority of theCommittee, with the Chief Secretary, Treasury reserving theChancellor of the Exchequers position, had been prepared to agreeto the acquisition of the assets to ensure employment for 600 men,&apos;although they had not agreed to the further proposal that theunutilised workers should be retained.He had now heard however that the workers were prepared to shareout the jobs available so that no more than 450 would be employed&amp;nd on the payroll at any one time.    On this basis they would co-opeiete with the Receiver who, for his part, would releaseholiday pay at present held in a blocked account.    He thereforesought agreement to the Government acquiring the assets toprovide employment in the way he had described.12
confidential the PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Secretary of State for Industry should tell the Receiver thatthe Government remained a potential buyer for the factory andmight put in a bid; but he should not offer to acquire the assetsat this stage.    The proposal for sharing out the jobs the receiver could offer appeared to get over the earlier difficultyof paying 500 men for whom there would be no work, but theSecretary of State should arrange for this to be urgentlyexamined by bis officials, in consultation with the Treasury andthe Department of Employment.    If necessary, he should bringthe matter back to the Cabinet early in the following week.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for Industry to be guided accordingly.4.        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C(74) 78) about programme analysisand review (PAR).THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, invited the Cabinet to endorse the proposal that PAR should continue on the basis of theprocedure outlined in Annex 1 to C(74) 78.    The memorandumexplained that PAR was a selective programme of analyticalstudies taking particular aspects of policy in turn over time.The system had originally been intended to operate on an annualcycle, but this had proved too rigid; none the less the conceptitself was valuable, and the arrangement for central review andcollective consideration by Ministers helped to counter theinertia in expenditure programmes and ensure that the optionsfor new programmes were properly exposed.    The procedurenow recommended would retain the interdepartmental machineryfor formulating the programme collectively, through a committeeof officials under the same Treasury chairmanship as the public expenditure Survey Committee; and the central Departments andthe Central Policy Review Staff would continue to be involved bothin this process and at key stages in each individual study; itwould however discard the rigidity of a strict annual cycle.    Thememorandum also recommended that there should be no changein the previous practice whereby the list of subjects under studywas not publicly revealed.The Cabinet -Approved C(74) 78.Cabinet Office28 July 1974 13confidential
