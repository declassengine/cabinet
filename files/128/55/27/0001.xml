The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenin the House of Commons during the week following the Recess.It was intended that the Debate on the Report of the 0&apos;BrienCommittee on the Export of Live Animals, which was planned for16 January 1975, should take place on the basis of a substantive /Motion upon which there would be a free vote.2. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of memoranda (iby the Prime Minister (C(74) 134 and .141) and by the Secretary ofState for Employment (C(74) 145).    The conclusions reached are recorded separately.1
3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat on 11 December Mr Ian Smith, the leader of the illegal regime,had announced that in return for a cessation of guerilla activity hewould release the Rhodesian African leaders and their followers whowere held in detention, and would allow them to engage in political activity in preparation for a constitutional conference.    A de factocease-fire appeared to be in force; the African leaders had beenfreed; but many of the detainees had not yet been released.    Therewas no evidence that the positions of the African leaders andMr Smith were coming closer on the objectives of a constitutional conference.    The political outlook remained obscure.    There wasalso disagreement on where the conference should be held: the africans wanted it to be in London under United Kingdom chairman-ship.    He did not wish to become involved prematurely in theseexchanges.    We should for the present leave it to the Africansand the white Rhodesians to make the running.    It would be important to have a clear idea of Mr smith s intentions beforeagreeing to hold a constitutional conference here.    He himself had received indications that the South African Prime Minister,Mr Vorster, would like to meet him.    In view of the major rolewhich Mr Vorster had assumed in pushing Mr Smith towards an accommodation with the Africans, a meeting might prove useful.But before agreeing to one he would wish to discuss the matter with President Kaunda of Zambia in the course of his own forth-coming tour of African countries.    If President Kaunda was infavour, and judged that a meeting would not be offensive to african opinion ia present circumstances, he might, unless his colleaguessaw objection, arrange to make one while he was in Africa,possibly on the borders of Botswana.The Cabinet -1.      Took note of the statement by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe Ministerial Meeting of the North Atlantic Council on 12 and 13December had also enabled him to have seme useful bilateral talks.In the meetings themselves the American Secretary of State,Dr Kissinger, had explained the agreement reached with the Russiansat Vladivostock on strategic arms limitation, and had claimed thatthe agreed limits represented an important step towards slowing down the arms race.    Dr Kissinger believed that in reaching thisagreement with President Ford, Mr Brezhnev had been obligedto overrule strong opposition from within the Soviet armed forces.There had been useful discussion in the Council about the J)negotiations on the mutual and balanced reduction of forces in Europe.2 : &apos; . %
It had also been agreed that there was now a prospect of achievingan acceptable outcome of the Conference of Security andCo-operation in Europe by the spring and that it might be foundappropriate to hold a summit meeting of Heads of Government to mark this in the early summer.    The Western countries were however continuing to press the Soviet Union on a number of issues.He and Dr Kissinger had formed the impression from their separatediscussions with the Greek and Turkish Foreign Ministers, thatthere was some prospect of the Greeks and Turks entering into discussions about Cyprus on a broader political basis than had sofar been possible.    Discussions between the representatives of theGreek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities might also developaccordingly.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that in the NATOMeetings the American Defence Secretary, Dr Schlesinger, had spoken strongly about the danger of defence cuts, although in private conversation he had shown understanding of our approach to our defence review. .The Cabinet -2.      Took note of the statements by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and the Secretary ofState for Defence.jieeting betweenjie Presidentsfthe UnitedStates and france the FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theAmerican Secretary of State, Dr Kissinger, had sent him an appraisal of the recent meeting in Martinique between PresidentGiscard d&apos;Estaing of France and President Ford of the United States.Dr Kissinger&apos;s anxieties in advance of the meeting had not been realised.    On energy in particular he was now less worried aboutthe divergence between the American and French positions.President Ford had not pressed the French to join the InternationalEnergy Agency, but he had stood firm on the need to maintainconsumer co-operation, and progress on this had been made a pre- -condition for the holding of the proposed consumer/producerconference.   The meeting with the producers, as advocated by theFrench, would probably take place by next summer.    On energymatters and on the related issue of the re-cycling of the surplusfunds of the oil producers, as on international matters generally,there was likely to continue to be very close contact be tween theUnited States&apos; Administration and ourselves.
PAY OF THENATIONALHEALTHserviceCONSULTANTS4. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary ofState for Social Services (C(74) 143 and 147) on the pay ofNational Health Service (NHS) consultants together with memoranda by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C(74) 144) and the Secretary ofState for Employment (C(74) 145) on the same subject.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said mat itwas important to reach a decision on the principle of the new contracts for NHS consultants before she met the doctors thefollowing day.    Unofficial industrial action had already begunbecause of the delay in deciding this question.    The question ofthe new type of contract was separate from the question of costing.The pricing of the contract would be determined by the Doctors&apos;and Denti6ts&apos; Review Body   (DDRB); after the DDRB had made recommendations it would be open to the Cabinet to reject oramend or stage them in the same way as the recommendationsof the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB).    The point t6 bedecided now was the form of the new contract.    The existingcontract was out of date and unfair and constituted a long-standinggrievance among consultants.    When the Labour Government came into office she had set up a joint working party with the consultantsto consider it and she had ensured that the terms of referenceincluded the phasing out of private beds from the NHS.Discussions had been difficult and without commitment on theGovernment side.    Under the existing contracts those consultantswho did not commit themselves wholly to the NHS were allowed todo private practice in return for a reduction in pay, which underthe maximum part-time contract of 11 sessions amounted to2/llths,    There was no means of policing the extent to which thepart-timer discharged his obligations.    Some that had privatepractices subordinated their NHS patients to their private ones.Others   worked long hours beyond their commitment without additional reward.    For this open-ended system the government proposed to substitute a new contract carrying a firm obligationto work for a definite number of sessions: normally 10 four-hoursessions a week.    In addition,  10 million that was currentlydistributed secretly in the form of distinction awards would be diverted into 2 new supplementary payments to reward particularlyuseful or unpopular work.    The latter proposal was a point of controversy; and the consultants were pressing for additional payments of various kinds which she proposed to resist.    ShebeUeved that the offer of a new contract on the lines she proposed would give the only hope of meeting the profession, remedying a genuine grievance of consultants in disadvantaged areas and encouraging a more equal distribution of talent.    It had beenobjected that the new contract would give additional money for thesame work.    This was not so; the Government would get extra ;work for the same money, since consultants who undertook10 sessions would be obliged to attend throughout.    The additional cost would arise out of the payment for extra sessions beyond the 10.4
Neither the general practitioners nor the junior doctors had asimilar case for a major pay restructuring.    Payment for extrasessions might be represented as a kind of overtime for a highly paid group, but the extra sessions would be identified and contractedfor in advance as part of each consultants individual contract:that was a unique feature, unlikely to be paralleled elsewhere.The next general review of doctors&apos; pay was due in April 1975.An interim report was expected later that day which probably wouldnot recommend any breach of the 12 month rule but would make itclear that doctors and dentists had fallen behind.    Some increasein doctors&apos; pay was therefore to be expected in any case.    the alternatives were to reject the new contracts and ask the DDRBto base their review on the existing contracts, or to accept thenew contracts in principle and ask the DDRB to use them as thebasis of their review.    If the Cabinet chose the first alternativethere could be no tope of avoiding a breakdown.   The consultantswould be likely to carry out their threat of setting up agenciesfrom which they would offer their services back to hospitals atarbitrary rates after resigning from the NHS; they would havepublic sympathy.    If on the other hand the Cabinet accepted thenew contracts in principle she would seek Cabinet approval forher departmental evidence to the DDRB and after the DDRBreported it would be for the Cabinet to take the final decision onthe implementation of their recommendations.    The salary levelsfor consultants were not in fact very high.    Only about 2, 000 ofthem were drawing more than  10, 000 a year from the NHS.Whatever the DDRB recommended there need be ho conflict withthe decisions of the Government on the recommendations of theTSRB.    If curbs were to be applied to consultants&apos; increases she might be obliged to postpone the start of phasing out pay bedsuntil 1976-77, but in the meantime she would propose to introduce the necessary legislation as quickly as possible.In discussion it was argued that the consultants, who were in astrong negotiating position, might demand a commitment on their new salary levels before they would agree to the new contracts;they might also demand a guarantee that the Government wouldgive no ex, parte evidence to the DDRB.    These demands must be resisted.    It would be desirable to remove some of the morerepercussive elements from the new contracts.    If possible thetotal cost of the restructuring together with the 1975 pay reviewmust be brought down from the estimated figure of 35 per cent or38 per cent to a figure of about 25 per cent that could be presented as being within the social contract.   The doctors might be warned that if the recommendations of the DDRB fell outside the TradesUnion Congress , guidelines they would have to be staged;this line would be easier to hold if similar measures were being applied to other high paid sections of the community.    If the consultants broke off negotiations on this issue they would get lesjs&apos;sympathy than if the Government had refused to accept the principleof the new contracts.
In further discussion it was argued that it was not enough to offer 5 million towards the cost from offsetting reductions in expenditure within the health programme.    The cost of re-structuring the contracts had been estimated at  17 million ayear and there would be a further cost of at least  20 million ayear arising from phasing out pay beds.    The Cabinet would haveto take their decision later on the timing of the action on pay bedsand the cost of that might be disregarded for the present; but a contribution of  5 million towards the cost of the new contractsstill appeared insufficient. 11THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed in principle that the Secretary of State for social services could offer new contracts of the kind that she proposed,on the clear basis that the Government was not committed asregards the cost and would reserve the right to give ex partc   .evidence to the DDRB and to modify the DDRB&apos;s recommendations in the light of the economic situation at the time.    Her evidence to the DDRB should be cleared with the Cabinet and they should be consulted again when the DDRB had made its recommendations about pricing.    It would be helpful if the Department of Employmentwere represented at the discussions with the doctors.    that part of the cost of the new contracts that could be shown to be dueto the normal review of remuneration by the DDRB should not betreated as an increase in real terms.   The rest represented thecost of restructuring.    The question of the source of the additional expenditure should be discussed on that basis between theDepartment of Health and Social Security and the Treasury.    Interms of public expenditure the phasing out of pay beds shouldbe left aside for the time being, as the timing of that measure would need to be considered by the Cabinet in the light of theprogress on the new contracts.    Until then no legislation for thepurpose should be included in the legislative programme.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing up oftheir discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the Secretary of State for Social Services to proceed accordingly.
IOUoItON[lEPGRT ONTEACHERS * PAYjprevipusReference:lc(74) 17mConclusions,jiiinute 4 .5. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION and science said that the report of the Houghton Committee on the pay of non-university teachers had been discussed the previous day in the Sub-Committee on Pay Negotiations of the ministerial committee on Economic Policy.    The Houghton Committee had undertaken a complete review of the teaching profession inEngland, Scotland and Wales.    They had done excellent work.They confirmed that the pay of teachers had fallen behind andthat it was right to treat them as a special case.    Therecommendations would add an average of 29 per cent to the salary bill as it was in May 1974 after the last general increasebut before the threshold payments; this addition would be withoutprejudice to the next settlement due in April 1975.    Therecommendations were weighted in favour of the more experiencedteachers.    The increases would range from 16 per cent for the teacher on the minimum rate to 44 per cent for the Principal ofa Polytechnic.    The total cost was estimated by the committee at  340 million in 1974-75 but would rise eventually to  432 million a year. The Suh-Committee had agreed to statements to be madeby him and the Secretary of State for Scotland welcoming thereport, accepting its implications for public expenditure andreferring the recommendations to the negotiating bodies.    TheGovernment was committed to accept a settlement within the totalrecommended by the Committee, though they should insist thatthe total must not be exceeded.    As regards the distribution ofthe money, the Government lacked the final power, but they would exercise their influence in the negotiating bodies towards the fullacceptance of the Houghtcn recommendations, so as to stop thedrift of experienced teachers out of the profession.THE SECRETARY/OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that the report would not receive any general welcome in Scotland.    Although itgave Scottish primary teachers parity with their counterparts inEngland it would hardly begin to meet the expectations of the lowerpaid groups.    His influence in the Scottish negotiating committeesmight not be sufficient to procure the full implementation of therecommendations though he would try to keep the deviations to aminimum and would in any case ensure that the total recommendedexpenditure was not exceeded.    Meanwhile disruption would continue.    Not even an interim increase of  150 would necessarilyend it.THE PAYMASTER GENERAL said that, although the Governmentwere committed to accept the financial implications of theHoughton report, the total cost was greater than had been expected.The Treasury would wish now, in consultation with the educationdepartments, to re-examine the plans for increasing, the number of teachers.The cabinet took note.
ftTHE PRICE CODEpreviousReference:CC(74) 44thConclusions 8Minute 46. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR PRICES and consumer PROTECTION said that, as a result of the processof consultation which followed their last discussion of the PriceCode, she had made certain changes to the proposals in the consultative Document.    In reducing the productivity deductionto 20 per cent there would be a transitional deduction of35 per cent for labour cost increases incurred between thedate of the last price increase and 1 November 1974.    The      &apos;safeguard for manufacturers&apos; profit margins on products wouldbe set at 70 per cent with the option of using the existingsafeguard.    The safeguard for distributors&apos; net profit marginswould be increased from 75 per cent to 80 per cent, while leaving the gross profit margin limit at 105 per cent.    Theretrospective recovery of cost increases would not be allowedbefore 1 November 1973 in either the private or the public sector the cabinet took note.Cabinet Office19 December 1974
