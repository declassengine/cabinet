this document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s governmentIcopy no cabinet confidential annex cc(74) 37th conclusions tuesday 15 October 1974 at 10. 30 am the THE PRIME MINISTER said that the purpose of the meeting was to political give the Cabinet the opportunity for an early stocktaking of theSITUATION political and Parliamentary situation following the Election without having any papers before it.    The Government had an adequatemajority over the Conservative Party, and it seemed unlikely that allthe other Parties would ever combine to vote with the Conservativeson an issue of major importance.    Thus the Governments position was stronger than its overall majority might suggest.    the presentation of its policies should clearly be such as to achieve themaximum consensus in the country, but there seemed no need to adjust their programme on account of the Parliamentary situation.The Government should therefore proceed to implement itsManifesto in full.    He was grateful for the support of his colleagues in the Election campaign and the Government should now get down tothe job which lay before it.    He proposed to make only a few changesin his Ministerial team and hoped that these could be announced withinthe next two or three days.    Now that the Election was over thenormal rules about Ministerial acceptance of invitations to broadcastor give Press interviews would apply;  and it was also very   )important to maintain the cohesiveness of the Cabinet and observance of the rules about collective responsibility.    A new version of&quot;Questions of Procedure for Ministers&quot; would be circulated shortlyand careful attention should be given to it.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theCabinet as a whole would wish to congratulate the Prime Ministerboth on the result of the Election and on the part which he personallyhad played in achieving it.In the course of a general discussion it was noted that the Committeeon The Queen&apos;s Speech and the Future Legislative Programme hadalready been established.    The Committee would finish its work during the cour se of the pre sent week, and the Cabinet would then consider the legislative programme on 22 October and finalise
The Queen&apos;s Speech on 24 October.    This would allow account to betaken of views expressed at a meeting of the Parliamentary LabourParty early in the following week before the Cabinet finalised the queen&apos;s Speech.    The timetable for carrying out the governments policies would of course be settled in discussion of the futurelegislative programme.    The overall economic situation was an extremely difficult one and an argument could be mounted forconcentrating initially on uncontroversial measures which weredirectly relevant to it and postponing until a later date measureswhich might be both more controversial and less immediatelyessential.    In this context the public expenditure situation was relevant since if the Governments economic policies were to commandsuccess, public expenditure must be reined back in the earlier years in the belief that greater resources would become available later.On the other hand there were powerful arguments which pointed inthe opposite direction.    It was generally a sound strategy for aGovernment to carry its controversial legislation early in the lifetime of the Parliament, and this might be particularly relevant for thepresent Government, which could face a more difficult parliamentary situation in 1976 if by-election results went against them at a time before the benefits of North Sea oil began to be felt.    It was alsorelevant that the social contract comprised two parts: and the unionscould not be expected to observe continuing restraint on incomesunless the Government were seen to be acting on other matters towhich the trade union movement as a whole attached importance.The development of the social contract would clearly be of crucial importance.    The need to narrow differentials and to avoid leap-frogging would give rise to particular problems.    Leading membersof the Trades Union Congress were being as helpful as possible but their influence on particular claims was necessarily limited and ifrestraint did not continue through the spring of next year a veryserious situation would arise.    In this context the suggestion wasmade that, however much the Government might dislike the idea ofa return to statutory controls over incomes, they should notunalterably commit themselves against them.    On the other hand itwas argued strongly that such controls had been shown to be ineffective and that the Government was already so heavily committedagainst their reintroduction that it was unthinkable to imply that theymight be held in reserve.    Furthermore, if the impression weregiven that the Government would reintroduce such controls in theevent of the social contract breaking down, this would of itself destroy the social contract by encouraging a rush of pre-emptive claims.There was much to be said therefore for the Government nailing itscolours to the mast, although it was also argued that there was no need, at the present time, for mention to be made of either theexistence or the absence of a fall-back position.
The point was also made that a decision to proceed with theGovernments full Manifesto was not inconsistent with the desire which many people had for a greater sense of national unity.    TheConservative approach to this theme during the Election had however been no more than an attempt at a political contrivance bywhich to obtain power.    National unity could not be achieved in peacetime by inviting people of different views to partake inGovernment but by convincing the country as a whole that theGovernment had policies which would be fair to all.    A new consensushad to be struck and in this context there was general agreement thatthe line which the Prime Minister had taken in his Ministerialbroadcast the previous evening had been exactly right.    It was important when stressing the seriousness of the situation also to sound a note of hope.In further discussion the following main points were made -a. Very serious and urgent thought would have to begiven to the energy situation.     It was right to cover the oildeficit by borrowing and the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;sproposals about recycling surplus oil revenues had been generally welcomed by all countries at the recent international monetary Fund meeting except the United States.    A dialoguehad begun with the oil producers which we were in a goodposition to conduct as a future major oil producer ourselves.In due course North Sea oil should transform our position, butit would not be sufficient simply to borrow against it in themeantime.    We had also to take action to reduce consumption.This would involve both energy conservation measures and amore realistic approach to energy pricing.    The latter was desirable in the conservation context, but it might also enablemore to be spent on other socially desirable programmes by reducing subsidies to the nationalised industries.    A campaign for energy conservation might also be linked with a campaign against waste more generally.b. Despite what had been said earlier about the desirabilityof carrying controversial legislation early in the new parliament, it had to be remembered that the programme wasalso determined by the readiness of Bills and the availability of Parliamentary time.    Two major finance Bills and thearrangements being made for the scrutiny of european economic Community legislation would limit the number ofcontroversial Bills that could be passed in the next Session andit was arguable that the existing draft of The Queen&apos;s Speechalready had too much in it.    A particular problem might arise in the House of Lords: hitherto the Tory majority had been concerned to avoid provoking an early Election, but this
situation had now changed and the Conservative Front Benchmight have difficulty in controlling some of their backbenchers.It would also be important to try to ensure a reasonably evenflow of business in the House of Lords, perhaps by introducingsome Bills in that House.c. The Election results in Scotland were much better thanthey might have been, and great credit was due to theSecretary of State for Scotland.    Devolution had not featuredprominently in the Election campaign but in the present political situation it would be important to get on with theGovernments proposals for devolution as quickly as possible.In this context the Cabinet were informed that a new unit wasbeing established in the Cabinet Office to deal with long-termconstitutional questions including particularly the detailedworking out and management of the devolution process.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that it hadbeen a useful initial stocktaking.    A further opportunity for a general discussion in depth would occur at their next meeting when theCabinet would consider a paper which the Central Policy Review staff had prepared on strategy and priorities.    He also noted andwelcomed the suggestion which a number of his colleagues had madefor occasional all-day discussions at Chequers on major strategicissues.    He would like members of the Cabinet now to call in theirjunior Ministers and brief them generally on the Governmentsapproach.    In doing so, they should emphasise the commitment tothe Manifesto as a whole and the Governments intention to plan for afull Parliament.    The attention of junior Ministers should also be specifically drawn to the points he had made at the beginning of their discussion about the need for strict observance of the rules on procedure.Cabinet Office16 October 1974
