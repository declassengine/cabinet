UNITED 1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord PresidentKINGDOM of the Council (C(74) 87) on United Kingdom civil servants in NorthernCIVIL Ireland.servants in NORTHERN THE LORD PRESIDENT said that in May he had received a deputationIRELAND from the National Staff Side who had argued strongly in favour of along-standing claim for an additional one week&apos;s annual leave and aspecial allowance of  150 a year for all United Kingdom non-industrial civil servants serving in Northern Ireland.    The Staff Side had saidthat other good employers in the Province gave their staff additionalleave, cash bonuses or free holidays abroad; that government employees were subject to more stress than other people in Ulster;and that morale was at a low ebb.    He did not agree that civilservants were in fact under greater stress than the rest of theNorthern Ireland population, but it was certainly true that their conditions were worse than those of civil servants in other partsof the United Kingdom and there was some talk of industrial action.He had promised them that their case would be considered by ministers collectively.   Although the National Staff Side spokeonly for the 4, 000 non-industrial United Kingdom civil servantsserving in Northern Ireland, it would be necessary to extend any concessions to the 5, 000 industrial civil servants; the cost of an ex gratia payment of  100 each would be about  900,000 and thenotional cost of an extra week&apos;s leave would be about  350,000.The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland was concerned aboutthe possible repercussions, but if the Government did not give some such concession it would stand out as one of the few employers that had failed to do so.    There was also a Departmental claim on theCustoms and Excise Department for an allowance of  300 a year for the 200 staff employed at the land boundary posts.    These staff were exposed to particular danger and discomfort, but if a generalconcession were made on the lines that he had suggested, he would propose to reject any special concession to the land boundary men.THE MINISTER OF STATE, NORTHERN IRELAND OFFICE, saidthat his Secretary of State was against any concession to the UnitedKingdom civil servants in the Province because of the repercussions.Most of the civil servants in question were Irish and would expect to spend their whole careers in the Province.    Many of them were not under any particular stress.    If they received any specialconcession it would be necessary at once to discuss the similar treatment of the 30, 000 staff of the Northern Ireland Civil Service.There would then be a case for special treatment for the ambulance-men and the firemen, who faced greater dangers than the civilservants, and for the staffs of many of the other public services in the Province.    Because of under-staffing It might prove impossible to give leave concessions to the Northern Irelandpublic service so that a further cash concession might have tobe offered in lieu.    Finally the pressure would come on the
industrial firms in the Province, who had not so far followed thecommercial firms in offering special concessions to their staff.The total cost to Northern Ireland might amount to about  50 million a year.In discussion it was argued that the Cabinet should be guided by theSecretary of State for Northern Ireland, who was in a position to judge the repercussions in the Province,    There could moreoverbe repercussions in other parts of the United Kingdom if, forinstance, a terrorist campaign were mounted against the police.The proposal would lower the value of the existing concessions tothe Army and Post Office in Northern Ireland.    On the other hand it was argued that the United Kingdom civil servants in NorthernIreland had worked well throughout the recent disturbances.    Unlikemany of the staff of the Northern Ireland public services, they had notjoined in any political strike.    Good management practice required the Government to follow the other employers of comparable staff inoffering similar concessions, the repercussive effects of which hadbeen greatly exaggerated.    It was suggested that if extra leave orcash allowances were ruled out it would be worth consideringconcessions on travel, and that if there could be no generalconcession it would be right to do something for the land boundarymen, whose case was recognised by the trade unions as exceptional,and for the resident magistrates, who earned less than theirequivalents in Great Britain.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that although many members of the Cabinet clearly had doubts aboutthe proposals they ought to be examined on their merits by theOfficial Committee on Pay Negotiations.    Although it might becomerelevant to consider the special claims of particular groups like those that had been mentioned, the Committee should first consider thegeneral question of the proposed concessions to all United Kingdomcivil servants in Northern Ireland with a view to assessing asaccurately as possible what their repercussions would be.    TheOfficial Committee should report to the Sub-Committee on pay negotiations of the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy,and the question should be brought back to the Cabinet at thebeginning of September.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.2.        Invited the Official Committee on pay negotiations to proceed accordingly.2
2. THE PRIME MINISTER said that, following the issue in early-June of the Governments Consultation Document on Devolution,discussions with the interested bodies had been taking place inScotland and &quot;Wales, and their outcome had been considered bya small Ministerial Group under his chairmanship.    The group had then considered what should be the content of the White paper which the Government were committed to issue in the autumn.Very major issues were at stake - indeed, mishandling of thesituation could arguably lead in the long run to the break-up ofthe United Kingdom: and the Ministers concerned had been veryconscious of this danger and of the possible risk of embarking ona process of change which, once started, could not be halted.The Government were publicly committed against separatismand federalism, but on political grounds some move towardsdevolution was necessary.    The Ministerial Group had rejectedfull legislative devolution on the lines proposed in the majorityKilbrandon Report.    They had then considered the possibility ofsome form of modified legislative devolution, but this raisedsubstantial problems and the majority of the Ministerial Groupwere against any commitment to it.    They had therefore concluded that at this stage the Government should commit themselves only toproposing elected assemblies in Scotland and Wales, the former withsome legislative powers and the latter with mainly executive powers.This different treatment of the two countries could be justified on several grounds - the existence of a separate Scottish legal system and of separate Scottish statutes was one; and the differing wishesand expectations in the two countries was another.    Accordingly the ministerial Group had commissioned the preparation of two draft white Papers, one very short and doing little more than announce the decision about the establishment of elected assemblies, theother going into rather more detail.    It had been decided that the short version was preferable, but that it should be somewhatexpanded, in particular to indicate what had already been done or was being done within the existing constitutional frameworkin order to increase the extent to which decisions affecting Scotlandand Wales were taken in Scotland and Wales, while at the same timestressing the importance of preserving both the unity of the UnitedKingdom and the principle that the economy must be managed on a united Kingdom basis,    It would probably also be desirable to refer to the continuance of the two Secretaries of State and to the retentionof Scottish and Welsh reprt sentation in the United kingdom parliament at its present level.    A short White Paper giving a general statement of principle on these lines should be sufficientto meet the immediate political requirement while leaving theGovernment the maximum room for manoeuvre after the Election.In discussion it was argued that the Government should have more time to weigh a decision of such historical importance and that itwas regrettable that their hand had to some extent been forced by
external political pressures.    In the circumstances they had to beel alive to political realities: but it would be important for theproposed White Paper to assert the positive argument for the integrity of the United Kingdom and to relate the case for elected assemblies in Scotland and Wales to the problems which would be involved,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet need take no final decision at this stage.    Further work should however proceed on the basis of a short White paper containing a genaral statement of intent to establish elected assemblies in Scotland and Wales, the former with somelegislative powers and the latter with mainly executive powers.It should emphasise the importance of preserving the unity of theUnited Kingdom and should also bring out what was separately being done to benefit Scotland and Wales.    The two Secretaries of Statewere already revising the sections of prime concern to them: theyshould do so in the light of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion and should alsoconsult the Chancellor of the Exchequer.    A revised version of thedraft White Paper would be considered by the Ministerial Group atthe end of August which would enable account to be taken ofdiscussion at the Scottish Labour Party Conference in mid-August.Following that the matter would come before the Cabinet for a finaldecision with a view to publication of the White Paper in the first part of September.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister *summing up of their discussion.
jlanningig-reementsnd&apos; thejUTIONALInterpriseidard3.        The Cabinet considered two notes by the Secretary of theCabinet, C(74) 88, to which were attached draft sections of a white paper on Planning Agreements and the National Enterprise Board(not), and C(74) 89, to which were attached draft introductoryparagraphs for the White Paper, prepared by the Secretary of Statefor Industry,THE PRIME MINISTER said that a first draft of the White Paper had come before the Ministerial Committee on Industrial Development(IDV) on 28 June,    In the light of their discussion he had prepared afresh outline which had been agrec-d by IDV on 9 July and given to officials as a guideline in preparing a further complete draft.    Asmall group of Ministers under his chairmanship, comprising theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for Employment,the Secretary of State for Industry and the Secretary of State for prices and Consumer Protection had discussed this draft on 29 july and a further draft, reflecting their decisions, had been considered at IDV on 31 July.    The draft attached to C(74) 88 reflected the weightof opinion in IDV on the main issues arising from Planning agreements and the not.    The introductory paragraphs would be consequential onthe decisions reached on the main text; he suggested therefore thatthe Cabinet should first discuss Planning Agreements and the not.lanninggreementsIn discussion the following main points were made -a.        In the absence of a statutory requirement some otherleverage was needed to ensure that firms entered intoPlanning Agreements with the Government.    For thesefirms, some proportion of the grants normally payable under the authority of the Industry Act 1972 should be madenegotiable.    In return, the company could be assured thatthe rate of grant for projects embarked on under the agreement would not fall below the rates in force at the time of theAgreement.    Labour&apos;s Programme 1973 had specificallystated that all incentives and aid to companies should bechannelled through the Planning Agreements system; theprodigality of the present system has been sharply criticised by the Select Committee on Trade and Industry,    If the white paper failed to put forward any proposal to control thismassive outflow of public funds, people in the regions would see it as a totally missed opportunity on the part of theGovernment.    On the other hand, it was strongly argued that business confidence would be severely damaged by the implication that investment grants and other automaticpayments would depend, for firms in the planning agreements system, on the discretion of a Ministerrather than, being received as a right derived from an act of Parliament.    The Government should recognise
that conditions had completely changed since Labour&apos;programme 1973 had been prepared; business confidencehad declined to ah alarming degree and further chopping andchanging in Government policy would be disastrous.    Thedraft should therefore make it clear that investment grants,regional development aid and Regional Employment Premium(REP) were not at issue, but that the Government wouldassess with the company its needs for assistance to supportcompany plans, with particular reference to selectiveassistance for new employment projects in the regions.b. The need for a far-ranging review of regional aidwas generally agreed, but it was pointed out that to announce this would create uncertainty &quot;and be detrimental to businessconfidence.    No statement about the review should be made until an alternative system had been thought out,c. Assistance for small businesses should be givengreater prominence, and the Governments considerationof their problems should be specifically mentioned.A number of other amendments were discussed and agreed.In discussion the following main points were made -d. The degree to which the not would be subject to parliamentary and Governmental control should be givengreater emphasis.e. It should be emphasised that the intention was thatall holdings in companies, whether 100 per cent or in part,would be acquired by agreement; the drafting of paragraph 20should be amended to avoid ambiguity on this.f. In its existing form, paragraph 23 would causeuncertainty over the circumstance s in which the government might choose to exercise compulsory acquisition, and whatParliamentary authority would be sought.    It would be preferable to say that, if in any case compulsory acquisitionproved to be necessary, this would normally be authorised byspecific Act of Parliament.    The rights of private interests to represent their case against compulsory acquisition mustbe strenuously safeguarded.g. Paragraph 32 should be expanded to cover the specialcircumstances of Northern Ireland, and to allow for similar arrangements to those in Scotland to be made for Wales, onthe analogy of the reference to Wales in the Secretary of Statefor Energy&apos;s report to Parliament on United Kingdom offshore1    oil and gas.
A number of other amendments were discussed and agreed.h.        A revision of the paragraphs covered in C(74) 89 was circulated by the Prime Minister and agreed, subject to minorchanges&apos; V- &apos; II - &apos;THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that investment grants, regional aid and REP shouldnot be made conditional for firms in the Planning Agreements system.The Government would assess with companies their need for anyfurther assistance to their plans with particular reference to newemployment projects in the regions.    The Government should undertake a review of automatic grants to industry, but this shouldnot be mentioned in the White Paper.    Further consideration shouldbe given to helping small businesses, and a clear reference to thisshould be made.    The Secretary of State for Industry would of coursealso be free to report to the Cabinet on the working of the scheme inthe light of experience, but it would be important not to imply in public that modifications might be contemplated.ii      &quot;&apos;The not should operate in pursuit of its objectives, as defined and expanded in discussion.    If compulsory acquisition proved to be necessary, it would normally be by specific Act of Parliament.The Secretary of State for Industry should arrange for his officials toconsider further, in consultation with the First parliamentary counsel, the procedure to be adopted in cases of extreme urgency.The arrangements for Northern Ireland and Wales should be statedin greater detail.The Secretary of the Cabinet should arrange for a further draft,incorporating the revisions agreed at the meeting, to be prepared and circulated to the Cabinet on 5 August.    If necessary, the smalldrafting group of Ministers would meet on 6 August to consider any outstanding textual issues.    Subject to such clearance, the Secretaryof State for Industry should arrange for the White Paper to bepublished.    It was important that Ministers should adhere to the policies now agreed for Planning Agreements and the MEB in public speeches.    The Secretary of State for Industry should consider, inconsultation with the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, whethera popular version of the White Paper might be published by the LabourParty; it should not however be issued as a Government document nor should the cost of producing it fall on public funds.    It would benecessary however for the text of any popular version to be clearedwith himself and other Ministers concerned.
The Cabinet -1, Took note, with approval of the prime minister s summing up of their discussion.2.        Invited the Secretary of State for Industry -i. To arrange for the first parliamentary Counsel to be consulted on Parliamentary arrangements for compulsory acquisition- in circumstancesof compelling urgency.ii. Subject to final clearance of the textby Ministers, to arrange in consultation withthe Lord President of the Council for theWhite Paper on Planning Agreements andthe National Enterprise Board to be published.iii. In consultation with the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary to consider whethera popular version of the White Paper might bepublished under the auspices of the LabourParty.3,        Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet toarrange for a revised text of the White Paper,incorporating the amendments agreed at their meeting, to be prepared and circulated on 5 August.
4, The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Industry (C(74) 86) about possible changes to assisted areaboundaries.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY recalled that at their discussion on 11 July, the Cabinet had decided not to pursue for thetime being any changes in assisted area boundaries, but had recognised that the question might need to be reopened in thelight of the economic measures -which the Chancellor of the exchequer had then been preparing.    In the event, these measures hadsignificantly strengthened the case for making some immediatechanges in assisted area boundaries; particularly the doublingof the Regional Employment Premium (REP), which had increased substantially the financial advantage to manufacturing industry of thedevelopment areas (DAs) over the intermediate areas (IAs), and hadalready brought strong representations from Edinburgh and to a lesser extent from Cardiff and Newport.    He believed that the case for upgrading Edinburgh, Leith and Portobello was now overwhelming,and the case for Cardiff was closely linked politically with that forEdinburgh.    Mersey side and North West Wales would both gain fromthe doubling of REP, but their position relative to the rest of the DAswas unchanged, and the urgent need for further action remained.The position of Chesterfield was a major anomaly, and it was generally accepted that if any areas were to be upgraded thenChesterfield should be given IA status at the same time.    Thecost of these measures would now be some  25 million a year;they could be made by Statutory Instrument, which could be laidand brought into force in the Recess,    There were alreadyindications that further measures might be needed to assistthe regions over the problems of the coming winter.    Theseproposals were a means by which some real good could be doneimmediately to areas in need.    He therefore invited the Cabinetto agree to the immediate upgrading of Mersey side, North west wales, the Scottish IA, the Cardiff travel-to-work area, andChesterfield.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the proposed changes would further dilute the effectiveness of regional benefits and would stimulate new demands for upgradings elsewhere.    Indeed,such changes would be an extension of the indiscriminate andunselective aid which had been criticised during the Cabinet&apos;discussion earlier that morning.    The measures he had recently announced had made a significant Improvement in the position ofMersey side and North West Wales: for example, the doubling ofREP would bring an extra  20 million a year to Mersey side,compared with about  2 million which would come from upgradingit to a special development area (SDA),    It would be preferable to review the matter again at a later stage when the possibility ofcompensating downgradings could be considered.    In the meantime,he urged the Cabinet to reaffirm their, earlier decision not to makeany changes at present.
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that theproblems of Edinburgh had begun in 1963, and had been accentuated by the previous Administration^ decision not to proceed with the plans to site a large tax office there.    The doubling of REP had now put industry in the Edinburgh area at a severe competitivedisadvantage compared with the whole of the rest of Scotland andthe North of England.    Male unemployment in Edinburgh was higher than the average rate for the whole of Scotland, and doublethat for the United Kingdom.    Merseyside and Cardiff were due to benefit from the disperal of Government jobs.    There was an overwhelming case on merits, therefore, for the upgrading of edinburgh.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WALES said that although he had modified his original proposals for changes in Wales,he must continue to press for the upgrading of North West wales and Cardiff.    North West Wales was indeed an outstanding anomaly,where unemployment now ranged between 8.5 and 9.5 per cent;  and though the absolute cost of conferring SDA status would be small, theeffect in psychological terms would be very marked.    LikeEdinburgh, the position of Cardiff in relation to the surroundingarea had been significantly worsened as a result of the doublingof REP, and the high rate of male unemployment there was not likely to be improved by the jobs available from the dispersal ofGovernment offices.    Nor would it be feasible, on broad political grounds, to discriminate between the treatment of Cardiff and edinburgh.THE LORD PRESIDENT, summing up the discussion, said thatwhile they recognised the need, in the longer term, for a morethorough review of assisted area boundaries, the Cabinet agreed on balance that the doubling of REP made some immediate changesnecessary; and they accepted that the proposed package had to beconsidered as a whole.    They therefore approved the changes nowproposed by the Secretary of State for Industry,    The Secretary ofState for Industry should agree the terms of a suitable announcementwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the other ministers concerned, and consult him about its timing.The Cabinet -1. Agreed that Merseyside and North West wales should become special development areas, thatEdinburgh, Leith and Portobello and the Cardifftravel-to-work area should become development areas, and that Chesterfield should become an intermediate area.10confidential
2.        Invited the Secretary of State for Industry,in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer,and the Secretaries of State for Employment, forScotland and for Wales, to prepare a suitableannouncement, and consult the Lord Presidentof the Council about its timing.Cabinet Office2 August 197411
