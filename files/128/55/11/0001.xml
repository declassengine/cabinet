secretary sir John HuntSUBJECTDISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT
THE PRIME MINISTER informed the Cabinet that The Queenhad agreed to his request that Parliament should be dissolved:and this would be announced at 12.45 pm that day.    It was unnecessary to recall Parliament for prorogation, and parliament would be dissolved at a meeting of the Privy Council on20 September.    Polling in the General Election would take placeon 10 October:  the first meeting of the new Parliament would beon 22 October: and the State Opening of Parliament would be on29 October.The Prime Minister said that during the election campaign theGovernment retained its responsibility to govern and Ministersremained in charge of their Departments.    Furthermore, theprinciple of collective responsibility continued to apply, althoughit would be natural to expect Ministers to range wider than wasnormally customary in their speeches.    But while it was essential for the Government to continue to function throughout the campaign,it was customary for Ministers to observe reasonable discretion as regards the initiation of any new action of a continuing orlong term character and also in the making of new appointmentseg to statutory boards for which they were answerable.    Indischarging Government engagements Ministers should seek toavoid creating any impression that they were using such occasionsfor Party political purposes: and before undertaking to fulfilany international commitments they should consider carefullywhether the subject matter was such that they could speak withthe authority proper to a representative of Her Majesty1 sGovernment.    But clearly international discussions had to continue and Ministerial attendance at some meetings might be necessary.As soon as the dissolution had been announced, memoranda wouldbe circulated to the Cabinet advising them of certain arrangements which, by long convention, were made during the period of an election.    An Election Business Committee was being established under the chairmanship of the Lord Chancellor, with the secretaries of State for Prices and Consumer Protection, Tradeand Education and Science and the Lord Privy Seal as members,which would provide the framework for the clearance of statements of policy by the Government, would co-ordinate as appropriatecomments from Departments on the guidance prepared for the useof Government Party candidates in dealing with enquiries put tothem during the election campaign, and would consider repliesby Departments to similar enquiries from Opposition Partycandidates, organisations and members of the public.    guidance on the operation of this Committee, which was in practice unlikely to have to meet frequently, was being circulated separately.Guidance was also being circulated to Ministers on the use of official transport during the campaign and on the arrangementsfor broadcasting, Press articles and interviews by Ministers.DISSOLUTIONofPARLIAMENT
He hoped that his colleagues would study this guidance with care and would also hear in mind the importance of carefully checkingboth their facts and the policy line in their campaign speeches.The recent White Papers and the Manifesto would often provide sufficient guidance but in any case of doubt the point should be checked through the medium of the Election Business committee or direct with the Departmental Ministers concerned.    His ownOffice would be functioning at 10 Downing Street throughout the campaign.    It was essential for the Government to maintain a united front, to avoid making promises which had not beencollectively approved and also to avoid leakage of confidential information.    No meetings of the Cabinet were at present plannedduring the election campaign but if urgent issues of government business arose, which required collective consideration, he hoped that Ministers would leave it to him to decide whether aspecial meeting of the Cabinet should be held or whether improvisedarrangements for collective consideration should be made.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the statement by thePrime Minister.Cabinet Office18 September 1974
