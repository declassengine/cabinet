1. THE PRIME MINISTER said that because of the veryconsiderable volume of business which would have to be dealtwith during the next two or three weeks it would be necessaryfor the Cabinet to have more than two meetings during thecoming week, and the week following that.    The possibilitycould not be excluded that the Cabinet would have to meetduring the week beginning 5 August.2.        The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenin the House of Commons during the following week.    It was reported that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was proposing to make an important economic statement on 22 July.    on present plans it was likely that the House would rise for the summer Recess not later than Thursday, 1 August.    It wouldbe helpful if before then time could be found for at least theSecond Reading of the Education (Awards and Grants) Bill.It was unlikely that this measure would be politicallycontroversial.
NORTHERN 3.        THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Secretary of StateIRELAND for Northern Ireland would make a statement in the House ofCommons on 22 July announcing that the shipbuilding firm ofHarland and Wolff Limited was being brought under publicHarland and Wolff      control.    The financial position of the company was such thatin the absence of a major intervention by the Government itwould be forced into liquidation, with serious political, social and security consequences for Northern Ireland and Belfast inparticular.    United Kingdom and Northern Ireland Governmentheld loans would be converted to enable us to obtain 90 per cent of the equity in the company through the acquisition of votingshares.    An examination of Northern Ireland expenditure would be made by the Secretary of State for Northern Irelandand the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to ensure that expenditure was subjected to rigorous scrutiny, and in particular to findsavings to offset the cost of rescuing Harland and Wolff fromcollapse.
FOREIGNAFFAIRSCyprusPreviousReference:CC(74) 26thConclusions,Minute 14 THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe internal situation in Cyprus appeared to be quiet: the illegal regime, with the support of the Greek-officered National Guard,seemed to have the country under control.    But the situation could develop quickly and dangerously.    He was arranging for publicadvice to be given to intending holiday makers not to travel to the island.    The Prime Minister and he had held talks with thePresident of Cyprus, Archbishop Makarios, the previous day, and *the President was now travelling to New York to attend a meeting ofthe Security Council.    They had discussed with him the terms of apossible resolution.    They had also had separate meetings with thePrime Minister of Turkey, Mr  Eceyit, whose approach to thesituation was marked by a degree of caution.    The Turkish Ministerof Defence, Mr Isik, who was also acting Foreign Minister, had however taken a less restrained line.    He would be seeing Mr Isikagain later that day.    The Turks were envisaging the possibility that they might be obliged to invade Cyprus for the sake of theTurkish Cypriot community there, who, according to some reports,had already suffered maltreatment at the hands of the NationalGuard.    The Turks showed interest in the possibility ofco-ordinating military measures bilaterally with us.    The GreekGovernment were apprehensive lest the Turks should invade Cyprus,and were showing some nervousness about Mr Ecevifs visit toLondon.    Brigadier Ionnides had asked to see our Ambassador who,when he called on him later in the day, would say that he was unable to provide any information about our talks with the Turks,but that if Brigadier lonnides wished to visit London the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary would be willing to meet him.    Thequestion arose whether we should issue a positive invitation to the greeks to come here for talks.    No useful purpose would be served,however, if they were to send civilian members of their Government,since these had no influence.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that United states policy was not entirely clear.    The Under Secretary of State,Mr Sisco, had come to London for discussions and he would seek to persuade Mr Sisco to go to Athens to put pressure on the GreekGovernment to withdraw the Greek officers from the CyprtuBNational Guard.    He would also ask the Americans to put themaximum pressure on the Turkish Government not to invade Cyprus.In our view a resolution in the Security Council should include threeelements: continued recognition of Archbishop Makarios as thelegally elected President;   a call on the Greek Government towithdraw their officers from the National Guard; and a call for therestoration of legal government in Cyprus.    In the unlikely eventthat the Greeks agreed to withdraw the officers, the illegalgovernment would probably not survive for very long and PresidentMakarios might well be able to return to Cyprus and resume theGovernment.secret
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatwe were inevitably much involved in the problems created by the overthrow of President Makarios.    The existence of our SovereignBase Areas in Cyprus and the presence there of our forces and their families was one aspect of our involvement, and studies were beingmade urgently of the implications of military intervention, whetheror not we participated in it.    We also contributed to the united nations Force in Cyprus.    We were fellow members of theCommonwealth and, together with Greece and Turkey, we wereguarantors of the I960 Treaty.    A number of countries were pressingus to take the lead.    The Soviet Ambassador, who had delivered a message to him from Mr Brezhnev earlier in the week, had now asked to see him again.    It was entirely in accord with our positionas guarantors of the Treaty that we should pursue consultations with Turkey and Greece.    But military intervention by us or theTurks, separately or together, would not be desirable.    If diplomaticpressures on Greece failed, and military action against Cyprus hadto be contemplated, this should be a United Nations decision and operation.    We had, however, made some precautionary naval dispositions and were studying the possible usefulness of an inter -national blockade to sever communications between Greece and cyprus.    He had decided to establish a small group of Ministers tokeep the situation under review, and to meet at short notice ifnecessary.    No important decisions would be taken without referenceto the Cabinet.The Cabinet -1.    Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.european community:BeefArrangementsPreviousReference:CC(74) 25thConclusions,Minute 2The Cabinet discussed the decisions on arrangements for beefunder the Common Agricultural policy  (CAP) which were taken atthe Council of Ministers (Agriculture) on 15-16 July;    It was argued that despite our success in getting agreement to a scheme of directpremia for beef producers, it was disturbing that the community had decided to suspend imports of beef.   This was contrary to the government&apos;s stance on renegotiation of import arrangements underthe CAP.On the other hand it was argued that failure to achieve the schemefor producer premia could have led to disorderly marketing overthe next few months and subsequently to serious shortages forconsumers.    The suspension of imports would have little practical effect on supplies since it was temporary, and did not apply to existing licences or to supplies of frozen beef entering levy freeunder the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) quota.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said theCabinet were agreed that although the Community decision to suspendimports was regrettable it was an acceptable price to pay for the major success of securing agreement to the premia arrangements.It did not prejudice our requirements for long term changes in import arrangements under the CAP.    In the public presentation of the results of the Council Meeting we should exploit the Ministerof Agriculture&apos;s success in renegotiating a fundamental part of the cap arrangements.    The question of whether we should implement the proposals for cheap beef for people receiving social benefits would need to be discussed further and he would arrange for it to be examined by a small group of Ministers under the Chairmanship ofthe Minister of Agriculture.The Cabinet -Z.      Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of the discussion.
MEMBERS1 AND 5. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by thePEERS&apos; Lord President of the Council (C(74) 71) about Members1ALLOWANCES allowances and by the Lord Privy Seal (C(74) 75) about Peers&apos;allowances.previous reference: THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that theCC(74) 16th Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB) had now submitted its conclusions, Report on Members&apos; allowances.    They proposed to increaseMinute 5 the car allowance (from 5p to 7. 7p per mile), the secretarialallowance (from  1, 000 to  1, 750), the additional costsallowance for Members living outside London (from  750 to 1, 050 per annum) and the London supplement for Memberslining in London (from  175 per annum to  228 per annum).In addition they proposed altering the boundary rules for theLondon supplement to avoid any Member falling between the boundaries for the London and additional costs allowance.The increases did no more than make good the loss in purchasing power since they were raised to their present levelnearly three years ago and he proposed that they should beaccepted and implemented from 1 August.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that, as agreed by the Cabinet at its earlier discussion, he had announced in May, when Members1allowances were referred to the TSRB, that an increase in thePeers&apos; allowance would also be considered.    In the light of theTSRB Report now received and the proposals for Members&apos;allowances he proposed that the Peers&apos; daily allowance shouldalso be increased from 1 August from  8. 50 to  11. 50, thecurrent rate of the Civil Service subsistence allowance to whichit v/as linked.    The present allowance was, however,unsatisfactory from the standpoint of Peers living outside london, whose expenses were very much greater, and he proposed, therefore, that the TSRB should be asked to review the whole basis of the allowance, and in particular thepossibility of a differential allowance.In discussion it was argued that the proposed increases were substantial in percentage terms and that in the present economicsituation it would be better to defer their announcement until after the Recess,    On the other hand it should be made clearthat Members were not getting an increase in their basic pay,that the allowances were to meet actual expenses, and that theincrease in the secretarial allowance in particular was essential if Members were to be able to employ secretaries at current rates i  pay.    As to the Peers&apos; daily allowance, there were strong arguments against improving this in its present formsince it gave an easily-acquired payment to any Peer living inLondon who attended the House, while failing to meet the realneeds of Peers whose homes were outside London.      It would
be better, therefore, to refer the allowance to the TSRB and make no increase in the payment for the few days remainingbefore the Recess.    As against this, the Government hadalready committed itself to considering an increase in this allowance concurrently with the increase in Members1 allowances and there were many Peers, especially among those supporting the Government in its legislative programme, who urgently needed an increase to enable them to meet the expenses theywere incurring.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said theCabinet were agreed that Members1 allowances should beincreased from 1 August as proposed by the TSRB.    particular care should be taken, however, in presenting the increases toemphasise that the basic pay of Members was not being increased,that the allowances were to meet expenses actually incurred andthat the amount of the increase proposed by the TSRB and accepted by the Government did no more than compensate forthe higher costs of these items.    As to the proposed increasein the Peers&apos; allowance, it was agreed that the whole basis ofthe allowance should be reviewed by the TSRB and that some increase was urgently needed in the allowance for Peers livingoutside London.   There were substantial arguments in favour of deferring any general increase until af tjr the Recess, so thatthe TSRB could by then have made recommendations which provided for provincial differentiation; but on balance theCabinet concluded that it was preferable to announce now, asproposed, a general increase in the allowance from 1 Augusttogether with a review by the TSRB with particular referenceto the problems of Peers living outside London.    The increase for both Members and Peers should be announced concurrently.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theLord President and the Lord Privy Seal to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office .18 July 1974
