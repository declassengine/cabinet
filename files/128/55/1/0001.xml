1. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN and commonwealth AFFAIRS said that, contrary to earlierinformation, it now seemed that the President of Cyprus,Archbishop Makarios, was still alive.    The Greek Governmentwere playing down the events in Cyprus, but it was clear that theywere in some degree involved.    He had sent a message the previous day through Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Athens to the ActingForeign Minister, and had now instructed the Ambassador to followthis up with a request that the Greek Government should make apublic statement affirming in unambiguous terms their respect forthe independence, the territorial integrity and the security of cyprus.    The Ambassador would alsd suggest that the presentGreek officers should be withdrawn from the Cypriot National Guard.The Turkish Government who, together with the Greeks and ourselves were guarantors of the I960 Treaty, had so far behavedwith admirable restraint, but the situation was grave and potentiallyexplosive.   A number of other countries had expressed their concern, including the Soviet Union,    He had also been in touch withthe Secretary General of the United Nations, Dr Waldheim, who didnot think it wise at this stage to convene a meeting of the Governmentscontributing to the United Nations Force in Cyprus; it was right to respect his judgment that it would be better to wait, at least until we saw how the Greeks responded to our request for a public statementof their position.    Similarly a meeting of the United Nations security council would be premature.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that developments would have to be followed closely.    The situation waspotentially very dangerous.    In addition to the British forces stationed in Cyprus, numbering some 8, 000, there was a largenumber of British subjects on the Island and we must be ready to implement our contingency plans if the need should arise.    TheForeign and Commonwealth Secretary would be making a further statement in Parliament that afternoon.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion..1
2.        The Cabinet considered a note by the Lord Chancellor(C(74) 72) to which was attached a draft negotiating brief on Concordefor the Prime Minister&apos;s forthcoming discussions with the Presidentof France.THE LORD CHANCELLOR recalled that the Cabinet had invited himto arrange for the Ministerial Committee on the Concorde Projectto consider the negotiating brief for the Prime Ministerrsforthcoming discussions with the President of France, and submitit for their approval.    The draft brief before them had beenunanimously agreed by the Committee.    It recommended that the objectives should be to rehearse the major problems concerning thecontinuance of the programme; to test the strength of french resistance to the British Government1 s preferred course of outrightcancellation; to agree, if the French were immovable, to complete the production of 16 aircraft but no more, and seek their agreement to this;  and to secure agreement in principle to a new agreement(probably by Exchange of Letters) which would take the new situationfully into account and modify the 1962 Treaty as necessary.    He hadone detailed amendment to propose to paragraph 6(f) of the draftbrief, concerning a possible re sumption of the programme after16 aircraft had been completed.    The second sentence should read:&quot;But any agreement to authorise further production or developmentmust clearly define the commitment of the parties&quot;.In discussion the view was expressed that it was regrettable thatthe Cabinet had to decide this issue before they were able to considerPublic Expenditure as a whole.    When the Public Expenditure Surveycame before them it would be all too apparent that in the current economic climate many programmes of social value and deepconcern to a Labour Administration must be curtailed or forgone,and there would then be great regret at the extent to which Concordelimited the Government&apos;s room for manoeuvre:  cancellation even now would save between  100 and  250 million.    Some disquiet wasalso expressed about the tone of the brief.    There seemed to be a danger of blurring the Cabinet&apos;s previous decision to limit theprogramme to 16 aircraft and that only if the French refused toagree to cancellation.    The French were proceeding with theprogramme on the assumption that we would always acquiesce ina course which they had chosen and which we could not afford: andwe would never regain our negotiating freedom until this bluff was called.    There should be no que stion of entertaining any furtherproduction beyond 16 aircraft, except in the remote contingency offirm orders coming forward in sufficient quantity to makecontinuation an economic proposition.    Nor should it be thoughtthat agreement now to complete the production of 16 aircraft wouldbe the end of the problem.    Work was already running down inToulouse (which accounted for the French Government&apos;s eagerness2
to build another 3 aircraft) and Weybridge, and early next year itwould begin to do so at Bristol.    In a year&apos;s time the Governmentwould face exactly the same dilemma and there would again be similar pressures to continue the programme.On the other hand it was argued that production of all the 16aircraft was now well advanced, and the programme could only be cancelled in any meaningful sense by locking the gates anddismantling the half-completed aircraft.    So drastic a step -- whichwould disrupt the French part of the programme as well as ourown, since each aircraft was partly built in each country - wouldhave the widest political implications.There was general agreement that if the programme were tocontinue, there must be stringent conditions about the circumstances in which it would do so, and the extent of our obligations.    Weshould be enabled to withdraw if, for example, there were largecost overruns;  above all, the French Government must be broughtto realise - a point the brief did not make - that landing rights at new York, which were still to be secured, were crucial to thewhole future of the project.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet had already decided that if the French Government refusedto cancel Concorde, the programme to complete 16 aircraft shouldcontinue and that decision should not be reopened now.    But he andthe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary well appreciated the concern expressed by a number of their colleagues about theeconomic consequences of continuing the Concorde programme,and would bear in mind the points which had been made in discussion in their discussions with the French President about the future ofthe programme.The Cabinet -. ;i      II - ,.      -1. Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister,2.        Approved C(74) 72, subject to theamendment of paragraph 6(f) indicated by theLord Chancellor.
3,        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Employment (C(74) 74) on London weighting.TKS SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that theTrades Union Congress (TUC) had now decided to hold aconference of unions the following day on the subject.    Theconference would probably result in the TUC General Secretaryasking for an explicit assurance that the Pay Board report was not seen by the Government as a straitjacket but simply as guidance to negotiators.    He recommended that he should be allowed togive such an assurance if asked.    He should try to maintain theapparently contradictory principles that the recommendations ofthe Pay Board ought to be applied but that negotiations would stillbe free.    This meant that the Government could give guidance on negotiations in the public sector but should not try to impose anyabsolute limit or exercise any veto on the results of thenegotiations.    The Government as employer should still try toget settlements consistent with the Pay Board&apos;s principles and ought not themselves to make the breach.  But the London weightingarrangements likely to be adopted by the London clearing bankswere in excess of the limits in the Pay Board report; theGovernment should not therefore adopt an attitude so rigid thatit would be put in an untenable position if the banks or otherseventually breached recommendations of the report.In discussion it was generally agreed that where the Governmentwas the employer it should not set an example of breaching thereport.    The difficulty was that for the teachers and the police the Government was not the employer.    It was argued that withoutexercising any veto, the aim of the Government should be to induce the employers to keep as close as possible to the financial Hmitsrecommended in the report, so that the estimated total cost of 154 million would not be exceeded.    Under the social contractthe trade unions ought to be ready to agree that the sole purposeof the allowance was to compensate for the additional cost of living in London.    Many people in Scotland and the regions were doubtfulwhether this difference was as great as the Pay Board had estimated, and the trade unions whose members worked outside london might well consider the recommendations too generous.It would appear illogical for the Government to try to limit thetotal awards to the police and the teachers but not those to the localauthority staff, since the same local authorities were theemployers of all three groups.    The Local Authorities Conditionsof Service Advisory Board (LACSAB) had asked to see the PrimeMinister so as to ensure that there would be no leap-frogging of claims.    The National and Local Government Officers&apos; Association(NALGO), which had rejected the social contract, had chosen to4
make their first attack on the gas industry with the aim of breaking the policy; they had withdrawn from negotiations and wereballoting for a strike.   The Pay Board report presented theGovernment with a clear issue; and if they would not stand firm on this issue it was hard to see where they would ever take a stand.On the other hand it was argued that, although there was a good case against giving any allowance for London weighting, theGovernment had to deal with the situation which they had inheritedand they could not now abandon the principle of compensation thatwas the basis of the Pay Board report.   By dealing with this issuebefore the social contract came into effect the Government hadavoided making any breach in the contract.    To impose any rigidlimit would be the denial of free negotiations; but this did not mean that every claim should be conceded.    It was to be hoped thatthe employers would resist the claims of NALGO.    The aim should be to stick to the principles in the Pay Board report but tobe prepared to give a little extra sometimes where this wasnecessary to reach a settlement.    The edges of the policy mightbe somewhat blurred but a blurred policy was better than an industrial confrontation.    The Government was engaged in a newexperiment in free bargainings having in mind the limits thataggregate earnings should not exceed.    Sometimes it would becheaper to settle a claim and sometimes not.    But if at the end ofthe year it turned out that the average level of settlements hadbeen too high the experiment would be seen as a failure.As regards the private sector it was argued that the expectedaction by the banks and insurance companies would make it moredifficult for the Government to hold the line.    These institutions and also the oil companies had not had their profits significantly reduced by price control and could afford to be generous in their pay settlements: other companies were already in difficultiesbecause of the threshold arrangements.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that on balance the Cabinet had accepted the proposals of the Secretary ofState for Employment although it was clear that some ministers were deeply concerned about the implications of Government policyin this field.    They agreed that, although there must be flexibility,the aim should be to keep any excess over the limits in the pay board report to a minimum.    The. Secretary of State for employment should meet LACSAB and persuade them toco-ordinate their policies on these lines.   As regards the private sector, the Treasury should consider whether any means could befound to deter the financial institutions from paying over the oddsand also whether any further inducements or sanctions should beadopted in order to persuade firms in the private sector to dispersetheir staffs outside London.5
The Cabinet -1. Took note with approval of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Ministerand invited the Secretary of State for employment to proceed accordingly.2.        Invited the Chancellor of the exchequer to consider the points relating to the private    usector mentioned in the Prime Minister&apos;summing up.6
4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Trade (C(74) 73) about the review of the Maplin airportproject,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that the review ofthe Maplin airport project which he had announced on 21 March hadbeen completed, and a report by officials would shortly be ready for publication.    The central finding of the report was that there hadbeen a fundamental change in the forecast number of air trafficmovements.    Because of the higher price of fuel and the increasinguse of wider-bodied aircraft, the forecasts were now significantlylower, and no need was seen for further runway! capacity in theSouth-East before 1990,    The report had gone on to examine anumber of options, but the basic choice was between building Maplinairport, which would allow Luton and Stansted to be closed to air transport, or abandoning Maplin and redistributing the growth in air traffic, mostly among the existing London area airports.    while some traffic might be diverted to regional airports, the scope for relief in this way appeared to be limited.    The question of noisewould remain a sensitive issue, and a decision to abandon Maplinwould be opposed by those who lived around the existing airports;on the other hand Maplin was much more expensive than any of theother options.    He had discussed the matter with the ministerial committee on Economic Policy, which had agreed to recommend thatthe Maplin airport project should be abandoned.    He proposed to announce this in a Parliamentary statement on the lines of the draft attached to C(74) 73, and to publish the report by officials, ifpossible on Thursday 18 July.    Further work would be done on theuse of regional airports, and he would initiate consultations withthose concerned on the alternative options to Maplin.    It waspossible that there would be a demand for a debate, and he recommonded that time should be allowed for this, preferablyafter the Recess.In discussion, it was argued that aircraft noise was already a source of great resentment among those living around the existingLondon area airports, and abandonment of Maplin would be strongly criticised in those areas.    Expansion of the existing London areaairports would also absorb workers needed for the expansion oflocal industry.    On the other hand, the Cabinet1 s discussion ofLondon weighting had underlined the need to avoid concentration inthe South-East, and this should also be borne in mind when the futureof the Maplin seaport project came to be decided.    The Governmentshould urgently seek ways of restricting any further expansion ofthe London area airports, and of encouraging the greater use of regional airports, which were generally further from centres of population.    It might be preferable for some people in the South-east to have to start their journeys at regional airports, rather than,&apos;   7
as now, people from the regions having to travel to London.    Inparticular, the possibility should be examined of imposing a financial disincentive to the use of the London area airports.    Whilespecific proposals to this effect could not be included in theforthcoming statement, it should be made clear that the subject wasbeing studied.In further discussion, it was noted that abandonment of the Maplinairport project should save the large expenditure involved inrelocating the Shoeburyness firing range.    This saving would however only be achieved if the seaport was also abandoned, andthis should be borne in mind in the assessment of the seaportproposals.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Maplin airport project should be abandoned,and that the Secretary of State should announce this in a parliamentary statement and should publish the report by officials.The Cabinet attached importance however to making greater use of regional airports and discouraging the expansion of the existingLondon area airports.    The Secretary of State for Trade ehouldexamine ways of achieving this objective, including the possibilityof financial disincentives to the use of the London airports; andthe announcement should indicate that the matter was being examined.The draft statement should also be revised in the light of any drafting comments suggested by other Ministers, and it should beshortened as far as possible.    The Secretary of State should discuss the timing of the announcement with the Lord President andthe Chief Whip.The Cabinet -1. Approved C(74) 73, subject to the points made by the Prime Minister in his summing upof their discussion.2.        Invited the Secretary of State for Trade -i. to revise the draft statement attachedto C(74) 73 in the light of their discussion,and having regard to any further draftingpoints suggested by other Ministers;ii, to make the statement in the Houseof Commons, and publish the report by officials, on a date to be agreed with theLord President and the Chief Whip;8
iii.      to examine ways of ensuring greater use of regional airports and of discouragingthe expansion of the existing London areaairports, including the possibility offinancial disincentives, as suggested intheir discussion.SEX 5.        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theDISCRIMINATION  Secretary of State for the Home Department about Legislation onSex Discrimination (C(74) 70).THE HOME SECRETARY said that if his proposals were approvedhe had in mind to make a short general statement in the House ofCommons on 22 July, and to put in hand the preparation of a white paper for issue in the last week of August or the first week ofSeptember.    He would aim to have a Bill drafted in time for it toreceive its Second Reading before the Christmas Recess, so thatit could reach the Statute Book by the late spring of 1975, well;       before the Equal Pay Act came into force.    His proposal was forarrangements which would have a wider scope and be more effectively enforced than those envisaged by the previous administration.   As regards enforcement, he proposed thatcomplaints about employment should be dealt with by IndustrialTribunals; that complaints relating to the maintained sector ofeducation should be dealt with in the first place by the EducationMinisters; and that other complaints should go to the county courts.There would be a strong Equal Opportunities Commission, the mainfunction of which would be to identify and deal with discriminatorypractices by industries, firms or institutions.    It would be able toundertake general enquiries and would have the power of subpoena,though this could only be exercised with the consent of the HomeSecretary.    He had considered whether access to the courts shouldbe possible only through the Equal Opportunities Commission, thusmaking arrangements parallel to those provided for in race relationslegislation, but had concluded that this was not necessary.    It was unlikely that very large numbers of cases would otherwise bebrought to the county courts, and in any case such a provision was likely to be unacceptable to women&apos;s organisations.   As regardsthe scope of the Bill, two approaches were possible.    The first would be for it to apply to employment and education and to areas,such as credit, mortgages, housing accommodation and access tolicensed premises, restaurants and hotels, which had been thesubject of serious complaints.    There could be power to add to the list by regulations subject to Affirmative Resolution.    The secondapproach was for the Bill to make it unlawful to discriminate in theprovision to the public of the generality of goods, services and. 9
facilities covered by the Race Relations Act, but with certain specific exceptions.     Both courses should in the end producemuch the same result; but in his view the broad approach haddecisive presentational advantages and was to be preferred - itwould indeed be difficult to explain why the Government were adopting a more restrictive approach than that provided for in the race Relations Act.    It was true that exceptions would have to be identified and defined; but this should not present insuperable difficulty.One question which was still open was how the Bill should treatincitement to commit a discriminatory act.    At the recent meetingof the Home Affairs Committee at which the subject had beenconsidered he had expressed the view that the Bill should deal only with aiding and abetting; but he now thought that it ought to provide that anyone responsible for aiding, inducing or inciting thecommittal of a discriminatory act should be treated as doing thatact.    This was however a somewhat contentious matter and a finaldecision would have to await the completion of the consultations with the Trades Union Congress (TUC) on which the Secretary ofState for Employment was at present engaged.    The matter didnot have to be refe rred to in the Parliamentary statement.In discussion, considerable support was expressed for the wideapproach.    There was however some support for the narrowerapproach, although this was itself fairly wide, on the grounds thatit might be more prudent,,    Thus it would help to avoid theappearance of anomalies or absurdities which might discredit thenew legislation, and would prevent an excessive number of casesfrom coming to the courts.   If however the wide approach werepreferred, it was argued that it would be helpful if the power to seek an injunction were exercisable only by the Equal OpportunitiesCommission.    Further thought was needed about the extent to whichinsurance should be excluded.    Discrimination could of coursearise; but the different - and frequently more advantageous -terms offered to women by insurance companies were often fully justified on actuarial or other statistical grounds; and it would be unfortunate if a side effect of legislation on discrimination was to deprive them of these benefits.    It would be desirable for the Billto make specific provision for dealing with incitement; and it wouldbe helpful if legal aid could be made available for women bringingcases before Industrial Tribunals.    There might well be other points of detail which would arise during the consultations but which would not affect the Home Secretary^ statement in the Houseof Commons,10
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed generally with the Home Secretary&apos;s proposals andon balance shared his view that the scope of the Bill should be defined in wide terms - ie that it should be made unlawful to discriminate in those areas covered by the Race Relations Act,subject to such limited exceptions as might be necessary.    TheHome Secretary should discuss with the Secretary of State for trade what exceptions were required in relation to insurance.    Theproposals about enforcement were also acceptable, but the HomeSecretary should consider with the Lord Chancellor whether, to relieve the possible burden on the courts, the power to seek an injunction should be given only to the Equal OpportunitiesCommission and not to individuals.    It was prima facie desirablethat any person aiding, inducing or inciting the committal of adiscriminatory act should be treated as doing that act; but a finaldecision on this would have to await the conclusion of the Secretaryof State for Employments consultations with the TUC.    Moreover,it might be helpful for any such cases to be examined by the EqualOpportunities Commission before they came to the courts.    TheHome Secretary should, as proposed, make an early parliamentary statement, consulting the Lord President about a suitable date, andshould report again to the Cabinet before the Summer Recess onthe progress being made.    He should also put in hand thepreparation of a White Paper for issue in late August or earlySeptember; it should be agreed with the Ministers mainly concerned and should be circulated in draft to members of theCabinet, although there might be difficulty in arranging a meeting to discuss itc.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited theHome Secretary, in consultation with the other ministers concerned, to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office16 July 197411
