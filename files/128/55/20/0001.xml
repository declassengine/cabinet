BILL TO amend the TRADEUNION ANDLABOURRELATIONS ACT1974Previous! Reference:CC (74) 44thConclusions,Minute 22. The Cabinet resumed consideration of a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Employment (C(74) 128) about the Bill tpamend the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974, and of a minute from him to the Prime Minister to which was attached a copyof a letter dated 6 November from the General Secretary of theTrades Union Congress (TUC).THE&apos;SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that thestatement that he had made at the last meeting could besummarised as follows.     The TUC had put forward aproposal which was a real advance on the situation that existed before 1971; if it were accepted the TUC would co-operatewillingly with the Government in setting up voluntary arrangements and each union would have an incentive to bring its internalpractices up to the standard of the best.   If on the other hand theGovernment were to try to force them to accept the statutoryalternative in spite of their dislike of it, they might refuse to collaborate in working the procedure, and the atmospherebetween the Government and the TUC would be soured.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that the original proposals, towhich Ministers had agreed, had been intended to provide a statutory safeguard not only for those who were dismissed fromtheir employment but also for those who were prevented fromobtaining employment because of their unreasonable exclusion orexpulsion from trade unions in a closed-shop situation.    Becauseof TUC objections, the safeguard had been restricted to cover only those who were dismissed.    The proposal now was to abandon even this safeguard.    This was a retreat from the principle set out inthe report of the Donovan Commission, which had argued that,because of the connection between trades union membership andlivelihood in a closed-shop situation, members of trades unionswho complained of unjust treatment should in the last resort havea right of complaint and a right to compensation if not reinstatedin their jobs.    The voluntary arrangements proposed by the TUCprovided that in the last resort the review committee would makea recommendation upon which the General Council would expecta trade union to act.    There would be no power to award compensa-tion and no power to enforce compliance.    The individual would retain the power to appeal to the High Court, but only on grounds of common law which were vaguely defined and probably would not give complete protection.    The concept of natural justice, whichunderlay the operation of the common law, would apply chiefly tpcases of wrongful action under contract, which could hardly coverexclusion from a union; what was needed was a safeguard basedupon a broader conception of what was fair or unfair.    The Donovanproposal was expressly designed to bring trades unions into line with the professions.    For instance doctors and dentists had aright of appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council;2
solicitors could appeal to the High Court, and barristers to the judges.    If the Government retreated from this principle in the face of trades union pressure, its action would be difficult toexplain in Parliament and its credibility would come into question.THE HOME SECRETARY said that a threat to deprive a man of hislivelihood involved a fundamental question of human rights.    TheGovernment could not justify reliance on voluntary procedures todeal with these cases any more than with cases of discriminationon grounds of sex or race.    When Ministers had discussed theproposed legislation on 28 October the suggestion that no t ribunalwas needed and that full reliance might be placed on the TUC hadreceived no support.    Many Ministers had wished to go further andapply the statutory safeguards even outside the closed-shopsituation.    An early proposal that two members of the statutorytribunal should be nominated by the TUC had been changed infavour of nomination by the Secretary of State.    If the Governmentgave up these safeguards merely because the TUC disliked themits conduct would not only seem wrong; it would be wrong.In discussion it was argued that in many other fields theGovernment had favoured the case for independent outside checks:for instance in enquiries on the conduct of the police; in appealsagainst the Law Society;  in cases of race discrimination.    Itwould be illogical to move in the other direction in cases involvingtrades unions.    It was doubtful whether the TUC proposals would cover fully all cases involving trades unions that were notaffiliated to the TUC, or trades unions that did not accept the TUCprocedures, or individuals who did not come under trades unionrules because they had not joined a union or had been expelledfrom it, or cases where there was no closed shop.    Moreover the tuc proposals covered only cases of dismissal, not of refusal of employment.    The TUC proposals would not, therefore, rule out the possibility of conflict with the Courts.    Moreover it was likely that the Courts in these circumstances would extend their common-law powers.    So it would be in the interests of the trades union themselves to interpose a statutory appeal body between themselves and the Courts.    Such a body could co-exist with theirown procedures.    One important case that illustrated the dangerswas the behaviour of the National Union of Journalists (N UJ).    Thisunion was moving towards a closed shop position, and had already decided that all editors must be full members instead of associatemembers as they had been hitherto.    It was easy to see how this could impair editorial freedom.    The NUJ was not close to the tuc and had probably not been in mind when the TUC proposals were formulated.    In order to cover this and similar cases it wasnecessary for the TUC to have a power to require a trades union to obey a ruling of the review committee.    It would also be necessaryfor the review committee to be more independent than the TUCproposed; it was hardly satisfactory that the TUC themselves should3 -
appoint both the chairman and the members of the committee.    Thecase of the NUJ also illustrated how crucial it was that the appealbody should have the power of reinstatement; financial compensa-tion would be worth far less.    Six years had passed since the donovan Committee reported and the TUC had shown no sense of urgency in acting on its recommendations.    Many peopleexpected the Government to take action, and a failure to do so would, be seen as a surrender to TUC pressure.On the other hand it was argued that there was no reason tointroduce the legislation at this stage.    The Secretary of State for employment had promised that he would be willing to consider anyvoluntary alternative put forward by the TUC;  he would be in a difficult position if the resulting proposal was dismissed by theCabinet.    The TUC proposal should be given a trial.    the composition of the proposed review committee was similar tothat recommended by Donovan; and the trades unions would havean incentive to make it work and to bring their internal proceduresup to standard.    The public was less hostile to the trades unionsthan in 1969 and expected to see them collaborating in the operationof the social contract.    Not many appeals would in fact arise; andunsatisfied appellants could still make use of their common-lawright of appeal to the High Court.    If the voluntary system provedunsatisfactory the Government would still have the power to legislate;     but if the Government were obliged to withdrawlegislation in the face of non-co-operation by the unions itsweakness would be manifest.In further discussion it was argued that it would be impossible toreach a decision on the questions raised in discussion before thepublication of the Bill to amend the Trade Union and labour relations Act; it would be better to hold over this Clause until theintroduction of the Employment Protection Bill in 1975.    On theother hand it was argued that the proposed amending Bill was neededurgently to remove the danger of a case arising which could bringthe trades unions into conflict with the Courts.    This danger would arise particularly if Section 5 were the only part of the 1974 Actto be left unrepealed.    Moreover the omission of this subject fromthe Bill would excite comment from the Opposition and the Press,and if the Government then inserted the Clause after discussionwith the TUC they would be said to have done so under pressure from the Opposition.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that,although important objections had been expressed, the majority in the Cabinet were willing to accept the TUC proposals providedthat two conditions were satisfied.    The first condition was thatall trades unions would be required to observe the recommendationsof the review committee, in the same way as the Bridlington andCroydon agreements were mandatory for all unions.    The second4
condition was that the chairman of the review committee should beappointed by the TUC after consultation with the Lord chancellor and in agreement with the Conciliation and Arbitration Service.It would also be desirable to enable the review committee torecommend compensation as an alternative to reinstatement in a union; but this was not a sticking point, for reinstatement was moreimportant.    The Secretary of State for Employment should explainthese conditions to the TUC and should   report back to him; hewould decide in the light of the tuc&apos;s response and the views expressed in Cabinet whether it would be necessary to bring thematter to the Cabinet again.    Meanwhile the amending Bill shouldnot be published;  it was to be hoped that the delay in publication would strengthen the hand of the Secretary of State for Employmentin his discussion with the TUC.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing up oftheir discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the Secretary of State for Employment to speak accordingly to the Trades Union congress and to report back to the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office11 November 19745
