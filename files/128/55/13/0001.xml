1. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the Ministerial Committee on European Community Questions(EQ) had approved on the previous day the line which the Ministerof Agriculture should take on the subject of sugar at a meeting ofthe Council of Ministers (Agriculture) of the European economic community (e.c.) which was to take place in Luxembourg on21 October.    Over the next year the United Kingdom faced serious difficulties over sugar supplies.    Our annual consumption was approximately 2.6 million tons.    From our own production and imports from our traditional suppliers we could count on suppliesof 1.6 million tons.    Other e.c. countries might be able to supplyus with a further 400, 000 tons, but this left a shortfall of 600, 000tons and a particularly serious situation in the first half of 1975.We had accordingly been negotiating with Australia for the conclusionof a new long-term agreement under which Australia would supply us with 300, 000 tons annually for five years from June 1975 and might also make available an additional 200, 000 tons early next year.The Australians insisted that any agreement should be endorsed bythe e.c..    The Community was unlikely to agree to a five-year agreement with Australia, particularly at the price level the australians wanted which would be above the internal e.c. pricewith provision for indexation to keep it above the e.c. price.    TheCommission had proposed as an alternative that the community should assume the responsibility for ensuring our sugar suppliesnext year, buying the necessary supplies on the world market (whichwould include supplies from Australia) and selling it to the UnitedKingdom at the Community threshold price, which was at present 115 per ton.    There remained points to resolve to ensure that thisproposal would work effectively but it offered very substantialfinancial advantages to the consumer and to the balance of payments -the cost of the e.c. subsidy could be of the order of  75 -  125 million and the EQ Committee had agreed that the Minister of agriculture ahould seek endorsement at the Council both for the Commissionproposal and for the deal which had been negotiated with Australia.If the Commission proposal was not approved, we should insist onthe Australian agreement.    That agreement did not offer a completesolution to our problems in 1975, however, and in the last resortwe should accept the Commission proposal (provided the details were satisfactory) even if we could not get endorsement of theAustralian deal.        The EQ Committee had also discussed the levelof United Kingdom production quotas which we should seek under thenew e.c. internal sugar regime.    There was general agreement that we should seek an increase in the United Kingdom quota to1.25 million tons, or at least 1,1 million tons, and that we should seek a maximum total for Community sugar produce ction at a levelsomewhat below self-sufficiency, with a view to safeguarding theinterests of developing Commonwealth sugar producers.    But under present world market conditions sugar producers were likely to have1
no difficulty in selling their sugar at good prices, and in the event the Minister of Agriculture might have to accept the principle of community self-sufficiency.    The Minister of Agriculture had beenasked to take full account of the interests of the developing commonwealth sugar producers in all these negotiations on thebasis of our firm commitment to secure access for 1.4 million tons annually at a fair price.    The price ought to be not less than 140 per ton, and suitable arrangements should be made forpurchasing and for the allocation of supplies to United Kingdomrefineries.    There appeared to be some prospect that the Ministerof Agriculture could obtain agreement to satisfactory arrangements on all these points in the Council of Ministers, but we should stillface the prospect of shortages Of sugar in the first half of 1975 and increases in price of the order of 6p to 8p for a 2 lb packet.In discussion it was pointed out that Australia was prepared toleave the proposed agreement open only until 22 October.    If we accepted the Commissions proposal to subsidise supplies and abandoned the Australian deal, we should be giving up an importantoption for future sugar supplies.    It was therefore important thatthe commitment by the Community to guarantee to supply us withsugar should not be limited financially, or limited in time to oneyear only.    On the other hand, it was suggested that while anyCommunity arrangement would be formally for one year in the firstinstance, it would be hard for other Community Governments to argue that it should not then continue.    Moreover, we could expecta substantial increase in internal sugar production by the end of 1975and perhaps some easing in the world market situation,,    our commitment to obtain access for 1.4 million tons of sugar from the developing Commonwealth was most important, and theCommission^ proposal if accepted would provide a strong incentive to the rest of the Community to honour that commitment in full.But there remained a conflict of interest between the interests ofour consumers and growers and the balance of payments on the onehand, and the interests of the sugar producing countries of the developing world on the other.In further discussion it was pointed out that if the United Statesremoved import controls for sugar (as was likely), the prospects of our obtaining the sugar we needed could become still worse.There was some reason to suspect that sugar was being withheld from the market, perhaps in anticipation of increases in price.    TheMinisters concerned were watching the supply position carefully andwere considering action to equalise the domestic price of sugarimported at differing prices from the Commonwealth, the e.c. andthe world market.2
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the conclusions reached by the EQ Committee onthe line which the Minister of Agriculture should take in theCouncil of Ministers on 21 October, subject to the need to obtainthe best possible assurance that a Community subsidy for oursugar supplies would not be limited to one year only.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion,2.        Invited the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food, at the meeting of theCouncil of Ministers (Agriculture) on21 October, to be guided accordingly.
2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat he saw no prospect of early progress towards a political settlement in Cyprus.    The Greek Government were preoccupied with their forthcoming elections and Turkey had a caretakerGovernment.    The talks between the acting President of Cyprus,Mr derides, and the Vice President, Mr Denktash, had so far been confined to humanitarian issues.    There had been a recentindication that they might begin talking about a possible withdrawalof the Turkish forces to a new line.    This would be a welcomedevelopment, but it would of course fall far short of a settlement.He was aware of the view which some people held strongly that theUnited Nations should have demonstrated greater authority in this situation and that we should promote a resolution which would lay down a general framework within which a settlement should be made.There were of course United Nations resolutions calling upon theTurks to withdraw, and he had assured the United Nations of our support in any moves likely to contribute to a settlement.    the prevailing view in the United Nations was however that at the present justice it would not be helpful to attempt to specify conditions fora settlement.    He shared this view.    Any draft resolution of thekind proposed was bound to be blocked.    The best hope for progressin present circumstances lay in the talks between Mr Clerides andMr Denktash, with both of whom the personal representative in cyprus of Dr Waldheim, the Secretary General of the United Nations,was in constant touch.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.4
3. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that asa result of hard negotiations in the twelve-nation EnergyCo-ordinating Group an agreement had been drafted for setting up an International Energy Programme (IEP).    the ministerial Committee on Energy had discussed this the previous day, and had concluded that the British Government should acceptthe agreement and put it into provisional operation.    Theagreement covered arrangements for emergency oil sharing, forrelations with the oil producers, and for long-term co-operation on energy matters:  the participating countries would include members of the European Economic Community (e.c.), theUnited States and Japan.    It was proposed that the IEP would be managed by an Agency within the framework of the organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, .    Theagreement secured three main objectives: co-operation with theUnited States on energy problems, effective protection againstemergencies resulting from shortages of oil, and a basis forsecuring co-operation between oil consumers and producers.    Itwould ensure that even if there were to be a cut-back of 50 per centin Arab oil production, the participating countries could last forwell over a year with only a 10 per cent cut in normal consumption:and because the operation of the agreement was largely automatic,the participation of the United States was assured.    However, theagreement also provided that participating countries couldwithdraw after three years (and twelve months1 notice).    Finally,the agreement offered the advantage that the British Government&quot;sobligation to export oil during an emergency would be restricted:and it was a better arrangement than could be made within the framework of the e.c..He proposed, if the Cabinet agreed, to make a statement inParliament as soon as possible that the Government accepted theagreement and were willing to put it into provisional operation:the statement would of course be drafted in consultation with theother Ministers most concerned.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet endorsed the agreement which the Secretary of state had described, and agreed that a statement should be made toParliament as soon as possible.The Cabinet -Invited the Secretary of State for Energy, inconsultation with the Secretary of State forForeign and Commonwealth Affairs and the secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales,to draft a statement for Parliament on theGoyernmenfs acceptance of the agreement on the International Energy Programme.5
SE CRI :T4.        The Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary of theCabinet (C(74) 110), to which was attached a memorandum by theCentral Policy Review Staff (CPRS) on Government Strategy and priorities.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it had on occasion been suggestedthat Ministers did not have sufficient opportunity for longer-termcollective examinations of the Governments programme as a whole.One of the main functions of the CPRS was to help them to do this,and their memorandum had been circulated as a basis for such a discussion.    While the CPRS would not argue that they hadnecessarily got the picture exactly right, their object had been toprovide a background against which Ministers could form a strategic view.    No specific decisions would be taken on thememorandum: these would come to Cabinet in the ordinary way,but the discussion should provide a useful background to laterdiscussions on, for example, The Queen!s Speech, the legislative programme, the Price Code, public expenditure and the Budget.The memorandum might also form the basis of a further discussionof Government strategy at Chequers after the Budget,In discussion, it was at first suggested that the CPRS memorandum was based on unduly pessimistic assumptions, and did not offersolutions for the problems which it raised.    It represented adifferent Manifesto from that on which the Government had successfully fought the election, and it had been written from anessentially managerial point of view.    Moreover, it was not practicable, in a democratic society, to sacrifice everything tolonger-term considerations.    The paper also did not placesufficient stress on the international dimension of the problem,particularly the real likelihood of a breakdown in the international monetary system.    On the other hand, there was generalagreement that the memorandum had been successful in itsintended purpose, which was to stimulate a wide ranging discussion,although not necessarily agreement on every issue.   It was right that the CPRS should address Ministers frankly on the problemsconfronting them, and they should continue to do so: and it was by no means certain that the assumptions in the report would turn out to be too pessimistic.    A general strategic discussion of this kindwas a valuable new initiative, which should be repeated at regular intervals.In further discussion, several Ministers endorsed the argument inthe memorandum about the need for the Government to get their policies across to the nation.    There had been evidence during therecent election campaign that people appreciated that the countryfaced a grave economic situation, but they also wanted to know why this had arisen, what the Government would do about it, and how
they themselves could help.    The Government should explain thatthe difficulties did not arise wholly from our own failings, but from the impact of external events, especially the enormousincrease in oil prices.    There was a case for introducingmeasures, such as petrol rationing, designed to bring home thenature of the problem to every family in the country.    Such action might also help to restore international confidence in the UnitedKingdom, which was at present at a low ebb.   At the same time,it was important to stress that there was light at the end of thetunnel: the production of oil from the North Sea would put us in amore favourable position than many other Western european countries.    The memorandum had also drawn attention to the factthat the public had come to believe that everything that was desirable was possible, and that to convince them otherwise would require a major effort in education and persuasion directednot only at the public but at pressure groups and the professions.Plans were already in hand for a new kind of social surveydesigned to show the extent of the need for social services and theresources and manpower available to meet them.    discussions would be held with the professions on how the resources could best be used to meet the needs.    It would also be necessary to take steps to strengthen the social contract and obtain a fuller measureof acceptance for it.    The reports of widespread strikes inScotland showed that it was not yet fully understood.    Whileefforts were being made to deal with individual disputes, theGovernment should also consider bringing forward, no later thanthe Budget, a package of measures designed to reinforce thesocial contract in a number of fields.    The education andpersuasion of the public must be seen as a two-way process.   Atpresent, the Government were handicapped by having to use theexisting media of communication.    Urgent consideration shouldbe given to the possibility of televising Parliament, which wouldenable the Governments case to be more effectively projected tothe population at large.    The trades unions should also be encouraged to explain the situation to their members; and government supporters in Parliament should be encouraged to address trades union schools and classes on a far larger scale than hitherto.During the course of discussion, the following further points were also made -a. A number of decisions which the Government would need to take during the near future would have an adverse effect on the retail price index.    If the social contract wasto hold, it would be necessary to seek ways of offsettingthis effect, and to avoid creating inflation by direct government action.
b. In order to strengthen the social contract,consideration should also be given to a possible cut in ministerial salaries, and to restraint on increases in higher salaries generally.    But the standard of living ofthose on higher incomes was in fact already being erodedby inflation and the tax structure; for example, even if those earning  7- 10, 000 a year were given increases ingross salaries equal to the rise in the cost of living, theiractual standard of living would decline by 8f per cent thisyear.    However, if the social contract was to be implemented,those earning  30- 40 a week would be being asked toaccept a compression of their differentials, and it wouldbe inconsistent to ask for this-at the same time as those on higher salaries were maintaining differentials.c. Remedies should be sought for the presentweaknesses in our system of economic management.While there were a considerable number of macro -economic techniques available, these were very uncertainin effect;  and there were not sufficient instruments forthe Government to use at the micro-economic level.There was also a need for closer integration of micro-economic and macro-economic management.    New formsof training, and possibly a different career structure,might be needed for civil servants if they were to carry the responsibilities which the Government wantedDepartments to undertake.    On the other hand, it was argued that the recruitment of more highly qualified staff would not necessarily lead to better decisions.   Apreferable course might be to involve people at all levels of industry in decisions through the medium of theproposed Planning Agreements.    It might also be desirableto reverse the present trend; towards concentration in large economic units.d. There was a tendency in economic discussions toplace emphasis on capital resources rather than on manpower, which was the most important resource of all.The Manpower Services Commission should be strengthened,and the Cabinet should have an opportunity to discuss whatcontribution further education establishments and schoolscould make to the economy, in collaboration with industry.There was also a need for better manpower forecasting,which should help the universities to adjust the balance oftheir courses to future economic needs.
ea While in general the memorandum might be right that public expenditure increases were an unsatisfactoryinstrument of short-term demand management, there wasa case for making an exception for a special stimulus tothe construction industry, in view of the centralimportance of this industry in the economy.    The presentnumber of unsold houses represented a very urgentproblem.    In view of the constraints on resources, therewas a case for a further look at the scope for greaterausterity in standards of provision in the various publicconstruction programmes.    Savings might also be sought in the administrative expenditure envisaged in theproposals for the nationalisation of development land.f. Experience had shown the difficultie s involved bothin improving the rate of growth and in dealing with inflation.    While it was right to try to increase the growth rate, it would be unwise to count on an increase.Moreover while it was possible, in the last resort, to livewith a poor rate of growth, the country could not live withan unsatisfactory rate of inflation.    It would beinstructive to conduct an exercise on ways in whichinflation could be brought down if there were no politicalconstraints to consider.g. The memorandum had not brought out fully theinternational aspects of the economic problem, auch asthe need for recycling of the earnings of the oil-producing countries.    It was unsatisfactory that there was nocontinuous monitoring of the economic performance ofother countries.    More emphasis should be placed onimport savings: for example, the recent developments which might enable more soft wheat to be used in bread,and the possibilities of energy saving through stricterbuilding regulations.h. The problems of the Third  World were becoming increasingly acute, and the gap between these countries and the industrialised countries was growing continuously.The Manifesto commitment regarding overseas aid shouldbe regarded as a moral imperative talking precedence overall others.    Our action in this field should however beundertaken within the international community, includingThird World countries with growing oil revenues.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the function of the CPRS was not to provide solutions to all thequestions which they had raised in their memorandum.    That wasa matter for Cabinet, and for individual Ministers and their departments.    The purpose of the memorandum was to provoke a collective discussion of strategy and priorities, and it had in factgiven rise to a very worthwhile discussion.    The CPRS shouldcontinue to produce synoptic papers of this kind from time to time.The Cabinet would need to consider the suggestion which had beenmade about a possible reduction of Ministerial salaries, as a wayof giving a lead to other recipients of high salaries.    Such an initiative ahould however be aimed primarily at those earningsalaries higher than those of Cabinet Ministers, and with capitalbehind them, rather than those in the  7- 10, 000 range.    TheCabinet would also need to consider whether The Queen&apos;s Speechshould include a commitment to give Parliament an early opportunity to consider the question of televising its proceedings.He would arrange a further meeting at Chequers at which theCabinet would be able to continue their discussion of generalGovernment strategy.    In preparation for this, all cabinet ministers were invited to circulate papers putting forward theirown proposals.    Such papers should however be as short and specific as possible, and should concentrate on solutions ratherthan analysis.    At the same time, the Cabinet would wish toconsider the paper which the Secretaries of State for employment and Industry had been invited to circulate on ways of encouragingeconomic growth; and papers on possible reductions in standards of provision in pubHc expenditure programmes, and on Hmitingprivate non-essential building in favour of public capital expenditure.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office17 October 1974
