jjATE 1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the SecretaryIMPLEMENTATION   of State for the Environment (C(74) 124) about late implementation of THE HOUSING      of the Housing Finance Act 1972.FINANCE act the SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT saidprevious that in England and Wales 18 local authorities had defaulted in reference: 1972-73 over the implementation of the Housing Finance Act and cc(74) 8th    ji some 400 councillors were now liable to surcharges in respectConclusions, of losses totalling  1.5 million.    There were 3 courses open to minute 2 the Government to deal with this situation.    They could legislateto make good the losses from Exchequer funds: he would strongly oppose this, since it would condone defiance of the lawat the taxpayers&apos; expense, and the Government were in any casepledged against it.   Secondly, they could let events take their course: this would, however, result in about 2 years of legal proceedings for recovery, leading to Court Orders, baiHffs andbankruptcies but with little prospect of recovering more than afew thousand pounds.    It would distress many councillors of standing, including some who had genuinely believed that theGovernment of the day would have responded to their actions inEngland, as they had in Wales, by putting in HousingCommissioners to take over responsibility for the rent increases.He did not believe that such a policy of inaction would be accept-able.    The final course was the compromise which had beenconsidered by a meeting of Ministers under the Prime Minister&apos;chairmanship.    This would put responsibility for recovering the losses back on the councils that had incurred them, by requiringthem to recover the sums by way of increases either in rents orin rates over the next 5 years.    This would mean that surchargesand disqualifications for these councillors would not then arise.Because of local government reorganisation since 1972, however,many of the councils had been absorbed into bigger authoritiesand he thought it right to empower these authorities to increaserents or rates differentially so as to recover the money only from where it had been lost.    Clay Cross was in a differentposition in that surcharges had already been made and had been thesubject of Orders of the Court, and the councillors had beendisqualified.    He thought it right in these circumstances that thesurcharges should stand and not be met in any way from public&apos;funds but the Government were committed to removal of the disqualification and, with reluctance, he would propose to legislate for this purpose.    He considered that taken as a wholethese proposals, although not ideal, were a practicable and humanesolution to a difficult problem, although it was inevitable that theywould be heavily criticised from both sides.    If the cabinet agreed he proposed to announce them on Wednesday 6 November.In discussion it was agreed that the breaches of the law whichhad occurred should not be condoned by the Government and thatthe terms of the Secretary of State&apos;s announcement should make this very clear,.  It should also be made clear that if councils1
chose to recover the money from the rates, this would not attractRate Support Grant.    The solution proposed for England andWales would not, however, be appropriate for Scotland, sincesurcharges could only arise there when, following an auditor^report of a loss, the Secretary of State imposed them,    Therewere some 170 councillors responsible for losses reported for1972-73 totalling  1.6 million; and since the sums involved wereplainly beyond the councillors1 means to pay it was proposed thatthe Local Government (Scotland) Act 1947 should be amended soas to give the Secretary of State a power, in respect of surchargesarising from 1972-73, to have regard to all the circumstances ofthe case, including ability to pay, and to be able to reduce the surchange accordingly.    This power already existed for 1974-75onwards under the previous Administration^ legislation for localgovernment reorganisation in Scotland.In further discussion it was argued that the Government would do better to wipe the slate clean, as the National Executive Committeeand the Conference of the Labour Party had desired, by paying theClay Cross surcharges from the Exchequer.    The councillorsconcerned had felt that they were defending the interests of their supporters, as they had promised to do, and that they were defend-ing the rights of local authorities to fix their rents; they had led the opposition to the Housing Finance Act, which had been to theGovernments advantage electorally.    Moreover, retrospectivelegislation was not objectionable if it was beneficial to the individuals affected; and breaches of the law had been forgivenin other situations, for example, in respect of illegal Pakistaniimmigrants.    As against this it was argued that the government&apos;s supporters in Parliament were not expecting a general amnestyfor the Clay Cross councillors, while their supporters in localauthorities, especially in London and the Midlands, who had stoodup to criticism for applying the law as it then stood, would beoutraged if those who had broken it were to have their penalties met by the taxpayer.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed with the proposals put forward by the Secretary ofState for the Environment and congratulated him and his officials on the ingenuity shown in meeting the Governments commitmentswhile ensuring that responsibility for recovering the losses shouldbe put upon the rent-payers and ratepayers in the areas wherethey were incurred.    The fact that these proposals did not meetfully the views expressed by the National Executive Committee; andby the Labour Party Conference was recognised; but it was important to understand that the Governments authority rested,not upon resolutions of the Party Executive and Party Conferencebut upon the support of the Parliamentary Labour Party in theHouse of Commons.    There was no doubt that the majority of thelatter were very far from thinking it right for the taxpayer to meet2
the financial liabilities of the Clay Cross councillors.    TheGovernment&apos;s commitment was to remove the disqualification on them and, under the Secretary of State for the Environmentsproposals, this would be done from the date when the legislationhad been given Royal Assent.    As regards the other councilsconcerned, the proposals put forward for England and Wales andfor Scotland would be regarded as fully meeting the Government&apos;sundertakings.    The Secretaryjof State for the Environment andthe Secretary of State for Scotland should announce theGovernment&apos;s proposals on Wednesday 6 November, the proposalsfor Scotland being referred to in the Secretary of State for theEnvironments statement or published in reply to an arrangedQuestion, as seemed most appropriate.    The Secretary of states for the Environment should clear the text of the announcementurgently with members of the Cabinet.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for the Environment and theSecretary of State for Scotland to be guided accordingly.3
2. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C(74) 120), by the Secretary of State for social services (C(74) 122 and 123) and by the Minister of overseas development (C(74) 121), on public expenditure from 1974-75 to1978-79.THE PRIME MINISTER, introducing the discussion, reminded theCabinet that they had already reached a broad decision on the overall allocation of resources, whereby public expenditure should be allowed to grow at 2f per cent a year in demand termsover the period under consideration.    They had not howevercompleted their discussion of priorities within this overaLl ceiling,and at their request the Chancellor of the Exchequer had put forwardan illustrative scheme.    Members of the Cabinet would no doubtwish to suggest variations but this should be on the basis of aswitch in resources and not simply proposals for additions.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that there were two points of special urgency.    The first was to settle the arrangementsfor next year&apos;s Rate Support Grant, which would be considered lateras a separate item.    The second was to agree public expenditure figures for 1975-76 for incorporation in the Budget he would bepresenting on the following Tuesday:  so long as firm agreement was reached on the total, some switching between programmes would be possible later, but it was also necessary to move towardsdecisions on the years up to 1978-79 to facilitate the preparation ofthe public expenditure White Paper, publication of which would almost certainly now slip to January.     Public expenditure was underenormous pressures and he was grateful for the understanding hehad had in his bilateral talks.    The last published figures for 1975-76had appeared in the Conservative Governments White Paper theprevious December.    Allowing for the increases likely to benecessary in the forthcoming Rate Support Grant settlement, and forthe Increases contemplated in his own paper for housing, health and education, the total for 1975-76 would show an increase of some 3, 000 million compared with the figure given last December.    Themain areas of increase were housing ( 1,170 million), social security ( 768 million), trade and industry ( 547 million) - mainly for price restraint - and agriculture and food ( 534 million) - mainlyfood subsidies.     For 1978-79, the programmes in the 1974 public expenditure Survey were some  3-400 million above the 2f per centguideline;  and he was suggesting the addition of a further 135 million for social security improvements, being in his view theminimum necessary for family support.    Table 3 of his paperidentified further claims totalling  456 million, of which  165 million were distinguished for special consideration.    He also drew attention to the prospective claims in Table 4, which included 3,.000 million for public ownership&apos;; ..and although the resource effectof much of this would be small, it did create financing problems,
especially in 1975-76 when the borrowing requirement would beunprecedentedly high.    In spite of these difficulties he had tried to help the spending Ministers; he had for example agreed to twoupratings of social security benefits next year;  to an increase in family allowances of 60p for the first qualifying child and 50p forthe others;  and to a substantial increase in the Rate Support Grant.He had also accepted that in 1975-76 expenditure on price support would have to be as high as in 1974-75.    But it would be importantby 1978-79 to get rid of all subsidies to nationalised industry prices,and to halve food subsidies, unpleasant though the political consequences might be.    In his view the major priorities werehousing, industrial and manpower policies and regional development.The phasing out of subsidies was essential to accommodate these,and he proposed to indicate this in his Budget speech.    Whilehousing investment was a priority, housing subsidies must not beallowed to grow above their present size, and this meant that therewould have to be rent increases to this end.    He emphasised alsothe need for the Government to take greater control over localauthority current expenditure, the rate of increase in which must bereduced.    Even if everything he had said about subsidies and localauthority expenditure was accepted, there was still a need for reducing the planned expenditure in some other programmes.    on defence, he would be prepared to accept the figures for 1975-76already discussed by Ministers but it could well prove necessary toreduce the amounts for later years faster and further than at presentforeseen.    Certain other programmes, all making heavy demands on goods and services, and mostly in the local authority field,would need to be cut, although even after cutting they would still be growing at a rate higher than public expenditure as a whole.    In1975-76, in view of the special problems facing some Ministers, hewould wish to add  149 million to expenditure on local authoritymortgages, the Housing Corporation, health, education and overseas aid.    In 1978-79 he would favour an additional  100 million for localauthority mortgages and  65 million for the Housing Corporation;but such increases in that year must mean offsetting cuts elsewhere,perhaps on the roads programme.    He hoped the Cabinet would agreebroadly with his illustrative scheme.    He recognised the matter wasa complex one, and he would try to find a simpler and more satisfactory way of presenting it next year.    Meanwhile, he warnedhis colleagues that if they agreed to his general approach, they wouldbe committing themselves to modifying both central and localgovernment spending policies to turn it into a reality.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES, introducingher papers, said that it was necessary to consider where theproposed priorities would take the Government by 1978-79.   In thefield of family support, including nursery education, they would find that they had actually reduced financial support to families; therewas a fall of  170 million between 1975-76 and 1976-77, partly because the proposed increases in family allowances did not restore
the earlier real level, and partly because the Chancellor proposedto postpone the introduction of child allowances to 1977, with nofurther uprating of family allowances before then.    She felt it essential that some way be found of helping the first child of one -parent families.    In the field of health, current expenditure wouldgrow at an annual rate of only 2. 8 per cent, where the conservative government had achieved 4. 2 per cent.    The programme as a whole would grow less rapidly than roads, which under the Chancellor&apos;sillustrative scheme would grow at a rate of 3. 2 per cent.    Turningto the Law and Order programme, she thought it was a wrong set of priorities which allowed a 40 per cent increase in capital expenditureon police, prisons and courts, while the services for young offendersground to a halt for want of money.    An.urgent reassessment ofoverall priorities was necessary.   She had reached agreement withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer on the improvements in social security benefits to be made in 1975-76.    Social security benefits had of necessity to keep pace with earnings, and this made the uprating next april essential.    This would cost an extra  200 million next year,but even then, because she had agreed to the &quot;historical&quot; basis forassessing the increases in relation to the relevant movements in earnings and prices, beneficiaries would be receiving a smaller proportion of average national earnings next April than last July.She had agreed with the Chancellor that a second uprating in Decemberwould mean that there would be no Christmas bonus in 1975.    Herother proposals were a modest improvement in some other benefits and in supplementary benefit disregards - the only thing which wasbeing done for one-parent families.   Family allowances would beincreased from April 1975 but the introduction of the full scheme of child allowances would be postponed until 1977:  she had accepted that the corresponding rate need not be settled now.    Even with these improvements she doubted whether it was acceptable to reduce food subsidies as the Chancellor had suggested, and she urged on hercolleagues the need for some gesture of support for one-parent families in 1976.THE MINISTER OF OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT said she recognised the problems which the Chancellor faced, am that her own request was a difficult one in the present situation.    But it was unavoidable.In her view the proposed increase of  9 million in 1975-76 wasnot enough:  the figure should be  30 million.    She was, however,prepared to accept the proposed Survey figures for later years withthe exception of the cut of  10 million in 1978-79.    For 1975-76,the Chancellor&apos;s proposed addition of  9 million would mean - andwould be seen to mean - no more than a standstill in the aid programme.    Her own proposal would offer a recognisable increase.In the past the Cabinet had been motivated by a desire to helpdeveloping countries; but today the situation was one of crisis, withthe possibility of a world slump.    The developing countries represented some 18 per cent of the United Kingdom&apos;s trade and an: 6
important part of that of other countries too.    Their ability tocontinue that trade was thus directly linked with the UnitedKingdom!s own economic self interest.    Analyses by such bodies asthe United Nations and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development had shown that the countries which would be hardesthit by a world recession would be those who were traditionallyrecipients of British aid, such as India and Bangladesh, wherepolitical as well as economic breakdown was threatening.    The aid programme had to be fixed in the light of the commitments in theParty Manifesto and in The Queen&apos;s Speech.    The reference in thelatter was being taken by voluntary organisations as a precisecommitment to show some increase next year.    The United states was unlikely to do more next year than in 1974-75, and this put agreater burden on other countries.    The&quot;hope was that next year would begin to see the involvement of the Arab oil-producing countries in the provision of development aid;  but this would take time, and in her judgment an additional  30 million next year was essential if the United Kingdom was to play its proper part.In discussion there was general acceptance of the analysis presented by the Chancellor and of the approach represented by his illustrativescheme.    There was broad agreement that housing - which had been referred to by every Labour speaker in the debate on The Queen&apos;sSpeech - was a first priority.    On overseas aid, there was also ageneral view that more money should be made available - both on grounds of moral commitment and because it would be important to mobilise the support of the developing countries in coping withthe potential threats to international economic stability.    There wasno diseent from the argument that nationalised industry price subsidies should be phased out and the cost of food subsidies gradually reduced.Concern was expressed at the difficulty of making collective decisions on fundamental questions of priority on the basis of the present formof public expenditure surveyjbefore the next survey Ministers shouldbe able to discuss priorities in depth and the figures should be givenin a way that would allow this to be done sensibly.In further discussion, the following points were made:-a.    Expenditure on roads had already been switched to avery low priority.    The rate of increase of 3. 2 per cent which had been quoted was a measure of increase, not in capital expenditure on roads, but of the whole roads andtransport programme, and was largely attributable to the subsidies to British Rail and to local passenger transport undertakings.-   In Wales the construction of roads waslagging badly behind England, most of the money in1976-77 being required for the M4, which was of crucial importance for the Principality.
b. The proposals for education meant that someexpectations could not be fulfilled.    There was no prospect of restoring free school milk in primary schools.    In higher education it meant a target of only640, 000 students compared with the 750, 000 which hadbeen the aim of the Conservative Administration (although there was some evidence of falling demand).    It meant noresources to cater for the recommendations of the RussellReport, the James Report or the Bullock Report; and no additional resources for the youth service, the librariesservice or the arts or basic scientific research.    Thelarge cuts proposed were feasible partly because of reduced demographic forecasts; ,but some increase in capital expenditure was desirable - additional starts of 5 million for nursery education and  10 million for improvements in primary and secondary schools addingsome  7-8 million to expenditure in 1975-76,c. On expenditure on Law and Order, while capitalexpenditure, as had been noted, was planned to increase,hardly any of this was for the expansion or improvementof accommodation for adult offenders.    Some  40 millionhad been taken out of the prison programme, and to go further would have serious repercussions on prison building.Much of the increase was devoted to the needs of the under21&apos;s - the age group which showed the most disturbingincrease in criminal activity.d. The Secretary of State for the Home Department had agreed to a cut in the building programme for courts under his control;   but it was for consideration whether thereshould not be a larger cut than agreed so far in the courtbuilding programme controlled by the Lord Chancellor.*e. Private productive investment could be stimulated in three ways - by generalised fiscal measures, through theBudget; by easing the price Code; and by direct selectivesupport for industry.    Only the third of these, which wasfavoured by the TUC, impinged directly on public expendi-ture.    There were obvious difficulties in trying to correlatethese three different ways of tackling the same problem.Thus, the Investment Bank which was contemplated, and theNational Enterprise Board, might require some  1,500million, but there was no way of relating that to help whichcould be given through Budget easements.    This was aquestion that needed further study.
In. subsequent discussion, it was pointed out that events beyond thecontrol of Ministers might well make it necessary to look again atany general pattern of priorities agreed now.    If a recession became a reality the preservation of employment might well need to assumetop priority.    Similarly if the world moved into a new and emergency food supply situation, it could mean that there would need to be increased expenditure on the fostering of home basedagricultural production; but that would be a new situation whichwould have to be considered at the time.    The Contingency Reserve - 300 million next year rising to  1, 000 million in 1978-79 - wasmeant to cope with unforeseen expenditures on a modest scale, but clearly a major crisis such as a threatened breakdown in the tradeand monetary system would require fundamental reconsideration.Even within the existing scheme, the prospective commitments listed in Table 4 of the Chancellor&apos;s paper should not be viewed lightly.If the Cabinet were to be stringent about public expenditure whichdirectly or indirectly, made demands on goods and services, it must beprepared to be equally tough towards expenditure with little or nodemand effect - as with the purchase of assets on nationalisation -since their implications for the public sector borrowing requirementcould be very serious.    It could well be that the main Oppositionattack on the Governments scheme would be focused on the borrowing requirement itself.    Nor was it to be assumed that the demandeffects of many of these prospective payments would be negligible.In considering priorities it would not be enough to confine attentionto the public sector simply because that was the area under ministerial control, and it was necessary to work out a means of reining backinessential private expenditure so as to minimise the public sectorcuts needed.The Government would have to consider the problem of the presenta-tion of their policies to the Party and the country.    The Budget Speechwould be an occasion for a comprehensive presentation of strategy,but early opportunities should be taken to reinforce it.    It wassuggested that there might be merit in drawing up a declaration forissue after the Cabinefs meeting at Chequers on 17 November whichwould set out the relationship between the world scene and the UnitedKingdom&apos;s own problems, and relate public expenditure policy to continue strategy generally.    On the other hand it was pointed outthat the Chequers1 meeting was to allow a wholly free and uninhibiteddiscussion between Ministers.    Even if such a declaration was appropriate its drafting could only be put in hand subsequently.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that, theCabinet gave general approval to the approach proposed by theChancellor of the Exchequer to the problems of pubHc expenditure.The Chancellor should now consider the points made in discussion,both those of a general character and those concerned with departme ntalprogrammes; and should consult further with the Ministers concerned to decide what adjustments could be made in order to accommodatedesired changes within the agreed guidelines.    As far as possible he9
should reach agreement with his colleagues, and then circulate a definitive version of his paper, which could set out any unresolvedpoints for the Cabinet to settle at a further meeting.    He should note the general view that there should be an increase in the overseas aid programme, as part of the United kingdom s approach to the worldproblem.    Ministers had quite rightly pressed their departmentalpoints, but he thought there had been a noteworthy willingness to acceptthe general economic limitations and the problems of other Ministers.The Chancellor should now take the initiative with all the Departmentsconcerned to work out a tighter system for the control of localauthority current expenditure, with particular reference to the needfor monitoring that expenditure in view of the proposed increases in local authority manpower, not all of which could be going to priority programmes.    On presentation, the Budget speech wouldrelate pubHc expenditure to the national s.nd, to adme extent, theworld crisis, and would provide part of the background for theCabinet&apos;s discussion on 17 November.   This would be timely giventhe fact that the main forum outside Parliament for the presentation of Government policies to the Party and the Nation in the near futurewould be the Party Conference later in the month.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.10
TE 3.        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretary ofUPPORT State for the Environment (C(74) 125) about Rate Support&quot; Grant in 1975-76.LRANTTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that thePrime Minister had recently chaired a meeting about Rate Support grant in 1975-76 with the Ministers immediately concerned, and the outcome of the discussion was reflected in the memorandum which he had circulated.    Four main issues had to be considered.    The first was theacceptable level of local government expenditure for rate support grantpurposes.    Local authorities had been generously treated in recentyears; their expenditure had been increasing by about 8 per cent a year in real terms and the number of staff employed by about 80, 000(though about half of these were part-time).   This rate of increase could not be allowed to continue, and it was proposed that, for 1975-76,expenditure should be held at its 1974-75 level, plus an allowance forinescapable commitments amounting to about 4 per cent.    The localauthorities were expecting measures on these lines; but the effecton services would be painful - Metropolitan bus fares would, forexample, have to be increased by 30 per cent next year and fares inLondon by 50 per cent.    The second question was the tolerable levelof increase in rates.    This year the original target of an average increase of 30 per cent had proved unacceptable and had subsequentlyhad to be reduced to about 10 per cent.    In his view a figure of25 per cent was the most that could be accepted politically and fromthe point of view of preserving the social contract.    This should be adequate to discourage local authorities from increasing expenditure,particularly bearing in mind that Metropolitan district elections wouldbe taking place in April.    Thirdly there was the question of how thegrant should be distributed amongst local authorities.    This was amatter on which he would be circulating proposals to the Cabinet.Finally there was the need to exercise greater control over localauthority spending and, in particular, staffing.    Monitoring arrange-ments would have to be established, and the Government would have toaccept general responsibility for reductions in services and to giveguidance on priorities.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he agreed broadlywith what was proposed for 1975-76.    It was, however, important tomake clear to local authorities that this was only the first step in a continuing process and that severe restraint on expenditure would have to beexercised throughout the Public Expenditure Survey (PESC) period.   TheGovernment would have to give clear guidance on priorities and on chargingpolicy, and to establish effective monitoring machinery.   Asregarded the levelof rate increases, he favoured a figure of 35 per coat, which would represent]an increase of only 20 per cent in the target which had originally beenadopted this year.    A target of 25 per cent would increase theExchequer cost by  250 million but would only reduce the retail price index by 0. 25 per cent.    Moreover, the lower the average increase infeviouseference:&apos;C(74) 19th(inclusions,[minute 3
rates, the weaker would be the restraints on local authority expenditure.He agreed that there should be some increase in the grant payable tolocal authorities this year, but in order to discourage profligateexpenditure it would be desirable not to meet the local authorities1deficits in full, still less to enable them to build up the balances whichhad been run down.    He favoured an arbitrary figure of  250-300million in terms of current values.In discussion, it was argued that the public found rate increasesperhaps the most objectionable of all the increased charges they werecaUed upon to pay, and that this was a ground for keeping the increases to the minimum.    It was, moreover, undesirable that the rate increase should exceed by too much the likely rate of inflation;  but an average increase of even 25 per cent would involve some much largerindividual increases - indeed, some 5 per cent of the population wouldbe faced with increases of 50 per cent or more.    It was, however,not proposed to impose an upper limit to permissible individualincreases.    It also had to be borne in mind that there would be substantial increases in water and sewerage charges, which in wales would amount to about 60 per cent on average.    On the other hand, itwas argued that substantial rate increases were the most, perhaps theonly, effective way of controlling expenditure by local authorities,whose excessive spending during the current year it was now proposedto allow for the purpose of calculating grant.    In the light of past experience it was doubtful how effective monitoring would be.In further discussion, it was argued that within an overall manpowerceiling it was important that some increase should be allowed in thenumber of teachers.    Without this there would be a decline in thepupil/ teache r ratio and significant unemployment amonst newlyqualified teachers.    The Government would be obliged to indicate their intentions as to the prospective number of teachers to be employed,and it was important to avoid the implication that they were deliberatelyadopting policies which would produce unemployment amongst teacherswho were about to complete their training.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed with the approach proposed by the Secretary of State forthe Environment.    The aim should therefore be to hold expenditure bylocal authorities in 1975-76 at its 1974-75 level, plus a 4 per centallowance for inescapable commitments.    Continuing restraints in expenditure would be necessary throughout the PESC period;  andalthough it might not be practicable to give the local authorities targets for the years after 1975-76, the Secretary of State for the Environment,in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, should consider urgently how the continuing need for severe restraints could best be impressed on local authoritiesi    The Government should acceptgeneral responsibility for the effects on services and should issuedetailed guidance to local authorities on priorities.    The total numberof staff employed by local authorities should be held at its present
level and detailed monitoring arrangements should be established.Detailed arrangements for these purposes should be worked out onthe lines agreed at his recent meeting with the Ministers immediately-concerned.    There should be flexibility within the staffing ceiling;and the Secretary of State for Education and Science was free to make clear that the Government were not planning for unemploymentamongst newly qualified teachers.    In view of the strength of publicresentment caused by increases in rates, and the harmful implications-tions for counterinflationary policies, the Cabinet agreed that themaximum tolerable level of average rate increase was 25 per cent,despite the increased demands which would thus be made on theExchequer.    They agreed also that some extra grant should be paidthis year by way of a Rate Increase Order.    The precise amountshould be settled by the Secretary of State for the Environment inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who had expressed a preference for limiting it to some  250-300 million so as to avoid any impression that the Government were condoning profligateexpenditure.The Cabinet -1.    Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.2.
