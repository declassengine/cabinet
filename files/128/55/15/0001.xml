1. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT, reporting on the industrial situation in Scotland, said that the strike of road haulage drivers was the most serious problem, and that the AdvisoryConciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) had been making everyeffort to assist the parties to come to an early settlement.    An offer which had been worked out with the assistance of   ACAS  had been rejected by a mass meeting of the road haulage workers against theadvice of the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU).    Theemployers were now meeting to consider the position.    If they did not agree to meet the further demands of the strikers, one possibility wasthat they would appeal direct to the Government for help;  and, in this event, it would be necessary to consider urgently how best to respond.Meanwhile the advantage lay in leaving mediation with the ACAS, as the body established by the Government for this purpose, and in avoiding any statement or other action by the Government which might prejudice the chances of a solution.    Mr Jack Jones, the Secretaryof the TGWU, was in close touch, and he shared the view that therewas no further initiative which could usefully be taken at the presentmoment.The strikes by municipal refuse, sewerage and transport workers in glasgow were quite separate from the road haulage dispute.    Heretoo   ACAS   was fully engaged.    The unions concerned wished to avoid a local settlement in Scotland which might prejudice the position oftheir members in England,In discussion it was pointed out that the Government was subject to political attack, especially by the Scottish National Party, on thegrounds of inaction and also from the angle of the social contract;it might be necessary therefore to make clear what the governments attitude was.    There was no present risk to health or increaseddanger of fire in Glasgow, though the situation would have to remain under close watch.    Consideration was being given in the CivilContingencies Unit to possible contingency plans, though on a strictlycovert basis.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet recognised the potential difficulties presented by any statement by the Government in the immediate future and also theneed to avoid any action which might prejudice the continuing role ofACAS.        The Government would however probably have to make astatement in Parliament in the following week if matters were notsettled before then.    The Home Secretary should arrange for appropriate contingency planning in the Civil Contingencies Unit on acovert basis: but there would need to be collective Ministerialconsideration before contingency plans were implemented.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.
2, THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thathe had recently held talks with the Vice President of Cyprus,Mr Denktash, who had agreed that it would help his discussions withthe Acting President, Mr Clerides, if some concessions could be offered on the extent of the Turkish military presence.    Mr Denktashfeared, however, that if such concessions were madePresident Makarios might return to Cyprus and pocket them whilerefusing to make any concessions in return.    He had pointed out toMr Denktash that the longer concessions were delayed, the greaterbecame the risk that it would be President Makarios with whom the vice- President had to deal.    In reality, however, the TurkishGovernment was unlikely to make any significant move at present,while any developments in the policy of the Greek Government wouldhave to await the outcome of the Greek elections on 17 November.    Hehad also discussed with Mr Denktash the problem of the turkish cypriot refugees in our Sovereign Base Areas,    Mr Denktash wantedus to agree that the refugees should be removed by sea and taken tothe Turkish controlled area of Cyprus by way of Turkey.    This,however, would cause us difficulties with Greek Cypriot opinion since there was also a serious problem of Greek Cypriot refugees, includingmany in the Turkish held area.    He had urged Mr Denktash to try tomake progress on the refugee problem in his talks with Mr Clerides,and had sent a message to the Acting President in the same sense.He had suggested that particularly urgent attention should be given tothe old, the young and the sick.    He had also expressed concern toMr Denktash about the looting of property belonging to Britishsubjects in the Turkish area and had asked that steps should be takento bring this to an end.The Cabinet -1. Took note of the statement by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary,THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that hegreatly regretted the reports in the Press that he was critical of theMinistry of Defence over the conduct of the recent visit by units ofthe Royal Navy to Simonstown.    He did not know the source of these reports; they were not inspired by him and he had no evidence thatthey emanated from his Department.    He was nevertheless concerned about the effect of the publicity which had been given to the naval visit,which appeared not to have been conducted on the agreed basis.    Whenthey returned to office in March, the Government had decided that our policy towards South Africa should be seen to be consistent with ouropposition to the internal policies followed by the South african government.    It had been decided to discontinue the sale of arms, to
refuse to sponsor sporting and cultural exchanges, and not to allowgoodwill visits by the Royal Navy.    Visits by Her Majesty&apos;s ships would be permitted from time to time if there were an operationalrequirement, and subject to consultation between Departments.    Inhis view the continuance of the Simonstown Agreement should beconsidered in the light of the Defence Review.    If we had animportant security interest in maintaining the Agreement, this wouldhave to be taken into account.    If the security interest was marginal,the political objections to the Agreement might be overriding.Pending the outcome of the Defence Review it should be made clearthat visits would be subjected to the strictest test of operationalnecessity.    The South African Government had sought to obtain themaximum propaganda value out of the recent visit.    They were undergrowing attack in the United Nations, where there was a move to expel them.    He believed, however, that it was important to preserve the principle of universality in the United Nations becauseif this were breached there might be pressure to expel other countries.If South Africa were expelled, pressure to expel Israel wouldprobably grow.    He thought it important to make plain our attitudetowards South Africa and the steps we had taken.    He therefore proposed to speak on the foregoing lines at a meeting in his constituency the following day.    He hoped that the Cabinet would agree in principle, and that the Prime Minister and the Secretary ofState for Defence, to whom he had sent the text of his speech, wouldbe able to agree to its terms.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that he muchappreciated what the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had said about reports of an alleged conflict between their two Departments.The Press reports had made it appear that comments had emanatedfrom the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.    Although the SouthAfrican Government had certainly tried to make the most of the recent visit, the fact of the matter was that the Navy had not broken the agreed ground-rules.    There had been two visits, both of which hadbeen cleared between Ministers in the two Departments.    The firstvisit had passed off quietly.    Instructions had been issued by theCommander-in-Chief, Fleet, that such visits were to be treated asoperational, that there were to be no special social functions.    It hadbeen correctly reported that a salute had been fired: this was inaccordance with Queen*s Regulations.    Such social occasions as hadtaken place had been on the advice of and under arrangements madeby the British Embassy.    There had been no formal social occasions,and no official entertainment was offered on board ship.In discussion it was suggested that we must assume the South african government would try to exploit any visit by Her Majesty!s ships.    Ifas a result of the Defence Review it was decided to bring the simonstown Agreement to an end, there would be advantage in
announcing this as soon as possible.    It was also suggested that such steps as possible should be taken to counter the damage done by press reports of a conflict between the Foreign and Commonwealth Office andthe Ministry of Defence,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary and the Secretary of State for defence would report to him on the way in which the visit had been conducted and on the subsequent pubKcity.    The Cabinet agreed thatthe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary should deliver a speech onthe lines he had indicated, subject to his own agreement and that ofthe Secretary of State for Defence on the text.    He would be sending to members of the Cabinet a paper on the Defence Review, fordiscussion on 31 October.    This paper should be treated asexceptionally secret; it was to be seen only by members of. theCabinet and, tp the extent necessary, by their senior official advisers.Discussion of the Defence Review would include consideration of the simonstown Agreement;The Cabinet -2.        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.
QUEEN lsSPEECHON THEOPENING OFPARLIAMENTpreviousReference:CC(74) 39thConclusions,Minute 23. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the draft of the queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament.    They had beforethem a memorandum by the Lord President of the Council (C(74) 113)to which was attached a revised draft of the Opening Speech.The Cabinet considered the draft paragraph by paragraph.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the draft Speech subject to certain amendments which had been agreed in discussion.    The inclusion of the referenceto legislation to give further protection to policyholders of insurance companies was, however, dependent&quot;upon the Secretary of State for trade and the Chancellor of the Exchequer being able to establishurgently that, when the Speech was published, the Governmentwould be able to announce its intentions in sufficient detail to avoiduncertainty of a kind which might undermine confidence in insurance companies generally.    The Secretariat should now prepare a final draft of the Speech which he would submit to Her Majesty for approval.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of the Cabinet to arrange for a final draft to be prepared for the Prime Minister tosubmit to The Queen for approval.
4. THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOODsaid that, at the Prime Ministers request, he would be circulatingto the Cabinet for consideration in the following week a paper setting out the agreement which had been reached in the Council of Ministers(Agriculture) and relating this both to the original entry negotiations and the Governments future policies.    While it had not been possibleto achieve all our objectives, the agreement reached had been withinthe terms of the brief approved by the Ministerial Committee on european Questions and endorsed by the Cabinet in the previous week.Although the scheme to meet our sugar deficit in 1974-75 at theCommunity price, which was less than the AustraHans were demandingand appreciably less than the world price,, was formally for one yearonly, it would be hard for the Community to reject an extension and indeed the Commissioner for Agriculture had already talked in termsof a scheme running for two years.    The scheme did not exclude thepurchase of Australian sugar by the Community and it represented agood deal for the British consumer.    The immediate problem hadbeen to deal in the best possible way with the existing shortfall butthe possibility of an agreement with Australia in the longer run hadnot been ruled out.    Furthermore, the agreement provided for anincrease in our beet sugar quota and progress had been made on theneeds of the Commonwealth Protocol 22 countries.In discussion some anxiety was expressed about the terms of theagreement and in particular the provision that it should run for oneyear only.    This was an aspect which had greatly concerned some members of the Cabinet in their previous discussion, and the cabinet should now have an opportunity of discussing in more detail the merits of the agreement which had been reached.    For this reason it was important to establish whether the agreement was final and operativeor whether it had been reached subject to ratification by the british cabinet.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theparameters within which the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food had negotiated had been agreed in detail by ministers collectively;   and his initial study of the agreement showed that itwas within the bracket of what we had decided we could accept.    the negotiation had been a particularly difficult one and the Ministerdeserved considerable credit for what he had achieved.     Theagreement was not formally subject to ratification by member governments and it was possible that the Community had already begun to purchase sugar on our behalf.    There was however nothing to prevent the Cabinet from rejecting the agreement if they so wished.He suggested that further discussion of the merits of the agreement should be on the basis of the paper which the Minister would becirculating.V     -.-6
The Cabinet -Agreed to resume their discussion of this question in the following week.5. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that theCouncil of Ministers (Finance) at their meeting on 21 October hadendorsed in principle a scheme by which the Community, in its ownname and without further formal guarantee or security,  would&apos; seek to borrow externally from oil surplus funds and would then lendwithout gain or loss to individual member States needing assistanceto finance deficits attributable to increased oil costs.    The obligationwhich the Community would be undertaking to the outside lenderwould be backed by internal Community arrangements under which,in the remote contingency of a borrowing member State being unablefor a period to find foreign exchange to meet its repayments, theother member States would have to cover the required amountaccording to a prearranged distribution of underwriting liabilities.The scheme was a relatively modest one of up to $3 billion inclusive of principal and interest and it was likely that only Italy, andpossibly Denmark, would want to take advantage of it.    We had nocurrent intention of borrowing from it ourselves: but he welcomed the scheme as one of a number of different international mechanismswhich would be necessary for the recycling of petro-dollars.    Thescheme was still in an early stage however.    Although legislation would probably not be required in this country, provision would bemade for formal Parliamentary scrutiny.    There would have to bea reference to the European Assembly, and some other governments might need legislation.    There would be no final commitment untilthe last stage in the process, when a specific borrowing operation was authorised by a future Council meeting.In discussion some anxiety was expressed that any borrowing by thiscountry might be made conditional on our continuing membership ofthe European Economic Community.    It was however explained thatthis problem was most unlikely to arise before the decision on our continued membership in view of the fact that we had no currentintention of borrowing from the fund.The Cabinet -Took note&apos;.Cabinet Office24 October 1974- t \V % .:.-   .; 1        &apos;   .
