1. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER communicated tothe Cabinet particulars of the proposals in the statement he was tomake in the House of Commons that afternoon.In accordance with precedent, details are not recorded in theCabinet Conclusions.2. The Cabinet had before them a Note by the Secretary of theCabinet (C(74) 77) covering a report by officials on the situation in cyprus.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theGreek and Turkish Governments had agreed to a ceasefire in Cyprus,to come into effect that afternoon.    They had also agreed to holddiscussions with us, as the three Governments guaranteeing the I960Treaty.   He hoped that these discussions could begin within the next two days; they would probably take place in either Vienna or Geneva.The Turks must be disappointed at the meagre success of their armedintervention.    They would not of course admit this publicly; and theycould claim that by establishing several thousand of their troops on the island they could ensure that Cyprus would return to constitutional government, and they were in a better position to protect the TurkishCypriots.    It remained to be seen whether the return of president Makarios would be acceptable to the Greek and turkish Governments or, indeed, to the Cypriots themselves.If he did not return, the requirements of the constitution wouldbe met by the appointment in his place of Mr Clerides, speaker of the House of Representatives, pending new elections.    Throughoutthe past few days he had been in frequent touch with the United states secretary of State, Dr Kissinger, and with the Greek and turkish governments.   Initially the United States Government had beenpreoccupied by the wish to prevent Greece from leaving the north atlantic Treaty Organisation and their anxiety to retain the facilities in Greek ports which were important to the American Sixth Fleet.The Americans had been rather slow to appreciate the prime importance of the situation in Cyprus itself.    But once the Turkishattack had taken place they had worked hard, in full consultation with us, to avoid war between Greece and Turkey.    Indeed it was the dependence of both countries on American aid which gave the americans, and them alone, the leverage to insist upon a ceasefire.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that our armed Services had achieved an outstanding success in bringing theService families and so many British and foreign residents andtourists into the safety of the Sovereign Base Areas.    There hadbeen some public criticism that a warning had not been given toBritish tourists to leave Cyprus as soon as there was speculation
about a possible Turkish invasion.    We had been right not to do this:if we had advised British subjects to leave earlier this would havemade little practical difference and would have confirmed the GreekGovernment and their supporters in Cyprus in their suspicion that wewere in collusion with the Turks: the danger of Greek-Cypriotviolence against our people would then have been much increased.The ceasefire was an important achievement, and although the americans had been immediately responsible, it was also a successfor our own efforts.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office22 July 1974
