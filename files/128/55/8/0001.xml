1. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the draft &quot;White paper on Devolution.    They bad before them a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (C(74) 98).THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet would wish to considerthree papers which had been circulated with his memorandum.Annex B was a draft White Paper prepared by the Secretaries ofState for Scotland and for Wales on the basis of an earlier draft and in the light of the earlier discussions.   Annex C was a statementof policy on devolution which had concurrently been prepared by theHome Policy Committee of the Labour Party under the chairmanship of the Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection andwhich would shortly be published.    Annex A was a draft White Paperprepared at his request which attempted to combine the convincingfactual background of Annex B with the more positive approachtowards the Governments proposals shown in Annex C.In discussion it was pointed out that Annex C had now been givenout to the Press by the Labour Party and there was, therefore, noquestion of suggesting modifications to it.    Its form was not such that it could stand as the Governments expression of views ondevolution and in any case it went too far on matters of detail andwas expressed in emotive language.    The Government was committed to publishing its own White Paper soon and it wastherefore now inevitable that the Government&apos;s White Paper wouldbe closely compared with the Party document.    Although there was some feeling that Annex B was attractive, it was generally agreedthat in the circumstances Annex A represented a substantial improve-ment.    In particular, the Government&apos;s conclusions and proposals were put forward in a more convincing and positive way, and it was important that reference should be made to England as inparagraph 25 of the draft.In further discussion the following comments were made -a. The Government would need to make it clear thatthe draft at Annex C now published was to be regarded only as a valuable discussion document and that the Government!views would be made clear in their White Paper to bepublished shortly.b. The draft at Annex A should avoid mere repetition of passages in Annex C, and in particular should not carryover from it colourful wording which was inappropriate fora Government White Paper eg the references to &quot;thespotlight of democracy&quot; and to &quot;avarice and selfishness&quot;.
C Paragraph 1 of Annex A was wrong to suggest that civil servants stationed in the regions were not subject todemocratic control.d. Greater emphasis should be placed on the vital need to maintain the political and economic unity of the UnitedKingdom.e. The conclusions on Scotland and Wales were presentedtogether, with some confusion as between legislative and executive devolution.    There was a case for keeping thetreatment of Scotland and Wales separate, as had been thebasis of Annex B.f *        It should be made clear that authority granted to an assembly would in practice be exercised by those in controlof that assembly.g. The functions which the Secretaries of State forScotland and for Wales would exercise after the settingup of Scottish and Welsh assemblies were not very clear;they appeared to be very restricted.    It was arguable thatthere might be some disadvantage in establishing a constitutional doctrine that the two Secretaries of state must necessarily be in the Cabinet.h. The proposals for Wales broadly represented whatthe Labour Party in Wales had wanted for some time.Although they fell somewhat short of what was proposed for Scotland, the difference could be faced.i. It should be made clear that while the assembly wouldbe able to allocate the block grant in accordance with its ownpriorities, the total size of the grant would have to be arrivedat by an assessment of individual programmes, having regardto standards obtaining throughout the United Kingdom.j. It was important not to exaggerate the benefitsexpected to come from North Sea and Celtic Sea oil.Good prospects were there, but they should be presentedmore soberly.k.        It. should be made clear that nothing in the White Paperaffected decisions on Northern Ireland.    In particular, noencouragement should be given to the view that the numberof Northern Ireland Members of Parliament should beincreased to the Scottish and Welsh levels.
1. There should be no apparent commitment to release the executive control of law and order functions to scottish and Welsh assemblies.    Paragraph 23(d) of Annex A mightbe interpreted as restricting the Secretaries of State to thefunctions there listed, and these did not include law and order.On the other hand paragraph 29, which gave examples of theassemblies1 functions, did not include law and order.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were concerned at the far-reaching and perhaps destructivenature of the proposals on devolution which were current and were reluctant to commit the Government to detailed and specific proposals before the full implications had been worked out.    However, a movement towards devolution had been started by the setting upof the Kilbrandon Commission itself, and the present Governmentwas committed to making proposals in a White Paper,   Given thatcommitment, the Government should not seem to put forward their proposals in a grudging or reluctant spirit.    At the same time theproposals should be so framed that, whilst meeting present politicalrequirements, they did not specifically provide for separateexecutive governments for Scotland and Wales or commit theGovernment on the scope of the powers and functions to be devolved.The precise nature and timing of the devolution to be introduced could then be considered in the light of more mature consideration.    Thebest basis for further consideration of the White Paper was Annex A.This should however be revised in the light of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion by a drafting group of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretaryof State for the Environment, the Secretaries of State for Scotland andfor Wales, and the Minister of State, Civil Service Departments underthe chairmanship of the Secretary of State for Prices and consumer protection,    The revised draft should be circulated for considerationby the Cabinet in the following week so that the White Paper might bepublished as soon as possible thereafter.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion, and invited theSecretary of State for Prices and consumer protection, in consultation with the Chancellorof the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for the environment, the Secretary of State for Scotland,the Secretary of State for Wales and the Ministerof State, Civil Service Department, to prepare a revised draft for the Cabinet1 s consideration.
COMMUNITY&quot;ownership ofdevelopmentlandPreviousi Reference:CC(74) 31stConclusions,&apos; Minute 22, The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for the Environment (C(74) 95) to which was attached adraft White Paper on the Community Ownership of DevelopmentLand, and a note by the Secretary of State for the Environment(C(74) 96), to which was attached the report of a Working party on purchase price and taxation in the transitional period.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT saidthat at their meeting on 1 August the Cabinet had accepted the broad principles of the scheme, - but they had not decided whattype of taxation should apply to private transactions in landduring the transitional period.    This question was remitted toan expert Working Party, who had now reached agreement onthe type of tax to be applied.    The only important outstandingquestion was the rate at which the new tax should be levied.On the merits of the case he was in favour of a rate of 80 per cent,but the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster were disturbed by the effects of so high separately on business confidence.    The Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster had held a meeting the previous evening which had considered 3 possible ways of mitigating these effects.    one possibility was to provide for a rate of tax that would increase to 80 per cent over a period.   Alternatively there might bedifferential rates for individual landowners and for companies.The third possibility was to allow the landowner to increase the base value for the calculation of tax by taking account of hisexpenses, including interest.    The meeting had favoured thethird option and proposed to add to the White Paper a statement that for land already held on the date of the White Paper the basisof the tax would be adjusted to take account of the fact that theacquisition of the land might have been financed at high rates ofinterest.    He would accept this change, but the Cabinet wouldnote that the new formula left open some important questions, suchas the treatment of interest charges on the cost of land acquiredafter the date of the White Paper, the question whether the concession would apply indiscriminately or only to landownerswho would otherwise incur a loss, and the question of theamount of the adjustment.    He must be ready to answer detailedquestions on all these points when the White Paper was published,and would have to discuss them immediately with the treasury and other Departments concerned.  If the Cabinet agreed to theWhite Paper he would propose to publish it on Thursday12 September, which would mean going to Press the following day.4
In discussion it was argued that in the present state of the economy the preservation of business confidence was of paramount importance.    The collapse of the market in propertyhad endangered many firms that had invested heavily in realestate under the previous Government.    So far, thanks to theefforts of the Bank of England and with no help from theGovernment, it had been possible to avoid any spectacularfinancial crash, but the clearing banks which had already lent 500 million to the fringe banks could not rescue them from theconsequences of further bankruptcies, and there was a real danger of a chain of bankruptcies which would spread into industry and could lead to a collapse of confidence in sterling.The position of the insurance companies, for which theGovernment had a responsibility, was particularly worrying.However, the proposal agreed at the meeting under theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster should have the effect ofincreasing the putative value of land in company assets, by givingfirms a better idea what price their land might fetch in themarket.    The formula should be politically acceptable, fornobody could wish to tax transactions on which there had been noprofit.    In general the supporters of the Government should takecomfort from the proposal to bring in the full scheme by a seriesof Orders, area by area, as the effect would be to bring the transitional provisions to an end as quickly as possible in each area.In further discussion the following amendments were suggested to the White Paper:-a. Under the transitional arrangements the developmentland tax would be payable on land held by builders.With Government encouragement, builders had boughtland continuously and would now show a profit on landbought when prices were lower than at present and a loss on land bought more recently.    Either there shouldbe some arrangement for setting the losses against theprofits for the purposes of the tax, or the reference tosuch land in paragraph 36 should be amended so as to exclude it from the tax as well as from acquisition underthe scheme.b. Under the draft White Paper the development landtax would seem also to apply to a firm building a new factory on land that it already held for the purpose.    Thiswould be inconsistent with the intention not to constrainimportant industrial development and expansion.However, it would be difficult to exempt such caseswithout opening up loopholes that could be exploited by others, and the legal provision might be complicated.
Nevertheless it would be desirable to include in theWhite Paper a form of words to deal with the difficultybut it would need to be established urgently that these were likely to be compatible with the legislation aseventually drafted.c. It was argued that the position of owner-occupierswas not sufficiently protected in the draft.    The promisein paragraph 47. appeared weak.    If possible, the white paper should include a categorical statement that existingowner-occupiers would not,be affected by the scheme,d. Since the White Paper did not cover NorthernIreland, it would be anomalous if the new developmentland tax were to apply throughout the United Kingdom.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that,subject to the points made in discussion, the Cabinet approved the draft White Paper for publication.    The Secretary of Statefor the Environment should consider in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster how to amend the draft to take account of the points ata. and b.    The Cabinet agreed that the draft should include amore definite statement on the position of owner -occupiers.The position of Northern Ireland should be cleared up betweenthe Departments concerned.The Cabinet -1.    Invited the Secretary of S tate for the Environmentto pursue the points raised in discussion on the lines indicated in the summing up by the Prime Minister.2.    Subject to these points approved the draft white paper for publication.6
3,        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (C(74) 93) about the approach to renegotiation objectives on regional aids.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY recalled thatthe approach to regional policy in the European Economic Community(e.c.) had been based on economic factors which were significantlydifferent from those applying to the United Kingdom, and theCommunity was now committed to defining new arrangementsfor the co-ordination of regional aids.    This was being pursued in a Commission Working Party,    In his statement of renegotiationobjectives in the Council of Ministers on 4 June he had said, with thefull authority of the Cabinet, that we accepted that the co-ordinationof rules under which member States gave regional aids had a usefulpart to play, and that we would be taking part in the Working Partywith the objective of ensuring that the rules took account of the needsof the United Kingdom,The Ministerial Committee on European Questions (EQ) had considered on 31 July how to further our objectives in the working party but had been unable to reach agreement on which of two alternative courses to adopt.    The Secretary of State for industry on the one hand had proposed the approach outlined in Annex A toC(74) 93.    This would mean submitting a paper to the Working Partychallenging the principle of co-ordination of regional aids andarguing that, since realistic rules would be difficult to define,it would be better to opt for a much looser arrangement basedon consultation.    We should have to argue that national governments must be free to exercise regional policies within their territories,including freedom to determine and vary the boundaries within whichaids should apply and to change the rate of the aid.    We would haveto argue that Governments must be free to take quick or exceptional measures without obstruction from the Commission.    This line of argument implied a need to amend the Treaty of Rome in order toenable the Governments of member States to have the necessaryfreedom of action.The Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs(Mr Hattersley), on the other hand, had argued that we should approach the Working Party on the lines set out in Annex B toC(74) 93.   We should acknowledge the need for rules to securethe co-ordination of regional aids and should argue that theCommunity needed to reconcile conflicting pressures in determiningits policies on regional aids.    It must recognise that all member states conducted regional policies which effectively distortedcompetition between regions; but the dangers of such distortionshould not be exaggerated and the rules and procedures must enablemember Governments to discharge their internal responsibilitieslECJenegotiationegionalids
while avoiding actions which could have unacceptable consequences for other member States.    We should argue that systems of regionalaid must be appropriate to the situation to which they applied and thatthe provisions of the Treaty must not be interpreted in a doctrinairefashion.    We should argue that it was essential for member governments to take quick or exceptional action where necessary,and to vary the boundaries of their assisted regions in the light of changes in circumstances at a time when they judged such assistanceto be necessary.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that his own view,which had been shared by the majority of EQ, was in favour of the approach proposed by the Minister of State for Foreign and commonwealth Affairs.    This was fully consistent with theGovernments Manifesto commitment to retain for the UnitedKingdom Parliament &quot;those powers over the British economyneeded to pursue effective regional policies&quot; and also with the basic philosophy of the Labour Party.    The approach proposedby the Secretary of State for Industry would lead to a direct conflict with the Commission and other Community members and would be contrary to the policy of attempting to modify e.c. arrangements to suit our needs.    The work on regional aids would make no progress and we might well find ourselves at a disadvantage if other member states were free to pursue competitive regional policies.    There wasno reason to suppose that the Commission was fundamentally hostile to our present regional policy.    In recent months they had notresisted significant changes in both the rate of Regional employment premium (REP) and in the definition of needy areas,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that the decisionon the approach to be followed in the Working Party was central torenegotiation and was of the greatest importance.    It should not betaken in a hurry.    The question was not whether the Community wasor was not likely to take a reasonable line towards our regional policyneeds, but whether we could accept that the Commission rather thanthe United Kingdom Parliament should have the power of decision inthe field of regional aids.    It was difficult to resolve the philosophicalparadox that, whereas the fundamental objectives of the e.c. aimed atremoving distortions in competition between different parts of theCommunity, regional policy must aim to cause such distortions.The width of the difference of view between the United Kingdom andthe Community was illustrated by the way in which senior membersof the Competition Division of the Commission regarded the settlementof regional policy as an important aspect of gradual progress towards their concept of full economic and monetary union.    Although theyhad shown understanding over recent changes in REP and the definition of boundaries, this might reflect no more than a recognitionof the sensitive political situation here.    There was no reason why
this understanding approach should persist once renegotiation was over.    Moreover, in some areas such as steel pricing and ship-building policy, it was already clear that effective power had passed over to the Commission,    The approach which he advocated did notnecessitate amendment of the Treaty of Rome.    He accepted the needfor some co-ordination of regional aids, but the interest of theUnited Kingdom, and of other member Governments, must lie ina looser form of control than the Commission wanted to impose.The basic flaw of the approach recommended by the Minister ofState for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs lay in its acceptance,contrary to the specific wording of the Labour Party Manifesto, thatthe right of decision should lie with the Commission rather than withthe United Kingdom Parliament.In discussion it was argued that the powers of control available to theCommission under Articles 92-94 of the Treaty of Rome were considerable.    Moreover, the provisions for the free movementof capital were likely to impose additional constraints on our economic policies.   Article 154 of the Treaty of Accession had required thatthe co-ordination of rules for regional aids should be settled by1 July 1973, but this deadline had been deferred following criticismsmade by Labour Party spokesmen in a Parliamentary debate.   Whenthe new deadline of 1 January 1975 had been settled it had been assumed that the agreement would form part of a comprehensiveCommunity regional policy including a regional development fund.In all the circumstances we should not allow ourselves to be pushedtoo fast in the matter of settling rules for regional aids,THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet would be unable tocomplete discussion of this subject at the present meeting sinceurgent decisions were required on some other matters.    He would arrange for it to be resumed at an early meeting.The Cabinet -Took note.9
4.        The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the european economic Community&apos;s proposals for cheap beef for people receivingsocial benefits.    They had before them a minute to the PrimeMinister by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Foodreporting the outcome of his discussion in the Council of Ministers(Agriculture) on 3 September.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD recalled that the Cabinet had decided at their previous discussion that theCommunity !s scheme should be introduced in the United kingdom for all retirement pensioners, without distinction between those whowere or were not receiving supplementary pensions; however, theCommission had given the opinion that the scheme was intended only for those receiving social assistance, which would confine it to thosein receipt of means-tested benefits.   He had raised the matter at themeeting of the Council of Ministers (Agriculture) and subsequently withM Lardinois, the Commissioner responsible for agriculture, who had promised to consider carefully the suggestion that all retirement pensioners in the United Kingdom should benefit and to propose, ata further meeting to be held on 14 September, a scheme whereby this could be achieved.    He expected that the Commission would beprepared to make available assistance up to the sum which hadbeen budgeted on the basis of five million recipients for a seven-month period: on this basis cheap beef could be provided for     millionretirement pensioners, starting on 2 December, with a full contribution of 50 per cent from Community funds.    Althoughit would be premature to announce the introduction of this schemebefore the meeting on 14 September, he proposed that the arrange-ments to print the necessary coupons should be authorised now inorder that the scheme might start on 2 December.In discussion it was pointed out that instructions for printing thecoupons should be given by the end of the week if the scheme wasto start before Christmas and that once the printing order was placed the news would almost certainly leak, with the consequence that theGovernment would be discredited should the outcome of the meetingon 14 September turn out to be unsatisfactory.    There was therefore a case for taking no action until after the 14 September meeting, andaccepting that the scheme would then not start until after Christmas.As against this it was argued that a leak of information about thescheme would not matter; if, contrary to expectation, the Commissiondid not agree to the scheme now envisaged the Government&apos;s refusal to implement a scheme confined to those receiving means-tested benefits would command public support.10confidential
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food&apos;proposal to accept a scheme on the basis expected to be put forward by the Commission, and agreed that although no announcement shouldbe made until after the meeting, to be held on 14 September, thearrangements for printing the coupons should be put in hand forthwith:a leak of information was likely but would not be important enough tojustify delaying the printing instructions and thus the implementation of the scheme.    The Secretary of State for Prices and consumer protection had indicated that she would be ready to agree that the money required should be found from funds previously allocated to herDepartment, but her Department was not in a position to acceptpolicy responsibility for the scheme nor account for the costs:policy and accounting responsibility should therefore rest withthe Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, with the Secretaryof State for Social Services carrying out necessary functions on his behalf.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2.        Invited the Minister of Agriculture, fisheries and Food to be guided accordingly.11
5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Social Services (C(74) 97) on a new scheme of help for the disabled.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that shewas required under Section 36 of the Social Security Act 1973 to lay a report before Parliament by 31 October on social security provisionfor the chronically sick and disabled.    She proposed that this report should be published on 12 September.    The most important part of itrelated to her immediate proposals for social security changes; theintroduction in 1975-76 of a non-contributory invalidity pension, at separately of  6 a week free of tax, for congenitally handicapped persons,with a pocket money rate of  2 per week for in-patients inpsychiatric hospitals; the introduction in 1976-77 of a non-contributory invalid care allowance also at a rate of  6 perweek; and the subsequent introduction of a non-contributoryinvalidity pension for disabled housewives.    The text of thereport would differ marginally from that circulated as a resultof further discussions with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, butthe changes were ones of presentation rather than substance.    Thepossibility of highlighting her actual proposals in a summary had been raised, but since these proposals fell far short of what ideally she would like to do because of the public expenditure constraints it mightwell be better not to draw attention to them in this way.    The reportdid not deal with the action to be taken on Lady Sharp&apos;s report onmobility for the disabled on which the conflicting nature of thepolitical pressures and the public expenditure constraints had made settlement of policy particularly difficult; but she had howreached agreement with the Chancellor of the Exchequer on themain principles to be adopted; and subject to agreement on thefinal wording she hoped it would be possible to issue a printedstatement on this issue at the same time as the report was published.THE LORD CHANCELLOR, summing up a brief discussion, saidthat the Cabinet approved the publication on 12 September of thereport as amended in the light of the further discussion betweenthe Secretary of State for Social Services and the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer; but the Secretary of State for Social Services should give further thought to the possibility of highlighting her immediateproposals in presenting the document.    The Cabinet also agreed thata statement should be made simultaneously on the government&apos;s decision on Lady Sharp&apos;s report on mobility for the disabled subjectto the Secretary of State for Social Services&apos; being able to reach agreement with the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the wording ofthe text.12
The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the Lord Chancellor&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for Social Services to proceed accordingly.6.        THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOODinformed the Cabinet that the meeting of the Council of Ministers(Agriculture) on 3 September had considered measures to deal with problems arising in agriculture due to high costs and inadequateproducer returns, but had reached no decisions.    The Council had agreed on the seriousness of the situation and had decided to meet again on 17, 18 and 19 September with a view to reaching decisions to apply from 1 October.    He had made clear to the Council the specific problems for the United Kingdom, and he had argued thatthe situation demonstrated the need for greater flexibility in theapplication of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). There appearedto be a growing recognition elsewhere in the Community that the cap in its present form was not working satisfactorily.He had informed the Council of the serious sugar supply situationin the United Kingdom and of his intention to conduct immediatediscussions with Guyana and with Australia so as to ensureadequate supplies for the remainder of this year.    The Communityitself was unable to make good our deficit and the Council had notobjected to his proposals.     He would shortly be circulating to the ministerial Committee on European Questions detailed proposals onthe line to be taken at the Council Meeting on 17, 18 and 19September.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Minister ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food.Cabinet Office .5 September 1974
