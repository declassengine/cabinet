1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.It was reported that it would be difficult to take the SecondReading of the New Towns Bill on 28 November as proposed,because an informed Debate would not be possible if theGovernments forthcoming consultative document on future new towns policy had not been published by then.    This would not now be practicable, since there were some significant policy issues which still had to be settled.    It would therefore be preferable to use that day for a Debate on the consultative document on The Review of the Price Code.    It would then notbe possible for the New Towns Bill to have its Second Readinguntil after the Christmas Recess; but this would be acceptable,provided that the Bill received the Royal Assent if possible by may, or at the very latest by July.\1
foreign AFFAIRS      2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat he had held discussions in Paris on 19 November with president Giscard d&apos;Estaing and with M Sauvagnargues, thefiance French Foreign Minister.    In discussion on current energy-issues, it appeared that the positions of the United States and ofFrance might be closer than their public postures suggested.It was desirable to do everything possible to reconcile theirpolicy positions.    He hoped that the meeting next monthbetween the French and American Presidents would carry this process forward.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that, in discussion of preparations for the meeting of Heads of governments of Member States of the European economic community (e.c.), he had made plain that the Prime minister would raise the question of renegotiation.    He had explainedour case on the budget issue, but had not convinced the French.Similarly in discussion of the eec&apos;s common agricultural policy (CAP) the French had asserted that it was now to our advantage and to their disadvantage for them to sell us foodstuffsat e.c. rather than world prices.    He had emphasised to president Giscard the political importance of the Government;fulfilling its undertakings on renegotiation, and particularly thepolitical nature of the budget issue.    Although President Giscardhad given nothing away, he appeared to recognise this factor.In general, the French Foreign Minister had given theimpression that he was disposed to welcome some support from.other Member States, with a growing recognition that France toofaced serious economic and other domestic problems.The Cabinet - \1. Took note of the statement by theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary.Anglo-French THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatContinental Shelf in the course of his discussions in Paris, Mr Sauvagnarguessaid that the French wished to authorise, by next March at thelatest, some pilot borings in what he described as non-contestedareas in the Western Approaches.He had told M Sauvagnargues that we would be ready to examine this request when we had received the necessary information from the French; but it was important that the arbitral tribunal which we had jointly agreed to establish to resolve ourdifferences over the division of the Continental Shelf should beset up as quickly as possible.i   2
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that theFrench request should be examined very carefully: we shouldnot agree to it if there were a danger that by so doing we would weaken our case before the tribunal.The Cabinet -2.       Took note of the  statements by theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary andthe Secretary of State for Energy.e.c. Council ofMinisters(Agriculture)The Cabinet had before them a minute dated 20 November fromthe Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to the PrimeMinister reporting the results of the meeting of the Council ofMinisters (Agriculture) on 18-20 November.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthat the main decisions of the Council related to the price for new Zealand butter and cheese imported under Protocol 18 ofthe Treaty of Accession; new beef marketing arrangements forthe United Kingdom; and arrangements for the import of sugarfrom developing countries under Protocol 22 of the Treaty of accession.    The negotiations at this Council, had proved to bethe hardest he had experienced; he had noticed a hardening of attitude by other Member States in the face of further and continuing demands by the United Kingdom for special arrangements.-New ZealandButter and CheeseTHE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthat the Council had adopted a proposal to increase the price ofimports into the United Kingdom of butter and cheese from new Zealand by 18 per cent from 1 January 1975.    Throughoutthe discussion he had maintained contact with the New ZealandMinister of Overseas Trade.    The latter was content with the outcome of the discussion, and had pubHcly welcomed it, givingparticular credit to the efforts of the British Government.The Cabinet -3.      Took note, with approval, of the decision ofthe Council of Ministers (Agriculture) on the priceof New Zealand butter and cheese.
THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthat agreement had been reached in the Council of Ministers tothe United Kingdom introducing new arrangements for beefmarketing, involving variable slaughter premia (which weredeficiency payments under another name) together with limitedsupport buying at prices well below pur national intervention andguaranteed prices.    This was a temporary arrangement andwithout prejudice to the permanent beef regime to be introducedfrom 1 March 1975.    He had had much difficulty in obtainingagreement to Our requirements, particularly since the principleof deficiency payments had been totally unacceptable to the EECin the past.    He believed that the new arrangements would giveBritish farmers a firm floor price for their beef cattle; andthat they would not involve intervention buying of large amounts of beef nor lead to increased levies on imports when they were resumed.    At the Council he had again pressed the need to     .permit imports from Botswana and Swaziland.In discussion it was argued that, although the right to reintroducedeficiency payments was valuable, the commitment to introduceintervention buying would have serious implications.    this meant the acceptance of a principle, no matter in how modified a form, which the Government had publicly opposed.    Moreoveragreement on the new arrangements, since they were purely temporary, did not advance our objective of the fundamentalreform of the CAP.    Indeed a system whereby Britain paid foragricultural support for other members of the e.c. through the cap while paying out of our own Exchequer to the order of 15 million in this instance, for support for British farmers was unsatisfactory.    Action should be concentrated on our major  iobjective of reforming fundamental features of the CAP which weredetrimental to the interests of consumers and international trade.On the other hand it was argued that acceptance - even iftemporarily - of deficiency payments, which the e.c. had hithertoresolutely opposed, was to be welcomed and would have a most valuable impact on the forthcoming negotiations within the CAPstocktaking and on the future beef regime.    Our objections to full-scale e.c. intervention were more practical than doctrinal,as the existence of support buying arrangements for potatoes inthe United Kingdom showed.    The Government had to deal with thevery serious problems facing farmers; in present circumstances,and as part of arrangements designed as a whole to restore confidence in the market, limited intervention buying was an acceptable price to pay.    If the new arrangements led, as theyshould, to firming-up of the market, it would make it easier to restore import j , and lead to lower levies on imports.    The CAPwas in fact changing under the pressure of events as well as the impact of our renegotiation objectives.4
In further discussion the following points were made -a. Preparations for the negotiations on the permanentbeef regime should be pursued urgently.    In these negotiations it would be a mistake to accept as the starting point the position which would be reached by31 January 1975, when the intervention price would be85 per cent of the guide price.b. The presentation of the decision reached at theCouncil of Ministers would require careful handling.We should not claim to have achieved a major victory.The temporary nature of the arrangements, and the factthat they were without prejudice to the negotiations for apermanent regime, should be made clear.    On the otherhand we should claim credit for dealing with a difficult situation in the livestock industry - the new arrangements had been welcomed by the President of the national farmers Union - and for the reintroduction of deficiency round.c. It had been agreed at the Council of Ministers thatparallel payments should be made on imports of cattle(without any domiciliary period) and beef from the irish republic.    This was inevitable; nevertheless there was still feeling gmong Welsh farmers on this matter, and difficulties would be caused in Northern Ireland if itappeared that farmers there were in a less advantageousposition than those in the Irish Republic.d. An understanding had been reached with theCommission, despite French reservations, that anysavings on variable slaughter premia early in the periodof the arrangements could be used later in the period;this should help to ensure maintenance of the guaranteed price which otherwise might come under pressure later in the period.e. Storage capacity for beef taken into intervention was limited.    However, since sales into intervention would not benefit from slaughter premia payments, and since the market was likely to firm up in the coming weeks,the quantities likely to go into intervention could beexpected to be small.    The Intervention Board forAgricultural Produce was of the view that it could cope with the quantities likely to be offered.5
OF THE council the LORD PRESIDENT/ summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet took note of the arrangements for the marketing of beefin this country which had been agreed at the Council of Ministers(Agriculture).    Although some members had expressed seriousreservations, these arrangements had widespread support in theCabinet.The Cabinet -4.       Took note, with approval, of theLord President of the Councils summing up oftheir discussion the MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthat two aspects of the arrangements for the import of sugar intothe e.c. from certain developing, principally Commonwealth,countries under Protocol 22 of the Treaty of Accession had been left over from the Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs).    Theserelated to the duration of the agreement and the prices to be guaranteed under it.At the Council of Ministers (Agriculture) a fully satisfactoryformula for the duration of the arrangements had been agreed.This provided that the principle of the guarantee to buy sugarwould be valid for an indefinite period; that the procedures for implementing it should be open to review, and that there wouldbe a review before the end of the seventh year; but that noamendments (apart from cases of deliberate short-fall) shouldbe made for five years.    This formula recognised the seven-yearcycle of cane sugar production.    It was at least as good as the duration formula of the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement (CSA).The negotiation about prices had proved particularly difficult.In the end a formula in two parts had been agreed.    There wouldbe a long-term basic guaranteed price which would be within theprices applicable in the Community.    In addition, in the presentcircumstances of high world prices - and this meant at least for1975 and, if necessary, for 1976 - it would be possible to supplement the basic guaranteed price on a national basis.Although a price within Community prices would currently be equivalent to less than  140 a ton fob,..a &quot;flbigh world price&quot;supplement would consequently be payable in the presentsituation, and Community prices could be expected to rise in themeantime to the equivalent of  140 a ton fob.6
The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that he had accepted these arrangements ad referendum to the Cabinet.    Hewould have to lift or confirm his reservation by the end ofFriday, 22 November.    The negotiations between the community and the Protocol 22 countries should then be pursued urgently.It was not possible at this stage to forecast precisely what prices were likely to emerge from those negotiations.In discussion it was argued that the decision on duration was a notable achievement.    It represented a defeat for those dominated by the European heet interests, and a recognition that, following the United Kingdom&apos;s accession, the e.c. had to pay more regardto the developing countries - a fact that the developing countriesthemselves had acknowledged.    The assurance of access for an indefinite period plus a firm basis for the establishment of prices was to be welcomed.    The recognition that, in periods ofexceptionally high world prices the long-term price arrangements might not prove adequate, and could be supplemented on a national basis, was valuable in principle.     The strains thrown upon long-term contracts when the residual world price reached exceptionally high levels had been shown in the operation of the CSA this year;and supplementary payments had been required.    If the CSA hadbeen continuing, present circumstances would have required some system to be devised which would have distinguished between theprice that had to be paid in the immediate future and the long-termprice basis.On the other hand it was argued that to limit the long-term pricepayable under Protocal 22 to the price payable for European beetsugar would not be acceptable to the CSA countries, and would therefore effectively nullify the guarantee of access.    We shouldnot accept the proposals ourselves unless they were acceptable to the CSA countries.    As the proposals stood, we could get the worst of both worlds.    Only the Community as a whole could 1enter into a long-term contract, and only the Community as a wholeCould determine the price to be offered.    If that price provedinadequate, we should not have the option of negotiating asupplement on a long-term basis, under which we might well beable to reach agreement with our CSA suppliers at a reasonablelevel.    Instead we were free only to pay a supplement on anannual basis and we must expect our suppliers to charge a high price since they would have no long-term assurance of thesupplement.    Moreover, the national responsibility for  v:financing the supplement would seem to detract from the \\decision taken last month at the Council of Ministers (Agriculture)by which it was to be a Community responsibility to assure us ofour sugar supplies and, if need be,: to subsidise the price downto the Community level,7
However it was suggested that it was to our advantage for thesupplement to be on a national basis; this would help us tosafeguard employment in our refinery industry.    We were on this occasion in the unusual situation of wishing to pay a higher pricethan the rest of the Community.    Whatever prices were finally agreed for 1975, it was realistic to expect there to be a short-fallfrom the 1.4 million tons of imports from the CSA countries;we should try to ensure that this short-fall did not prejudice their future rights of access.    There was in any case likely to be a gap between our imports under Protocol 22 plus home production on theone hand and total United Kingdom demand on the other; but wewould be at liberty to make good that gap from any source.OF THE COUNCIL,THE LORD PRESIDENT/ summing up the discussion, said thatthe Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food had circulated tothe Prime Minister and other Ministers directly concerned, his proposals on duration and price for the Protocol 22 arrangements on sugar before the meeting of the Council of Ministers(Agriculture).    The Council decision on duration was clearlywithin his remit and that on price was in principle consistent with it.    It was the view of the majority of the Cabinet that the decisions on sugar reached at the Council of Ministers (Agriculture) should beaccepted, and that the reserve on British acceptance of them shouldnowbeHfted.    The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Foodhad been faced with difficult and complex negotiations throughoutthe whole meeting of the Council of Ministers; he was to bewarmly congratulated on what he had achieved.The Cabinet -5.      Took note, with approval, of the Lord Presidentof the Councils summing up of their discussion.6.      Invited the Minister of Agriculture, fisheries and Food to the his reserve on the decisions on sugartaken at the Council of Ministers (Agriculture) on18-20 November.8
3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for the Environment (C(74) 135) containing his proposalsfor the next steps in dealing with the Parliamentary, technical and international aspects of the Channel Tunnel project.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT recalled that in March, the Cabinet had agreed that Phase II of the project should go ahead, subject to a most searching reappraisal of all aspects of the scheme, and on the firm understanding that theGovernment were completely uncommitted as to its future.Recently, it had been agreed that the Channel Tunnel Bill shouldbe reintroduced in Parliament,  and that an earl y policy  statement should be made by him.    Since March there had been one major change in the situation; the cost of the proposed new high-speedrail link had escalated by two or three times, so that it was now clear that this proposal should not be proceeded with: British iRail were considering an alternative solution which might reducethe price of the rail link to an acceptable level.    In Parliament,there had been a shift of opinion against the Tunnel, though theEarly Day Motion opposing the project had so far attracted only85 signatures, fewer than had been expected.    He was strongly opposed to seizing the opportunity to cancel the project now.This in his view would be frivolous and irresponsible, because itwas essential to have the report of the Cairncross. Committee,and the results of Phase H of the project, and British RaiPsproposals for a modified rail link, before the Cabinet would havethe information on which to base a considered decision.    Takingthe long view, the Tunnel might well prove more cost-effective than any other option; ways must be found to convey more trafficacross the Channel, and we did not know that the alternative of increased investment in ferries, ports, roads, airports, aircraft and the rest would not involve larger sums than the Tunnel project.The Tunnel was the only way to link the rail networks of Britainand Europe, and would provide a useful stimulus to British Rail.There would be no financial advantage in cancelling the projectnow: expenditure on Phase II waa limited to the cost of two orthree hundred tunnellers and some highly specialised tunnellingequipment.    Because of the arrangement for Governmentguarantees for financing the project, to cancel the project would cost money which would not be forfeited if the project went ahead.Therefore, he proposed to seek to negotiate with the FrenchGovernment a delay of at least a year before taking a decision whether to proceed with Phase III of the project.    He would liketo make an announcement the following week in Parliament thatthis was being done, and that the Government had decided not toproceed with the high-speed rail link; such an announcement would at once disarm many of those who objected to the rail link,and those who felt that the prospective economic difficulties of thenext couple of years made it inappropriate to spend large sums of.   -   &quot; 9
money on this project.    The Cairncross inquiry should continue,and so should Phase II, until enough information had beenobtained for the Cabinet to consider the matter properly.    he hoped that Sir Alec Cairncross would produce an interim reportin the New Year, and a final report by about April;   Phase IIstudies should be complete during the first half of 1975, and inthe spring British Rail should produce their revised proposalsfor a rail link, at least in preliminary form.    If the cabinet agreed with his proposal, therefore, this did not mean that theywere putting off the possibility of taking any decision on the project for a long time to come.In discussion, it was argued that the progress of the project sofar had borne out all the fears which had been expressed at thebeginning.    The project was becoming more and more expensive;indeed, the escalation on the rail link far exceeded what wasusual even for technological developments of this kind;  theprospect that a suitable rail link could be completed at reasonablecost was getting more and more re mote;  the longer a decision;was postponed, the harder it would be eventually to cancel the project.    In the meantime, until a decision was taken, large areas of the South East were blighted, while the pull of theTunnel prospect enhanced regional imbalance.    At a time whenMinisters were proclaiming an economic crisis and the need toreduce public expenditure, it made no sort of sense to continue with the project.    A Channel Tunnel had been considered for more than a hundred years, and the arguments against it had always been found compelling; we might expect that the FrenchGovernment were also making their own reappraisal of the project,and they would certainly not hesitate to abandon it if they feltthat that was in their own best interest.    The right coursetherefore was to decide now to withdraw from the project, before we found ourselves trapped into spending larger and larger sums of money to no good end.On the other hand, it was argued that it would be irresponsibleand frivolous to cancel the project without the information whichwould become available from the Cairncross Committee,Phase II, and British RaiPs new look at the rail link.    It mightbe possible to make a re-assessment of the wisdom of continuingin the spring.    Of course, the high-speed rail link as originally proposed should be abandoned, and any new proposals fromBritish Rail should be examined very carefully indeed.    TheTunnel could prove much more cost-effective in energy termsthan alternative.possibilities, although admittedly we would becommitting large sums of money to a single programme if itwent ahead.   The French would probably be receptive to theproposal for some delay.    Indeed they might themselves bereappraising the viability of the project.    Nevertheless theywere pushing ahead with ratifying the Treaty because of the risk&apos; 10
of claims for compensation, from the companies if they allowed the due date to pass: if the British Government decided towithdraw from the project now, the French would be certain toput the full blame and any consequential charges on us, whereasif we proposed a delay to them and they agreed, we would be ableto take steps jointly to ensure that the least expenditure was involved before a proper decision could be taken, either toproceed with the scheme or to cancel it.In further discussion it was emphasised that if the Secretary ofStatefs proposals were accepted, it would be essential to meetlikely opposition in Parliament by making a very full statement,and also by meeting the Parliamentary opponents of the scheme in order to try to convince them of the wisdom of the Government&apos;policy.OF THE council the LORD PRESIDENT/ summing up the discussion, said thaton balance the Cabinet agreed with the Secretary of State&apos;sproposals.    The opportunity of talking to the French aboutpostponing Phase HI of the project should be taken to try and as certain their current views more generally about itsviability.    In view of the very important international,financial and regional impHcations, it seemed desirable that asmall Ministerial Committee should be set up to keep an eye on developments, and in particular the negotiations with the FrenchGovernment, the Cairncross Report, the Phase II studies,British RaiPs new appraisal of the rail link, and the regionalimpHcations.The Cabinet -1.      Approved the recommendations inparagraph 13 of C(74) 135.2.      Invited the Secretary of State for the environment, in consultation with the Secretaryof State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs,to seek agreement with the French Governmenton postponing for at least a year a decision onPhase HI of the project.3.      Invited the Secretary of State for the environment to arrange for the reintroduction of the Channel Tunnel Bill on Report, prefacedby a statement in Parliament on the high-speedrail link and the result of his approach to theFrench Government.4.      Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to seek the Prime Minister&apos;s approval for theestablishment of a small Ministerial Committeeon the lines proposed by the Lord President inhis summing up.: - 11
BILL TO amend the TRADEUNION ANDLABOURRELATIONS ACT1974PreviousReference:CC(74) 46thConclusions,Minute 34. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT saidthat the General Council of the Trades Union Congress (TUC)at their meeting the previous day had accepted the proposalput to them by the General Secretary of the TUC for a non-statutory appeals procedure.    They had accepted it in exactly the form to which the Cabinet had agreed, substituting &quot;inconsultation&quot; for &quot;after consultation&quot; as had been suggested in cabinet.    He would now proceed with the introduction of theGovernment Bill to amend the Trade Union and labour relations Act.   As regards the National Union of Journalists(NUJ) he was not yet ready to propose what action should betaken.   He had met certain editors who had proposed an ill-considered amendment to the Bill, the effect of which wouldbe to destroy an essential part of it.    He had told them thathe would try to find some other way to deal with the matter.The question was certain to arise during the second reading of the Bill, and it would be possible to introduce an amendment to the Bill at that stage if any valid suggestion were made.In discussion it was argued that the question of Press freedomwas too broad to be discussed only in relation to one clause inthe Bill.    The Cabinet should consider this question separately.OF THE council the LORD PRESIDENT/, summing up the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet took note of the decision by the TUC general council and agreed that the Government Bill should now beintroduced.    As regards the threat to Press freedom posed bythe NUJ, it would be necessary to provide an answer to theParliamentary attacks that were likely to be mounted by theOpposition at the debate on the second reading.   After thesecond reading the Cabinet would expect to see proposalsfor action in fulfilment of the conclusions of their meeting on14 November.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Lord President of theCouncil.Cabinet Office21 November 197412
