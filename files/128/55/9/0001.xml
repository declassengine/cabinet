The Cabinet resumed their discussion of a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (C(74) 93)about the approach to renegotiation objectives on regional aids withinthe European Economic Community (e.c.),In discussion it was argued that the approach proposed by the Ministerof State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Mr Hattersley) would imply, however generous the rules might be which we succeeded in negotiating, our acceptance that in the last resort the authority of the eec Commission must prevail over that of the United kingdom parliament,    The Election Manifesto had committed the Governmentto the retention of the necessary powers by Parliament,    If any press reports of discussion in Brussels were to suggest that this objectivehad been abandoned, this would be widely interpreted as a retreat fromagreed political objectives.   In view of the constant risk of Pressleaks there would be advantage in the present political circumstances in deferring any action which would require officials to argue theUnited Kingdom case in Brussels.    If this were accepted, no immediate decision was necessary on what our policy approach should be.On the other hand, it was explained that since the meeting of theWorking Party was to be held at the level of officials only the riskof leaks to the Press should be small.    The paper at Annex B toC(74) 93 was not for circulation to the Working Party, but was a brief as a basis for the oral deployment of the United Kingdom case.As long ago as 4 June, the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had said in his statement to the e.c. Council of Ministers that the UnitedKingdom would be making a full contribution to the work of theWorking Party.    Even in present political circumstances we couldnot reasonably ask for discussion in the Working Party to be furtherdeferred; and it would be to our disadvantage if the work went aheadwithout us.    The course which the Minister of State for Foreign and commonwealth Affairs proposed was entirely compatible with the manifesto, and it should not create any political difficulty if it should become known publicly.In further discussion it was suggested that it would be wrong toassume that any e.c. rules, once made, would be interpretedflexibly by the Commission or would be likely to give us the freedomwe would require.    Unacceptable rules governing state aids already existed within the e.c.; and, once any system of rules had beenagreed, it could be changed only by unanimous agreement or throughobtaining a favourable interpretation from the Commission and theEuropean Court of Justice.    All questions affecting aids to industry had now to be referred in advance to the e.c. Commission inaccordance with the e.c. Treaty,    To place ourselves further in the hands of the Commission bureaucracy would not be compatible
with the Governments position on the preservation of the powers ofParliament with regard to the e.c...   The course favoured by theSecretary of &quot;State for Industry did not necessarily involve any Treatyamendment, nor the avoidance of any co-ordination: it wouldmean trusting Governments to behave reasonably rather thanplacing faith in reasonable behaviour by the Commission.    we ought to seek to persuade the other member Governments of the merits of this policy approach, at least as an opening position.On the other hand, it was pointed out that it was in the interestsof the United Kingdom that there should be rules governing action by other Governments to attract investment within the e.c..    Rulesnecessitated a role for the Commission under the e.c. Treaty.Provided we could obtain agreement to rules which were compatible with the various requirements set out in both the Secretary of Statefor Industry&apos;s paper and that by the Minister of State for Foreign and commonwealth Affairs, for example that member Governments shouldbe free to introduce labour subsidies and to take quick or exceptionalaction as necessary, we need have no fear that in practice our freedom to follow the policies we wished would be constrained.    Satisfaction onsuch points should be a sticking point in the present discussions: andthe progress made would be taken into account in the eventual decision whether to recommend the outcome of renegotiation.    Annex B toC(74) 93 should be strengthened to make this clearer.    The statement by the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary on 4 June that the UnitedKingdom recognised the value of rules within the Communitygoverning levels of regional aids had been made in consultationwith the other Ministers concerned.    We ought now to follow upthat statement as soon as possible by explaining the changes were quired in the rules.    If we could not in the event obtain what we wanted, it would still be open to us to consider alternativeapproaches, including if necessary Treaty amendment,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe Cabinet were agreed that we must be free to follow the regional policies we required.    The majority felt however that this wascompatible with having rules on state aids and that indeed theestablishment of the right rules would be in our own interests.They therefore favoured the tactical course recommended by theMinister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs.    The brieffor the United Kingdom repre sentative in the e.c. Working Party onthe co-ordination of regional aids should however be strengthened by including appropriate extracts from the Foreign and commonwealth secretary^ statement of 1 April, and by quoting more fully from his statement of 4 June.    The instructions should also be amended to makeit plain that it was of fundamental importance in renegotiation that thenew e.c. rules governing the co-ordination of regional aids shouldsatisfy the requirements set out in paragraph 5 to Annex B of C(74) 93.2
This action would ensure that the line to be taken by the UnitedKingdom representative in the Working Party would be fully defensiblein the event of any Press leaks that might occur.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2.        Invited the Foreign and commonwealth secretary to revise accordingly,, and circulate to the Cabinet, the brief to the United kingdom representative to the Working Party,Cabinet Office10 September 19743
