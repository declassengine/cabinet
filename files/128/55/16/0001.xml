2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat we had been informed of the impressions gained by theAmerican Secretary of State, Dr Kissinger, in the course of his recent visit to Moscow,    Mr Brezhnev, who clearly remained infirm control of Soviet policy, had shown some anxiety that the policyof detente which had marked Mr Nixon&apos;s approach to relations withthe Soviet Union would not be pursued as vigorously by president Ford.    Dr Kissinger&apos;s discussions with the Sovietleadership about strategic arms limitation appeared to have madelittle progress, but Dr Kissinger professed himself hopeful thatthere would be some forward movement in the coming year.    TheRussians had shown concern for the possible international consequentces of the achievement by India of a nuclear explosion.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that at therecent meeting of Arab leaders in Rabat, King Hussein of Jordan hadbeen obliged to yield ground to the Palestinian LiberationOrganisation (FLO) in the context of future international negotiations,including the future of the West Bank of the Jordan,    This would lead the Government of Israel to harden their positions; they were most unlikely to agree to negotiate directly with the PLO.    Dr Kissingerappeared to be hopeful of some progress in the Middle East, but thesituation during the next few months could well be difficult and thepossibility that the Arabs would resort once again to a restriction of oil supplies as a means of putting pressure on Western countries could not be entirely excluded.    It was important that the plans,national and international, for meeting an oil shortage should be advanced as quickly as possible.The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Prime Minister(C(74) 116) on the Defence Review.    Their discussion is recorded separately.Cabinet Office31 October 1974
HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy no cabinet confidential annex cc(74) 41st Conclusions, Minute 3Thursday 31 October, 1974 at 10. 30 amDEFENCE The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Prime MinisterREVIEW    ,        (C(74) 116) about the defence review.THE PRIME MINISTER said that his memorandum summarised theconclusions of a very detailed examination undertaken by theDefence and Oversea Policy Committee of our defence expenditure,commitments and capabilities.    Their objective had been to deter-mine the minimum essential level of our defence and the maximumsavings on the defence budget.    In view of the long timescalesinvolved in defence planning it had been necessary to consider a10 year period in order to achieve real reductions.    If we continued with the present plans defence expenditure would amount to 6 per cent of gross National Product (GNP)by 1978-79 and over 5j percent by 1983-84.By drastically cutting commitments and capabilities the level ofexpenditure could be reduced to 4j per cent of GNP by 1984 - a saving of  475 million a year by 1978-79 and  750 million a yearby 1983-84 by comparison with the cost of existing plans.    these were substantial savings and consistent with the Manifesto.    Itwould not however be possible to avoid a modest rise in actual costsover the next 2 years, after which the figures would level off.   Butdefence expenditure for next year would be contained within thegrowth limit of 2f per cent for public expenditure generally.    Someof the Governments supporters would think that the cuts in expenditure should be greater.    There was likely to be criticism inside and outside Parliament, however, when the severity of the cuts thatwould have to be imposed on the Armed Forces became known.    Wewould also face difficulties with our allies in the North Atlantic treaty organisation (NATO) and with some of our non-NATO partners.    Itwould be necessary to withdraw from our non-NATO commitments to the maximum possible extent, although in some cases, such asCyprus, the timing of withdrawal would depend upon the politicalsituation.    Major reductions would also have to be made in our contribution to NATO, but in a way which would not undermine alliedt
confidence or remove the incentive to the Russians to agree mutualforce reductions.    The conventional forces of the Warsaw Pactcontinued to grow and were out-distancing those of NATO.In discussion it was argued that although our defence expenditure was greater than that of our major European allies when measured as a percentage of GNP, this reflected our low rate of growth, and inabsolute terms we were falling behind both France and Germany.The severity of the proposed reduction in our commitments and capabilities was disturbing.    Our standing as an ally, and our influence abroad, especially with the United States and the soviet union, would inevitably be weakened.    To make even greater cuts would call in question our credibility as a member of the alliance and endanger our relationship with the United States.    Before we entered into the necessary consultation in NATO it would be important to discuss our proposals confidentially with the Americans and theGermans and, within the financial limits we had laid down, to beprepared if necessary to modify them in the light of their reactions.On the other hand it was argued that a high level of defence spendingwas a contributory factor in our slow rate of growth.    Major reduc-tions were necessary if we were to strengthen the economy,,    Theforeign exchange costs of maintaining forces in Europe were a heavy burden on our balance of payments.    We alone among the Europeanpartners made a major contribution to NATO both on the CentralFront and in the Eastern Atlantic and Channel.    It might well benecessary to look for further savings within a few years.In further discussion it was pointed out that the industrial implications of the proposed reductions should be manageable though there might be difficulties in particular areas.    It would however be important at anearly stage to have consultations with both sides of industry to minimiseany adverse effects.    It was also argued that, in view of theimportance of the problems involved, further time should be providedfor discussion of the strategic philosophy behind the proposals, and ofcertain particular aspects including the extent of our withdrawal from our non-NATO commitments and the proposal to maintain and improve our deterrent.    On the other hand it was pointed out that ourpossession of an effective deterrent enabled us to exercise a degree pfpolitical influence, particularly with the United States (but also withthe Soviet Union) much greater than that enjoyed by other members of nato.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the issues involved in the defence review were of great complexity and importance and the Cabinet would resume their discussion at a later meeting.    The programme for international consultation to which wewere committed was however very tight.The Cabinet -Agreed to resume their discussion at a later meeting.Cabinet office November 1974 secret
