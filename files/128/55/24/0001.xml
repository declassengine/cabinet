[ 1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeRROPJSM Secretary (C(74) 139) about legislation on terrorism by the IrishGREAT Republican Army (IRA).SITAINTHE HOME SECRETARY said that the Police and the Security service had in the past been opposed to banning the IRA on the ground that thiswould tend to make their task more difficult.    They had howeverfavoured an extension of the power of the Police to hold without charge;but legislation on this had hitherto seemed impracticable.    Therevulsion of feeling in the country and in Parliament following therecent terrorist incidents in Birmingham had however made possiblelegislation on a package which would-both provide substantially wider powers for the Police and enable the IRA and other terroristorganisations connected with Northern Ireland to be proscribed.It was argued in some quarters that it would be desirable to reintro-duce identity cards as a security measure; but the consequential callson resources of manpower and money would be quite disproportionateto the likely benefits.    The provisions of the Bill which it was hoped to introduce on 27 November, and to pass through all its stages on thefollowing day, fell into four main groups.    First, the Bill wouldproscribe the IRA and give power to make further proscriptions byOrder of organisations involved in terrorism in the Northern Irelandcontext.    It would become a punishable offence to be a member of, orto support, a proscribed organisation, or to display publicly items ofdress or other articles indicating membership or support of aproscribed organisation.    This latter proposal would involve asubstantial widening of the powers at present contained in the public order Act 1936, which were of uncertain applicability.    Secondly, itwas proposed that the Secretary oi State should have powerto make Orders prohibiting par sons he believed to be involved in terrorism from entering, or expelling them from, GreatBritain,    It had originally been intended        to exclude from theapplication of this power citizens of the United Kingdom or Colonieswho had been ordinarily resident in Great Britain for the last 20 years or, if less than 20 years of age, since their birth; but he nowproposed to reconsider this proposal because the Birminghamexperience showed that residents of even longer standing might be associated with terrorism.    It would be an offence to fail to complywith an exclusion order, or knowingly to harbour a person subject toan order or to facilitate his entry into Great Britain,    Thirdly, it was proposed that the Police should be empowered to detain a suspectedterrorist without,charge for 48 hours, and for a further five days withthe consent of the Secretary of State, and to take his fingerprints.Fourthly, the Bill would give the Secretary of State power to make anOrder providing for the control of travel into and out of Great Britainand for the appointment of officers to operate the control.    It was intended to make an Order as soon as the Bill became law; this would -
not be a vehicle for control over all passengers moving betweenGreat Britain and Ireland but would enable selective checks to be operated by the Police - indeed, manpower stringency often would prevent anything more, for example at some of the Scottish ports.These were very wide powers, unprecedented in peacetime; and he therefore proposed that the new provisions should expire six monthsafter becoming law, but that there should be power to renew them forfurther periods of six months by means of Orders subject to affirmative Resolution.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said thatit was important to ensure that the proposed new legislation would nothave undesirable practical or political implications for NorthernIreland.    There, the IRA was already proscribed; but experience showed that it was generally not in practice possible to take actionagainst public displays of support for it, such as uniformedprocessions.    It was also important not to extend proscription sowide that no scope was left for legitimate political activity.    It was desirable that the proposed powers for controlling travel betweenGreat Britain and Ireland should be matched by similar powers tocontrol travel across the Border with the Irish Republic, though here again only selective action would be possible.    As regards theproposed powers of arrest and detention, the Eill would provide wider powers in Great Britain than existed in Northern Ireland, where asuspect could be held for only 72 hours.    It would cause him much difficulty if Northern Ireland practice were not brought into line andhe hoped it would be possible to do this at an early date when theEmergency Provisions (Northern Ireland) Act came up for renewal.He was however particularly concerned about the proposed power tomake exclusion orders.    It was doubtful whether people subject tosuch orders would be admitted to the Irish Republic, and most of them would therefore probably finish up in Northern Ireland.    Those against whom charges could be made would be taken before the courts and, itwas to be hoped, imprisoned; and virtually all the remainder were likely to be detained under IntftrimCustody Orders made by theSecretary of State.    The implications for security in Northern Irelandcould be harmful, all the more so because of the present inadequacy ofprison accommodation and staff.    A good many of the presenttroubles in Northern Ireland were worsened by the irresolution of theDubHn Government in combating terrorism, and the opportunity shouldbe taken to press them vigorously for stronger measures and for closer co-operation with the Northern Ireland authorities.In discussion, it was argued that drastic powers, despite theirworrying implications for civil liberties, were justified by the specialcircumstances of the time.    Terrorism in this country was now amuch more serious threat than it had been in 1939 when thePrevention of Violence (Temporary Provisions) Act was passed.
Northern Ireland was on the verge of civil war, which the IRAwere seeking to extend to Great Britain.    The Birmingham incidentshad violently aroused public opinion; and unless the Governmentshowed a firm determination to act against terrorism there was likelyto be an intensified public reaction against the Irish community here.It was however argued that there was legitimate ground for anxiety about the erosion of civil liberties.    It was, for example, proposedthat a person against whbm an exclusion order had been made shouldbe able to make representations only to the Secretary of State, and notto apply to the courts, on the ground that the making of such ordersmust be an executive act.    But this safeguard was inadequate andsome more satisfactory right of appeal was needed.    The provision on exclusion orders was tantamount to a power to banish Britishcitizens.    This had been unknown in Britain since the Middle Ages.It was likely that it would lead to proceedings before the european commission on Human Rights, which the United Kingdom Governmentwould almost certainly lose.    It would be preferable to drop this power altogether; but if it had to be retained, it would be desirable for the provisions of the legislation to run only for periods of threemonths, rather than six months as proposed.    Anxiety about the implications for Northern Ireland were heightened by the fact thatthere could be no certainty how the new legislation would work inpractice.    But the return of terrorists to Northern Ireland underexclusion orders could exacerbate the situation there9 and perhapslead to an increase in attacks on the security forces.    On the otherhand it was argued that exclusion orders were a necessary part of theproposed package although the number of persons subject to orderswould not be large.    The orders would not apply to persons born inGreat Britain, and the power to expel would be used only where suchaction was justified on the ground that the individual concerned hadconnections with a territory outside Great Britain.    A life of only three months for the new powers would be too short; but an assurance could be given that the working of the legislation would be reviewedbefore the end of the first six-month period, so that amendments couldbe made if necessary.    In relation to exclusion orders an additionalsafeguard might be provided by giving a right of appeal to theSecurity Commission, who would of course have to be consulted inadvance, or an undertaking by the Home Secretary to consult theCommission.In subsequent discussion, it was pointed out that the Parliamentaryhandling of the legislation would need careful thought.    The opposition were likely to ask for a general debate on Northern Ireland,    Becauseof the urgency of the legislation, this could scarcely take place inconjunction with consideration of the bill but time should be found assoon as possible thereafter.    There was a particular danger thatamendments might be tabled for the restoration of the death penalty.Such amendments should if possible be precluded, partly because they3    -
would seriously delay the passage of the Bill and partly because anyquestion of restoring the death penalty should preferably beconsidered later, when passions had cooled.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet had concluded that the Home Secretary&apos;s proposals must be supported, including the proposed power to make exclusion orders:the danger from terrorism was greater than it had been in 1939 and powers must be taken at least as wide as those in the Prevention of violence (Temporary Provisions) Act 1939.    The better co-operationof the Government of the Irish Republic on security matters was essential; and urgent talks must be held with them.    Anxiety hadbeen expressed about the implications of the proposals for civilliberty and about their implications for the situation in NorthernIreland itself.    The Home Secretary, in consultation with the LordChancellor, the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Secretary ofState for Northern Ireland and the English and Scottish Law officers should arrange for an urgent examination of the detailed provisions ofthe Bill to see, in the light of the discussion, how far the anxietieswhich had been expressed could be met.    On specific points it hadbeen agreed that the Home Secretary would consider the possibilityof establishing criteria for the use of the power to make exclusionorders and of enlarging the right of appeal;  and he would make clearthat, although it was proposed that the new powers should run for sixmonths, there would be a review of the working of the legislationbefore the end of the first six-month period so that amendments couldbe proposed if necessary.   The Prime Minister continued that if, inthe light of the interdepartmental consultations, it seemed that furthercollective consideration was required, he would consider with theHome Secretary what arrangements should be made for this.    Asregards the handling of the Bill in Parliament, it would be desirable for the Home Secretary to meet Government supporters in advance inorder to explain what was proposed.    The aim should be for the Billto complete all its stages in both Houses on 28 November; but if, as was likely, the whole of that day was required for proceedings in theHouse of Commons it should be taken in the House of Lords on thefollowing day.    It would probably be necessary to promise an earlygeneral debate on Northern Ireland.    The Long Title of the Bill should if possible be drawn so as to preclude amendments seeking therestoration of capital punishment; but if this were impracticable, or if pressure on the matter proved too strong, a separate debate shouldbe promised, though after an interval long enough to allow for coolerreflection.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited the HomeSecretary, in consultation with the other ministers concerned, .to proceed accordingly.
2, The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of theCabinet (C(74) 137) covering the draft of a Parliamentary statement on the Defence Review,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that subject to a small number of drafting amendments which had been proposed and accepted, the draft statement was approved.    It wouldbe made by the Secretary of State for Defence on 3 December,   In themeantime the strictest security about its contents should bemaintained.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.\5
3.        The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C(74) 136) and by the Secretary of State for social services (C(74) 138) on public expenditure from 1974-75 to 1978-79.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that his memorandumset out the extent to which he had been able to reach agreement on further adjustments to the expenditure figures following the Cabinet1 slast discussion.     The proposals he put forward would enable theaverage annual rate of increase in expenditure to be kept within the agreed limit of Z\ per cent a year in demand terms, but a greatdeal would turn upon the Governmenfs ability to control localauthority expenditure and its willingness to go forward withincreases in nationalised industry prices on which, in spite of thepolitical problems they would produce, they were all agreed.    on overseas aid, he had reached agreement with the Minister on anincrease of  24 million in 1975-76 and  6 million in 1976-77, whichwould avoid a fall in real terms between those two years.    He was grateful to those of his colleagues who had been prepared to acceptwhat he had proposed in the interests of maintaining the overalllimit.    On defence, expenditure, he would have preferred to havekept to the lower figure of  3j 750million for 1978-79, but was prepared to accept the Secretary of State&apos;s figure of  3,800 million on the understanding that it should be regarded as provisionalpending further consultation with allies and the preparation of nextyear&apos;s long term costings; that no public statement should be made which would prevent the figure being considered further; and thatthe Cabinet were prepared to accept the rest of his proposals.The only programme on which agreement had not been reached wassocial security.    The Secretary of State for Social Services wasasking for the extension in 1976 of family allowances to the firstchild of one-parent families.    Although the initial cost was small - 7j million - it could add  100 million to the cost of family endowment.    It could only be accepted by cutting into the contingency reserve.    In his view it would be better to wait until nextyear and take a decision when the Government could see more clearly whether they would be able to stick to a single uprating of benefits in 1976 without a Christmas bonus in that year.    He thoughtit would be unfair to other Ministers if an item not previouslydiscussed were added at the last minute in this way.On flie minor items listed in Table 3 of C(74) 120, he sought authority to come to an agreement bilaterally with the ministers concerned.    If they were agreed they would count against the contingency reserve.    He drew the attention of Cabinet to the factthat his proposals would Involve an increase of 3p each year from april, 1975, in the charge for school meals.   He asked his colleagues to accept the table attached to C(74) 136 as a basis for the preparationof the Public Expenditure &quot;White Paper; the figures for intervening years could be agreed without difficulty between officials.
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that herproposal to extend family allowances to the first child of one-parent families in 1976 was an attempt to reduce the hardship that would arise from the postponement of the introduction of child allowancesuntil 1977.    She was under great Parliamentary pressure to makea statement about the Government&apos;s intention on the timing of theintroduction of child allowances, and the announcement that this wasnot to be untill977 would produce a profound shock.    The Governmentcould not plead reasons of administrative difficulty - theConservative Administration had planned to introduce their scheme in 1976 - and they would have to admit that the delay was necessary on expenditure grounds.    At the same time the Government wouldbe making clear their intention to allow nationalised industry prices to move to a more realistic level and would be increasing thecharge for school meals.    If the Government, in this situation,were seen to be doing nothing for this most vulnerable section of thecommunity they would be subject to great criticism.    Expenditureon family support was actually planned to fall from  1240 million in1974-75 to  910 million in 1978-79.    This was the result of three factors: no allowance was made in the Survey for upratings of family Allowances after 1975; it was assumed that there would be no increase in child tax allowances in 1976 or 1977, and that thereafterthey would be increased only enough to compensate for half of theincrease in prices; and it had been assumed that when child allowance were introduced in 1977 it would be at a rate of  2. 16 a week.    Shepointed out that in September 1976, eight months before the child allowances were to be introduced, the average family with two children would be   1 a week worse off than they were now - andthere would be food price increases on top of that.    The one-childfamily would get catastropbically poorer.    Her proposed step was a modest one, benefiting half a million children and would help thevery poorest people.    She did not accept the Chancellor&apos;s view thatthe consequence of introducing it would be to add  100 million to the child allowance scheme.    The absorption of the benefit for the firstchild of lone parents into the child allowance scheme would mean anincrease in the rate from  2. 16 to  2. 20 at a cost of only  16 million:this would be enough to ensure that no family was worse off afterintroduction than before.   In any case she thought it wholly unrealistic to assume that child tax allowances would not have to be increasedbetween now and 1977, and if they were, the cost of child allowances would inevitably be higher without necessarily helping the most needy.In discussion the following points were made -a.      The cuts in education expenditure were acceptable,but they were not welcome and there would no doubt be difficulty with those concerned in education matters.
b. The increase in the school meals charge would takeplace in April 1975 to coincide with the introduction of the newsocial security rates.    At 15p it would cover about half of thecost of the meal and would save about  29 million.    Thereshould be another drive to ensure that children who receivedfree meals were not publicly Identified in their schools.c. Parliamentary pressure over one-parent families didnot of itself justify the proposed increase.    Most spendingMinisters were subject to Parliamentary pressures, not leaston housing, on which Labour Members had shown deepconcern in the Debate on The Queen&apos;s Speech.d. Taken in isolation the proposal on family allowanceswas insufficiently argued.    This reinforced the need for a social monitoring system which would measure progress inthe field of social policy - a suggestion which had been stronglyadvocated in a previous paper.In further discussion it was suggested that it might be possible to helpsingle-parent families by other means, such as treating maintenaE.cepayments as earned rather than unearned income for tax purposes.This could be considered in the cosite?s4 of next April&apos;s Budget.    Tothis it was objected that it would not help the people most in need of help - the poorest who did not pay tax - and that it would by then be too late to introduce the change in family allowances which had been proposed.    It was acknowledged that there was a need to relatetogether decisions touching on social policy, such as the increase inthe age allowance announced in the Budget earlier in the month.There would be advantage in setting up an Anti-Poverty Committee toconsider the position and to offer advice on the interrelationship of policies in different fields which touched on the problem of poverty.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that,subject to further discussion of the proposal on family allowances,the Cabinet agreed the proposals put forward in the memorandum bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer.    Defence expenditure would be entered at the higher figure, on the understanding that this was a provisional figure dependent upon further consultation with our alliesand the preparation of the 1975 Long-Term Costings.    The cabinet agreed that the charge for school meals should be increased by 3pfrom April 1975.    They accepted the table attached to theChancellor of the Exchequers memorandum as the basis for thePublic Expenditure White Paper, preparation of which could now proceed.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer should settle with theMinisters directly concerned the minor items referred to inparagraph 4j. of his paper.   An Anti-Poverty Committee would beset up with a general remit to consider the interrelationship of
policies touching on poverty; this Committee should consider urgently, with a view to reporting to Cabinet before Christmas, theproposal to extend family allowances to the first child of one-parent families.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.2,        Agreed the proposals in paragraphs 4 and 5of C(74) 136, save that for defence the figure of 3,800 million in 1978-79 should be provisionallyaccepted instead of  3. 750 million.3, Agreed that the table attached to C(74) 136be accepted as the basis for the Public expenditure white Paper.4.        Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for the establishment of a Committee to review policies related to anti-poverty; and thatit would be asked to produce an early report oh theproposal in C(74) 138.Cabinet QEfice25 November 19749
