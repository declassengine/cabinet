1. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat there was continuing diplomatic activity between the parties concerned with the Cyprus dispute but no early prospect of afurther conference of the kind which had been held in Geneva.    Thebest hope of progress lay in the talks between the acting Presidentof Cyprus, Mr Clerides, and the Vice President, Mr Denktash.These were initially concerned with humanitarian problems andmight provide a means of resolving the problem created by theproposal of Mr Denktash that Turkish Cypriot refugees should be evacuated from the Western Sovereign Base Area with a view tosettlement in the Turkish controlled zone of the island.    The hopewas that these talks would later provide a forum for discussion of constitutional issues.    The position would however be worsened ifthe Turks were to carry out their reported intention of declaring anindependent Turkish Cypriot Republic, and the attitude ofArchbishop Makarios seemed to be hardening against a federalsolution based on two regions.    He recognised the feeling of someof his colleagues that the Turkish action in Cyprus should not gouncondemned by the United Nations.    But, at this stage, aresolution in that sense might well not command general support inthe United Nations and would not contribute towards achieving asolution to the Cyprus problem.    It might also prejudice theprospects of satisfactory arrangements for refugees,The Cabinet -&quot; &apos;l 1 ,:,J   !1. Took note of the statement by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY informed theCabinet that the Ministerial Committee on European CommunityQuestions (EQ) had considered the position on sugar supplies in thelight of the Minister of Agriculture&apos;s negotiations in Guyana and preliminary discussions with the Australian Government.    TheMinister had secured the agreement of the Guyana Government to deliver 85, 000 tons of their 1974 quota under the commonwealth sugar Agreement (CSA) at a price of  140 per ton f. o. b. although this represented a substantial increase over the current CSA price,the deal was the most favourable we could expect to achieve in thecircumstances and EQ considered that we should confirm it immediately with the Guyana Government.    The Committee had alsoconcluded that the Minister should be authorised to conduct negotiations with Australia towards a five year agreement under which she would supply annually 335, 000 tons to our market at a similarprice; in return for such an agreement starting in 1975 australia would send us immediately 200, 000 tons of sugar which would help to make good our 1974 shortfall.1 m
These arrangements would secure the sugar supply situation for thenear future but further interdepartmental consideration should begiven to the long-term implications both for the implementation ofthe assurance to the developing Commonwealth of guaranteedaccess for 1.4 million tons under the Protocol 22 arrangements and for our policy on United Kingdom beet production.    It wouldalso be necessary to consider whether the consequential consumerprice increase should be offset by an increased subsidy.    Therewere potential objections, and this question could not be settledimmediately.i/THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said theCabinet agreed that the Guyana Government should be notifiedimmediately of our acceptance of the arrangements negotiated bythe Minister of Agriculture, and authorised the Minister to pursuediscussions with the Australian Government on the basis described by the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.    The Minister ofAgriculture and the Secretary of State for Prices and consumer protection, together with the other Ministers concerned, should consider the consequential increase in the consumer price inrelation to the Governments policy on food subsidies;  and the outcome, along with proposals for the substance and timing of anannouncement, should be reported to him.The Cabinet -2.        Took note with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of the discussion.e.c. Council THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theof Ministers Ministerial Committee on European Community Questions (EQ) hadAgriculture discussed proposals by the Minister of Agriculture for the lineMeeting on which he should take at the meeting of the Council of Ministers17-19 September      (Agriculture) on 17-19 September when decisions would be taken on&apos;M4 r measures to deal with the serious situation in agriculture throughoutthe Community.    The Commission had proposed a package of measures including a general 4 per cent price increase, an adjustment of monetary mechanisms under the common agricultural Policy (CAP) and proposals on national aids for agriculture.    EQ agreed that we could accept the proposed price increase, though there was some doubt as to whether in the event it would prove adequate to meet the serious difficulties which ourfarmers now faced.    The Committee had also agreed that we mustpursue the wider use of national aids under the CAP to meet the varying needs of farmers in different countries, and that for theUnited Kingdom it was essential to make an early announcement
about measures aimed at a substantial increase in the profitability of milk production.    The Committee had concluded that furtherurgent thought should be given to the possibility of a &quot;winter keep&quot;scheme in view of the high cost of feeding stuff s, and of the longer term problems for beef and milk supplies which would arise if thecurrent rate of slaughter of calves was not checked.As to the proposals for changes in the monetary mechanisms, oneelement - the removal of the &quot;abatement rule&quot; which limited oureligibility to monetary compensatory amounts (MRCA*s) in certain areas - would be advantageous in keeping down feed prices.    Buta change in the &quot;reference rate&quot; for sterling would increase prices and import costs.    The majority of the Committee considered thatthe Minister should be authorised to agree to changes which amounted to a reduction limited to 7,5 percentage points in ourmonetary compensatory amounts.    Some members were anxiousto consider this area further.More generally it had been agreed that the agricultural situationclearly demonstrated yet again the failure of the CAP to meet theneeds of Community agriculture; this was useful ammunition insupport of our renegotiation objectives, and the Minister would bepressing hard for acceptance of the principle of national aids andthat they should be more widely used to supplement common endprices as a means of agricultural support.    CAP reform was amatter on which the Prime Minister might wish to touch when hedined with other Community Heads of Government on 14 September.The Committee had invited the Minister of Agriculture and theSecretary of State for Prices together with the other ministers concerned to consider the timing and terms of any announcement about the implications of the proposed increase in the profitability of milk for consumer prices and for the existing consumer subsidy.In discussion it was argued that the package of measures proposedby the Commission touched on a central area of our european economic Community (e.c.) renegotiation policy.    The changes proposed in the monetary arrangements and the question of nationalaids would be of vital importance to this country.    The difficultiesfaced by farmers in the Community and the evident inadequacies ofthe CAP presented us with an opportunity to insist on new andfundamentally different arrangements.    The Commission^ currentproposals did not include,any specific measures relating to nationalaids, though these were a most important part of our renegotiationproposals.    Whatever the pressures, therefore, we should beprepared to withhold our agreement to a package of measures atthe Council Meeting on 17-19 September unless we could secure ourown objectives, including far-reaching changes in principledesigned specifically to meet the needs of this country,3
On the other hand it was argued that the gravity of the problemsfacing milk and beef producers required an early announcement ofaction by the Government.    The Agricultural Council discussions should be handled in a way that would reconcile the need for urgent decisions on agricultural support with the equally importantneed for standing firm if necessary on the proposed monetary changes and the principle of national aids.It would be necessary to consider whether the full cost of the changes in the milk arrangements should be passed on to theconsumer, or whether the Exchequer should bear some part.    Themost satisfactory arrangement would be an increase of     per pintin the retail price, leaving the remainder of the cost to be borne bythe Exchequer.    This would still leave the retail price of milkbelow the level of when the Government had assumed office.    Itwas also argued that there were signs that the special premia forbeef production recently introduced here and the pig subsidy werebeing creamed off by the meat trade and were not reaching the producer.    Consideration should be given to announcing a fullenquiry into the meat trade and the possibility of control overmargins.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet was agreed on the need for early action to improve support for the farming industry.    The Minister of Agriculture&apos;s proposalfor an increase of 8p per gallon in the profitability of milk production was endorsed by the Cabinet.    The Cabinet also approved the Minister&apos;s proposal to accept a 4 per cent.general increase inCAP prices and to press for specific recognition by the community of the part which national aids should play in farm support underthe CAP.    The Minister of Agriculture would be meeting the irish minister and the Commissioner responsible for agriculture in brussels on 14 September and would be discussing the question of changes in the monetary arrangements.    In doing so he would wishto bear in mind the difficult situation which would arise in NorthernIreland if the Irish Republic were to make unilaterally the full15.3 per cent change in its reference rate and he would explore thepossibility of a compromise agreement based on an effectivereduction of not more than 7.5 percentage points in our MRCA&apos;s.    The-Minister should report back to his colleagues in the light of these discussions in order finally to settle the line to be taken on monetaryarrangements at the Council Meeting.      The Minister ofAgriculture and the Secretary of State for Prices, in consultationwith the other Ministers concerned, would consider the content and timing of any announcement on the implications of the additionalsupport for milk producers for consumer prices and subsidies andwould report to him.4SEC i ST
The Cabinet -3. Took note with approval of the PrimeMinister^ summing up of the discussion,4.        Invited the Minister of agriculture to be guided accordingly in the EECnegotiations he would be conducting.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY informed the Cabinet that the Greek Government intended to raise with the eec the question or? the reactivation of the Association Agreementbetween Greece assd the Community.    In view of the need toencourage the move towards more democratic Government in greece he did not intend to stand in the way of the preparation ofa revised Association Agreement.The Cabinet -5. Took note.5
2 .        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection (C(74) 105),to which was appended a revised draft White Paper on Devolution.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR PRICES AND consumer protection said that following the Cabinetls discussion on September a group of Ministers under her chairmanship had prepared a revised draft of the White Paper on Devolution which,while clearly differentiated in language from the document whichthe Labour Party had recently issued, retained its structure and positive approach.    There were two points to which it was necessaryto draw attention.    First, the Cabinet had concluded at their earliermeeting that the White Paper should not specifically provide for separate executive governments for Scotland and Wales or commit the Government over the scope of the powers and functions to be devolved.   The Ministerial Group had concluded that it was politically inevitable that the White Paper should specifically conveythat the assemblies would be given some (though unspecified)executive powers of the kind now exercised by the Secretaries ofState for Scotland and Wales and by certain nominated statutorybodies.    The Cabinet would wish to consider whether the terms of paragraphs 27 and 28(b) of the draft which had been circulated were acceptable.    Secondly, it had been suggested to the ministerial group that a reference to uniformity of charges as well as of standards of services should be included in paragraph 28(c).    This,however, was not reflected in the revised draft because of the differences which already existed between Scotland and England inrelation, for example, to rents.    Subject to comments on these points she invited the Cabinet to agree the revised draft and toauthorise its immediate publication.hi discussion of the way in which executive powers for the assembliesshould be treated it was argued on the one hand that there would clearly have to be some form of executive in Scotland and wales which would be responsible to the assembly, and that there would therefore be advantage in making this clear in the White Paper.    Itwas, however, also pointed out that no decision had yet been taken as to the form of such executives and that it could be open to anumber of interpretations.    The balance of advantage at this stagetherefore lay in limiting the Government&apos;s future freedom ofmanoeuvre to the least possible extent, and it would therefore be preferable not to include any commitment on executives in theWhite Paper.    In dealing with any subsequent questions which mightbe raised, it should be indicated that this was a matter on which theGovernment was not ready to give its detailed view.6J
On the second point raised by the Secretary of State for Prices and consumer Protection there was general agreement that some reference to payments was necessary but that the point could bemet by referring to contributions instead of charges.In further discussion, it was argued that in any comments aboutdevolution following the publication of the White Paper it would be important not to go beyond the terms of the White Paper by implying that the Government were committed to a substantial devolution ofpowers in the trade and industry field.    The danger had to be borne in mind that the substantial devolution of such powers to Scotlandand Wales, combined with the limitation of the United kingdom governments freedom of action implied by our membership ofthe European Community, might unacceptably erode the Government1ability to develop and operate industrial policies on a UnitedKingdom basis.A number of detailed amendments to the draft were also proposed and agreed.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the revised draft White Paper, subject to the amendments which had been agreed in discussion.    It should bepublished in London, Edinburgh and Cardiff on 17 September andshould appear in his name.    Everything possible must be done toprevent any leakage prior to publication.    It would be for theLord President, in consultation with the Secretaries of State forthe Environment, Scotland and Wales, the Parliamentary Secretary,Civil Service Department and the Press Adviser at Number 10 toensure that the associated publicity arrangements in all threecapitals were fully co-ordinated, particularly in relation to thepreparation of briefing to deal with supplementary questions.    TheWhite Paper, which in some matters of detail was more cautiousthan the document recently issued by the Labour Party, represented a carefully considered statement of policy by the Government, andit was essential that in public speeches or comments on the questionof devolution Ministers should not go beyond its terms.    TheCabinet had in particular decided that there should at this stage beno commitment to set up executive governments in Scotland andWales; and they had similarly not attempted to settle the extent and nature of the powers which would be devolved on the assemblies.These were matters for later consideration, and the outcome mustnot be anticipated.   Similar caution was necessary in relation totrade and industry functions, where difficult decisions would laterbe needed involving the determination of a satisfactory balance between retaining adequate powers for economic management on a united Kingdom basis and recognising the legitimate aspirations&apos;   7
of Scotland and Wales.    The position of Northern Ireland was alsovery sensitive, all the more so because the future constitutional arrangements for the Province still had to be settled.    It wastherefore important that in any discussion of devolution to Scotlandand Wales parallels should not be drawn with Northern Ireland.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2. Approved the draft White Paper annexed to C(74) 105, subject to the amendments agreed in discussion,3.        Invited the Lord President of the Council,in consultation with the other ministers concerned, to arrange for its publication on17 September and for the co-ordination of the associated publicity on the lines indicated inthe Prime Minister&apos;s summing up.
PUBLIC 3.        The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Chancellor ofEXPENDITURE       the Exchequer (C(74) 100 and 101), by the Central Policy review staff (CPRS) (C(74) 102), by the Secretary of State for Education andPrevious Science (C(74) 106) and by the Secretary of State for SocialReference: Services (C(74) 107), on public expenditure from 1974-75 to 1978-79.CC(74) 29thConclusions, \ THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that in July the minute 2 Cabinet had agreed as a guideline that total public expenditure should grow on average over the period to 1978-79 at 2f per cent a year in demand terms.    This limitation was necessary in orderto leave sufficient room for implementation of the Trades UnionCongress (TUC) guidelines on pay, but it also required that thoseguidelines should be observed.    Ministers had now looked at their programmes in the light of this decision and put forward some additional claims;  and bilateral discussions had taken place.   if all the additional claims were accepted, expenditure would rise byabout 3j per cent in demand terms, absorbing more than thepresent contingency reserve.    This would imply reductions in real earnings, and would make it impossible for the TUC to secureobservance of their guidelines.    If his proposals in C(74) 100 were accepted, the annual rate of increase would be just over 3 per cent,and further expenditure reductions would therefore still be required.The most difficult year would probably be 1975-76, when therewould be strong pressure both for an increase in family allowance,and for two upratings of social security benefits.    There wouldalso be a major problem on rate support grant, where for counter-inflationary reasons the Government would want to be fairlygenerous, but could only do so if local authorities were strict inrestraining their spending.    There was also an urgent question tobe settled on dental charges.   At this stage, however, the main question to be settled was one of procedure.    He had agreed to disregard, for the purpose of the present exercise, expenditure onthe acquisition of assets, since this did not have a large demandeffect, although it would involve financial problems which would be relevant to decisions on timing.    He had also agreed a package ofover  100 million of construction projects to deal with the presentunusually low level of demand for this industry&apos;s output: this hadalready been announced and would go some way to meeting thevarious claims for additional expenditure.   As regards theremaining claims, he suggested that on the smaller items, listed in Part I of Table 3, he should seek bilateral settlements with theMinisters concerned.    On the major programmes, it was not necessary to settle all the details now, since a public expenditure white Paper did not need to be published until December; but itwas therefore important that the Government should not commit themselves in an election manifesto to the amounts or timing ofnew proposals before decisions on priorities had been taken.    Inthe case of defence, the review was still continuing, although it wasj0
already clear that there would be some increase in the 1975-76provision over the 1974-75 level.    In the case of education,health and social security, some progress had been made inbilateral discussion, but full agreement had not been reached.His own proposals on these programmes were set out in Part ii of Table 3.    He invited the Cabinet to consider whether these were broadly acceptable or to indicate alternative priorities so that further work could proceed.In discussion, it was noted that when the Cabinet had discussed the matter in July, it had been agreed that there should be studies of possible ways of restricting less-essential private constructionexpenditure; on means of avoiding emergency &quot;winter works&quot;programmes; on greater austerity of standards of building andequipment, including the possibility of low cost housing; and on possible ways of increasing the underlying growth of production.On the first two aspects the Chancellor of the Exchequer had circulated a paper (C(74) 99) which was not on their present agenda.On less-essential construction expenditure, however, it seemedoutrageous that school projects should be deferred when, forexample, speculative office building was still continuing.   At thepresent time, when the constraints on public expenditure programmes were due to financial stringency rather than pressure on the construction industry, a system of building licensing wouldnot necessarily enable the public expenditure programmes to beincreased.    However, assuming that the position of the construction industry would change during the course of the period of theexpenditure survey, it would still be desirable to have some meansof ensuring that the resources of the industry were used on projects of social value rather than speculative building.    The need might also arise for an emergency programme of housing construction,and officials should study the problems which would be involved in organising such a programme.    Further thought would also need to be given to more general questions of resource planning,including manpower planning.    So far as the austerity of standardswas concerned the CPRS had put forward suggestions in C(74) 102,which should be pursued further.    The Secretaries of State for employment and Industry had not yet completed their paper on thepossibility of improvements in productivity, but the experience ofthe 3-day week seemed to indicate that a significant improvementshould be obtainable in the longer term.    This would not however be achieved simply by a Government fiat, and it did not provide away of avoiding difficult decisions in the next year or so.In further discussion, concern was expressed at the suggestion thatthe claims listed in Part I of Table 3 should be remitted forbilateral settlement before priorities had been established amongexpenditure programmes generally.    This might pre-emptj 10
 43 million in 1975-76 which the Cabinet might have preferred to devote to other programmes.    In particular, discussions stillneeded to take place on the provision for overseas aid, and thisshould be seen in the context of its priority against the mainexpenditure programmes, rather than competing for funds with the miscellaneous items listed in Part I.   At the conclusion of thelast Cabinet discussion, it had been assumed that the Cabinet wouldbe given an opportunity to weigh up the priority of all the main programmes on the basis of a comprehensive survey by theChancellor of the Exchequer and papers from all those ministers who wished to put forward additional claims.    In C(74) 100 theChancellor of the Exchequer had given his views on the prioritiesto be attached to some of the additional claims, but although somebilateral discussions had taken place, not all Ministers had yetdiscussed their programmes with Treasury Ministers;  and the review of defence expenditure, which was of critical importance inthe context of priorities, had not yet been completed.    The choice of a procedure for determining priorities had always proveddifficult.    Various alternative techniques had been tried in the past,but in the end it had been found best to discuss the matter in thefull Cabinet.    This would now have to be deferred to a later meeting and could best take place on the basis of a comprehensiveset of proposals from the Chancellor of the Exchequer, with papersas necessary from other Ministers, after a full series of bilateral discussions between Treasury Ministers and the other ministers concerned.    The Secretary of State for Scotland should also beincluded in these discussions when services with a separate scottish programme were being examined.    If the matter washandled in this way, it would however be important for theGovernment not to undertake, in an election manifesto, commitments which would restrict their room for manoeuvre in their subsequent consideration of expenditure priorities.In subsequent discussion, the Cabinet were informed that, in orderto leave more room for proposals of higher priority such as anincrease in family allowances and a March uprating of social security benefits, it was not proposed to give a Christmas bonusto retirement pensioners and the disabled, which would have cost about  80 million.    It was however essential to decide the line tobe taken on this point in public.    It was argued that it would bedifficult to find funds both for a Christmas bonus and for the-monthly upratings to which the Opposition were now committed.A bonus was necessarily tax-free and was not therefore an effective way of helping the. worse off.    There was evidence that the publicwere now recognising that the severity of the economic situationrequired a responsible approach to expenditure commitments.    Onthe other hand, it was undesirable to commit the Government to6-monthly upratings as a matter of continuing policy.   Retirement
pensioners probably attached more importance to a Christmasbonus than to more frequent upratingss and members of theGovernment had already become heavily committed to a Christmasbonus during the last election, although no firm commitment hadbeen given in Parliament.    On balance, it seemed better therefore to concede a Christmas bonus this year.    While this did not rule out a March uprating, the decision on that would need to be takenin the light of the fact that   80 million would have been committed to the Christmas bonus.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet maintained their broad decision on the acceptable rate of growth of public expenditure as a whole and Ministers should bearthis in mind in any election speeches.    The Cabinet would need toreturn to the question of public expenditure as soon as possible after the election when they would wish to take a comprehensivelook at the priorities to be observed within that total.    In themeantime they did not wish resources to be pre-empted bysettlement of the minor claims listed in Part I of Table 3.    TheChancellor of the Exchequer should therefore now hold bilateral discussions with the Ministers responsible for all majorprogrammes, and should then circulate a further paper giving his own views on the priorities of all the major items, includingdefence and overseas aid, so that the Cabinet could discusspriorities across the board.    With regard to the question of aChristmas bonus, the Cabinet agreed that in view of previouscommitments a bonus should again be paid this year.    During the interim period officials should make any possible further progress on the points raised in C(74) 99 and C(74) 102 to which the cabinet would also wish to return in due course.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister.12
4. THE PRIME MINISTER said that member s of the Cabinet had that morning received a letter from a Sunday Times reporter sayingthat he was preparing a corporate profile of the present Cabinefslifestyle for publication, cn 15th September and asking both whether their children attended private fee paying schools and also whetherthey possessed a second home unrelated to their Ministerial,Parliamentary or constituency duties.    It was clearly desirablethat members of the Cabinet should act consistently either in providing this information or in declining to do so.    Thisintrusion into their private lives had to be measured against therisk of inaccurate reporting, but on balance he felt that individual members of the Cabinet should decline to provide the informationsought by the Sunday Times.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the statement by the Prime Minister.5.        The Cabinet were further informed about this matter onthe basis of a note by the Prime Minister (C(74) 85) which was circulated at their meeting and subsequently withdrawn.    Thematter is recorded separately.13
6.        THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES saidthat the Cabinet needed to take an urgent decision on a proposed increase in fees for dental, treatment under the general dentalservices of the National Health Service (NHS).    This was a consequential of the increases in the target average net income of dentists recommended by the Halsbury Review Body which had resulted in a new scale of fees for dentists due to come into operation on 1 October.   The proposed new scale of fees was known to the profession^ representatives, since it had been drawn up by a group of which they were members.    These fees were the only way inwhich NHS dentists were paid.    They collected the appropriatecharge (part of the fee shown in the scale) for a course of treatmentfrom the patient and the Dental Estimates Board then arranged forthe balance to be paid to the dentist.   Any alteration in thissystem or in the proportion of fees charged to the patient would beso unexpected that it would inevitably attract much attention.    Theadditional cost to the patient would arise from the average increaseof about 23 per cent in the fees, which reflected the rising cost of dental practice: the basis of charge - 50 per cent of the fee - wouldnot be changed: nor would the  10 ceiling on charges to patientsbe increased.    There were a number of conflicting considerations.The dentists could clearly net be denied the proper fees for their work; but an increase in charges to patients would be particularlyinopportune at the present time.    The Government had opposed theexisting cost related charge procedure when in Opposition, but itwould be impracticable to change this before the new fee scale was introduced.    Furthermore while the Labour Party was committed to removing all charges under the National Health Service in due course, it would clearly be impossible, in the light of otherpressing needs, to make significant progress in this directionwithin the next few years.   A number of solutions had been examined.    The first was to freeze the charges to patients at theirpresent monetary level: but this would require new regulations and increased expenditure of  6 million a year.   A less costlyproposal would be to make the increases in charges proposed andraise the ceiling on charges to patients to  13.50 but to exemptpatients above pensionable age.   A third course would be to keepthe ceiling at  10 and reduce the proportion of fees charged topatients from 50 to 40 per cent.    Either of these courses wouldrequire new regulations and would cost about  3 million a year.It would not be possible for her to find additional money to meeteither of these solutions within her existing Public expenditure survey Committee allocation,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion in whichthe various alternative courses were examined, said that conflictingconsiderations arose and that it was not possible to reach a long-term decision without further deliberation.   An increase in charges14
would however have undesirable consequences at the present timeand there should therefore be a total freeze on any increase in charges at the present time.    This could be justified as an interimsolution, pending later consideration of the system and levels of dental charges to patients, on the basis that the Labour Party had always opposed the 50 per cent charge to patients which had been introduced by their predecessors, and that they were committed tothe eventual abolition of all charges for NHS treatment wheneconomic circumstances permitted, although this would clearly notbe practicable for some time to come.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister8ssumming up of their discussion.Cabinet Office12 September 197415

Hehad hoped to show it to them at the Cabinet on 1 August but the lengthof their discussion at that meeting had made it impossible.    He wouldlike the Cabinet to read it now.Copies of C(74) 85 were then handed round and read, without comment,by all members of the Cabinet except the Secretary of State for foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, the Secretary of State for the Environment,the Secretary of State for Energy and the Lord Privy Seal who wereabsent for this item.    The copies were then withdrawn.Cabinet Office12 September 1974
