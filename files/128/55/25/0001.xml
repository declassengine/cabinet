PARLIAMENTARY        1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in affairs the House of Commons during the following week.    It was proposed that the House should rise for the Christmasadjournment on Friday 20 December and resume on Monday13 January 1975.Capital It was proposed that the Debate on capital punishment onPuoiahment 11 December should take place on a backbench Motion opposing the reintroduction of capital punishment.    It was thought thatMr Brian Walden MP would be willing to put down such a motion; and the Lord President,&apos; in consultation with the HomeSecretary and the Chief Whip, would consider the exact wording.The Ministers would also consider the arrangements for handling the Debate.    The present intention was that the HomeSecretary should intervene, preferably at or near the end of the debate.    There should probably be only one Ministerialspeaker; but an intervention by the Secretary of State for northern Ireland might be considered if it would secure the intervention in the Debate of a major member of the Oppositionfront bench opposed to the reintroduction of capital punishment.It was important that as many as possible of the government&apos;s supporters should be present and vote; and it was helpful thatit would be necessary to impose a three-line whip for the immediately succeeding item of business (consideration of anyLords amendments to the Social Security Amendment Bill).THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL informed theCabinet that disturbingly slow progress was being made withthe legislative programme.    The programme which the cabinet had agreed for the 1974-75 Session was an extremely heavy one.In relation to some of the most important Bills, there had been much delay in preparing Instructions for the Parliamentarydraftsmen; and unless Departments urgently made a majoreffort to hasten progress, it might become totally impracticable to carry the programme through.    The position was to bediscussed at an early meeting of the Legislation Committee,and he hoped that all the Ministers concerned would be able toattend in person.-The Cabinet -Took note.1LegislativeProgramme
foreign[ffairs; Rhodesia2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat there were signs of movement in the Rhodesian issue.Mr Vorster, the Prime Minister of South. Africa, had evidently-concluded that he must stabilise his relations with the Black african countries and was accordingly putting pressure on Mr Ian Smith,the leader of the illegal regime in Rhodesia, to come to an early settlement.    In November Mr Joshua Nkomo, the chairman of theZimbabwe African People&apos;s Union and the Reverend N Sithole,chairman of the Zimbabwe African National Union, who were heldin detention in Rhodesia, were released into the custody of the zambian Foreign Minister, Mr Mwaanga so that they, togetherwith Bishop Muzorewa, of the African National Council, might take part in talks in Lusaka with President Kaunda of Zambia andother African leaders.    It seemed likely that they had been allowed to pay a further visit to Lusaka for meetings which were now going on, in which President Nyerere of Tanzania, PresidentSi r Seretse Khama of Botswana and Senhor Machel, the Presidentof Frelimo, were also participating.    These discussions might lead to early developments.    We might be moving into a situationwhere a constitutional conference on Rhodesia could take place;though past experience of Mr Ian Smith warned against over -optimism.At the present stage, it was right to leave it to the African leaders to make the running, and to hold any intervention by us in reserve in case they should run into difficulties.    The Government1 spolicies, both in Opposition and since it came into office, had put us in a good position with the Africans:  our stock in Black Africastood higher than it had at any time in the last 10 years.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.JEurope: PrimeMinister&apos;si Meetings withi the chancellor of the Federali Republic ofGermany andI with the FrenchPresidentTHE PRIME MINISTER said that he had held useful discussions inthe last few days with the Chancellor of the Federal Republic ofGermany, Herr Schmidt and with the President of the french republic, M. Giscard d&apos;Estaing.    In their joint Press conferenceat the end of Herr Schmidfs visit to Chequers on 1 December theyhad made clear that differences in national economic policies couldbe compatible with the harmonisation of economic policy as a wholewithin the European Economic Community (e.c.);  and he had beenable to give Herr. Schmidt some support, which he had welcomed,on the issue of reflating demand in the German economy.    In their discussions they had agreed on the need for the e.c. to have greaterpolitical control and responsiveness.    On the renegotiation of theterms of United Kingdom membership of the e.c., he had impressed
strongly on Herr Schmidt that we were not concerned only with thebudget Issue, but attached great importance to each of the sevenrenegotiation aims set out in the February Election Manifesto; hehad now sent Herr Schmidt a personal message which set out theposition.    His visit to Paris for talks with President Giscard hadbeen deliberately handled in a low key, but it was noteworthy thatthe French Government spokesman had been authorised after themeeting of the French Cabinet on the previoxis day to stress the goodclimate in which the talks had taken place.   As to the issues of renegotiation M. Giscard had been at pains to give nothing away and he had defended well-known French views in familiar andsomewhat &quot;theological.&quot; terms.    We should be ready to allow theFrench some degree of &quot;theology&quot; provided that we secured the concrete results we required.    He had told both Herr Schmidt andM. Giscard that the success of renegotiation would have to be judgedagainst what was achieved on all the Manifesto aims.    He had also indicated to them that, while the issue would need to be consideredby the Cabinet at the appropriate stage, the logic of the position which he had consistently taken up meant that for his part he wouldbe prepared, if all the Manifesto commitments were satisfactorilymet, to recommend to the British people that they should supportthe terms obtained.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the french president had raised the idea of establishing a small permanentpolitical Secretariat for the purpose of supporting the Presidency ofthe e.c. Council of Ministers during each 6-month period.    this could also be valuable in promoting - and away from Brussels - the fuller political dimension which the Community required.The Cabinet -Took note.3
3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Energy (C(74) 140) enclosing a draft statement on an interim package of measures to promote energy saving,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that energysaving had been discussed in the Ministerial Committee on economic strategy and also at the meeting at Chequers on 17 November.    TheHouse of Commons had been told that he would make a statement onenergy saving by the end of November, and it was now very urgentto make this statement.    Various- Ministers might havereservations about the details of his proposals, but he hoped thathe would be authorised to announce them in Parliament the following monday; the package of measures in his paper was, he believed,the least that would be acceptable at home and abroad as evidenceof the Governments firm intention to tackle an urgent problem.In considering the package, Ministers should remember that our object was to start a campaign which could be sustained for four or five years, and that the only means of achieving dramaticsavings were drastic measures such as rota cuts, rationing orstrict aUocation which, besides causing a good deal of misery tothe public, would involve massive disruptions of industry.    In hiscovering memorandum he had picked out four points which were in dispute in earlier discussion.    As regards lead content in petrol,he now accepted that we could not go back on the reduction madeon 1 November, but he believed that there should be no further reductions pending a further review of the medical and economic implications.    On speed limits, though he had previously favoured a general maximum of 55 mph rigidly enforced at 60 mph, he nowproposed what was agreeable to the Secretary of State for the environment, namely no change in the limit on motorways, amaximum limit of 60 mph on dual carriageways, and a maximumlimit of 50 mph on single carriageways; this proposal took accountof the enforcement aspect, and also of the fact that 90 per cent oftraffic used single carriageways, so that there would be a significantpsychological effect.   As regards maximum heating standards inbuildings (except living accommodation), he proposed compulsoryrather than voluntary limits, making use of powers contained in the fuel and Electricity (Control) Act; there were obvious difficultiesof enforcement here but the same applied to many other possible measures and it was important to show a firm resolve.    He also proposed to use statutory powers to prohibit floodlighting of buildings, statues, bridges and so on at all times (though he wouldnot be restricting the use of floodlighting for sporting events), andto restrict electricity for external advertising and external displaylighting during dayKght hours; here again the amount of energysaved might be comparatively small but the psychological effect would be important.
As regards the rest of the package ox measures, there was clearly a need to help firms, which at present had cash flow problems, byloans to finance energy saving in.vestment.    On the oil price increase, it was important to load as much as possible on to petrol,increasing the price of petrol by 8p to lOp a gallon, so as toreduce consumption and cut down on imports.    The PropertyServices Agency (PSA) had done good work on energy saving butthere was much more to be done, especially in the local authorityfield.    In connection with his proposals for a massive government publicity campaign on the more careful and efficient use of energy,he attached particular importance to cc -ordinating the publicityprogrammes of the nationalised fuel industries.    As regards thepossibility of introducing a two-tier price system for petrol, witha basic ration available at one price and additional supplies at much higher prices, he sought the CabinetEs views on whether this shouldbe included in the statement.    Petrol rationing by coupon would becostly in. terms of staff and administrative effort, needing something like 2, 500 more civil servants, and would encourage the growth of ablack market; two-tier pricing would be a better option, but it toowould need extra staff to administer, and was likely to provoke amass of claims for consideration of special cases.    However, hewould be happy to look at this possibility with the other ministers concerned, and to put forward proposals in due course.Finally, he felt it essential not to weaken in setting realistic prices for energy.    All energy was now grossly underpriced, and financialdiscipline had been lost.    It made no sense at all to increasedemand for energy by subsidising prices, thereby increasing public expenditure and distorting the nationalised industries investment programmes; this was the area where Government policy could have a really significant effect, not least in encouraging the proper use of each fuel for the right purpose.In discussion, it was argued that the package of measures proposedby the Secretary of State fell far short of the needs of the situation.Against a background of the massive oil deficit and the efforts beingmade by other Governments to cut down on fuel imports and encourage the economical use of energy, the package would appearto consist of a number of more or less trivial items, and give theimpression that the Government did not attach enough weight to theproblem.    The amount of energy being saved in Britain was actuallygoing down in percentage terms, and we compared badly with othercountries in Western Europe.    From this point of view, it was essential to ensure the biggest possible psychological impact, so asto bring forcefully to the attention of the public the urgency of savingenergy: two-tier pricing and a lower speed limit on the motorwaysshould form parts of any serious package.    If it was not yet possibleto bring forward such measures, then the Secretary of State should at least announce a firm intention to introduce them soon.^  confidential
On the other hand, it was pointed out that the statement was intended as one more instalment of energy saving measures andanother package could be announced in the New Year,    It would be wrong to state a firm intention to bring forward new measuresbefore these had been properly considered and their implicationsfully assessed.    For example, it was arguable that the best wayto tackle the problem of petrol prices was to abolish or reduce the vehicle excise tax, and raise petrol prices to recover the same amount of revenue.    There was also a risk that if the Governmentdeclared an intention to introduce some sort of rationing, whetherby coupon or by pricing, there would once again be a rush to thegarages by drivers eager to top up their tanks with petrol.,    It wasunhelpful to favour saving energy as a general proposition, but to object to each particular proposal to achieve it.    It was essentialto make a very early statement on the next package of measures,because energy would be discussed at the meeting the following week of Heads of Government of the European Economic Community (e.c.),From this point of view, the package proposed by the Secretary ofState was broadly on the right lines, and included a number of well-thought-out and effective measures which would have considerable psychological impact.In further discussion the following main point? were made -a. While it was essential to price energy properly,and in particular to discourage the wasteful use of petrol,it was important to remember that there were many people,for example those living in country areas, the disabled,and those working shifts at times when there was no public transport available, who were bound to use their own cars,and an excessive burden should not be placed on them.b. It would be beneficial if the pricing system could bearranged to encourage the production of cars of smallerhorsepower, and also to encourage the use of public transport, perhaps by attaching some season ticket value to the vehicle excise licence.    On the other hand, the motor industry was already in great difficulties, and the sideeffects of any pricing policy would have to be consideredcarefully.c. As regards speed limits, it was important not toreduce the 70 mph limit on motorways, so as to avoid thedanger that cars would not be able to overtake heavylorries;  as regards the proposed maximum limits of60 mph on dual carriageways and 50 mph on singlecarriageways, rigid enforcement would be difficult,especially of the latter limit, but they could be acceptedby the poHce,- -6   .
d. The statement could be made more positive by including examples of what had already been achieved, andwas intended, in the Government service; for example, inthe field covered by the Ministry of Defence it had beenestablished that 10 per cent of oil fuel, and 6 per cent ofother sources of energy, would be saved in 1975-76 compared to 1974-75, by means of careful economy.e. Of the  5 million a year which it was proposed thePSA should spend over the next few years on improvedcontrol equipment and other energy saving measures, theMinistry of Defence might have to find a substantial proportion of the cost; the Secretary of State for Defencereserved his position on finding this contribution.f. Since it was intended that the energy savingcampaign should last for a number of years, it was questionable whether it would be appropriate to make useof powers under the Fuel and Electricity (Control) Act,which had to be renewed from year to year; it would be preferable if the Act could be replaced by powers taken under a permanent Bill.    Moreover, powers under the Actseemed inadequate to enforce the proposed rules: forexample, they did not include powers of entry.    there seemed to be no intention to monitor the proposed heatingstandards, and it was doubtful who would be the responsibleperson for administering them.    On the other hand, while itwas wrong in principle to legislate for what could not been forced, there was no harm in setting standards to whichthe community in general, might reasonably be expected to conform.g. The statement included a proposal that companyannual reports should state the expenditure incurred on fuel and the steps taken to save energy: this should be extendedto the reports of nationalised industries and public authorities.h. The opening part of the statement should be strengthened by including a passage on the internationalsetting: many countries now had energy saving programmes,and we would be playing our full part.    The measures takenin 1973 had had an impact on Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, sothat we might expect that the measures now to be announcedwould have some useful effect on Government opinion in the oil producing countries.7
j. As regards the proposed ban on floodlighting of buildings, statues and bridges, this would cause a good dealof public gloom in exchange for a small saving in energy,and should not be proceeded with, at least in the middle ofthe winter j it was also important not to restrict the use offloodlighting in public places for reasons of security,,    Asregards external advertising and external display during daylight hours, it was important to remember that inScotland the New Year was a holiday period, and theproposed restrictions should not come into effect until the&quot;    holiday was over. 1&apos;.lTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that a statement on energy saving should be madethe following Monday and that the draft proposed by the Secretaryof State should form its basis.    The first part should be redraftedto place the need for economy in its international setting and a passage should be included to illustrate the savings in fuel whichcould be achieved in Government establishments by positiveeconomy measures.    The statement should emphasise that thiswas an interim package of measures which would be followed by others: it should not however specifically refer to the possibilityof tax changes, two-tier pricing or petrol rationing lest this leadto panic buying.    It should also make it clear that while theGovernment were giving a lead and would run a major energysaving campaign, success would depend primarily on the efforts of individual businesses and households.    The publicity campaignitself should be put in the charge, of someone with the necessary flair:it should be aimed at import saving and wasteful use of energy andshould avoid giving any impression that the Government anticipatedindustrial action by the mineworkers.    Of the items which had beenthe subject of argument, the Cabinet agreed with the proposals onthe lead content in petrol, on speed limits, and on imposingmaximum heating standards on buildings other than living accommodation.    On balance they were opposed to announcing atthis time a ban on floodlighting of buildings, statues, bridges andso on, though this could be looked at again for possible inclusion inthe next package of measures; as regards external advertising and external display lighting during daylight hours, these should not be restricted until after the Christmas and New Year holiday period.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.2.        Invited the Secretary of State for Energyto revise the draft statement on the lines indicatedin the summing up, and to make the statement thefollowing Monday.8
3. Invited the Minister for Transport to makea short supplementary statement on the reductions in speed limits.4.        Invited the Secretary of State for Energy,in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the other Ministers concerned, to continue withurgent consideration of further possible energysaving measures and to bring forward proposalsfor a further package in due course.&apos; &apos; - &apos; &apos;       -/-/ -&apos;      - &apos;9
4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Employment (C(74) 142) on the anxieties expressed bynewspaper editors about the provisions of the Trade Union andLabour Relations (Amendment) Bill.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that inhis discussions with newspaper editors they had pressed for theBill to be amended to put editorial staff in the same position asreligious objectors.    The reasons that they gave were, however,unconvincing and he believed that the general problem of potentialconflict between professional ethics and union loyally would not be helped by intruding the law.    The right course was to reachsensible agreements in discussion between the parties.    TheNational Union of Journalists (NUJ) shared this view and had justwritten to the employers and editors to propose a meeting.    Hethought that the meeting would take place.   Although the closed shop and other union practices with a bearing on editorialindependence came within the terms of reference of the RoyalCommission on the Press he thought that it would be unwise to ask the Commission to produce an interim report on editorialindependence;  and the Chairman of the Commission had in facttold the Guild of British Newspaper Editors that the Commissiondid not wish to pronounce separately on these issues at this early stage of their deliberations.    He invited the Cabinet to agreetherefore that the Government should not introduce any amendments to the Bill directed to the position of editors; that he should take this line in the further meeting with the editors to which he was committed;  and that the Royal Commission should not be askedfor another interim report.\THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that he accepted that it would be wrong to ask the Royal Commission to produce aquick report in time to influence the Parliamentary considerationof the Bill.    The question of editorial freedom was a broader one that should not be considered only in relation to the trade unions.But he would not oppose a request to the Royal Commission toproduce an interim report that would treat the issue in a generalway.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, saidthat the Cabinet agreed with the proposals of the Secretary of Statefor Employment.    In the Debate on the Bill the Government line should be that this question was being discussed between the parties concerned and it was to be hoped that they would find a solution.If the outcome of the discussion was that both sides wished thematter to be referred to the Royal Commission for an interimreport, there would be no objection to doing so.    After the meetingthe situation should be reviewed by the appropriate CabinetCommittee before it came back to the Cabinet.10CONFIDENTIAL
The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the summing up oftheir discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the Secretary of State for Employment to proceed accordingly.THE HS 146 5. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that heAIRCRAFT would like to report to the Cabinet the agreed conclusions of the project Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy (EC) about the HS 146aircraft project, which had been conceived by Hawker SiddeleyAviation (HSA) and jointly funded up to now by HSA and theGovernment: HSA were no longer willing to invest money in the planned programme.    The HS 146 was a &quot;feeder line&quot; aircraft,intended as a replacement for aircraft such as the Viscount; theBritish content of the aircraft would be about 70 per cent by value,compared for example with 50 per cent British content in theFokker 28, one of its main competitors.    The short-term salesprospects were poor, because the economic recession and increased fuel costs had stopped the growth of civil air traffic and caused the airlines to put off buying new aircraft, and there wasno means of saying when the market would revive again.    The best estimate officials could make at present was that,more than 500aircraft would need to be sold to recover our investment, let alonemake any sort of profit, but sales by the first half of the 1990&apos;were unlikely to reach this level.    To suspend the programmeinvolved no major current employment problems, because out ofthe 2, 750 people currently working on the project in Britain, only about 200 might actually be made redundant if the project werestopped, but these could probably be found other suitable work inHawker Siddeley Dynamics (had).    If the project were successfulabout 10, 000 people might be employed on it by the 1980&apos;s in britain, most of them skilled men.    The present situation wasthat the workforce at HSA supported full continuance of the project,whereas the board of HSA believed that it was not now commerciallyviable; however, they were keeping the design drawings, jigs andtools, they intended to maintain a civil design capability on other projects, and they proposed to review the HS 146 in a couple ofyears&apos; time, when a reassessment of the market might show thatit was worth going ahead.When the project was discussed by the Ministerial Committee, avery substantial majority had rejected the option of continuing the planned programme at full steam ahead with 100 per cent Governmentfunding; this would have involved public expenditure of 120 million over the next three years,   70 million more than was11
provided for in the Public Expenditure Survey,    The Committeehad also been opposed to spending money on production of twoprototypes at Government expense.    The Committee had come tothe conclusion that on balance the right thing to do was to keep the project in cold storage for two or three years, at a cost of 2 or  3 million, so that the board of the nationalised aircraft industry would have the opportunity of reviewing the project in thelight of its own general policy, and making recommendations tothe Government in due course.    In presenting this decision in public,we would make it clear that it was HSA&apos;s action in stopping workand cancelling sub-contracts which had created difficulties in thefirst place, so as to maintain our strong contractual position incase of any litigation to recover money from HSA.    On the otherhand we must plainly accept the offer which the HSA board had now made of tripartite talks with them and the trades unions.    TheLaw Officers had given advice on how to do this without prejudice to our legal rights.    He therefore proposed, on behalf of the ministerial Committee, that the Secretary of State for Industry beauthorised by the Cabinet to make a statement the following Mondayand to enter discussions with both fides of HSA, making it clearthat the Government were not prepared to take over the original programme on the basis of 100 per cent public funding, but that ministers were ready to consider keeping the project in cold storage against the possibility that the market would improve again.The view had also been expressed in the Ministerial Committee thatit would be desirable to give the House as much information aspossible about the reasons for the Government&apos;s decision, and thatthere might be advantage in giving to a Select Committee of theHouse the task of examining the programme of the aircraft industry,including civil and military projects.    The Lord President of theCouncil would wish to consider this proposition carefully, in view of the obvious risk that an examination by a Select Committee might simply turninto lobbying on behalf of particular projects; but it would be helpful if the Secretary of State for Industry could include in his statement a passage to the effect that the Government jrecognisedthe need to give Parliament fuller opportunities to examine this kindof question.In discussion, there was general agreement that the conclusion reached by the Ministerial Committee on the HS 146 project shouldbe endorsed.    As regards the ways in which Parliament might begiven more opportunity to consider such projects, there were already Select Committees in being which could investigate aircraft projects if they wished to do so; the possible risks in setting up a select Committee specifically to look at aircraft projects probablyoutweighed the advantages, but the Lord President of the Council andthe other Ministers most concerned would need to consider the options12
carefully.    It would be an innovation to establish a SelectCommittee charged with looking at future policy of a nationalised industry; and whatever happened, it would be important to seethat the membership of any Committee which examined aircraft projects included members concerned with due control of public expenditure,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the conclusion of the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Policy, that the Government should not take over theoriginal HS 146 programme on the basis of 100 per cent publicfunding, nor finance the construction of two prototypes, but shouldbe ready to consider ways and means of keeping the project in cold storage, against the possibility that the market might improve again.The Secretary of State for Industry should make a statement thefollowing Monday to this effect, and enter tripartite talks with bothsides of HSA; in these talks it would be important to avoid prejudicing the Governments position in the case of any litigationto recover money from HSA, and so the talks should not touch oncontractual matters, at least in the first stages0    The statement could refer to the Governments readiness to provide the House ofCommons with fuller opportunities for discussion of this type ofproject but reference should not be made specifically to a SelectCommittee.    This proposal should be further considered by theLord President of the Council in consultation with the Ministers mostconcerned.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.\2. Invited the Secretary of State for Industry,in consultation with the Lord President of the Council, tomake a statement in Parliament the following Mondayabout the HS 146 project on the lines indicated inthe summing up.3, Invited the Lord President of the Council, inconsultation with the Ministers most concerned, to consider thearguments for and against inviting an existingSelect Committee, or establishing a new one, toexamine the programme of the aircraft industry iincluding civil and military aircraft projects.13
6. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Prime minister on Ministerial salaries (C(74) 134) and on the report of the top salaries Review Body (C(74) 141).    Their discussion and theconclusions reached are recorded separately.7. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said thathe wished to draw the attention of the Cabinet to the serious situation in Scottish schools, where the teachers were continuing their disruptive action in spite of the promise of an interim award of  100 to be paid on the publication of the Houghton Report.    Hewould be meeting the Scottish Labour Members of Parliament thefollowing day to discuss the situation.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet office December 197414

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy no cabinet confidential annex cc(74) 50th Conclusions, Minute 6Thursday 5 December 1974 at 10. 30 amTOP SALARIES      The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Prime Minister on ministerial salaries (C(74) 134) and on the report of the top salaries Review Body (TSRB) (C(74) 141).THE PRIME MINISTER said that it had been suggested that in orderto strengthen the social contract consideration should be given to apossible cut in Ministerial salaries as a way of giving a lead toother recipients of high salaries.    In the past he had regardedcuts in Ministerial salaries as a meaningless gesture but inpresent circumstances he was inclined to see merit in them.    TheGovernment was committed to refer the remuneration of Membersof Parliament to the TSRB for a review in January 1975.    Thenormal course would be to ask the Review Body to considerMinisterial salaries at the same time.    They needed now to decide between three courses -i. To forgo a certain proportion of their salaries for a specified period and to refrain from referring ministerial salaries to the Review Body,ii. Not to reduce Ministerial salaries but not to referthem to the Review Body.iii.       Not to reduce Ministerial salaries, and to includethem in the reference to the Review Body, retaining their freedom not to act, or to postpone action, on itsre commendations.The report of the TSRB on top salaries in the public servicesneeded to be considered carefully.    The Government could accept and implement it in full or by stages or could reject it and substitute smaller increases or no increases, or it could be used as a basis for inviting all high income earners in the private sector1
as well as the public sector to forgo part of their incomes for aperiod.    The report showed that top people in the public sectorwere underpaid by comparison with their counterparts in industry,and it drew attention to the real problems of compression ofdifferentials that had arisen in the public service and to thepermanent effects on pensions which would result from anyshortfall of salaries in the public sector.    His own personal and preliminary opinion was that the TSRB recommendations on civil Service pay should be accepted but that their implementationabove a certain level should be staged.    The staging might becarried out by asking those concerned to forgo voluntarily a partof their increase, while still preserving their full pension rights.The proposed increases for nationalised industry chairmen were,on the other hand, so large as to be provocative to the trades union in those industries, and he suggested that the increases should be reduced, besides staging their implementation in thesame way as for civil servants.    Ministers could use cuts in theirown salaries and the staging of the TSRB recommendations as abasis for an appeal for restraint at the higher income levels in theprivate sector.In discussion it was argued that the average level of the increases recommended by the TSRB was 31 per cent, which was higher eventhan the level of the settlements so far reached outside the TradesUnion Congress (TUC) guidelines.    If the Cabinet agreed to this and also to the increase in National Health Service consultants&apos; pay,proposed by the Secretary of State for Social Services in C(74) 143,both increases would become known during the crucial negotiations on the pay of miners and electricity supply workers.    Even the modified proposals put forward by the Prime Minister couldprejudice those negotiations.    It would be better to reject theTSRB report and to ask officials to work out an alternative system by which, for instance, the full increases might be given up to thelevel of  10, 000 and a ceiling should be set at a higher levelbeyond which no increase at all would be given.    Only by measuresof this kind, together with a cut in Ministerial salaries, would itbe possible to shame those who earned high salaries in the private sector into accepting their share of the necessary cuts in living standards.On the other hand it was argued that if the TSRB proposals were taken together with the interim pay increases and spread over theperiod since the last substantive increase they could be shown tbbe within the TUC guidelines.    It was furthermore argued strongly that the Government must fulfil its side of the bargain under which public servants surrendered some of their fundamental socialrights in return for a system of pay determination by objectivecriteria.    To attempt to apply a pay policy in the public sector2SECRET
only would denude the public sector of talent, with results that must be unacceptable to a Socialist Government.    Some public servants like the doctors were beginning to push for a return tocollective bargaining.    Many were becoming increasinglypreoccupied with their pay.    If the Government did not fulfil itsside of the bargain, the drift of promising public servants into theprivate sector would increase; morale would suffer;  and officials who now worked long hours without payment for overtime might even consider some form of industrial action.    The idea ofvoluntarily forgoing remuneration was attractive at first sight but was open to objections:  it would seem to pre-empt the report ofthe Royal Commission on Income Distribution and Wealth;  anembarrassingly large proportion of civil servants might decline on principle to make the necessary sacrifice;  it would be impossibleunder the present legislation to disregard this renunciation for thepurpose of pension rights unless it were also disregarded for tax purposes, which would open up loopholes for evasion.    Theproposed increases for nationalised industry chairmen were harderto justify because the effect would be to increase their real earning!by comparison with 1969; but it must not be forgotten that theGovernment would need to recruit chairmen for new bodies such asthe National Enterprise Board and the British National OilCorporation.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet had hot been able to resolve these important issues in the time available^    He would see that they were placed high on the agenda for the next meeting.The Cabinet -Agreed to resume discussion of this itemat their next meeting.Cabinet Officei6 December 1974
