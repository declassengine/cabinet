1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theLord President of the Council (C(74) 111) about the legislative programme for 1974-75.THE LORD PRESIDENT said that the programme of Bills proposed for the first Session of the new Parliament totalled 107, which was far too many0   The Queen5s Speech and Future legislation committee had, therefore, classified the Bills into categories of importance: Essential Bills were those needed becauseotherwise powers or finance would lapse;  Contingent Bills were those which might become necessary and, if they did, would be essential; Main Programme Bills were the Government&apos;s majoritems of legislation.    The latter had been grouped into Bills of top Priority, for completion in the Session, Priority for completionif and when time became available, and No-Priority.    parliament would be heavily engaged with Finance Bills for a large part of the session and taking this into account it was clear that even the top Priority category of Bills was overloaded.    These difficulties would, of course, be compounded if the Bills were delayed in production so that the later part of the Session was congested.    Hewould, therefore, welcome proposals from the Cabinet forshortening the programme.In discussion it was argued that the major Bills proposed for the top Priority programme were essential to the Governmentsfulfilment of its Manifesto commitments and that there waseverything to be said for bringing them forward sooner rather thanlater: this was especially so if they did not materially affectpublic expenditure.    Moreover, it was good strategy to bring forward in the first Session as many as possible of the Bills whichwere politically controversial, applying a guillotine to Commonsdebates if necessary, even though this might result in longerdebates in the Lords.    If in the event some Bills had not progressedbeyond Second Reading by the end of the first Session, this wouldnot be disastrous.In further discussion the following points were made -a. Seat Belts, which was short and now ready, shouldbe brought forward as a Top Priority Bill.b. Channel Tunnel might not need to be dealt with as anEssential Bill, depending upon the outcome of a policy review of the Channel Tunnel scheme which would shortly be put before the Cabinet.1
c        The Government was committed to legislation on public Lending Right before the end of the year and this bill, which was virtually ready, should, therefore, bebrought forward as soon as possible as a Top Priority Bill,d. A small Weights and Measures Bill would be neededurgently to legalise the sale of sugar in metric packs,e. In view of further instances of child cruelty, theChildren Bill was vitally important:  since it would benon-controversial, and should not, therefore, impedeother Bills, it could be brought in very quickly.f. It was for consideration whether Industry 2 shouldbe deferred; but, as against this, it was argued that thedelay would serve only to prolong uncertainty in theindustries concerned and that it was better to introducecontroversial measures of this kind as soon as possible.g. The place of Child Allowances could not be settleduntil the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary ofState for Social Services had reached conclusions as to thedate for implementation of the new scheme: if this werenot until April 1977, there was a case for deferring the Billto the next Session.h. Mobility Allowance would need to have receivedRoyal Assent by the Summer Recess if the scheme were togo forward as approved; consideration should, however,be given to including these provisions in one of the other social Security Bills,i. Foreign Compensation could, if it would help, be dropped,j. Trustee Savings Bank was more important than itscategorisation as a Second Reading Committee Bill suggested,and should desirably be passed by next year,k.        Work was proceeding on the implementation of theBriggs Report on Nursing, in the Nurses, Health Visitorsand Midwives Bill, and it would be helpful if this Bill couldbe got ready in case opportunity arose for implementingit this Session,    It was pointed out, however, that it wouldbe wrong to pre-empt the time of Parliamentary Counsel onsuch a speculative basis.2
1, Construction Industry Contracts was being discussedurgently between the Ministers concerned and the TradesUnion Congress, and policy issues would be brought to the ministerial Committee on Economic Policy,. Sub-Committee on pay Negotiations next week.    Once these were settled it was desirable that this Bill, which would be controversial, should bebrought forward as soon as possible.m.        The volume of Northern Ireland legislation, whetherby Bill or by Order-in-Council under the Northern ireland act 1974, posed a particular problem and it might benecessary to set up a Northern Ireland Committee to dealwith it.    The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland wouldwrite to the Lord President of the Council about this.n. The possibility might be considered of combiningin a Miscellaneous Powers Bill some of the proposed legislation which, though important, was on a small scale;but a solution on these lines could not be adopted in advanceof the report of the Renton Committee on legislation.o. Consideration should be given to the combination ofthe Scottish and Welsh Development Agency Bills.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said theGovernment should approach its legislative programme as a new government with a fresh mandate, and should adopt the strategy,which had been successful in the past, of bringing forward in its first Session the legislation which would be most likely to generateParty political controversy.    The programme put forward by theLord President was consistent with this approach, and the cabinet agreed that it should be adopted.    They accepted, however, that because of the number of Bills proposed, and of the manyuncertainties about their preparation and progress through parliament, there would have to be some flexibility in thearrangements for bringing Bills forward.    The Lord president and the Chief Whip should, in their day-to-day management of theprogramme, take account of the points made in discussion aboutthe relative importance of particular Bills.    departmental ministers had a particular responsibility to ensure that policyproposals, on which the preparation of Bills depended, were brought forward for collective consideration by Ministers in good time and that every effort was made to have the Bills ready for introduction at the appropriate time.    The Lord President would need to take stock of progress by Christmas, and should circulate a progress report on the basis of which the Cabinet could review theprogramme again in January,    It might be necessary to discardsome Bills at that stage if progress was unsatisfactory.
The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing up oftheir discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the Lord President of the Council to proceed accordingly.2, The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president of the Council (C(74) 112 (Revise)), to which was appendeda draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament whichhad been prepared by The Queen!s Speech and Future legislation committee.The Cabinet examined the draft paragraph by paragraph.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were in general agreement with the draft Speech, subjectto amendments on lines which had been agreed in discussion.    the paragraph on Northern Ireland should be reviewed and theSecretary of State for Northern Ireland had undertaken to provide an alternative form of words.    Further consideration should alsobe given to the passage referring to legislation for the establishmentof Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies, and the Lord president should discuss this with the Secretaries of State for Scotland andfor Wales.    In the light of the decisions then reached and of the cabinet&apos;s discussion, he should circulate a revised draft of the speech for final approval by the Cabinet at their meeting on24 October.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office22 October 1974
