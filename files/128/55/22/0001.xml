[HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTjefenceIEVIEWreviouseference:lc(74) 42ndfonclusions,&quot;ilinute 1ilateraldiscussionssith themericansnd GermansCOPY NO0CABINETCONFIDENTIAL annex cc(74) 47th ConclusionsWednesday 20 November 1974 &quot;at 10.00 am the PRIME MINISTER recalled that the Cabinet had agreed thatconfidential bilateral exchanges should take place with the americans and Germans on the basis of the proposals set out in his memorandum(C(74) 116)*    These consultations had now taken place and the cabinet would wish to have an account of them.    They would also wish todiscuss the economic and employment impHcations of the defence review proposals in the light of the memorandum by the Central policy review Staff (C(74) 132) and to discuss the policy on the strategic nuclear deterrent.THE PRIME MINISTER said that a small team led by the Secretary ofthe Cabinet had visited Washington on 12 November and Bonn on13 November.    In Washington they had had discussions with theUnited States Secretary of State (Dr Kissinger) and the Secretary ofDefense (Dr Schlesinger) and with senior representatives of the WhiteHouse, State Department and Department of Defense.    Thediscussions were very friendly and the Americans had shown under-standing of our problems.    But they were concerned about the inter-national situation and many of our proposals were clearly mostunwelcome to them.    As regards our contribution to the north atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), the Americans were worriedlest our reductions might encourage other NATO countries to makeunilateral defence cuts which would in turn increase Congressionalpressure for reductions in United States forces in Europe.   Theydid not contest our view that the reductions we proposed probablystopped just short of starting such a process but they stressed thatany further reductions on our part would cause them very serious concern.    They were also concerned that our proposals would effectively mean the end of our ability to intervene militarily outsidethe NATO area.    Dr Kissinger was worried about the position in theMediterranean and was emphatic that we should retain the SovereignBase Areas (SBAs) in Cyprus.    He did not believe that the total
withdrawal of our forces would help to secure a satisfactory-political settlement in the island and considered that it would be interpreted by the Russians as an indication that the Western powers were increasingly leaving the Eastern Mediterranean to them.    Hewould be less concerned at the prospect of a reduction in the size ofour forces in Cyprus, provided we maintained our presence there.Both Dr Kissinger and Dr Schlesinger viewed the situation in the indian ocean with concern.    They were emphatic that our agreement to their proposals for an extension of the existing facilities in Diego Garciawas essential to them, particularly in the light of our proposals forwithdrawing our forces from the area.    In Bonn, discussions had beenheld with Herr Leber, the Federal German Minister of Defence, and senior representatives of the Federal Chancellory and Ministry ofDefence.    These discussions were primarily concerned with our proposals for the NATO area where the Germans were glad that we proposed to maintain our land and air forces in the Central Region.They also attached great importance to our intention to continue withthe programme for the Multi-Role Combat Aircraft.    They regretted the proposed reduction of our presence in the Mediterranean and showed some concern about the possible effect on the Danes of ourreduced capability on the Northern Flank.    Since the visit to washington he had received a personal message from President Ford.It was apparent that further reflection had increased Americanconcern, but it was his judgment that the Americans would not makeserious difficulties for us in the formal consultations in NATOprovided that we could meet their wishes over Diego Garcia and cyprus.    He was clear, however, that the reductions we proposedrepresented the limit of what the Americans would regard as tolerable.In discussion it was suggested that agreement to the american proposals for Diego Garcia would be badly received by the indian government who had, in the past, advocated an Indian Ocean PeaceZone, and by other of our friends in the area.    On the other hand, inthe light of the extensive withdrawals which we proposed to makeourselves and the continuing presence of the Soviet Navy in the area,we should be fully justified in agreeing to the modest extension of facilities at Diego Garcia which the Americans wished to carry out attheir own expense, and which we would also be able to use.    The useof the facilities by the Americans other than for routine purposeswould be a matter for joint decision by the two Governments,    the americans had, moreover, agreed to pursue consultations with us with the aim of developing realistic progress towards armslimitation in the Indian Ocean.   But it was unrealistic to expect to achieve early international agreement on measures for armslimitation and in the meanwhile it would be right to accede to theAmerican request to which they attached great importance.
In discussion of the memorandum by the Central Policy Review Staff(C(74) 132), it was noted that the employment implications of theproposed reductions in the defence industries should, in general, bemanageable, though there would be problems for particular firms and particular areas.    Arms exports might take up some of the capacityreleased by the reduced requirements of our own Services,   It was important that there should be consultations with both sides of industryabout the employment implications of the Defence Review in parallel with the international consultations with our allies; this point shouldbe brought out in the proposed Parliamentary statement.    Potentiallythe most serious employment problem would be at Yarrows onClyde side if there were a major reduction in the frigate programme.Decisions could not yet be taken on this, question but it was important that the situation should be clarified as soon as possible.THE PRIME MINISTER said that if we were to retain the strategic nuclear force it must be a credible deterrent.    The improvementsnecessary to ensure the continuing credibility of the present force were relatively cheap; they would not involve either a new generation of missiles or the introduction of Multiple Independently TargetedRe-entry Vehicles.    The essential question was whether to retain the Polaris force or to reverse the policy followed in the past andabandon it.   The Defence and Oversea policy Committee had unanimously concluded that it should be retained.   For our EuropeanNATO allies it represented an insurance against a breakdown in the credibility of the United States Strategic Nuclear Guarantee.   If weabandoned our deterrent France would be the only country in Europewith a strategic nuclear capability and this was not committed to NATO.    Such a situation would be particularly disquieting to othermembers of NATO and especially to the Germans.   In normal times,our possession of the nuclear deterrent gave us a unique entree to united States thinking and the possibility of influencing this not only on nuclear matters, including strategic arms limitation, but over a very wide politico/ strategic field.   In times of tension, it provided us witha unique opportunity to influence events both in Washington and moscow and counsel moderation.   For this country it provided, in the worstcase, the best protection against the risk of nuclear attack or nuclearblackmail.    From his own knowledge of the Soviet leadership he was satisfied that there was no question that our relations with the soviet union would be improved if we were not a strategic nuclear power;on the contrary, he believed that the Soviet Union valued the.contribution which our possession of the nuclear deterrent enabled usto make to discussion in the arms limitation field.   During therecent bilateral discussions with the Americans Dr Kissinger and dr Sc hie singer had reaffirmed the importance they attached to our strategic nuclear contribution.    Dr Kissinger had emphasised that theexistence of our Polaris force did not in any way hamper him in the strategic Arms Limitation Talks with the Soviet Union; on thecontrary, it was positively helpful,
In the course of a full discussion it was argued that, in addition to the strong views which some members of the Government Party heldagainst the possession by us of nuclear weapons, a decision to improve the deterrent carried an implied intention to keep up with further developments in anti-missile technology and to replace the submarines in due course.    It was questionable whether possession of the deterrent gave us a greater influence than we would enjoy if weabandoned it.    It was also argued, however, that our influence as a nuclear power was real and would be no less important in the futurethan it had proved to be in the pasts    If we were to abandon the deterrent this would have a serious effect on our European NATOallies and would revive demands for a European nuclear force.    even with the proposed improvements, the cost of the Polaris force was less than 2 per cent of the defence budget; this was a small price topay for the advantages it conferred.(At this point the Prime Minister had to leave the meeting and theLord President of the Council took the chair.)In further discussion it was argued that the prospective spread of a nuclear capability among the smaller powers was a particularlydisturbing development.    We should seek to work for international agreement to reverse this trend and should be prepared to considergiving up our nuclear deterrent if by this means we could secure an effective agreement at a later stage, though nothing could be said about this intention now.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL, summing up thediscussion, said that the Cabinet had held a valuable and wide-rangingdiscussion of the international and domestic implications of the defence review.    Their discussion of the nuclear deterrent in particular hadbeen conducted with moderation and understanding of different shades of opinion.    Agreement had now been reached on the outstanding points.It was clear that we would encounter very considerable Americanopposition to withdrawal from the SBAs in Cyprus and the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary would be considering the terms of a reply tobe sent to Dr Kissinger.   Apart from this the proposals summarised in C(74) 116 would form the basis of the consultations with our alliesand with both sides of industry.    The next step would be to settle thestatement to be made in Parliament on 3 December; this would beconsidered by the Cabinet on 25 November.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Lord President ofthe Councils summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office
