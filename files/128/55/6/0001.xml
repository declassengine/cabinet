FOREIGNAFFAIRSCypruspreviousReference:CC(74) 27thConclusions,Minute 41. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat at the tripartite talks with the Greeks and Turks at Geneva,the Turks had been particularly difficult.    Their forces in Cyprushad ignored the United Nations call for a ceasefire and had continuedto bring in reinforcements and to extend the territory under their control while the talks were taking place.    The situation had comevery close to the point at which the Greeks would have chosen warrather than suffer further humiliation.    Agreement on a declaration would probably not have been reached without very close Anglo-American co-operation and in particular the help of the American secretary of State, Dr Kissinger, who, at his request, had inter-intervened personally with the Turkish Prime Minister, Mr Ecevit.Talks in Geneva would be resumed the following week.    He would thentry to persuade the Turks to start reducing their forces in Cyprus.It was impossible at this stage to predict what the political future of cyprus was likely to be, but since the Turkish Foreign Minister,Mr Gunes, had said that Turkey did not want partition of the island,while the Greek Foreign Minister, Mr Mavros, had said thatGreece was not seeking Enosis, a federal solution might be possible.The position of Archbishop Makarios in future discussions might bea complicating factor.    It was of course for the Cypriots to decidewho should speak for them, and Archbishop Makarios was still thelegal President of Cyprus, but there was little doubt that the ActingPresident, Mr Clerides, would be more likely to reach a sensiblearrangement with the Turks.    The Soviet Union were throwing theirweight behind President Makarios.    In the United Nations theSoviet Permanent Representative, Mr Malik, had used the vetoagainst a resolution which would have enabled the Secretary General,Dr Waldheim, to issue the necessary instructions to the united nations forces in Cyprus, including their use in the buffer zonewhich was to be established around the territory held by the TurkishArmy.    Mr Malik had claimed that the veto was necessary forprocedural reasons and there was some hope that he would notpersist in frustrating the purpose of the resolution when discussion in the Security Council was resumed.The cabinet took note and congratulated the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary on the outcome of thefirst stage of the tripartite discussions.1
2. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENTsaid that considerable progress had been made in drafting a white paper on the fulfilment of the commitment in the Labour PartyManifesto that land required for development would be taken into public ownership; and the general principles underlying theproposals had been endorsed by a small group of Ministers underthe Prime Minister&apos;s chairmanship.   The proposals envisaged thatall development land other than owner-occupied housing would indue course be taken into community ownership, and that the priceof acquisition would be the current use value.    The principalacquiring agents in England and Scotland would be the localauthorities, but in Wales a new national body would probably be setup for the purpose.    The local authorities would benefit from thescheme by acquiring land for housing and other public purposes ata reduced cost.    Land intended for private development would be disposed of at the market value; and the gains on these transactionswould be shared between central and local government, with the major share accruing to the Exchequer.    The draft White Paperalso said, in a deliberately vague phrase, that the intention was that part of the benefit should help owner-occupiers.    The precise way in which this would be done could be settled later; but it waspresentationally important to offer reassurance to owner-occupiers.The main difficulties that had been encountered related to the transitional period for introducing the scheme.    Because of theshortage of valuers, the unreadiness of some of the local authoritiesand the danger of reducing the availability of land for housing, a transitional period would be essential, and was likely to be ratherlonger than some people had expected.    This might cause some political difficulty, though he did not believe that it would be serious.During the transitional period the local authorities would have extended powers to acquire development land but would not have a duty to do so; a private market would therefore continue to exist,and this raised the question of how to tax private transactions so asto leave landowners in roughly the same position whether they soldprivately or to a public authority.    A closely related problem wasthe price to be paid for public acquisition.      One possibility was touse the market value, frozen at the date of the publication of theWhite Paper, as the price for public acquisition and as the basis ofthe tax; alternatively, the tax might be based on the cost of the lasttransaction.    An expert Working Party of officials had been set upto study the complex technical problems raised by both courses andwould report during August.    A revised draft of the White paper would then be put to the Cabinet with a view to publication inSeptember.The following points were raised in discussion -a.      It would be a mistake to take an unduly gloomy viewof the probable length of the transitional period.    Somefeared that it might be 9 or 10 years; but, given a crash2
programme for training valuers, as little as 4 yearsmight suffice.    Moreover it was intended that itshould be possible for the complete scheme to beintroduced progressively by a series of Orders, whichcould relate to specified parts of the country - inpractice, local authority areas.b. It was suggested that the White Paper might refer to the arrangements in Letchworth, where a similar scheme had been working satisfactorily for many years and wassaving the authority some  300, 000 a year.c. It was suggested that the White Paper might includefigures to show the total increases in land values inrecent years, so as to indicate the amount of the benefit which was in future to accrue to the community ratherthan to private individuals.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet congratulated the Secretary of State for the environment and the Minister for Planning and Local Government on the outcome of the work they had done, and approved their proposals in principle.    They took note that the question of taxation and purchase price in the transitional period were to be consideredby an expert Working Party.    In the light of the conclusions thenreached, and of the points which had been raised in discussion,the Secretary of State for the Environment should circulate afinal draft of the White Paper to the Cabinet for approval atthe end of August or the beginning of September with a view to early publication.    Since the broad principles underlying the scheme had now been settled, the Cabinet would at that stage be concerned only with detailed and presentational matters.The Cabinet -&apos; l!        W &apos; ..Took note, with approval, of the summing up oftheir discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the Secretary of State for the Environment toproceed accordingly.
3. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the european economic Community&apos;s proposals for cheap beef for peoplereceiving social benefits.    They had before them a minute to thePrime Minister by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Foodreporting the conclusions of a Ministerial Meeting which had considered the matter.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthat the group of Ministers who had considered the scheme had agreed in principle, the Minister of State, Department of Health and social security dissenting, that the United Kingdom should adopt the scheme.It was to our advantage to do so financially, it would support thesuccessful negotiations that had been completed in Brussels on community beef arrangements, and since the previous administration had implemented the social butter scheme it would be poHticallydifficult for the Government not to take up the benefits of thisscheme, especially since it would result in a net transfer to theUnited Kingdom of Community funds.    The details of a scheme had still to be worked out but it seemed likely that it could be implementedbefore the end of the year and could run until 6 April 1975.    His own view was that notwithstanding the policy and operational problems involved, the balance of advantage lay overwhelmingly in favour of taking up the scheme.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that theGovernment should oppose the scheme on principle.    It extendedmeans-tested benefits; and it would also enlarge the poverty trap,since the value of the beef tokens, award of which would be dependenton receipt of supplementary benefit, would be substantial - in thecase of a man, wife and four children as much as  1. 50 per week.The Governments poHcies were to oppose means-testing and to cutback, not extend, its application.    It would be better, since thescheme could not be implemented before the Autumn, for theGovernment to enter into no commitment, especially since anyshort-term advantage would be outweighed by the outcry in Aprilwhen the subsidy stopped.    The operational problems I wereformidable and her Department could not, in view of its prior commit-ments, administer the scheme.    The most it could do would be togive means of identity to the recipients so that the Post Office couldissue coupons over Post Office counters as they had done for socialbutter.In discussion it was argued that the social beef scheme was a badscheme produced by a bad policy, the Common Agricultural Policy(CAP), and it was unacceptable for the Government to have to implement it in the form presented by the Commission, which wouldconfine it only to the poor, who had to identify themselves as such inthe shops to benefit from it.    The Government had criticised the butter scheme on these grounds and should be consistent.    The public4
expenditure entailed could, moreover, be better spent on other things - eg on invalid vehicles.    If the effects of the CAP were such that large amounts of beef had now to be eaten this would have been better achieved by distribution to hospitals, schools and other institutions.    If the surplus beef had to be eaten via a subsidy to individuals, it should not be on a means-tested basis but should begiven to all retirement pensioners, who were a distinct categoryamong recipients of social benefits and could be identified withoutstigma.    It was better to give it to them for 3 months than to themeans-tested beneficiaries for 6 Or 7 months.    On the other hand it was argued that it was not realistic for the Government to spurnthe financial benefits which would accrue to the United kingdom under the scheme when part of its case against the present termsof membership of the e.c. was the budgetary burden on this country.And it would be very difficult politically to sustain that position,especially since the losers would only be the people who had, underthe previous Administration, benefited by the social butter scheme.The operational problems, though great, were not insuperable and her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office had reported that all the necessaryprinting could be done for a scheme starting in November.In further discussion it was argued that a means-tested scheme of thekind proposed by the Commission was wrong in relation to pricespolicy generally and because of the adverse economic effects on thebeef market.    A scheme applicable to all pensioners would not beopen to the same objections.    Its cost could be found within theexisting Votes for food subsidies.    The Government should not beinhibited by the precise definition which the Commission chose to give to recipients of &quot;social benefits&quot; but should tell the Commission thatit intended to implement the scheme to the same effect but in a way which was acceptable to the British Government.    As against this itwas argued that the existence of the social butter scheme which wasframed in accordance with the Commission^ views made thiscourse difficult, and there would be opposition from other member states. iiTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the social beef scheme exemplified the faultsin the CAP and was in itself an unattractive scheme.    Neverthelessthey recognised that it was essential for the United Kingdom to gain what benefit it could from the agreements reached over beef,especially in view of the fact that the Minister o  Agriculture,Fisheries and Food had been successful in winning acceptance forour own approach based on deficiency payments.    It would be politically impossible to reject the scheme but the Cabinet did not find it acceptable to give cheap beef only to those in receipt ofsupplementary benefits, since this would involve an extension of means-testing which was wholly inconsistent with the Government1 ssocial policies and had been the basis of their opposition to the5
social butter scheme.    The scheme would have been better conceivedif it had directed the beef subsidy to hospitals, schools and residentialhomes and similar institutions; but since this was not nowpracticable it should go instead to all those within the social securityfield who were receiving retirement pensions, without distinctionbetween those who were or were not receiving supplementary pension.A broad and short-lived scheme on this basis would avoid the powerful objections of principle which the Secretary of State for social Services had put forward, and would also be consistent withthe Governments policies on prices generally.    The cost of thesubsidy should be borne on the Vote of the Department of Prices and consumer Protection, and administrative costs would be met by theDepartments incurring them.    The administration of the scheme would be by coupons issued to those eligible through the Post Offices,as had been done for the social butter scheme; and consultationswould be required with the relevant staff interests,    The Ministerof Agriculture, Fisheries and Food should present the Governmentsapproach to the scheme on these lines publicly and, in consultation as necessary with the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, should inform the Commission in Brussels that this was how the UnitedKingdom Government intended to proceed.    He should then arrangefor the details of implementation to be worked out in consultation between the Secretaries of State for Social Services, Prices and consumer Protection, and Industry, and the Chancellor of theExchequer.The Cabinet -IT&apos;:1.       Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2.      Invited the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food, in consultation with the other Ministers concerned,to proceed as indicated in the Prime Ministers summing6
SEXDISCRIMINATIONPreviousReference;0C(74) 26thConclusions,Minute 54. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the action to betaken against sex discrimination.THE HOME SECRETARY said that, as agreed by the Cabinet attheir meeting on 16 July, he had made a general policy statement in the House of Commons and had put in hand work on thepreparation of a White Paper.    On this there were four points onwhich he wished to report to the Cabinet.    First, he and theLord Chancellor had reached agreement on the question whether ornot the power to seek an injunction should be given only to theEqual Opportunities Commission.    Secondly, the question whatexceptions were required in relation to insurance had been left for further discussion at the Cabinefs last meeting.    His presentview was that the Bill should apply to insurance generally but with an exception for State and occupational pensions schemes,which were dealt with in separate legislation; and that in theprivate field it should allow differentiation in the terms offered to men and to women if, and only if, this could be fully justified on actuarial or other scientifically demonstrable grounds.    Thishowever was a matter which he would discuss further with theSecretary of State for Trade on the latter*s return to this country.Thirdly, it had been suggested that the police might be excluded.He did not think that this would be practicable; and it should suffice that the legislation would permit the sexes to be treateddifferently where this was justified by a genuine occupationalreason.    Fourthly, there was the question of incitement, aidingand abetting.    He had in mind that the Bill should allow legal proceedings to be brought only by the Equal OpportunitiesCommission and not by individuals.    This could not be finally settled pending the completion of the discussions currently inprogress with the Trades Union Congress (TUC); but in his view,whatever the attitude of the TUC might prove to be, it would notbe possible for the Government to accept that the legislation onsex discrimination should contain a substantially weakerprovision on this matter than was included in the Race relations act.    It was desirable that it should be possible to deal with allattempts at incitement and not merely with successful incitement;but it should be borne in mind that it was not proposed to create a criminal offence.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet noted the position which had been reached.    The finalwording of the White Paper should be settled by the Home secretary in conjunction with the Ministers principally concerned, and a copyof the draft should also be sent to him.    The objective should be toissue the White Paper during the early part of September; the precise date should be settled between the Home Secretary, theLord President of the Council and the Parliamentary Secretary,Civil Service Department.7
The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited the Home Secretary to be guided accordingly,Cabinet office August 19748
