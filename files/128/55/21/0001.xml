PARLIAMENTARY1FFAIRS1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.feorgeKentLimitedIt was reported that there was some doubt whether an affirmative resolution would be needed in respect of the financial help which ithad been agreed should be given to George Kent Limited (GK) and toScientific and Medical Instruments Limited (smi).    There were strongprima facie grounds for supposing that a Resolution would be needed,bearing in mind that the Governments total commitment was liable to exceed   5 million (the upper limit of help which could be given underSection 0 of the Industry Act 1972 without an Affirmative Resolution)and that since smi was a wholly owned subsidiary of GK it was doubtful whether the firms could properly be regarded as two separate enterprises.    It was however noted that the Secretary ofState for Industry would be investigating the matter further veryurgently; and the Lord Pre sident of the Council should be informed of the conclusions he reached.ChanneliTunnelBillThe Cabinet were informed that difficulties had arisen in the handling of the Channel Tunnel Bill following the substantial vote against theprocedural Motion which had been adopted by the House of commons on 11 November,    It was desirable that the Bill should now be reintroduced as rapidly as possible; but some early reassurance was desirable for Government supporters who had voted against the motion,    Such reassurances might take the form of a statement that although for procedural reasons the Bill must be proceeded with, any decision whether or not to go ahead with the Tunnel itself would be postponed until full account could be taken of the report of the Groupunder the chairmanship of Sir Alec Cairncross, which was expected in the spring.    The right course would therefore be for the Bill to be reintroduced as soon as possible and for it to be made known that anearly policy statement would be made by the Secretary of State for the environment, who should as soon as possible circulate forconsideration by the Cabinet a memorandum containing proposals asto the content of such a statement.1
2. THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOODsaid that at the Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) of theEuropean Economic Community (e.c.) on 12 November the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had succeeded in persuading theCommunity to commit itself for the first time to access on a continuing basis of 1. 4 million tons of cane sugar annually from the developing Commonwealth countries.    Some aspects of thearrangement still needed to be decided - especially the price whichshould be offered for this sugar; this was likely to be a difficultissue, and he was circulating to the Ministers concerned a note on howhe intended to handle it.    These further aspects would be pursued inthe Council of Ministers (Agriculture) the following week.In discussion it was agreed that the e.c. commitment to give access to 1.4 million tons annually on a continuing basis represented the achievement of a major renegotiation objective, though the pricingprovisions would require careful handling.    There had been no discussion at the Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) on the import of Australian sugar.    It had been reported that very little Australiansugar was available before the autumn of 1975, given the largeamounts reserved for Japan.    However, it was possible that theAustralian agreement with Japan might break down, and v/e should keep open the possibility of importing sugar from Australia, ifavailable, to help meet the severe shortage we were facing in the short term.    As to the longer term, the Government was not committed to obtaining long-term access for Australian sugar as oneof its specific renegotiation objectives.    It would be reasonable toconsider on its economic and commercial merits any proposal for along-term contract to import Australian sugar, taking into accountwhether or not the expansion of home-produced beet sugar would bemore to our advantage.It was pointed out that no matter what arrangements were made forthe import of sugar in the current discussions in the Council ofMinisters, the United Kingdom faced an acute shortage of sugar forthe next nine months.    The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food should have this in mind in seeking to get the best price hecould in the Council of Ministers (Agriculture) next week.    Inaddition, the Cabinet should, as agreed earlier, review the handling of the future sugar situation as soon as agreement had been reached in the further Community discussions.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary was to be congratulated onachieving the commitment by the e.c. to an offer to import on a continuing basis 1.4 million tons annually of cane sugar.    this commitment would make good a major defect in the terms of e.c.   !!accession negotiated by the previous Administration.    The continuing
basis of the arrangement would be most helpful to the developing commonwealth countries if the world sugar situation were reversed.In the present situation of acute shortage we should not let slip anyopportunities of securing Australian sugar; but any arrangements for importing Australian sugar in the longer term would need to be judgedon their merits and to take account of the factor of beet production athome.The Cabinet -1, Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthat at the Council of Ministers (Agriculture) on 18 and 19 Novemberhe would be presenting proposals for changes in our beef marketing arrangements designed to overcome the critical situation facing theBritish livestock industry.    He had circulated a memorandum on his proposals to the Ministerial Committee on European Questions (EQ).THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food&apos;s proposals amounted principally to therestoration in effect of a deficiency payment system.    His proposals should alleviate the present situation - a view accepted by theNational Farmers Union.    If any parts of the Minister ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food&apos;s proposals caused difficulties forother Ministers concerned, the matter should be resolved as quickly as possible within EQ,The Cabinet -2. Took note.3
3. The Cabinet had before them a copy of a letter dated13 November from the General Secretary of the Trades UnionCongress (TUC) to the Secretary of State for Employment,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that he had spoken to the General Secretary of the TUC on the lines that theCabinet had agreed at their last meeting, and the revised letter from him which they had before them embodied the latest TUC proposal.He hoped that the Cabinet would give a clear decision in favour of thisproposal instead of a statutory provision.    It represented a big stepforwards in the recognition by trade unions of their responsibilities;and its adoption would do much to reduce injustice.    For instance itcould be used to deal with the case of the National Union of journalists (NUJ) which had been raised at the last meeting.    TheGeneral Secretary&apos;s letter did not completely meet the conditions laiddown by the Cabinet at their last meeting, but the differences were small.    The TUC were now proposing to appoint the Chairman of the irreview committee after consultation with the Secretary of State for employment and the Chairman of the Conciliation and ArbitrationService (CAS): the letter now said that there would be &quot;a clearresponsibility&quot; on the unions to act on the recommendations of the review committee; this did not go as far as the Cabinet had wanted in asking for the same sanction as applied to the Bridlington agreement;but the General Secretary, Mr Murray, had said that he would not putsuch a proposal to the General Council of the TUC because he wouldhave no hope of their adopting it.    Mr Murray was working for a fair and sensible outcome and the Cabinet must respect his judgment.On merits, then, he believed that the TUC proposals were defensibleand carried out the spirit of the Cabinet&apos;s requirements.    In addition,the Cabinet must take account of the totality of their relationship withthe TUC.    The TUC were hypersensitive on the subject of theIndustrial Relations Act.    Its repeal was their first priority.    If theGovernment spurned their proposal, it would have to put through a statutory provision against their opposition and the TUC might refuseto co-operate in working the system.    It would be foolish for theGovernment to spoil its relationship with the TUC, when their entireeconomic policy depended on TUC co-operation, of which the welcomesupport that they had given to the Budget was only the most recent example.    He proposed, therefore, that the Government should encourage Mr Murray to put the revised proposal to the TUC general council at their meeting on 20 November.    He would delay until then the publication of the Bill to amend the Trade Union and labour relations Act,    If the General Council accepted Mr Murray1 s proposal,the omission of any statutory safeguard from the Government bill would be easily defensible in the House of Commons,
THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that the two conditions on which themajority of the Cabinet had decided to accept the TUC proposals hadnot been fully met.    It would have been better for the Chairman ofthe review committee to be selected after consultation with the LordChancellor than with the Secretary of State for Employment, since theLord Chancellor was in a better position to know the qualifiedcandidates for the post; but it could be arranged that the Secretary ofState for Employment would in practice consult the Lord Chancellor.As regards enforcement the language of the revised proposal was animprovement, but it still placed no mandatory duty on the trades union to observe the recommendations of the review committee.Rule 13 of the TUC constitution, which gave it the power to give directions to affiliated unions to desist from certain pratices on painof suspension or expulsion, would not apply to the recommendations ofthe review committee.    The Cabinet faced a grave political decision and he was still not happy about the terms of the TUC proposal,THE HOME SECRETARY said that at their last meeting he had strongly expressed a dissenting view.    He was if anything more unhappy than before about the attitude of the TUC.    Mr Murray&apos;s letter showed that the TUC did not believe in the need for a safeguard and were onlyadopting it to avert the threat of statutory machinery: their proposalmet neither of the Cabinefs conditions.    The support of the TUC forthe Budget was welcome but had nothing to do with this question of individual rights:  if the Cabinet accepted the latest proposal it wouldhave embarked on a profoundly dangerous course.In discussion it was argued that the recent action of the NUJ inblacking an article by a non-member in a provincial newspaper was a demonstration of the threat to the freedom of the Press that had been mentioned at the last meeting.    There had been cases of intimidationof individuals by both left-wing and right-wing unions.    Both must be stopped.    Workers who were less articulate than journalists might bemore in need of protection.    Unless the arrangements were supportedby similar sanctions to the Bridlington agreement a trade union coulddisregard the recommendation of the review committee.    The Houseof Commons would be entitled to an explanation of this point.      aImportant though it was for the Government to remain on good terms with the TUC, that should not imply giving the TUC a veto overGovernment measures.    The Cabinet should have no need tonegotiate: it should consult interested parties and take its decisions on merits.On the other hand it was argued that the case of the NUJ was nottypical: the union was a maverick and the question of Press freedomwas broader than the question of individual rights that arose in other cases.    It might be possible to adapt the TUC arrangement to dealwith this case by ensuring that the one member of the review
committee had experience of journalism; but it would probably bebetter to set in hand a special inquiry or to remit the question to theRoyal Commission on the Press which was already considering the parallel question of interference by newspaper proprietors,,    Settingapart the case of the NUJ, it was argued that the TUC proposals were well conceived and were likely to produce fair results.    Although theproposals for sanctions fell short of the Bridlington agreement, theywent further than the Croydon agreement, which had also been mentioned at the last meeting of the Cabinet.    In practice no tradeunion would be likely to disregard a recommendation of the review committee.    The TUC now had more powers over its membershipthan it had had five years ago; it was learning how to make use of legal advice; the present General Secretary exerted more authoritythan his predecessors and had shown his capacity to influence trades union even where his powers were small.    Moreover in certain respects the TUC proposals offered more than the Government had asked.    They provided for the Secretary of State for Employment andthe Chairman of the CAS to be consulted not only about the Chairmanof the review committee but about its two members.    They gave the review committee itself a conciliatory role.    They provided for individuals to be made aware of their rights of appeal.    To proceed,on the other hand, by legislation would not change attitudes on the shop floor.    Enforcement would prove impossible.    No statutory provision, for instance, could stop the action that had been taken bythe NUJ.    The support of the TUC leaders for Government policieswas difficult for them to give and was of crucial importance for theGovernment.    When they asked for Government agreement on amatter like this their wishes should be considered carefully even Ifthey did not accord completely with the Cabinet&apos;s own preferences.If relations with the trades unions were to break down it would bedifficult to produce any alternative line of policy that could be madeto work.In further discussion it was suggested that, where the TUC had proposed to appoint the Chairman and members of the review committee &quot;after consultation with the Secretary of State for employment&quot;, it would create a better impression if the appointmentswere to be made &quot;in eonsultation with&quot;.    This was a purelypresentational point, since there was no legal difference between thetwo phrases. ,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that themajority of the Cabinet agreed that the TUC proposals, as revised,offered a satisfactory alternative to a legislative safeguard.    in practical British terms the system could be made to work.    TheCabinet agreed, therefore, that the Secretary of State for employment should encourage the General Secretary of the TUC toput his proposal to the General Council for discussion at their
meeting on 20 November.    Until that discussion the Government Billto amend the Trade Union and - Labour    Relations Act should not bepublished^ and if the General Council did not accept the proposal, as expressed in the General Secretary&apos;s letter of 13 November, thequestion should be brought back to the Cabinet.    If the proposal were accepted, the Government Bill should be published without provisionfor a statutory safeguard, but the Secretary of State for employment should explain in introducing the Bill that the Government would retain the possibility of introducing legislation if the voluntary system did notwork satisfactorily.    Mr Murray&apos;s letter was not very suitable for publication, and it would be preferable for the TUC to make their own arrangements for publicising their proposal after the meeting of theGeneral Council,    The question of the conduct of the NUJ should betaken separately;  as a first step the Secretaries of State for employment and for Trade should consider, in the light of the points made in the Cabinet discussion, whether the question should bereferred to the Royal Commission on the Press or dealt with in someother way.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2, Invited the Secretary of State for employment to speak accordingly to the General Secretary of theTrades Union Congress,3. Invited the Secretaries of State for employment and for Trade to consider what actionto take on the threat to Press freedom posed by theNational Union of Journalists and to report back tothe Cabinet.7
4. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR. SCOTLAND said that theCabinet had agreed on 7 November that it would be de undesirable, ifpossible, to make an interim payment to teachers immediately afterthe receipt of the Houghton Report at the end of December,    TheSecretary of State for Education and Science and he had seenLord Houghton afterwards, and Lord Houghton had been most helpful:he had promised to try at once to obtain his Committee^ agreement inprinciple to an interim payment, and to put forward a recommendation on the amount of the payment by the end of November.    He had just received a message that the Committee, which was meeting at that moment, would send a letter enabHng a payment &quot;specified by theCommittee&quot; to be made in December.    He was not quite sure what this meant, but he thought that it would certainly be best if theCommittee would specify the amount of the interim payment that theywere to recommend.    He proposed to arrange an announcement through a written Parliamentary Question to be answered the following day.The situation in the Scottish schools was still bad: the EducationalInstitute of Scotland was threatening further action.    Since he wouldbe blamed personally for anything that went wrong, it would be helpful if other Ministers would consult him before commenting publicly.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE saidthat he agreed with the Secretary of State for Scotland.    Under theseproposals the Houghton Committee recommendations would be implemented in two stages: first a lump sum and then the more complex negotiations.    A meeting of the Burnham Committee theprevious day gave hopes of a reasonable outcome for England andWales, and if the management side in the Burnham Committee wereright in thinking that it would not be possible to make the interimpayment in December he thought that the teachers in England andWales would be willing to accept payment in January.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said thatthe Northern Ireland Office should be kept in touch, in view of the repercussions in Northern Ireland.In discussion it was suggested that the experience of the Department ofHealth and Social Security in making the interim payment to nurses onthe publication of the Halsbury Report would be of great assistance indrawing up the timetable for processing the interim payments for teachers.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office14 November 1974 ...8
