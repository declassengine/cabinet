0IjATIONAL 1, The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thepPERANNUATION      Secretary of State for Social Services about national superannuation (C(74) 84), to which was appended a draft white Paper.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES saidthat much of the credit for the very ingenious proposals for improved long-term pension arrangements rested with theMinister of State in her Department, Mr 0&apos;Malley.    The main principles which any scheme adopted by the present Governmentwould have to satisfy were that it should afford an adequateearnings-related pension for everyone; provide a role for goodoccupational pensions schemes; be simpler than the proposals put forward by Mr Grossman in the time of the last labour government; make some improvement in the position ofexisting pensioners; provide for equal treatment for women and for an element,of redistribution in favour of the lower paid;and offer proofing against inflation.    Her proposals satisfiedthese requirements.    The benefits proposed were outlined inthe memorandum she had circulated.    The base level pension would be revalued in line with average national earnings andthe remainder of the pension would be price protected.    Itwould be assumed that the rate of contributions at the start of the scheme would be not more than lfif per cent.    Thiscompared with a contribution of 14j per cent as from April 1975and reflected a reduction in her original proposals in the lightof discussions with Treasury Ministers.    Employees who hadbeen contracted in would be paying 6j per cent; those who hadbeen contracted out would be paying 6f per cent up to the baselevel and probably 4 per cent on the remainder of their earnings;but the detailed arrangements for contracting out could not befinalised pending the completion of consultations with theinterests concerned.    The period of maturity would be 20 yearsand pensions would be calculated on the basis of the contributor^best 20 years of earnings.    The latter was a particularlyattractive provision which would be appreciated by manual workers and by younger workers generally.    The proposalsenvisaged equality of treatment for women, and therefore the married woman&apos;s option would be abolished for all women newlyentering employment.    But, because of the consequentialincrease in contributions, phasing-in arrangements were needed for women already at work; the White Paper indicated that there were to be discussions with interested organisationsbut that the Government looked sympathetically at thepossibility of allowing the continuance for existing working wivesof the right to opt out of cover for short-term benefits.    Thiswould significantly reduce the total cost of the scheme andwould have the further advantage of largely eliminating the1
need for additional staff to operate it,    A point still outstanding was the provision to be made for existing pensioners.A general improvement in basic pensions would be very-expensive, and the alternative possibility of some form ofnegative income tax was being examined.    In the meantime,alternative forms of words had been included in the draft white paper; the choice between them would have to depend on the outcome of the discussions which her Department was at presenthaving with the Treasury.    The scheme would not involve any additional public expenditure until 1978-79 and the extra costafter the first year would be about  133 million - less, if the married woman&apos;s right to opt out from short-term benefits were retained.    She sought the Cabinefs agreement to publication ofthe draft White Paper early in September, if possible before theannual Trades Union Congress.THE CHANCELLOR.OF THE EXCHEQUER said that in principlehe endorsed the proposals put forward by the Secretary of Statefor Social Services.    There would be public expenditureimplications; but they would not arise until the last year of thepresent PESC period and it was possible that if there were ageneral election in 1978-79 the introduction of the scheme mightbe deferred for a further year.    The cost of the proposals would in the long run be very great, and it was important thatthe White Paper should be presented so that it would have theleast effect on confidence in this country&apos;s financial stability.He had four comments on the draft which had been circulated.First, whatever might be decided about negative income tax -and the prospects of proposals being worked out did not atpresent seem promising - he strongly preferred the second ofthe two alternative versions of paragraph 9 of the foreword.Secondly, paragraph 14 of the draft White Paper itself should indicate that the part of the pension above the base level would receive price protection rather than &quot;no less&apos; han&quot; priceprotection.    Thirdly, it was arguable that the proposals for widows and widowers were unduly favourable and it would therefore be desirable to review them.    Fourthly, the wording of paragraphs 36 and 38 should be reviewed to reflect the factthat the figure of 16^ per cent for the initial contribution was tobe regarded as a maximum.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet congratulated the Secretary of State for social services and the Minister of State on having produced aningenious and acceptable set of proposals.    They agreed that a white Paper should be published early in September, if possible before the annual Trades Union Congress.    The draft which hadbeen circulated was agreed, subject to examination by theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for 
Social Services of the points which had been raised.In the light of their consultations, any necessary amendmentsshould be made to the draft, and the Cabinet need be consultedagain only if there were points which the Ministers were unableto settle between themselves.    The Secretary of State should consider the issue of a popular version of the White Paper andthe provision for Ministers of suitable briefing material at thetime of publication.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister !summing up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for Social Services, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer,to proceed accordingly.2.        The Cabinet considered taxes on capital.    their discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded separately.Cabinet Office30 July 19743
&apos; secret  this  DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy NO   A r-lbCABINETCONFIDENTIAL, annex cc(74) 30th Conclusions, Minute tuesday 30 July 1974 at 12. 00 noonTAXES ON THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that theCAPITAL Government were committed by their Election Manifesto to measuresof redistribution of wealth as well as of income.    The only tax on wealth at present was estate duty, which was widely avoided bylifetime gifts and trusts.    If a wealth tax was not to be similarlyavoided, a tax on gifts was also indispensable.    He had   thereforealready announced in his Budget a new gifts tax which would haveimrre diate effect and for which the legislation, which would be very complicated, would be introduced in the second Finance Bill.    Hehad undertaken to give further information about the tax, and thiswould now be published in a White Paper.    The rates of tax wouldbe lower than those of the present estate duty, but the eventual yieldwould be higher, which was an indication of the extent to whichestate duty was avoided at present.    The most complex provisions would relate to trusts, where the general principle would be that thecharge to tax should be neither greater nor less than the charge onassets held absolutely.    The exemption for gifts to national heritagebodies would continue.    The present relief from estate duty for business and farm assets would be discontinued, but followingdiscussion in the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy, thedraft White Paper was being modified to show more recognition ofthe problems faced by small businessmen and farmers.He had also accepted an obligation to publish a Green Paper on the wealth tax.    This tax would be a new departure in this country,although other countries had had similar taxes for a considerable time.    The Green Paper would indicate the broad shape and structure of the tax, and explain the main difficulties, suggestingalternative solutions where appropriate.    It would be proposed thatthe Green Paper should be referred to a Select Committee of theHouse of Commons.    It would not be possible to include the necessary legislation in a spring Finance Bill in 1975, although it might well bepossible to include it in an autumn Finance Bill if there was one.
Otherwise it would have to be deferred until the 1976 Finance Bill,in which case the valuation and the first payments of the new tax would take place in 1977.    It was proposed that the starting point for the tax should be  100, 000, rather than the figure of  50, 000which had been previously envisaged.    This was necessary in orderto avoid an unmanageable burden on the Inland Revenue, and it also recognised the effect of inflation since the figure of  50, 000 was originally suggested.    Depending on share values, the tax would affect one in every 200 to 300 of the population.    The tax would start at 1 per cent, and two possible illustrative scales would be indicated, yielding approximately  200 million and  300 million respectively.    Any special exemption for works of art would be associated with a requirement that they should be placed on publicdisplay, but household goods might be exempted below a specifiedlimit.    When the wealth tax had been introduced, it should bepossible to abolish the investment income   surcharge, and also toreduce somewhat the higher rates of income tax.    The proposalsgenerally might be felt by some to be insufficiently draconian, butit was preferable to introduce them in a way which would not damageconfidence.    The important thing was to get the tax onto the statute book, and it would always be possible to change the rates later ifnecessary.The proposals in both documents would be provisional.    The green paper on the wealth tax was intended as a basis for public discussion.The Y/hite Paper on the capital transfer tax would sketch out the main principles, but the details would be contained in the Finance Bill.He proposed to publish both documents during the following week.In discussion, concern was expressed that the taxation of giftswould affect those of relatively modest means.    There would however be exemptions for gifts made out of income, for the first  1, 000 ofgifts made in any one year, and gifts on marriage up to  2, 500; andthe first  15, 000 of the cumulative total of chargeable transferswould also be free of tax.    Gifts to charities would also be exemptup to a cumulative limit of  50, 000, with half the normal rate of tax applying thereafter.    There were difficulties in giving completeexemption for charities because of the unsatisfactory definition ofcharities in existing charity law.    A further effort would however bemade to see if complete exemption could be given for gifts tocharities falling within some stricter definition included in the finance bill for this particular purpose.In further discussion the following points were made -a.    The special position of agriculture has already been recognised in the draft Green Paper, and agreement has beenreached on a passage of a similar kind to be included in thedraft White Paper on the capital transfer tax.    The effect on agriculture could however still be serious.
wb.    It had been argued that the rate of tax on lifetimegifts should be somewhat lower than on death, since otherwise the flow of gifts might dry up, to the detriment of the revenue.    Any such differential could howeverprobably only be created by increasing the rate of taxpayable on death, rather than by decreasing the ratepayable on lifetime gifts.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet took note of the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ proposals.Further consideration would be given to the point raised in discussion about the taxation of gifts to charities.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office31 July 19743
