1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.    It might bedesirable for the Prime Minister to speak in the Debate on theReport on Developments in the European Communities from march to October 1974, which was to take place on 19 December,since this would enable him to give a full report on the recentSummit discussions in Paris.    The Lord President of theCouncil would consider urgently whether it would be within therules of order to widen the Debate in this way.It was reported that, following a recent decision by the Chair thatit was in order for amendments to.be put down to &quot;take note&quot;motions, there might be difficulties in the handling of the debates on European Economic Community (e.c.) documents which wereto take place on 18 and 19 December.    As a result of thisdecision an occasion had arisen recently when an amendmentcritical of the document under discussion had been accepted andvoted on; this situation was liable to recur, and might put &apos;Ministers in an invidious position, particular if the amendmentwere controversial and related to decisions which the community had taken before our accession.    It was desirable to find a method of handling these debates which would avoid the need fora vote in such cases.    It was however pointed out that therewould be difficulty in establishing a procedure which would applyautomatically in all cases.    Some debates might properly takeplace on a motion for the adjournment, which was not open to amendment - though even then the possibility could not be excluded that some Members might divide the House in order to record their opposition to the policy involved;  and in that eventa free vote might be considered.    There were however other documents where a motion expressing approval would be appropriate; and advice on the procedure to be adopted would be needed in each individual case from the Department concerned.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthere could be no general rule about the form of the motion andthat an expression of approval might in some cases be appropriate.    In the circumstances which had been described,there would be advantage in arranging for the debate to takeplace on a motion for the adjournment; it should not then benecessary for there to be a vote because acceptance of the motion would not imply any view about the substance of the document.    The Lord President of the Council, in consultationwith the Chief Whip, should explore this possibility urgently.An alternative course which should also be explored might be to seek to devise a motion which in effect said that the document was not one upon which ParHament should at this stage be calledupon to express a firm conclusion one way or the other because.     &apos;    l :&apos;:
the issue was a part of renegotiation.    This approach mightbe worth considering in relation to the debate on documentsabout the e.c. draft budget which was to take place on19 December.The cabinet took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers\\ summing up of their discussion.2
0foreigniFFAIRSMeeting of Heads; Government of health  Europeaniconomic Community2. THE PRIME MINISTER said that the most useful feature of the Meeting of Heads of Government of the european economic Community (e.c.) held in Paris on 9 and 10 Decemberhad been the discussions of major world issues, notably energy,the problems of recycling, inflation and the dangers of aninternational recession.    It had been agreed that the french president should speak on their behalf to President Ford whenthey met next week in Martinique, conveying views which wereclosely in line with those agreed with the Chancellor of theFederal Republic when the latter was at Chequers on 1 December,Agreement had also been reached on the importance of thosecountries with a strong balance of payments to followpolicies of reflating demand.    Herr Schmidt had given themeeting a full account of the new economic measures whichthe German Government were about to introduce in the lightof their serious unemployment problem.    The Heads ofGovernment had agreed on the importance of co-ordinatingtheir positions so far as possible in future discussions of world economic problems.As to more specific issues, the Heads of Government had agreed to request the Belgian Prime Minister, in a personal capacity, to prepare a study in the course of 1975 on the concept of European Union:  Governments were in no way committed in advance to what this report might contain, and itwould defer until after the process of renegotiation was completedinstitutional decisions which might create difficulties for theUnited Kingdom Government.    On a number of other institutionalissues set out in the Communique he had fully reserved theGovernments position; he had made it plain that the UnitedKingdom&apos;s approach to all the conclusions in the Communiquewas governed by the commitments and objectives onrenegotiation defined in the February Election Manifesto, whichhe had explained in detail.    There had been a long and difficultdiscussion of the issue of the Community Budget; but, in spiteof the initial intransigence of the French President, agreement had been reached on a formula acceptable to us instructingthe Council of Ministers and the Commission to take accountof the United Kingdom&apos;s suggestions and estabHsh as soon aspossible the corrective mechanism we sought.    agreement had also been reached on the establishment of a regional development Fund, for three years only, from which the UnitedKingdom would draw a 28 per cent share.    The Communiquereferred briefly to the objective of the eventual establishmentof an Economic and Monetary Union; but it had been agreed between the Heads of Government in discussion that this wasnot a realistic goal in the foreseeable future, and the referenceto it in the Communique should be seen in the same light as the commitment to &quot;general and complete disarmament&quot; to which  JGovernments were always ready to subscribe.
In discussion it was suggested that certain passages in the communique appeared to commit the Government on a numberof issues in terms which were incompatible with the February-Election Manifesto and would weaken the credibility of theGovernments approach to renegotiation.    This was notably thecase in respect of the agreement recorded in the Communiquein relation to majority voting and the Luxembourg Agreementof 1966, to the election of the European Assembly by universalsuffrage, and to the reaffirmation of the 1972 Paris Summitcommitment to Economic and Monetary Union.    The firmretention of the power of veto was essential to the preservation of the sovereignty of the United Kingdom Parliament and represented a crucial safeguard against the e.c. overridingthe powers of both the Government and Parliament.    It was argued that the concept of Ministerial responsibility was further threatened by the agreement recorded as regardsgreater latitude to Permanent Representatives: this would increase the powers of officials at the expense of the Council ofMinisters.    Direct elections to the European Assembly would further strengthen that body and thus weaken the position of theUnited Kingdom Parliament.    The terms of the Communiquein respect of Economic and Monetary Union, however the concept might be regarded in practice, were directly at variance with the terms of the Governments February Election Manifesto.On the other hand it was argued that it was clear that as regardsmajority voting the terms of the Communique amounted to no more than an appeal that the power of veto should be exercised in future by Governments with reference to real issues of vitalnational interest.    Governments would remain free to decide which those issues were, and there had been no weakeningwhatever in the veto power essential to the United Kingdomposition.    Our position had also been expressly reserved on thequestion of direct elections to the European Assembly;  and onthat basis we were in no position to object to the approval ofother Governments to the question of direct elections? to theAssembly.    It was fully clear that no country regarded Economicand Monetary Union in practice as anything other than an idealbut distant goal.    The status of Permanent representatives would be unchanged by the decision to remit more detaileddecisions to them:  they would continue to be Ambassadors acting on the instructions of Ministers and Governments.    Furthermorethe passages in the Communique recording the views of the nineGovernment? on unemployment and inflation were entirely in line with the views of the Government: it was a substantialachievement by the Prime Minister and the Foreign an dCommonwealth Secretary to have secured general endorsementby e.c. Governments of this important element in theGovernments policy.

All the points on which agreement at the summit was recorded should be read in the light of paragraph 34of the Communique, which placed on record that he had explained to the other Heads of Government, along the linesof the public speech he had made on 7 December, the basis on which the Government approached renegotiation and theparticular issues to which the Government attached!the highest importance.    Throughout the Summit discussions he hadadhered strictly to the terms of the Manifesto.    In particular,the power of the Government to use the veto when necessary inthe Community remained unimpaired; one example of potentialuse was the question of lorry axle weights, but it could be used,if the Government wished, in relation to any of the policyquestions which might arise in future from the conclusions ofthe Summit meeting or from other areas of Community business.The Cabinet - ,Took note.

Some membersof the Cabinet felt that its terms suggested that agreement had been reached on issues which had not been the subjectof collective consideration by the whole Cabinet, and about which he personally had considerable reservations.In anticipation of a situation of this kind, he and two other members of the Cabinet had recently put to thePrime Minister a suggestion about how the doctrine of collective responsibility might best be applied in the later stages of the renegotiation.    To attempt to maintaincomplete Cabinet unity on all the issues which might arisecould prove impossible and the attempt could be damaging to the Government.    The only solution might be to reach some understanding (for which there was a precedent) on thebasis of an &quot;agreement to differ&quot; on this single issue andfor a limited period.   There was now the need for earlycollective discussion of the issues raised by theGovernment&apos;8 commitment to consult the British peopleonce renegotiation was completed.    Members of theCabinet would need then to be free to give their own judgement of the results of renegotiation, and it was arguable that they should now be free to give their owninterpretation of the relevant parts of the FebruaryManifesto. ,.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion,said that all members of the Government were bound bythe passages on renegotiation in the two Manifestos onwhich the Government had been elected: and in the publicspeech which he had made on 7 December he had statedclearly his own position on the basis of the Manifesto  //terms.    The collective responsibility of the government must be maintained on issues arising both in the course of renegotiation and in the continuing work of the, e.c. during that period.    He would arrange for a discussion early inthe New Year of the issues arising from the pledge to  1give the British people the final say through the ballot box,and this would provide an opportunity for discussion of theposition which members of the Cabinet might adopt whenthe results of renegotiation were clear.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office12 December 1974
COPY NOCABINET----- /CONFIDENTIAL annex cc(74) 51st Conclusions, Minute 4Thursday 12 December 1974 at 10. 00 am the Cabinet resumed their consideration of memoranda by thePrime Minister on Ministerial salaries (C(74) 134)and on thereport of the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB) (C(74) 141).They also considered a memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Employment (C(74) 145) on top salaries and the social contract.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that if theCabinet approved increases of 30 to 40 per cent for. the TSRB posts and the hospital consultants they would increase immensely theirown and the Trades Union Congresste(TUC) difficulties insustaining the social contract.    The proposals could not be reconciled with the TUC pay guidelines.    It did not help to argue that the TSRB groups would be recouping their position since 1969;other groups such as the electricity power workers would seek to recoup their losses over the period of statutory control.    Theminers would not be slow to draw the moral.    When the miners&apos;claim had been discussed at the Economic Committee of theGeneral Council of the TUC the previous day the Committee had agreed to take a hard line on that claim provided all other cases were to be judged by the same standards.    The TSRB report hadbeen mentioned in that connection, and the General Secretary ofthe TUC had said afterwards unattributably at a Press conference that an excessive increase for the TSRB group could be.as damaging to the social contract as any other.He proposed therefore that the TSRB report should be rejected.They should allow a sufficient increase to those earning less than 10, 000 to deal with problems of differentials but should give no increase to those above  10, 000.    They should invite all those inthe public and private sectors with incomes of  10, 000 or more to forego any increase in their incomes in 1975.    At the same time,in order to achieve the necessary public effect, the members ofthe Cabinet must accept a cut in their own salaries.    If theCabinet accepted the principles of this approach they should askofficials for detailed proposals for its application.1FOP SALARIESPreviousReference:CC(74) 50thConclusions,Shnute 6IIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYJS GOVERNMENT
In discussion it was argued that the rate of inflation in 1975 was likely to exceed the current rate of 17 per cent.    Commodity prices had failed to ease and food prices continued to go up.    the continuing fall in the sterling exchange rate added daily to the dangers.    It was clear now that even if the TUC guidelines on paywere fully observed, inflation would continue and that the dangerof runaway inflation was increasing.    This bore severely on the groups covered by the TSRB report who had already suffered a severe drop in real incomes.    On the other hand this was a timefor extreme measures and some unfairness to individuals wouldhave to be accepted.    It was argued however that what was neededwas something more comprehensive and egalitarian than theproposals of the Secretary of State for Employment.    TheGovernment should have a maximum incomes policy.    Either thisshould follow the recommendations of the Royal Commission on theDistribution of Income, and Wealth, who should be asked to produce an early report, and should be implemented through personaltaxation; or there could be a case for a more unconventionalapproach and more radical remedies.    But a discriminatory policy,directed only against the public sector, would be greatly resentedby those concerned and would fail to carry conviction with thepublic.    It would also be quite inconsistent with what theGovernment had said when in Opposition.In further discussion the following points were made:-a. Although it was illogical to propose a cut in ministerial salaries while only deferring increases in public service salaries, a gesture of this sort was needed to carry conviction with the private sector.    Against this it was argued that a similar measure had had no noticeableeffect in 1964.    At best the effects of a cut would be short-lived.    If Ministers accepted a freeze in their salariesthis would amount to a major erosion in their realpurchasing power which had already declined by 40 per cent over two years.    By accepting a freeze now they would retain the possibility of a cut later if it seemed necessary.b. Some trades unions, such as the Electrical PowerEngineers1 Association, accepted that the management structure of the nationalised industries had been artificiallydepressed in recent years.    It was important to attractgood managers, and a chairman for the proposed british national Oil Corporation would be likely to require ahigher salary than any in the Boyle report.    On the otherhand the attitude of the National Union of Mineworkers wascrucial.    .The salary increases proposed in the Boyle reportfor some of the nationalised industry chairmen whosesalaries were high already would be particularly difficult tojustify to the low paid workers in their industries.
c. It was argued that the TSRB recommendations for civil servants should also be rejected and an index-relatedincrease substituted.    On the other hand it was pointed outthat the size of the proposed increases in Civil Servicesalaries was the result of past restraint for which civilservants should not be penalised.    To avoid building up  //such difficulties for the future the TSRB review should beannual.    The Government should honour their expresscommitment to preserve the principle of fair comparisonsfor Civil Service pay.    If they abandoned this principlethey would undermine the whole pay structure of theCivil Service and give encouragement to the Civil Servicemilitants who would like their salaries to be determinedby free collective bargaining backed by industrial action.Some of the increases proposed at the top of the scale were- &apos;.however open to objection, though less so than the proposalsfor nationalised industry chairmen.    While accepting theBoyle recommendations in principle the Governmentcould stage their implementation and the process of stagingcould be applied most severely at the top levels.    Anappeal for voluntary staging might give good results, but because individual circumstances differed, some wouldhave more difficulty than others in complying and this could cause resentment.    The process of implementingvoluntary cuts would be likely to attract continued publicity,which was the reverse of the Governments intentions.For these reasons it was argued that the staging of the increases had better be imposed compulsorily.    The CivilService would probably accept this provided that futurereviews were annual and that provision was made for thepreservation of pension rights.d. An appeal to the private sector for voluntary restraint,though worth making, could have at best only temporaryeffects.    It should be accompanied by an urgent referenceto the Royal Commission on Income Distribution and Wealth,who should be asked to report by March 1975.    At the sametime the Government should consider what measures couldbe taken outside the system of personal taxation.    one possibility might be to disallow, for the purpose ofcorporation tax, all expenditure on incomes above  10, 000a year; anything above that level would then become adonation to be financed out of taxed profits.    Another1possibility might be for the Government to use the influencethat it derived from its position of shareholder or paymasterto so many private industries and public authorities.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that this was not the time for a cut in ministerial salaries but that, after including them in the reference to the TSRB,Cabinet Ministers should accept a freeze in their salaries for theyear 1975.    On balance they agreed that, subject to certain changes the present TSRB report fas the public sector should be accepted.The recommendations could not however be fully implementedimmediately.    The deferments should be compulsory rather thanvoluntary, and there should be full preservation of pension rights.Some of the details of staging needed further consideration however.Up to the new salary level of  15, 000 the Cabinet agreed to give him discretion whether to implement&apos; the TSRB recommendations in full or to impose some deferment at the upper levels, bearing that mind the need to preserve differentials.    For salaries on present rates of less than  15, 000 and TSRB recommended ratesof more than  15, 000 the recommendations would be implemented in full, but half the difference between  15, 000 and the new rates would be deferred for a year.    For salaries on present and recommended rates of more than  15, 000 the TSRB recommenda-tions would be implemented in two equal stages over a year.    Therecommendations for nationalised industry chairmen were not accepted;  the chairmen should each receive a maximum increase of 5, 900 from the due date.    The TSRB would be asked in future tocarry out their reviews annually but the first annual review shouldnot be until after the end of the staging.    At the same time theGovernment should appeal to the private sector to observe similarrestraint in increasing high salaries; they should ask for an urgent and comprehensive report from the Royal Commission on income distribution and Wealth on the levels of salaries at the top;  andthe Government should state publicly that they were meanwhileconsidering ways of dealing with increases in high salaries in theprivate sector.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing up oftheir discussion by the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office13 December 1974.   4
