The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the Defence Review.Their discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded separately.2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary (C(74) 119) about the Simonstown Agreement.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the simonstown Agreement was politically damaging and if, in the lightof the Defence Review, the future value of the agreement for our defence was only marginal it should be brought to an end or allowedto wither.    There was no provision in the Agreement for unilateralabrogation and if we were to take that course we should appear to bein breach of international law and would increase the antagonism ofthe South Africans.    It would in any case be desirable beforeannouncing a decision to withdraw from the Agreement to inform the americans of our intention.    He would also wish to consult the ambassador in Cape Town about the best way of reducing the riskof South African retaliation.    Thereafter he believed the best coursewould be to announce that we were about to enter into consultations with the South African Government with a view to terminating theAgreement.    If, having tried in good faith, we were unsuccessful inthese negotiations we should have to announce that we felt bound to regard the Agreement as at an end.In discussion it was argued that, although the defence facilities available to us under the Simonstown Agreement were useful in peacetime and could be of importance in war, their value was notsuch as to justify continuance of the Agreement in view of the political objections.    Termination of the Agreement would not preclude ships of the Royal Navy using South African ports in case of need.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that the defence advantages of the simonstown agreement were outweighed by the political disadvantages; theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary should therefore proceed ashe proposed.    An announcement of our intention to enter into negotiations with the South African Government with a view toterminating the Agreement should be made in the context of thestatement which it was proposed to make on the Defence Reviewtowards the end of November.    The Foreign and commonwealth secretary would consider further, in consultation with the Attorney
General, the possible legal implications of unilateral abrogation ifit proved impossible to reach agreement with the South african government.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.
10jfEaNATIONALgOPERTYmLOPMENTmSTRIAL)M1TEDleviousIference:1(74) 29thInclusions,Haute 33. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C(74) 115) and the Secretary of State for Industry (C(74) 118)about the Secretary of State&apos;s proposal to make a grant of 3.9 million to enable the convenors of International PropertyDevelopment (Industrial) Limited (IPD) to acquire the business fromthe Receiver and run it as a workers&apos; co-operative,THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that IPD had been introuble for a long time.   The Industrial Development Unit of theDepartment of Industry, after examining the workers&apos; proposals,considered that the capital cost of continuing the business had beenunderstated, that sales forecasts were too optimistic, and theydoubted whether the factory could be competitive with the manninglevels proposed and whether the enterprise would attract management of the calibre required.    The Industrial Development advisory board (IDAB) were of the same opinion.    It seemed clear that thebusiness could not be run on a profitable basis; the fact that theworkers&apos; proposals offered an opportunity to establish a workers&apos;co-operative was if anything an argument against this particular proposal, because it would be a disaster to the cause of workers&apos;co-operatives in general to give help to a project that could not succeed.    The Government were already giving support to theMeriden co-operative.    The minimum cost of the proposed IPDco-operative had been estimated by officials at  4, 8 million, andmore capital would almost certainly be needed.    The estimate thatthe assistance proposed represented a cost per job of some  4,300was made on the basis of overmanning; other estimates, taking account of the reduced work force and the possibility of further government expenditure, ranged to over  11,000 per job.    TheGovernment were moving to the stage where a great deal of help for industry would have to be provided; but this must be done in ways which would be good for the economy as well as for industry.    Theprospects for success of the National Enterprise Board (not), of planning agreements, and of the rest of the Governments policy for industry, must not be prejudiced by supporting ventures which couldnot succeed.    He therefore invited the Cabinet to agree that the project should no longer be supported.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that the affairs ofIPD had been considered many times by the Ministerial Committee on industrial Development.    The balance of opinion on that Committeehad been in favour of supporting the workers&apos; proposal;   it wastherefore irrelevant that official advice pointed to a differentconclusion.    The IDAB had been appointed by the previous government and Ministers were not obliged to be governed by itsadvice.    After the company&apos;s troubled history which was well-knownto members of the Cabinet, the workers had now put forward proposals which the appropriate Committee of Ministers had accepted.
Unemployment on Merseyside was 9. 5 per cent, and at Kirby  rt was10.5 per cent: there were no alternative possibilities of work for theworkers at IPD if the co-operative did not go ahead.    He had hadmany meetings with them, and they had now undertaken responsibilityfor the success of their proposals.    They had made it clear that theywould themselves be prepared to reduce the labour force if that wasnecessary for success: it was unrealistic to insist they should investmoney as well as enthusiasm in IPD, if that meant that each workerwas expected to put in a sum far beyond his means.    The recentstatement by the General Council of the Trades Union Congress onhandling redundancies was relevant, as were the representations that had been made by the Merseyside and Liverpool Councils.    From thepoint of view of industrial democracy, it was highly significant thatthe work-people at IPD had moved from an outlook of bitterness andresentment to one of enthusiasm.    The Government spent millions of pounds on commissioning reports by academics on various aspects ofindustrial affairs;  surely it would be more useful to provide supportdirectly to a project of the sox*t now proposed; the money involvedwas insignificant by comparison with the amount which the confederation of British Industry v/ere proposing should be released in the form of Government help to the company sector.    It was wrong to include in the estimates the possible cost of buying the factory;the capital cost of advance factories, for example, had never been included in such assessments in the past.    With the co-operative atMeriden, and now with a co-operative at IPD, he was convinced thatthe Government would find the start of a new spirit of enthusiasm inthe work force, which could eventually transform the outlook for industry.In discussion it was argued that Ministers were being faced by moreand more proposals for help to individual firms and co-operativeswhich were not backed up by the information needed for a soundjudgment.    While all would sympathise with the aims of the Secretaryof State for Industry&apos;s proposal and with his dilemma when faced withthe possibility of people being thrown out of work in an area of high .-.unemployment, it must surely be taken into account that expertopinion was not in favour of the IPD proposal, and that properestimates of the cost had not been provided.    For example, theGovernment had already been supporting IPD at a cost of  150,000a week, but this did not appear from the papers.    No assessment hadbeen given to Ministers about the likelihood that the loss Which haddogged the business up to now could be turned into a profit.    Therewas a serious risk that if the Government supported a project whichwas sure to fail, and which would almost certainly have lost all themoney advanced to it within a year, they would have discreditedimportant aspects of their industrial policy, and prejudiced theoperations of the not.    The Government were already investing inone co-operative experiment, at Meriden, and that should be enoughto start with.       - ,4
On the other hand, it was so.rgu.ed in support of the Secretary of Statefor Industry&apos;s proposal that Ministers on the Committee on IndustrialDevelopment had been impressed by the arguments of the workers&apos;enthusiasm, the degree of unemployment in the area, and thepossibility that success at IPD would have a widespread andbeneficial psychological effect throughout industry.    The problemsof inflation and of incomes policy could not be solved without a newspirit in industry, and the way to this might well lie through devolution of responsibility to the work force.    Experiments were thereforeworth while, and should not be assessed on the strict basis of theusual criteria;  a single co-operative experiment was not enough.In spite of the discouraging assessment made by the IDAB, there wassurely a sporting chance of the projects success if the presentovermanning were reduced or work shared, the unprofitable part ofthe business cut out, and suitable management acquired.    As regardsthe argument that the failure of IPD might discredit the whole of theGovernments industrial policy, it would be right to provide theassistance sought by the Secretary of State for Industry in the form ofa once-for-all grant, making It clear that the Government had decidedto invest this money in an experiment and that after this grant, nofurther funds would be forthcoming from the Government; theco-operative would be independent and must work out its own salvation.In further discussion, it was pointed out that whatever the arguments in favour of supporting co-operatives in general, it was important that Ministers should be provided with the means of telling whichprojects were likely to succeed and which were not.    The advisorybodies which were available to help the Secretary of State for industry might need to be improved.    In the case of IPD, it was essential to confirm that there would be no call on guarantees by the export credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) such as had belatedly beenfound necessary at Meriden.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY, summing upthe discussion, said that the Cabinet agreed on balance that theSecretary of State for Industry should grant up to  3.9 million, lessany money provided by the workers, to enable the workers&apos;co-operative to acquire the business at IPD, on the clear under-standing that this Government aid would be strictly once-and-for-alLThe Secretary of State for Industry should ensure that the enterprisestarted on a basis which gave reasonable prospects of success; heshould confirm that no guarantees from the ECGD would be called for; he should monitor the progress of the co-operative, and reportregularly to the Ministerial Committee on Industrial Development.

CONFIDENTIAL annex cc(74) 42nd Conclusions, Minute 1Thursday 31 October, 1974 at 4. 30 pmDEFENCEREVIEWPreviousReference:CC(74) 41stConclusions,Minute 3The Cabinet resumed their discussion on the defence review.THE PPJME MINISTER said that concern had been expressed about the need for further discussion on certain aspects of thedefence review.    He agreed.    The immediate question was whetherthe Cabinet could reach a provisional conclusion on his memorandumso that it could be used as the basis for confidential bilateral discussions with the Americans and the Germans-    these discussions should take place soon, in preparation for our consulta-tions in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO).    Earlydiscussions should also be held with our partners in the Five PowerDefence Agreement.    After the talks with the Americans and germans, and just before consultations began in NATO there wouldbe a fairly full statement in Parliament.    The draft of this state-ment would be considered fully by the Cabinet.    In the meantime the Cabinet could pursue its discussion of certain particular aspectsof the review.He wished however to draw the attention of the Cabinet specifically to one matter which was mentioned in his memorandum.    Under anagreement with us the Americans enjoyed certain facilities on the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, where we--- also maintaineda small communications group.    The Americans wished to make a relatively modest extension of their facilities.    This would be entirely at their own expense and we would be allowed to use thefacilities.    American use of the facilities in other than normal circumstances would be subject to joint decision.    The Soviet union had been establishing themselves in the area and the Americanswished to be in a position to respond to any further increase in soviet strength.    If, as suggested in the memorandum, we were towithdraw from Mauritius and Gan and if, as a result of discussion ofthe next item on the agenda, we were to end the simonstown agreement, the Americans would be still more concerned that their request about Diego Garcia should be granted.    The facilities wouldalso in those circumstances have somewhat greater value to us.is DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY 1 government copy NO g cabinet
In discussion it was suggested that there should be an examination ofthe general problem of the impact of the reductions on the shipbuilding and aerospace industries and of the possibility of switching resources from these industries into other production.    There should also be a study of the impact of the resource demands of defence on the economy.It was also argued that before a final decision was taken on the futureof Diego Garcia the views of the Indian Government and the governmentsof other countries in the area should be taken into account.    On theother hand it was argued that the   views of the Indian Government were well known, though they had been expressed with less vigour since india had carried out a nuclear explosion.    In the end we would have todecide on the basis of our own interests between incurring a measureof criticism from India and some other countries and denying a request for which there was strategic justification and to which the Americansattached importance.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that confidential bilateral exchanges should take place as soon as possible with the Americans and the Germans on the basisof his memorandum, on the clear understanding that these wereprovisional conclusions and that the Government had yet to make its final decision.    On 21 November there would be a   statement ingeneral terms in Parliament, and at the same time we would ask for discussions in NATO to begin in the course of the following week.A more definitive statement would be made to Parliament just beforethe NATO consultations opened, and the draft of this statement would beconsidered by the Cabinet, in the light of the bilateral exchanges withthe Americans and Germans.    The Central Policy Review Staff, inconsultation with the Departments concerned, should take the lead in preparing urgent studies on the impact on the economy broadly of theresource demands of defence and on the impHcations of the proposed reductions for the shipbuilding and aerospace industries.    these studies, and policy on the strategic nuclear deterrent would be dis-cussed by the Cabinet in the course of the next few weeks.    discussions with both sides of industry should not begin until the proposed statement on the defence review was made to Parliament.    The Lord Privy Sealwould arrange for consultations between the Civil Service department and the Ministry of Defence about the expected reductions in the numberof civil servants employed by the Ministry of Defence.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office4 November 1974 2
