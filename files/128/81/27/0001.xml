The visit would be very important, both politically and , Mr Gandhi had been very attentively received in France anh tftsssiyfited States, and the fullest and most effective programme Possibl^A^s being arranged for his visit to the United Kingdom. The n lan Government still harboured suspicions of the United Kingdom with regard toThe activities of the Sikh community here. There were ^Pportunities for major British contracts in India. It was highly

sirable that ths^visit should be a success. Great care would also be taken with the ^^cfli^ity aspects of the visit.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he had visited Nigeria 10 and 11 September. Nigeria remained important to the United lngdom. British exports were running at about   100 million per month, &lt;^d over 10,000 British cit izens were resident in Nigeria. The Foreign vW Commonwealth Secretary had had an opportunity to meet some of the 5^S-lsh business community in Nigeria and to hear their concerns. He J^ybeen warmly received by Air Commodore Larry Koinyan, a member of the X^^Forces Ruling Council, and had found him impressive. He had also d^2^eting with the new President, General Ibrahim Babangida, who was RP^-British than his predecessor.

It had been useful to be able to make plain the importance^ which the United Kingdom attached to relations with Nigeria, including commercial relations. Anglo-Nigerian relations would no doubt remain difficultaxul the Nigerian Government had made plain that real improvement woiy  d&apos;   &lt;Mpend on the treatment of Mr Umaru Dikko and Major o ammed Yusufu\Ws VaJ1 as the extent of British economic support for geria. a move tra^aMs more normal relations through the appointment 0 High Commission^^yjP^ght follow before long.

THE FOREIGN and COMMONWEALTH	said that the si tuation

j1  ac  rnin8 South Africa had becoire^x^cemely tense and difficult. There Mr p 660 wadesPread disappointment Jae speech of the State President, c ^ Botha, on 15 August. The Presp/l^it&apos;s speech on 11 September had cit/3^neC* Sli  hlty m  re encouraging	including a passage about the

j1ad/SnS&apos;1   &apos;P rights of black people in^&amp;ytlj^Africa. The United Kingdom co 6?n a^^e to prevent any move to savu^ions by the European Community lla^ntr^es ii July. On 9 September, the President of the United States r, . a^tered his position on sanctions, in order to pre-empt moves in the states Congress.

British i    	.	.	.

V Policy during this period had been to m/ldlaff pressure for

mic sanctions, and to avoid isolation by a^t^Lp^together with the a members of the European Community and with ^Ke~  Vited States. At 10 gStlnB   T Foreign Ministers of the European CoimiinJ^t^ countries on sjlo   Ptember, the British aim had been that the ques^^m/pf new steps Prg11.^ *3e Held for further study; but following the s(^^m^nt by the whicl/erit t*16 ^n*ted States even the Federal RepublCe^^fcermany, fu Previously had opposed sanctions, had on this occasi^vbroposed the i/r act*-on* The British task had thus been to limit T^^amtion by qj.^ Ur  pean Community countries to positive measures and b^pp&lt;  Kst p0r . raeasures beyond those already in place. The Minister qrtp&amp;pbte, the T 3nd Commonwealth Office (Mr Rifkind), who had been repkepi^ting uted Kingdom at the meeting, had largely succeeded in thiv^^K&amp;st


     f the coercive measures mentioned in the statement by the European Community countries following the meeting of Foreign Ministers had been s* ones which the United Kingdom already applied. On one of them, the ^cessation of oil exports to the Republic of South Africa, the position that the Government&apos;s guidelines to oil company licensees exporting from the United Kingdom Continental Shelf had the effect that no oil from there was sent to South Africa. The wording of one of \jfrp^oercive measures - discouraging cultural and scientific agreements ^^y^eezing official contacts and agreements in the sporting and se6*&apos;ip\spheres - had been amended at British insistence so as to apply n^^cttltural and scientific agreements. Another of the measures ProPose^t the meeting was the recall of military attaches accredited *-n Soirl  ^^  ^i.ca and refusal to grant accreditation to military attaches from SouOb^  &gt;ica. The United States, ,France, Portugal and the United Kingdom p^reently exchanged military attaches with South Africa.

The United Kingdom had reserved its position on the restrictive measures listed in the statement issued by the Foreign Ministers at the end of the meeting. One^qrr^e tion in this field was whether the formulation on oil supplies to S ou tW Afric.n could give the European Commission scope under Article llsSn^fTra Treaty of Rome to seek an actual embargo on all   il sales. There sK^wS/ii reasonable chance that this would not happen. The subject of policy^jjCTjawls South Africa would be discussed at a meeting to be chaired b^&gt;^\Prime Minister on the following day.

In a brief discussion, it wL^oted that the Department of Energy should be represented at the Prim  %mVfcter&apos; s meeting on 13 September, for the discussion of the question dsN^X^exports to South Africa.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that an important^rffuiouncement concerning security would be made later that day. AnV&gt;fficial of the Soviet Embassy in London had been granted asylum. From 1982, this official had been Deputy Head of the Residency in the Soviet Embassy of the Soviet Committee for State Security (KGB), and had recen^?7^&gt;ecome Head of that Residency. This official had provided a great d^bl ^Linformation about Soviet intelligence activities in the United King&lt;J5i(^Sim elsewhere.

Much of this would be very useful.

The Chargd d&apos;Affaires at the Soviet Embassy had been suMj^gd to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to be told that the GovS^^x^Kfc were greatly concerned at the extent of Soviet intelligence actijwttJ^s in the United Kingdom and that 25 named Soviet persons, who had	ively

engaged in intelligence activities in this country, were toNj^^tfJelled and must leave the United Kingdom within three weeks. The Sov^tM^arg6 d&apos;Affaires would further be told that, if the Soviet Union retd^dA^ by exPulsion of officials from the British Embassy in Moscow,


   the United Kingdom would have to consider taking further appropriate steps. The Soviet Chargd d&apos;Affaires would be told that the overall ceiling of 234 persons, which limited the number of Soviet citizens ^working in Soviet offices in London, would be reduced to 211 persons, ^his was a reduction of 23, rather than 25, because two of the Soviet, ^^jsons being expelled were working in international organisations in ^?iWon and were therefore not included in the overall ceiling. Within N^vt^Averall ceiling, the number of diplomatic staff allowed in the ^WUEmbassy would be increased from 43 to 46, the number considered t0^Srinimum for the diplomatic work of the Soviet Embassy. The nuiri^e^^)^ British officials with diplomatic status in Moscow was just helo^^^^ number.

This actt$iyK-d had to be taken at a time when East/West relations were delicate VnfKwhen there had been some p&apos;rospect of an improvement in Anglo/SovSa relations, which could now be put at risk; there was no option, however, but to expel the Soviet officials engaged in intelligence activities. The first duty of the British Government was the protection of/^JJK security of this country.

The following	made in discussion -

a- The Soviet^e^^ials who were being expelled would not present a significant inreWrJ&amp;oce threat before leaving the country within the maximum period\^^^W^ee weeks, since their role as intelligence officers had become ntnbVja^

b.	The Government wod^Vjrek^ clear to the Soviet authorities that, while the Governmeh^^ld always take the action necessary^ to protect the security o^js?w^/Snited Kingdom, the United Kingdom s aim was the long-term devei^jjjre/^ of fruitful relations and co-operation without the obst/p^Aeaused by unacceptable Soviet activities.

c.	Soviet action in retaliatior^g^jj^khe expulsion of officials^ from London could not be predicteaTy^TMce had avoided retaliation after recent expulsions from Par is, Nirf^&apos;this might not be an indication of Soviet reactions where \}je United Kingdom was concerned.

d.	There was no need for British Minister^^^^i officials to cancel engagements involving representative/^: (jhe Soviet Union, although the Soviet side might well cancel sxCh^aS&amp;agements. Some forthcoming British/Soviet events, such as a mtetJM   ot the Joint Commission, might be postponed by the Soviet sitte^w/

The prime MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thai^^Xk events rePresented a major success for the British services conderM^bwho were to be warmly congratulated.

.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOMEuE PARTME N T reported that police quir-xgg into j-^g disturbances in the Handsworth area of Birmingham artier that week were proceeding satisfactorilv^and many of the hadUreS prominently involved in the incidents utereYbeing identified. He great confidence in the Chief Constable of\j&amp;a^  feat Midlands who, handled the situation well. The police were m$w~^flully in control of pol&apos;31^63 anc* there was no truth in the stories in\bh^d^ess that the ^c   had pulled out of the area or had done any dm  A) leave pol^clng to ethnic minority patrol groups. Mutual as^v  rahce from other forces had worked well. Local politicians were&lt;  a^r^fi the view tjie tHe disturbances were primarily a demonstration of cjHM*r(ality, and ^ re was very little sympathy in the area for the deeper^frcnal Althn  SeS a^rec* at t&apos;ie conference of the Social Democratic\P^j&gt;J\

. 0ugh he did not bel ieve that it would be useful to commi^-rton^a to   n tFle ^nes   f the Scarman inquiry, a number of questronj^Ajaeded e answered about the precise way in which the disturbance vCrtalj/y


   started, the speed of the police response, and the factors that conditioned that response time, and there might be lessons to be learnt, v He therefore intended to ask the Chief Constable to prepare a report for yPublication, and would invite the Chief Inspector of Constabulary to \Vvvan  e ^or t^ie Inspectorate to be associated with that. He thought

_ the report should be published before the House of Commons resumed on 21 October. It would also be important for the Government to t*le c^a^ins being made by the Opposition that the Scarman report &apos;^il^Abeen adequately followed up: in fact, the record on implementing Sc^prfaj^as good.

, the following main points were made:

a* \TThe strong arguments against repeating an inquiry on Scarman linevwere reinforced by the fact that two people had died in the disturbances:	judicial inquiries running parallel to police

investigations of homicide were to be avoided.

b-	Theref(wa9(/some anxiety that the disturbances were too big and

too rapid ro^Kav  \been entirely unpremeditated, and that police intelligence (may/not have been fully adequate:	the Chief

Constable&apos;s intrp^My should cover these matters.

c* Whilst it w4e  x$Viwi welcome if the police had developed a useful dialogue wirhVjJ^ck and Asian leaders since the disturbances, storie^/Srfwut deals on policing being struck between the police and the ebhm^)minorities were damaging. These stories should be rebutted withejK^xfelay.

b- The record in impleme^TM&apos;jlc the recommendations of the Scarman report was good, and some	ion of public money had been

spent in Handsworth. TheseWch/ra^ments should not go by default, aud the Government should pre^entx^hem consistently and Persuasively.

e- Compensation for riot damage ^m^made under an Act of 1886, the operation of which could be curiJbfersome. It was important that those who suffered in the disturbances (and Asian shopowners were the most visible victims) should be reassured that they would get help quickly, where help was needed.

What had happened at Handsworth illul^raigd the problems of Healing with concentrations of alienated yom&lt;1p&quot;B|Wk people who had   Pted out of society at large, who had no la  nfii&lt;KA&gt;&amp;cupation and who tended to be involved with drugs. But it shouT^/jfyot. be argued or implicitly accepted that unemployment inevitably lawlessness.

agre^^^ MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that &lt;bj  ^^ibinet ge^6ec* that there should be no judicial inquiry and that andretary s&apos;10U&apos;*-&lt;^ that night announce the inquiry by the Chief^tft^stable re t*le ^ief Inspector of Constabulary that he had indicateaX&apos;vpi^ rt should be authoritative and comprehensive, and should o^yl


   published as soon as was consistent with that; and if possible before \ arliament reassembled. It was very important that the Government&apos;s ^presentation of the background, especially in relation to the ^*jnplementation of the Scarman report and urban aid with particular ^s^^erence to Handsworth, should be full, consistent and energetic. The

t Secretary should take the lead in ensuring that all Cabinet

fers received full and up-to-date briefing. More generally, there ^estions about the systematic presentation of Government policy to would wish to return.

&apos;   20-^fi^ibinet -

To&amp;p^ote, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s sumAkg up, and invited the Home Secretary and other Ministers concerned to proceed accordingly.
