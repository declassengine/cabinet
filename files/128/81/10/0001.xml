   EXPEN^S&amp;v

1    THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the outcome of total public expenditure had overrun the estimate by   1,000 million in 1983-84 and by   3,500 million (including   2,500 million on account of the ^effects of the strike in the coal mining industry) in 1984-85. These    werruns were accounted for by excess spending in local authorities&apos; and tonalised industries&apos; programmes and in demand-led programmes: ^Wh-limited programmes had been held under control. It would be highly T$j&gt;*Wble not to repeat this outcome for a third year running. Bearing ience in mind, and having regard to the pressures on public sp^P&apos;tTipV he proposed to increase the provisions for reserves for each   f t^^tjjree forthcoming financial years by   2,000 million, from   3,000 to ^ArW0/million in 1985-86, from   4,000 to   6,000 million in 1986-87 and frc^p/g^&gt;000 to   7,000 million in 1987-88. The planning totals would uorrespdmrffingly be increased for each year by   2,000 million. This still meaot that there should be no increase in public expenditure in real terms between 1985-86 and 1987-88. He made this proposal with some reluctance, because it would imply that the Government was in some degree admitti n^f^vilure to meet its targets for the control of public expenditure, biP hi/had concluded that it would be preferable that, in Presenting his	he should be able to do so on the basis of

figures in whose xfeayysm he could have reasonable confidence. Markets would not have beefr^^ressed by a Budget based on public expenditure figures which appeared/^j^be founded on unrealistic assumptions.

iu a brief discussion che^fejjlowing points were made:

a.	The proposed in&amp;sfea^rds in reserves and planning totals would not, and must not be ns*  HfwlAd as tending to absolve the Government from the most strenuousM^^opts to control public expenditure and in particular to keep the^^al flat in real terms over the forthcoming three years.

b.	The public expenditure iw(fn^)for 1986-87 could be expected to be very difficult. It would b^^Jjjj^icularly important to find ways of limiting the growth in demanJf^Cittr programmes, and thus to minimise the extent to which incr^fig*  fr in demand-led programmes had to be offset by reductions in cashv&lt;Limited programmes.

c* In view of recent overspending by local authorities and the Government&apos;s measures to limit capital spending out of accumulated balances, it would be very important, in j^ffB^nting the increases in reserves and planning totals now propoU^d Sxd emphasise Particularly to local authorities that theyidr^ses were not a licence for them to overspend again.

i&apos;bE Prime MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said Lhe^/Mespite the unwelcome implications of what was proposed, the Cabif^fcXe^lorsed the judgment of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that it was ppsrarable that ls Budget should be presented as based on realistic asswjjp^fyns about Public expenditure. But the reserves did not have to be xky^/Aaken up, an&lt;i it would be of the first importance that the proposed	in

Provisions for reserves should not lead to any relaxation irr\Ah  //  &apos;pntrol 0 Public expenditure.


   The Cabinet -

Agreed that the provisions for reserves and the public expenditure planning totals should be increased by   2,000 million for each of the three forthcoming financial years 1985-86, 1986-87 and 1987-88.

The CaMnet -

Took note, wi&gt;h^approval, of the Chancellor of the Exchequ^^/s^udget proposals.
