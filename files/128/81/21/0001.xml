pers-THE VREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that there were ^ea^lstent rumours of a coup in Nigeria. It was not clear who might Chief  ne* Gne Possihility was Major General Ibrahim Babangida, the prefe   E tlle Ariy  &apos;&quot;Sk  aff, who from the British point of view might be jUnier^a&apos;3^e,to tVfe^&apos;pMpsent leaders. Another possibility was a coup by gak or officer	armed services. A coup by Major General

viof1^1^3 wou^^ prntfamlW be bloodless; in a coup by junior officers to ence would be nJ&amp;rj^tSkely. The British Government should be ready chanScontac,:wi|wy with any new regime, to increase the as ?Ces of good relati/tt^foth it.

int0FGabIGN AN   C0MM0NWEALTH SECRETARY slj^d that the South African raid Serious   rone&gt; the capital of Botswana, on 14 June represented a new and 21 Ma^ devei  Pment. Following the arrest at Cabinda in Angola on oil in   	3   rouP South Africans apparently m-fe-axiding sabotage of the

leastnofallati  nS there    it: seemed to confirm *//  hiMge in the posture at whole    tde ^outh African army and perhaps of &apos;^he^CTvernment as a the NR0 *&quot; contrasted with South Africa&apos;s recent /fteMts, symbolised by countr  mat^ accord with Mozambique in 1984, to woneighbouring condemned ^   r^er to control terrorism. The United  &amp;m#$Jom had firmly further6 k^16 ra^d into Gaborone. The United States l((^^^owever, gone more r *	^ recalling its Ambassador for consultationsS^^f^there were

United  K^ African raids of this kind, it might be difficud^^or the Securit lnEdom not to react with moves of this type. Meai^iM, the a debate   uncil   f the United Nations had a few hours e a rKt  &gt;^tan eluded   n the n t&apos;ie ^amihian question, which was to be followed b  \HeN^ates had been3 ln&lt;?a incident and the Gaborone raid. The debate ab^t/N^mibia Affica 3n lndication   f how pressure for sanctions against Scirfyi^/X

was mounting. The United States had abstained on the res4&gt;&lt;ftjpoo,


   X^e France and Australia had voted in favour. The United Kingdom had ^yeen faced with a choice between abstention or casting a veto in

ation. in explaining our decision to abstain, we had said that we not feel bound by the terms of the resolution, which had stopped   f a mandatory call for economic sanctions but had represented a yyT/in that direction. Pressure for sanctions might continue to build He^d^$V.S should be watched carefully, especially as the Commonwealth Government Meeting approached.

In

St 3 &gt;^^JXdiscussionj the rapid increase of support in the United d ^S^y^Mnctions against South Africa was noted as an important much   Pl**c*y*&apos; The United States, however, would suffer proportionately c lesd\\than the United Kingdom from any interruption of trade.

Tran ft of

hi. 0REIGN ANDV^MJiLiJWEALTH SECRETARY said that the passengers of the bee^rT^ Trans Wor//f~Mihrlines (TWA) aircraft, now at Beirut Airport, had lead 1Spersed in ^&amp;o^s\around the city. Mr Nabih Berri, the Shi&apos;ite hi^ WaS seeRing	control over the Shi&apos;ites and the

ars&gt; but it was My^rom clear that he would succeed in so doing. Leb nited Kingdom was&apos;^M^ to explain to him, to President Gemayel of the3n  n an&lt;? t0 t^le Syrian^^Fnment the need for sensible handling of Un^ .9ltuati  n. The prosp6&lt;!^  ?ste that the hijack would drag on. It was to 6 ^ bbat the United ScALa^/would undertake any military operation 0   6bCue the Americans now	Beirut, given the great difficulty

aga  UC^ an nndertaking. If a\$er^S.atory action were later mounted fac-nSt the Shi&apos;ites by the UnV^wA^tes, this would increase the risks Embas^	British Embassy in Bei^^vespecially if the United States

robugSy withdrew. The British Am^a^a^r, Sir David Miers, was taking a sta     and c  urageous view. But itrwcjtf^ be necessary for him and his Sec re ^ 136 ready to move at short n^^pe^X The Foreign and Commonwealth Coris?*iary continued that security at At&apos;fi2ns^^irpor t had long been autli arad inadequate. Complaints had	addressed to the Greek

introdltleS by resPonsible organisationsSome of the main airlines had the ,uced their own security measures, in addition to such measures as Secretr*3  rt autb  rities had provided. The Foreign and Commonwealth Afpa- ary bad raised the problem of Athens Airpopt^at the Foreign respons ^  uncd^   F the European Community on lfi/xfun^. The Greek the Un&apos;6 t0 &apos;   k&apos;      3    and even more to a statement	ident Reagan of

keep altec^ States, had been unco-operative. It w&lt;/uTd)j&gt;e necessary to and aUd    pressure on the Greek Government in twJHj*pr%&gt;ean Community Mil * lscussion among Heads of Government at the Eu^d^e^ra Council in c  nside   June would be desirable. The matter sl^^Moalso be Bonn .ered the framework of the declaration on hija^xlsogyissued from    Dy the seven states participating m the Ecorj^mxs. Summits.

Gover&lt;^SCUSS^  n&gt; t&apos;rie contrast was noted between the calls V^flje&apos;\Israeli Unitedmsnt&apos; 3n&lt;* notably the Defence Minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabjid^^^ the to rel tates Government to make up its mind on whether it wa^  P^srael vacineaae ^bi&apos;ite prisoners, and on the other hand Israel&apos;s   L/C*

ion in first releasing over 1 000 Palestinian prisoners	5\

&lt;y\


   return for 3 Israelis and then taking large numbers of Shi&apos;ite prisoners ln violation of the Geneva Convention. It would be interesting to see ^whether Israel&apos;s behaviour would stimulate greater sympathy in the Visited States for the efforts of King Hussein of Jordan to make progress t*le Arab-Israel problem.

the security weaknesses at Athens Airport, boycotts of that by major airlines could exert pressure for improvement. British were still operating services to and from Athens, while ftra security precautions of their own. It would be desirable 0r	to discuss with BA the continuation and security of their

t ens smrices. Given the possibility that the weapons used in the TWA rjack	smuggled on to the aircraft with food or other supplies,

Was a 1 sVAte^i r ab 1 e to consider whether such supplies were subjected aecuritj^vfiecks at airports generally. It was noted that Cabinet nisters frying to or from Athens on commercial flights might be argets for hijacking attempts and might thus endanger other passengers n the same flights. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who was Ue to fly to Athe&lt;  s   ^he following day, would therefore not travel on a

commercial flight^*)
